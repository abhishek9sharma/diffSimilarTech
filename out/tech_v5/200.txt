2000281
security	owasp
and to be on topic security issues in php on owasp

2000286
put	get
hashmap uses hashcode to store things .so you have constants time for put and get operations but items are always unordered

2000286
binary-tree	tree
treemap instead uses a binary-tree .so you have log n time for basic operations but items are kept order in the tree

2000286
doubly-linked-list	hashmap
a middle approach is the linkedhashmap that uses same structure as hashmap hashcode and equals methods but it also keeps a doubly-linked-list of elements insert in the map mantaining the order of insert

python	java
it s hard to be sure without knowing more detail - like which os you re on - but my guess is that you re using a 32-bit versioning of python which means that .when you launchd java you re also getting the 32-bit versioning which has a heap size limit of 4gb

2000424
python	java
to test if this is the case compare the output of java -version .when run from the command-line and .when run from your python scripting

unicode	wstring	tchar	atl	wstring	ansi
while i agree with the spirit of the above posters that a standards solution is better than the alternatives cstring is if your project uses mfc or atl anyway much nicer to work with than std string wstring conversions between ansi unicode through cstringa and cstringw bstr loading from string table cast operators to tchar .c_str

2000886

2001275
access-vba	vb6
a simple c# dll - how do i call it from excel access-vba vb6

2001275
worksheet	excel
for a standards automation add-in you should read writing user-defined-functions for excel in .net and writing custom excel worksheet functions in c#

2001318
malloc	free
that is a potential memory leak anyway for every new there is a delete likewise same for malloc and free

2001319

2001403
aptana	pydev
i am currently using aptana basically eclipse with aptana s pydev plugins and find it useful

2001412
value	field
the mx binding source should be the field named itself not the value

2001412

need to be able to use dates beyond the 32-bit timestamp limit .so upgrade our server to windows-server 2003 64bit versioning

2001425
any	set
the acknowledged field let us set up a view named unacknowledged critical issues .so that we can quickly see any new issues and acknowledge them as we read them

2001427
mapping	unique
if you are worried about the identity-column not mapping correctly .when you ports the database you could create another non-identity unique column with your id value int or guid or whatever else would be helpful

2001435
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
you don t know whether to unix php perl or python

2001435
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
i would feel it necessary to write a spreadsheet extractor that would turn the backlog from an openoffice.org org file into restructuredtext restructuredtext

2001440
google-chrome	firefox
it works find in ie7 8 firefox google-chrome .so on

2001456
abstract	extends
i guess i could also extends uiview and then extends my class extendss uiview again but there is probably a reason objective-c does not directly support abstract classes.

2001472
any	set
if the data goes through various stages received acknowledged under review rejected accepted responded etc. then that approach quickly scale itself out of viability not to mention the irritating process of having to ensure that only one of the columns is set to 1 at any given time

2001483
fflush	stdout
if you re writing out every three seconds and sleep 3 is a good way to do that and it s not showing up every three seconds try putting in fflush stdout

2001506
internet-explorer	firefox
.so this looks perfect in firefox but doesn t work correctly in internet-explorer 7

2001510
shared-libraries	dynamic-linking
on unix-like systemd dynamic-linking can make life difficult for root to use an application with the shared-libraries install in out-of-the-way location

2001554
value	field
in that case you wouldn t need the arrays as you could just put the control s named into the value field and perform a lookup on it

2001561
value	field
value for each form are being serialization and sent as typed in the field which one can confirm through console.log

2001575
attributes	properties
controls have webcontrol.styles properties that returns a cssstylescollection which contains the html styles attributes to rendering on the outer tag of the server control

2001575
contains	any
any styles declare for a particular html server control is added to the collections .when the contains webforms page is parsing

2001575
attributes	properties
thus .when gridview is parsing asp.net doesnâ t for example checked the gridview.rowstyles properties and then rendering corresponding html styles attributes accordingly but instead it first transfer all of the gridviewâ s styless to cssstylescollection and only then checkeded which html styles attributes to rendering for that control

2001575
attributes	properties
b if my above assumption is correct which i doubt â why doesnâ t asp.net simply checked gridviewâ s styles properties like gridview.bordercolor etc and rendering appropriate html styles attributes accordingly

2001575
attributes	properties
controls have webcontrol.styles properties that returns a cssstylescollection which contains the html styles attributes to rendering on the outer tag of the server control

2001584
push	pull
pull parsing are in my opinion a good alternative between a tree-based model and a push parsing

2001587
anonymous-inner-class	nested-class
then again i d quite possibly not create an anonymous-inner-class with a member variables anyway - i d be tempted to turn that into a named nested-class instead

2001600
data-members	private
if this were my code i would say that if a class is complicated enough to need data-members it might be worth pulling it out into a separate class in which case i d certainly make the data-members private

2001617
value	field
is there a way i can get the arrays value and the arrays key arrays key are exactly the same as the table column field named in one go without having to add a new variables and table column pair

2001627
buffering	streaming
it depends on the underlying streaming that is being used the size of the buffering in that streaming and other factors

2001643
stderr	stdout
stdin stdout and stderr are already defined for your program .so you can use them directly instead of opening or declaring them on your own

2001671
subtract	add
for example to tell the jvm to automatically add or subtract some offset before returning from that methods

2001676
double	int
.so you re summing 3 large int then multiplying by a tiny double but still want the output to be an int

2001676
double	int
or you could cast the int to a bigint or double before the sum .so you don t overflow there

2001681
fwrite	fread
another one is using file structures which are used in c libs functions like fread fwrite etc including the one you mentioned above

2001685
32-bit	64bit
.so i think windows even though it is the 64bit versioning might be using 32-bit int with php

2001694
command-line	cmd
os have command-line cmd to do this

2001696
dependency-injection	singleton
ideally that should be done with dependency-injection but even if you used a replaceable singleton you would gain testability

2001720
fclose	fopen
you only work with pointers and you need a function like fopen to create an instances and a function like fclose to dispose of it

2001721
rollback	commit
if you don t commit not rollback an opened transactional and it s not commited anywhere later in your scripting it won t be commited as seen by the database engine and will automatically rollback at the end of your scripting

2001721
rollback	commit
still i well almost always commit or rollback explicit the transactional i open .so

2001730
put	get
i ve also tried to swap out put for upload but get the same result

2001730
sftp	scp
also dropping via scp and or trying to force sftp instead similarly fails

2001741
double	int
which will support the math and get you back the result as an int but this cast will just truncated the value and return 2 while as a double it would be 2.99 .so you would al.so want to have sql round the numbers appropriately

2001755
primitive	int
i m vaguely aware that java treats int int differently i come from a .net background but i was hoping someone could give me a full explanation on why i can t use primitive in a dictionary

2001757
malloc	free
these functions will call malloc and free respectively

2001760
android-listview	simpleadapter
i have an android-listview created with a simpleadapter that has more items in it than fit in the screens

2001767
stderr	stdout
the example below does make python output to stderr and stdout using utf-8

2001768
getter	setter
your use of getter and setter in this case don t make a lot of sense

2001768
constructor	private
unless you need to do validation or manipulation of more than one private member just go ahead and make those public and create a constructor to initializer colour apprpriately

2001768
getter	setter
if the answer to either of those is no i would say that you should not have any kind of getter or setter on that object at all

2001789
cairngorm	parsley	parsley	mate
the frameworks tend to just abstract all that away from you through metadata swiz cairngorm 3 parsley and eventmaps mate

2001795
type-erasure	autoboxing
however because the java generics systemd uses type-erasure there isn t enough information to autoboxing in this case

2001803
positioning	slider
.when it sees that the new slider positioning is greater than 3 you can reset the slider to 3

2001822
filtering	grouping
i m showing a view within a webpart and i updates this view to filtering the list items according to the logged on user s grouping

2001823
tapply	mapply
edit awb has correctly pointed out that while sapply tapply and mapply are implements in c apply is simply a wrapper function

2001825
primitive	int
int is a primitive

2001830
boost-preprocessor	boost-fusion
then you can write a macros using boost-preprocessor which takes the list of tags and generator the appropriate boost-fusion map

2001853
superclass	inherited
to explain a bit further you can only cast up the inherited tree which is to say an object can only be cast as the class types it was created as any of its superclass or any interface that it implements

2001876
json	xml
you d send the response back in xml the same would be true for json etc.

2001891
cgpoint	cgrect
i want to maintain a single cgrect rather than individual cgsize and cgpoint for compari.son against other cgrect with cgrectcontainsrect but i want acces.sor for the individual members .so i don t have to recreate a whole new cgrect every time i want to change one or the other

2001891
getter	setter
is there a way to do this without writing custom getter setter

2001908
buildpath	libs
go to your project properties - java buildpath - libs and make sure the necessary struts 2 jar files are all listed under web .app libs

2001917
.when	ready
on the other hand is execute only once .when the dom is initially ready loaded

2001929
debian	linux
using boost 1.38 on debian linux

2001940
subdirectories	archive
what i try to archive is that whenever i import formats the __init__.py looks for all available modules in the formats subdirectories loads them and makes them available right now simply through a variables supported_formats

2001942
implements	abstract
it looks a bit weird to see a methods that s both pure-virtual which generally means abstract and implements inline but it s the best and most concise way i ve found to ensure that an object is polymorphically destructed

2001944
arrays	loops
loops through your options arrays and if the value isn t empty add it to your headers arrays

2001959
32-bit	64bit
use the datetime class as it works in 32-bit and 64bit and is built into php5x

2001967
base-class	inherited
however i need to be able to create a new object in the process that is the same as the parent object that inherited the base-class

2001974
arrays	loops
then loops them through and building the final arrays

2001987
any	set
is there any benefit to set it up .so that the properties is set in the constructor like this

2002021
constructor	object
it makes it possible to send parameters to the constructor based on some logic or passed in arguments to the object you are working on

2002023
constructor	object
before the constructor for the object

2002023
value	field
assign the value of a field it will

2002023
value	field
overwrite any value given during field

2002052
where-clause	sql
i know how to successfully use arguments in drupal s views module but .when it filtering based on those arguments it uses in the where-clause of the sql statement

2002052
where-clause	sql
however i would like to use like instead of in the where-clause of the sql statement .so i can pass in say the title of a nodes as an arguments and then show all nodess that contains the title passed in

2002055
perl	ruby
if ruby or perl have some form of implementation that s just too awesome to pass up i can go that route

2002065
constructor	object
imo you re best off accepting a configuration object as a single parameter to your foo constructor rather than a dozen or .so separate parameters

2002073
.when	ready
most likely the reason it s coming up undefined is because .when you have separate ready call the scoping of the code inside those call is different

2002077
json	xml
this .post compares serialization speeds and sizes in .net including json bson and xml

2002085
pdfsharp	migradoc
you might be in luck however as it appears that pdfsharp + migradoc might be able to do this for you

2002089
children	nodes
the problem that i am currently encountering is that after validation the xml for the simple typess once they are built into a complex types all the children nodes get validation again producing redundant errors

2002090
constructor	object
i like to keep all initialization for any class properties whether primitive or object in the class constructor s

2002091
python	php
if you use flash media streaming server which means you cannot modify fms server-side scripting then use some scripting-language such as python or php to do file removing job

2002092
account	api
in the api use case you might want to return a representation that contains a uri to put to to activate the account

2002098
.when	ready
wrapped in a jquery ready function is nothing else than binding stuff to the ready event that is fired .when jquery thinks the dom is ready

2002116
cucumber	webrat
i am using cucumber + webrat + mechanize adaptor and want to test contents of pages that are iframed or framed into the selected page

2002127
globalization	localization
globalization localization related code

2002146
twitter	tweets	32-bit	64bit

2002161
oracle	mysql
while i m not familiar with mysql i don t believe an empty in-clause is permitted in db2 or oracle although i won t swear to it

2002167
attributes	properties
attr reads javascript properties not html attributes

2002174
nsmutablearray	nsarray
what is the difference between copy and mutablecopy .when used on either an nsarray or an nsmutablearray

2002183
datarepeater	gridview
i have a datarepeater with a gridview inside to display some tables from a stored procedure

2002187
sql-server	oracle
q2 is there a way to implements the individual row locking rather than table locking in sql-server like they have in oracle

2002197
put	get
tfs works like most .source control package it remembers what it has put on your computer .so that .when you get latest it only has to get the chnages since your last get instead of having to get ab.solutely everything

2002211
any	set
first any tags that invoke server-side actions must have set

2002215
abstract-class	subclassing
.so i am working on the book programming in objective-c 2.0 and working on exercise 8.5 where you have to building a bunch of classes and subclassing a homemade abstract-class into a square class a triangle class and a circle class

2002221
push	pull
this is something git can do but at that points you have two separate repositories that won t be able to directly easily push pull

2002261
factors	primes
given an arrays of primes factors of a natural numbers how can i find the total numbers of divisors using linq upon the original arrays

2002261
factors	primes
the primes factors of a numbers are the primes int that divide evenly into the numbers without a remainder

2002261
factors	primes
the primes factors of 60 are 2 2 3 5

2002261
factorization	primes
let s express the primes factorization using exponent

2002261
multiplying	exponent	factorization	primes
to find the total numbers of divi.sors given the primes factorization of the numbers all we have to do is add 1 to each exponent and then multiplying those numberss together like .so

2002261
factorization	primes
that s how you find the numbers of divisors given the primes factorization of a numbers

2002261
factors	primes
i already have good code to get the primes factors of a numbers .so i m not concerned about that

2002263
nsmutablearray	nsarray
copy ing an nsmutablearray may return an nsmutablearray since that s the original class but copy ing any arbitrary nsarray instances would not

2002283
display	width
you could try something like this if you really need to display it in a fixed width cell

2002284
downgrade	upgrade
officially you re not able to downgrade your iphone once upgrade and archiving copies is possibly copyright infringement but there are sites out there that hosts copies if you want to try anyway

2002290
nested	order
i ended up just setting the sort order on the default scoping of the nested model

2002300
versioning	upgrade
therefor it is impossible for your first versioning to have an upgrade link embedded

2002303
required	checked
whenever a user accesses a restrict page one that required a user to be logged in i checked the session to see if the login process has been completed

2002304
maven-release-plugin	release
actually i wonder how the maven-release-plugin deals with pattern #1 especially with the section since you can t have snapshot dependencies at release time

2002320
licensing	gpl
edit if licensing is important to you or your project note that jquery user-interface and jquery tools are dual-licensed under the mit and gpl v2 based on whichever suser-interfacets your needs better while extjs is only available under the gpl for other gpl project

2002322
png	gif
in asp.net c# i m trying to save a bitmap image as an 16-color non-transparent grayscale image as either a png or gif

2002347
zend-framework	symfony
which is one of the reasons for which they are less and liked by big frameworks i m thinking about zend-framework and symfony which are reducing the numbers of singleton for their next major versioning

2002348
deep-copy	object
a deep-copy will actually copy the individual object contains in the arrays

2002352
decrement	increment
i m gettign the error error 2 only assignment call increment decrement and new object expression can be used as a statement

2002365
logging	trace
what i m seeing from the trace logs suggests that .when i m logging in the first several tasks are using my data lets say user birk pass words

2002367
order	join
sql-server could first lookup all order in a particular status from the index and perform the join based on that

2002373
any	set
edit you need to somehow set your object to be the datacontext of the control or one of its ancestry and then you can reference any properties or nested properties of it

2002376
contains	set
the second level is the value for the second item plus a leaf nodes containss the set of lists which contains only x1

2002378
contains	any
if a large clustered index key is defined any nonclustered indexes that are defined on the same table will be significantly larger because the nonclustered index entries contains the clustering key

2002381
order	add
if you add a compound column the table will in some most cases need to be re-sorted on disk .when an order is added or the status is updates

2002385
textbox	button	inline-code	code-behind
essentially you wrap a textbox and a button with an ajax updatepanel in the anthem framework and then in the code-behind or inline-code page you can execute a javascript function after your callback has completed

2002392
any	set
inorder for the binding specified to work an instances of that disposabledisplay object must be set as the datacontext of the control labels in this case or any of its ancestry

2002409
itemtemplate	gridview
in a gridview using itemtemplate there is a wrap false properties

2002411
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
it works fine on firefox and google-chrome but in ie 7 and 8 and opera the elements just appears rather than being fade in

2002420
environment	building
specifically devenv may be invoked from another source with an environment variables specifying the target building directory

2002453
required	checked
i have one solution currently but it s quite ugly as it required checked to see which locals have changed at the end of a block and then reverting them to their value prior to the block

2002457
scriptmanager	updatepanel	updating	updates
really simple you d to have a scriptmanager on the page then server-side .when the updatepanel is updating before the methods updates just use

2002468
svg	vml
webkit implements overflow visible correctly for svg elements as does ie for vml elements

2002488
selected	checkbox
if the user unchecks a checkbox it will make the radiobuttons inactive .so the user cannot selected them anymore

2002490
png	gif
your fastest points from a to b is grab my code open-source but 69 to downloading and use the extremely simple api to set the color count to 16 and save-as gif or png

2002491
order	join
the plan will still have to scan tbl_b end to end and match every order numbers in tbl_a probably a merge join

2002505
insert-into	declare
if i mark a methods as transactional then do an insert-into a table and then throw a runtimeexception one that s definitely not declare in the throw list of the methods because there is no throw list on the methods it will still keep the insert-into that table

2002505
any	set
those grant need to be run for any user that a connection pool is set up for regardless of whether you actually do any modifying of anything

2002520
contains	elements
try setting the min-height on that columns and all all of their contains elements including body and html to 100

2002531
updating	updates
insert is for adding data to the table updates is for updating data that is already in the table

2002546
windows-vista	windows
a few users migrate to windows-vista and windows 7

2002546
windows-vista	windows
after investigating the users report i discovered kb 927387 common file and registry virtualization issues in windows-vista or in windows 7.

2002572
eof	eol
your while-loop is looking for eof which stands for eof not eol

2002601
display	height
after having a somecontrol instances created with a height specified and having that assign to a local ifoo variables display an attempt to assign a value to display s height properties via it s public setter isn t working for me

2002620
stripes	spring
using struts 2 or stripes doesn t exclude using spring for dependency-injection and other service

2002620
stripes	spring
actually most frameworks this is at least true for struts 2 and the stripes framework do provide nice spring-integration which is somehow something mandatory because of spring popularity

2002644
text-editor	editor
a fantastic and fast text-editor like eric4 s scintilla-based editor

2002692
sql-server	postgresql
i am attempting to make some cross-db sql-server and postgresql compatible sql

2002692
sql-server	postgresql
also i d just as well take 2 separate queries that will do this on sql-server and postgresql though i d prefer to just have to maintain 1 query

2002739
http	ssl
pretty sure you can t do this unless the page you are on is also ssl http as it will violate the same origin policy sop constraint on javascript

2002739
jquery	.post
jquery ajax .post to non-ssl page while current page is ssl

2002741
bug-tracking	workitem
the idea being reinforced by stressing that the intended scoping + duration of a bug-tracking workitem should not significantly exceed one business day

2002761
system.diagnostics	.net	logging	trace	log4net	nlog
while it include its own logging api it also works with popular logging frameworks such as log4net nlog the objectguy s dotnetlog as well as the trace console classes in the .net system.diagnostics namespace

2002763
active-directory	adam
there are three ways of figuring out things that have changed in active-directory or adam

2002763
callback	methods
the trick is using the getpartialresults methods in the callback methods to get only the change that has just occurred

2002786
javassist	bcel
you ll need to use bcel or javassist to patch thread-local bytecode to add the methods

2002797
dictionary	hashmap
the factory class on initialisation will need to discover all the possible finders and store them in a hashmap dictionary

2002832
postgresql	oracle
postgresql like oracle uses sequences to generator sequencial numeric value for artificial surrogate key

2002832
sql-server	mysql
sql-server and mysql allow you to either not specify the column or supply null as a placeholder for the primary key column and will provide the value for you

2002847
.when	ready
unfortunately i do not have an exact eta as to .when the new cookies management code will be ready for public use but it is very close possibly by the end of this month if time permits

2002848
fancybox	colorbox
interestingly i never noticed anything with colorbox but we switched today to fancybox and starting seeing an issue with galleryview

2002872
constructor	private	derived-class	inherited
i thought i was defining a new private methods foo in child which the inherited callfoo methods would call but i think some of what kdgregory has said may apply to my scenario - possibly due to the way the derived-class constructor is calling super or perhaps not

2002908
python	php
i m looking for something like php s print_r or python dictionary

2002922
worksheet	excel
i also figured out how to copy the raw-data to clipboard as a string which can then be paste into an excel worksheet and plotted but i would rather just copy the image itself

2002938
arguments	undefined
instead named the argumentss or take an object as an arguments instead and checked the argumentss or object s properties explicit for null or undefined

2002941
versioning	upgrade
however as tr1 features are brought into the c++0x standard-library they are upgrade where appropriate with c++0x language-features that were not available in the initial tr1 versioning

2002943
python	ruby
try to learn programming languages that introduce you to new approaches like lisp ruby python or javascript

2002951
highlight	selected
opening the link works fine but if the user cancels the link remains selected and is highlight in blue

2002970
freebsd	ubuntu	freebsd	linux	ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux 9.10 karmic but freebsd server gives the same result

2002982
child-process	spawn
.so you ll be able to set an environment variables and then spawn a child-process

2003018
fwrite	fopen	fwrite	fclose	fclose	fopen
.when you have everything how you want it in the variables re-assemble it and use the fopen fwrite and fclose cmd to rewrite the whole file

2003033
ip-address	hostname
in fact i think you are saying you just get back ip-addresses for other machines their ip-address and only get a hostname for your local

2003065
scrollable	panels
another thing you may want to do is have your game panels implements the scrollable interface

2003079
any	set
you can do that it ll work -- and even if i don t generally do it .when i set the key of my arrays by hand it sometimes happens .when i get the key from a file for instances and i ve never had any problem with this

2003088
any	set
.so my question is is there any way to set the year either for the current year or the next year

2003134
postgresql	mysql
there are a lot of free database engines - the most popular are mysql and postgresql

2003134
postgresql	mysql
if you think about the web-enabled frontend - consider php with mysql or postgresql on the backend or asp.net with mssql server at the backend

2003160
attributes	properties
on windows 2000 or higher instead of using ole compound document you can al.so store the summery information in the ntfs file metadata .so applications such as windows-explorer or windows desktop search can use the attributes in properties pages tooltip columns and searching

2003187
any	set
any client entity that has a request associated with it will automatically get a properties called request which is a query object that will return all request entities that have a client field set to the particular client entity you are dealing with

2003200
value	field
each recording will need to have a field updates with a different value

2003200
value	field
edit to clarify each field that i m updating will contains a unique value that is determined on the client-side

2003201
selected	cell
but while i can create a uiviewtouch object and overlay it onto my uitableview scroll events are not being relayed to my uitableview i can still selected cell and they respond properly by triggers a transitions to a new viewcontroller object

2003201
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
but i can not scroll the uitableview despite passing the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended events

2003213
mouseevent	mousedown
if i understand it correctly - .when i click on div with id alert function start working create an mouseevent evt types mousedown and dispatc this event on a with id my_link

2003246
decimal	hex
sqrt 2 doesn t have an exact representation in decimal hex or any other base-n systemd either

2003249
value	field
if each field is going to need a different value no

2003249
arrays	loops
you can have the value in an arrays and can write a loops that does it .so you don t need to write each updates by hand

2003250
gwt-rpc	gwt
gwt uses a non-transparent protocols for gwt-rpc communication

2003252
any	set
hey all i was wondering if any knew of a way to use a regular expression or wildcard operators or pehaps like in sql .so i could use j.sonpath to do searching within a large set of j.son data

2003263
updating	updates
enabling disabling the taction or updating any of its other properties will automatically updates all associated controls accordingly

2003283
traffic	packets
anyone with access to your javascript will simply be able to reverse engineer it tamper with it and anyone with a packets sniffer will be able to watch the unencrypted traffic

2003299
constructor	object
however object that initializer other object constructor are al.so function s in javascript .so it would make sense for object to al.so be a function

2003299
constructor	object
object needs to be an instances of function because it s a constructor and it needs to create more instancess of itself

2003301
any	set
add to that the fact that all cmd could be shortened to their first letters except the z cmd shortened to two letters that mostly handled the filesystems and curiosities like the fact that if i set a variables which was then consulted by else e -- and of course could be overrides by any intervening i or by the program itself

2003321
constructor	object
that object is the superclass or better the super constructor of

2003321
constructor	object
constructor is a function but a function is an instanceof object

2003321
constructor	object
above example is true because object is a constructor and a constructor in javascript is always a function

2003344
contains	any
most databases will allow you to store character field contains any character code

2003354
groovy	java
normally i would use swingworker but i m working with a java groovy backend for a grails .app and i m unsure how that would behave in a headless server environment since it has edt ties

2003364
.when	ready
then .when you re ready you can

2003427
textbox	button
.so my thoughts i could .somehow write .some javascript to create a textbox each time you click on a button to add a new row and then .somehow in the controllers save the data .when completed

2003447
attributes	properties
i have a inamedtypedefinition and get an ienumerable from the attributes properties

2003448
arrays	loops
i need to loops through an arrays and create a numbers of elements which i want to have in a single jquery result object

2003458
rollback	commit
transactional are a good tool for making logical sets of changes by multiple sql statements .so you can commit or rollback the whole set of changes as a unit and ensure your changes leave the database in a consistent state

2003468
mapping	unique
if you take a look at the nh documentation their example of using one-to-one for a parent-child relationship involves a many-to-one mapping with unique true and a one-to-one mapping not a pair of one-to-one mapping

2003486
buffering	streaming
streaming s buffering types can be controlled using setvbuf function

2003486
buffering	streaming	stderr	stdout
by default streaming referring to files are block buffering and terinals are line buffering stdout or unbuffering stderr

2003494
required	checked
.so i wrote a very simple javascript function to checked if those required field are missing or not

2003494
google-chrome	firefox
it works greate on firefox and google-chrome however not in ie

2003506
boost-python	bjam	bjam	jam
the boost part is really minimal boost-python thus using bjam to building everything looks like an overkill besides everyone working on the project feels comfortable with make and has no knowloedge of jam

2003522
juce	sdl
several c++ libs such as juce sdl etc

2003536
spaces	output
note the extra spaces before db and dc on the 2nd and 3rd line of the output

2003539
python	c++
i know this task is a well-tread path in python but have never tried it in c++

2003551
32-bit	64bit
you can also checked the mmc registry entries directly to verify whether your snapin was registered in the 64bit registry entries or the 32-bit redirected registry the one that show up under wow6432node

2003551
32-bit	64bit
msdn has a page on mmc 64bit versus 32-bit considerations with some more details including which installutil paths to invoke to get 64- vs 32- bit registry entries

2003553
spaces	output
which output each token separated by a spaces

2003553
spaces	output
to get the output you want you need to use one of the many suggestions here that don t re-inserted the unwanted spaces between tokens

2003569
terminal	prompt
open terminal prompt on the mac

2003571
average	min	average	max
whereas it does seem useful to keep stats like average min max and stddev measurements over time

2003572
double-quotes	single-quotes
the a is free text which can contains anything including single-quotes double-quotes back- and front-slash characters etc

2003573
32-bit	64bit
i am trying to run a 64bit executable java.exe from our 32-bit .net application

2003573
32-bit	64bit
i have tried explicily starting 64bit versioning of cmd.exe by calling c windows system32 cmd.exe but it gets redirected to syswow64 due to calling process being 32-bit

2003578
numerical	matrix
the numerical solution for doing this many time in a reliable stable manner involve 1 form the companion matrix 2 find the eigenvalue of the companion matrix

2003586
rmdir	cmd
rmdir cmd is safe in that it only

2003605
triggers	insert
i am hoping that there is a way to find out where the source code is calling from that is updating the table and insert the source as a triggers on that table that we are monitor

2003616
ondestroy	oncreate
i would agree with the use of oncreate ondestroy for a single activity application though an application with multiple activities would be better off using application.oncreate onterminate inorder to avoid triggers the uirunning state .when switching activities

2003683
order	add
add order by company assuming you want to sort by the company value

2003695
constructor	object	copy-constructor	constructor
the standards if read words by words defined that vector constructor in terms of the copy-constructor see quote and that literally means that the object obtained by dereference the iterator must first be converted into the types t and then the copy-constructor should be called

2003695
constructor	object	copy-constructor	constructor
this would go against the exact wording in the quote below as the copy-constructor is defined for a given types t as a constructor that taking a single possibly constants reference to an object of types t

2003695
copy-constructor	constructor
i cannot think of any reasonable arguments not to use the comeau approach and my believe this is just personal opinion is that the wording in the standards with respect to the complexity of the vector constructor should probably be restated as requiring only n call to the appropriate t constructor where appropriate would have to be defined as the constructor that matches the call that is either a constructor taking an inputiterator value_type by value or possibly constants reference or the t copy-constructor after an implicit-conversion from inputiterator value_type to t

2003710
arrays	loops
basically only use references in loops like this if you intend to change the arrays

2003716
vxworks	rtos
edit confirmed by wind river the spirit and opportunity run vxworks rtos

2003754
selected	cell	highlight	selected	highlight	cell
unless the cell is highlight not just selected this in effect hide the #name

2003759
value	field
change the order of a field s positioning in the dataset by changing the value of index

2003759
value	field
changing the index value affects the order in which field are display in data grid but not the positioning of the field in physical database tables.

2003779
value	field
most browsers would detection the value of the option field automatically meaning what i originally had was this

2003791
administration	account
2 temporary made my service account an administration

2003791
administration	account
4 remove service account from the administration grouping

2003791
administration	account
wasn t able to find a give ownership option to avoid making the service account an administration temporary though

hash	md5	salt	md5
even better if using a salt however md5 has known weaknesses and large collections of rainbow tables that aid in finding collision thus it would be a good idea to switching to something like sha-1 or one of the sha-2 family of hash

2003818
hash	md5
however to answer your original question there is really is no way to compare md5 or any hash against any types of encryption

2003840
webforms	asp.net
i m trying to develop my first site in asp.net using webforms

2003876
url-rewriting	query-string
then on the asp.net side you can use the url-rewriting feature to redirect that url to a specific aspx page as a query-string parameter

2003889
put	get
i believe you just need to put the currentdirectory properties of your application s invoke event in front of the relative part of your url to get the absolute url

2003937
any	set
the calendar modules let you set any weekday as first day of week but offers no simple way to get all weeks without duplications .when a week is split between two months .so i think that working directly off datetime is probably a better idea

2003962
selected	checkbox
first i want the row to get selected .when i click on a checkbox or if i click on multiple checkbox every row should stay selected in the datagrid for whose checkbox is selected

2003962

2004006
assign	add
one way that it does this is by assign 2 randomized value from php into the flash which you cannot grab or see even if running a realtime flash data grabber using a mathematical formula to add the score with the random value then checked it using the same formula to reverse it to see if the score matches it .when it finally goes to the php at the end

2004019

you could use just put the gridview into an updatepanel and handle your client side callback from there which is probably the simplest implementation for the gridview

2004052
updatepanel	gridview
basically you just wrap the gridview with an updatepanel and anything inside will work using ajax

2004060
qitemdelegate	qtablewidget
i have a family of classes based on the same parent class that are data cell in a qtablewidget .so they are all derived from qitemdelegate

2004068
cosine	sin
i then would put it back to normals angle by using sin and cosine

2004072
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
from what i understand obfuscation a java web application will just make it a little harder to read your application but reverse-engineering is still possible

2004149
innodb	myisam
are you using innodb or myisam

2004167
design-time	designer
i can mess with the width properties of the columns in the form designer and get the width to look just right at design-time but at runtime for whatever reason the columns tend to be significantly wider and i end up with a scrollbar at the bottom of the grid

2004183
64bit	x86
on most x86 platform va_lists are arrays of 64bit blocks

2004192
internet-explorer	firefox
and this works in internet-explorer and firefox

2004193
derived-class	inherited
even if you could inherited from sqldatareader it wouldn t matter anyway because you couldn t make sqlcommand create an instances of your derived-class

2004201
double-quotes	single-quotes
you could work around that by using the single-quotes for the html attributes and the double-quotes for the onclientclick

2004228
multiplying	modulo
other posters are right in that there is no inverse of 2 modulo 26 .so you can t .solve 2a 14 mod 26 by multiplying through by the inverse of 2

2004277
triggers	insert
it s worth noting that doing it via a triggers could be bad slow because it will occur for each insert

2004291
grouping	sorting
hi thanks for explaining sorting and grouping

2004293
command-prompt	cmd
if you add the directory contains git.exe to your path environment variables then you can simply run git cmd from the regular windows command-prompt

constructor	object
if i use a static counter in constructor and destructor it will be called in both the cases object from stack and heap

2004326
subtract	time
i am developing a c#.net .app in which i need to subtract two time periods

2004329
filtering	grouping
in any case you re already filtering the rows on a single value for bindingclassname in the where-clause .so you would only end up with 1 or 0 grouping s anyway

2004329
grouping	sorting
i think you re making the very common mistake of confusing grouping with sorting

2004329
contains	set
this means that my result set will contains one row per binding named and i can then do things like find the maximum start or end date or something like that

2004330
decrement	increment
have another counter there that is increment decrement in these operators

2004330
constructor	object	decrement	increment
the constructor destructor can increment decrement another counter that will count all object

you just have to assign the field value

2004344
radio-button	button
.when user click the done button on the screens keyboard finished typing i want to change a radio-button state

2004349
digits	zero
if you instead pad the numbers with zero up to the maximum numbers size in your case 5 digits the sort order should be maintained better in the directory

2004350
value	field
it seems that sometimes the value of various field are totally bogus as reported by gdb .when stepping from an objective-c file to a c++ file

2004357
configuration	environment
that way i could keep different configuration files in each environment

2004374
itemtemplate	expander
listbox has the styles in which itemtemplate consists of expander and inside expander there is a one more listbox listbox inside the expander has to be accessed

2004378
pointers	stack
you might try passing the parent pointers into the insert methods or you could convert insert-into an imperative methods and keep an explicit stack on which you recording the path down the tree

2004381
base-class	inherited
in code the forms themselves all inherited a base-class orderform

2004381
margins	padding
rather than create a slew of constants for each margins padding blah blah for each form in the base-class eg purchase_order_left_margins invoice_left_margins etc wouldn t it be better to create an overridable left_margins that can be set in the inheritee sic object

2004387
value	field
the field are series date value

2004393
display	width
you can do that but you have to checked the width of all fields-for all recording that you potentially can display

2004401
environment	building
my building scripting has a target environment switching .so that i can say dnn520 to deploy the building to my test dnn520 install

2004575
uilabel	uiview	uicontrol	uilabel
.so another way to do this if you needed to for .some rea.son would be to create a uiview change the class to uicontrol then place one or more uiimageviews uilabel or whatever you want in your generics uicontrol view

2004576
code-coverage	cobertura
cobertura for checked code-coverage

2004606

2004671
any	set
is there any way to set the orientation of the uiactionsheet programatically

2004685
constructor	object
historically i have coded my constructor .so that the object is ready to use once the constructor methods is complete

2004685
constructor	object
now if i am populating a directory listing view where i may only need the companyname and the main phone-number i may have a second constructor on the class that only retrieves that information and leaves the remaining information empty or i may just create a separate object that only holds that information

2004685
constructor	object
regardless of the numbers of constructor on a class my personal goal is to do whatever process is necessary to prepare the object for whatever tasks may be imposed upon it

2004704
emacs	vim
even if you were using an ide it s still useful to know emacs vim

2004716
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
if however you already have a separate data-access-layer business-logic-layer and presentation layer then you may only need to completely rewrite the presentation layer - while checked the other layer for things like concurrency safety

2004718
emacs	vim
in many cases emacs or vim is more productive than a huge ide that makes coffee

2004725
show	next
you should show some examples of what you want to do next time

2004733
click	mouse
simulating a mouse button click in windows

in sql-server 2008 management studio .when i right click on a database-table and choose selected top 100 rows i can then easily add a order by statement to the sql

2004796
pointers	stack
the nice thing about having pointerss is that you can pass them around as parameters with only minimal memory being copy-paste on stack the pointers is copy-paste instead of the whole object

2004801
constructor	object
second you initializer the memory with the value you want you construct the object by calling its constructor function

2004823
postdata	request
i don t see any correlation between postdata and request in your example .so not sure exactly what you are getting at with the two of them

.net	wcf
.net also offers some higher level ipc like .net-remoting and wcf which use the previous mentioned techniques

2004887
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome are using the same view engine .so chances are it works in safari as well

2004891
emacs	vim
everyone here seems to think that emacs vim are light-weight compared to ide s

2004900
constructor	object	hashtable	set	superclass	inherited
if you use that constructor and then call something like keyset inherited from its hashtable superclass you ll get an empty set because the map methods of properties do not take account of the default properties object that you passed into the constructor

2004909
linux	osx
windows linux and osx have their own complexities and most java application look out of place

2004911

2004929
frame	width
the issue is that .when i reduce the width of the table the normals demo not contains within a jinternalframe the horizontal scrollbar starts on the right where as doing the same for the internal frame demo the horizontal scrollbar starts on the left

2004938
spring	grails
but you have to keep in mind that grails now belongs to spring source

2004945
glassfish	weblogic
similarly web application servers jetty and tomcat are written in java and of course enterprise application servers such as websphere weblogic jboss glassfish

2004953
put	get
in the end i put together the following to get what i wanted

2004957

this queries the information_schema.tables table to retrieve table named that match your criterion then concatenation them together into a comma delimited string

2004959
easymock	junit
i m using easymock to create mock object for junit testing in java

2004961
value	field
this should be done on the database level and could throw an exception-handling .when trying to insert a wrong recording or updates one with a change of a key field to invalid value

2004984
principles	srp
however it doesn t belong together with your database module as that would be a violation of the single responsibility principles srp - it applies to modules as well as individual types

2004986
glassfish	geronimo
java based webserver tomcat geronimo glassfish .

2004986
look-and-feel	swt
with the advent of qt-jambi and swt java .apps look-and-feel like any other kind of .app including the insane startup time .so this isn t as obvious anymore

2005012

2005240
groovy	java
the main difference is that roo is a pure java framework whereas grails leverages groovy as well as java

2005240
spring	grails
this question was asked back .when roo was announced and graeme rocher grails lead says that both frameworks have a place within spring and are supported equally

2005243
google-chrome	firefox
i have recently maked a site which if i open that in google-chrome it gives me a malware protection error and if i open it in firefox or ie it gives me to install java plugins but i haven t add any java applet to home page and not any maleware or trojan on home page why it is showing it to me....

targettable is a string parameter targetfields is an arrays of field named and forwriting is an arrays of value

2005268
click	mouse
unfortunately the thumb appears to handle the mouse events .so that click on the thumb doesn t make the item selected

2005281
groovy	java
the main difference besides using different languages groovy vs java as others mentioned is that roo is mainly a development time tool and grails is more involved in runtime

2005295
any	set
what you have here is a common problem for which there is no common answer but what i would try if i were you since all these above suggestions apparently aren t working i d try to set my page containers background to any color let say white #ffffff and i d set background-color of body to any other then white let say grey #cccccc

according to this page it seems that perl php python is 50 time slower than c++ java

2005442
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
thus i think perl php python could not handle critical application such as 100 million user xx million request every second well.but exception-handling are exist facebook it is said facebook is written with php entirely wikipeida .moreover i heard google use python extensively

2005442
perl	php	perl	c++	python	java	python	php	python	c++	python	perl

2006797
formal-languages	lexical
while i agree with laura that formal language theory is highly useful i actually think that currently if you just want to get into the actual nl parts of nlp you can leave formal-languages for later as there are enough tools that will do your lexical analysis parsing tokenizing text transformation that you can use those rather than roll your own

2006797
lookup	any
edit in response to your question i would say that the first step would be to get a thorough grounding in the basic of probability the first 3-5 chapters of any undergrad prob stats book should be fine and then from there lookup new topics as they come up in the nlp book

2006800
click	mouse
you should set a breakpoints in the function click the bar on the left next to one of your lines-of-code then move the mouse over button3.text and see what it s actually equals to

2007403
put	get	sorted	lookup
for o 1 get put and remove operations you essentially need o 1 lookup which implies a hash-function as you know but the requirements of a good hash-function often break the requirement to be easily sorted

2007403
hashtable	set	hashtable	sorted
set up a hashtable alongside a parallels index that is sorted

2007403
python	java	python	c++

in hex always rendering bit field in hex not decimal 2080 is 0820 where it s clear there are two bits set

2008204
mouseover	mouseout
on application mouseover call a javascript function to disable the mouse scroll wheel and enable it on application mouseout

2008209
daemons	systemd
if you really do need to do locking because you are writing to some external service like a bit of hardware then you can use a typical unix approach to locking resources and write a single-instanced daemons that runs on a local socket which all your web-services can talk to - depending on if it indicates a resources is busy they could either reject request or queue them in memory in a queueing systemd a table in an sql db etc. with a a daemons which process queue request which also talks to the locking service

2008213
value	field
users don t always notice that the other field changed and they don t always double checked value for pre-populated field .so this often results in increased data entry error rates

2008215
.when	ready
the google collections libs now at 1.0 - but to be replace by guava .when that is ready contains many of the required methods - and i wouldn t be surprised to see 101 linq-like apis spring up as soon as the closure support looks reasonably final

2008226

2008288
filesystems	fat
if true this option enables various workarounds to enable git to work better on filesystems that are not case-sensitive like fat

2008289
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i dare say that asp.net-mvc is easier to work with than webforms

2008289
asp.net-mvc	webforms
webforms would probably be a slightly more comfortable technology for you coming from winforms development but asp.net-mvc will leave you with a greater understanding of how the web works which is incredibly important

a valid named in javascript must start with a unicode letter dollar-sign or underscore.js then can contains any of those characters as well as numbers combining diacritical accent characters and various joiner punctuation and zero-width spaces

2008359
selected	cell
.when the user then selected a non-table cell the home tab is activated by default

2008362
malloc	strdup
if i use malloc directly rather than strdup it won t crash

2008362
malloc	strdup	malloc	free	strdup	free
possibly because strdup is using the default malloc while the free call is using dlmalloc s free

2008381
dollar-sign	expression
for example with identifierstart we see that the regular expression will need to allow a letter a dollar-sign an underscore.js or a unicode escape sequences as the first character

2008399
constructor	private
my question is there a better methods of invoking the context menu that doesn t involve trying to initializer a class with a private constructor

2008409
physics-engine	chipmunk
i m using chipmunk dynamic for the physics-engine

2008409
chipmunk	box2d
box2d has ptm_ratio but i can t find anything like that in chipmunk .so how do my value correspond to the spaces coordinates in chipmunk

2008422
arrays	loops
as for alloc ing out of loops i m not sure that would work - you d still have to alloc for each entry in the arrays lest you wind up with five copies of the same object

2008456
binaries	install
with some difficulties -- you would need to install the cross-compiling to create windows binaries on linux

2008459
double	int
but i ve used this in the past for storing int double and serialization java object via xstream .so i can confirm it works well

2008477
debugging	trace
is there .some way i can either run it in debugging mode where i can set a breakpoints and step through and look at variables value or can i at least do the old-school methods of writing trace statements to a file .so i can see what s going on

it is a great tool for debugging the html code and also highlight the padding and margins areas for elements

2008588
getter	setter
i find making getter setter on object is best to pass data from one object to another in cocoa-type apps

2008588
getter	setter
create a setter methods on your .app delegation that accepts the lat value sets it internally to the .app delegation object in a protected properties and finally make a separate getter methods that simply returns the lat value from the .app delegation

2008588
getter	setter
or put the setter getter methods on whatever object makes sense in your .app

2008588
getter	setter
the naming conventions is usually setnameofvar and getnameofvar for setter and getter respectively

2008599
ubuntu	linux
then i run this program with gdb by the way i m using linux ubuntu 9.04 g++ 4.3.3 gnu gdb 6.8-debian and set a breakpoints at the end of the definition of compute_n_best_parses with some conditional to locate the exact call of this function i wanted i was tracing back from a segmentation fault

any	set	decrement	increment
any time you increment an index beyond the size of the arrays you set it back to 0 and vice versa if you re decrement the end index

2008877
arrays	loops
seems like you could just loops through the subviews arrays look at the tag properties of each one convert each to a string and use nsstring startswith to remove those that match your pattern

2008893
arrays	loops
the reference on image prevents loops from creating a copy of the arrays which would waste memory

2009175
slidedown	slideup
you might also want to have each slidedown cause all the others to slideup

2009194
python	ruby
i was reading about go and i can see that it s very good and can be a language used by many developers in some months but i want to decide a simple thing learn go or improve my python or ruby knowledge

2009212
scheme	let	sequences	subset
i haven t played with it much but i believe the lazy-evaluation language level or lazy-evaluation module in recent iterator of plt scheme would let you write your code to generator the entire infinite sequences which would theoretically use infinite time and memory but only evaluate a finite subset of that as needed

2009213
web-inf	maven
running the gwt eclipse goal will copy the maven dependencies into .war web-inf .lib

2009223
exception-handling	error-handling
we re working on .some error-handling code now and my first thought was to log the exception-handling throw reload the last consistent user-interface state and show .some .sort of modal pop-up or other user-interface elements with a brief error messages for the user this is an intranet page .so we re automatically notified of the bug and the users know where to find us

2009237
json	xml
silverlight has libs for handling both xml and json however silverlight data binding becomes much more usable .when you load that data into a strongly typed model

in the second 3-line versioning the assignment isn t allowed because the int variables could take any value from -2147483648 to 2147483647 inclusive most of which are out of range for the char variables to contains

2009334
object-reference	instances
once a string in intern the object-reference will points to the canonical string instances

2009352
beautifulsoup	html5lib
use an html parsing instead like beautifulsoup html5lib hpricot or nokogiri

internet-explorer	firefox
though the things work fine in firefox they don t in internet-explorer

2009411
innodb	myisam

2009428
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the rtm versioning here

2009445
any	set
- is the last value on any identity-column that was set

2009445
triggers	insert	value	field
the problem with identity is that it will report back the last identity value insert into any table - if your insert-into your data table will cause a triggers to write an entry into an audit table and that audit table has an identity field you ll get back that identity value - not the one insert into your table

2009450
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the rtm versioning of powershell 2.0 here

2009489
python	ruby
if you re looking to develop your skills for a job then go with python or ruby

2009489
python	ruby
go is compiled into machine-code whereas python and ruby run in interpreter

2009489
python	ruby
higher level tasks might be more suited for python or ruby

2009490
authentication	login
.so for instances your login-script would not only set your login credentials but al.so set the session key required for wordpress authentication

2009490
authentication	login
instead of using libcurl and hard-coding value try to simply integrated wordpress s authentication mechanism into your application s login mechanism

2009507
hidden-markov-models	markov-chains	hidden-markov-models	research	markov-chains	research
you might want to research the usage of markov-chains hidden-markov-models

2009509
python	ruby
i al.so would recommend keep using both python and ruby if you re interested you have enough experience to use them comfortably i think .so the next months you could experience a great boost in your experience using them.

2009512
background-image	transparency
you can use padding on some of the elements if you need the border images to be transparency ie the main background-image isn t to be rendering on the edges

2009513
removeclass	addclass
i don t think addclass and removeclass have duration parameters

2009519
object-reference	instances
it s erroring on the hello world line with a nullreferenceexception - the details below the error say object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

2009535
firefox	safari
however even their demo for addclass does not work in safari 4 but worked fine in firefox 3.5

2009540
tf-idf	corpus
they are probably using a variation on the tf-idf weight detection phrases that occur a high numbers of time in the specific book but few time in the whole corpus minus the specific book

2009550
groovy	java
ideally the cms should be implements in java or groovy does anyone know of something suitable

2009551
alignment	layout
no a class contains t1 and t2 is not guaranteed the same layout or alignment as at least in c++98 since std-pair is not a pod types

2009559
attributes	properties
add a targetid properties to your class and mark it with the attributes

2009568
directory	folder
in the first project i upload some images to a specific folder under the project root and save just the filename in the database now i am trying to display this images at some page of the second project i know the filename from the database and the image folder as absolute pat but i have not been able to display the image even thought .when looking in firebug the image src is correct the image does not display probably because it is not points in the right directory

2009572
gksudo	sudo
never run graphical cmd with sudo use gksudo instead

2009573
put	get
i am thinking the way to accomplish this in the changeparentfunction is to call a controllers action to get a new list then grab the mylistbox object and reassign it but am unsure how to put it all together

2009582
object-reference	instances
error system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2009584
keyboard	mouse
more specifically i need the application to stop process all input both mouse and keyboard .when the dialog is launchd and resume .when it s closed

2009584
keyboard	mouse
to summarize how do i disable enable user-input in a qt application both mouse and keyboard shortcuts

2009597
dictionary	arrays
i have a plist which contains a dictionary and an nsnumber arrays with more arrayss to

2009597
for-loop	arrays
could i use a for-loop to iterate through the arrays with all of the value converted to strings at the output

2009629
selected	checkbox
your current example is trying to selected the checkbox with an id of #chk0

2009676
hide	show
i am using this code to hide and show a div based on which thumbnail you rollover

2009678
silverlight	wpf
for exactly that purpose wpf and silverlight offer the textinput event

2009678
silverlight	wpf
i m not aware of such a function in wpf silverlight there is the keyconverter class but its purpose is a different one

2009696
contains	set
alternatively if there s a well-defined set of render-only functions that all required access to the same data i d seriously investigate pulling those into their own documentrenderer class that contains both the appropriate methods and the appropriate member variables

2009710
alignment	layout
each cell has a different view widget .so i thought a tabular layout would work well but they are all different sizes and default to top-left alignment inside each cell

2009731
extjs	flex
these applications some are in flex some in extjs are designed to be highly functional applications for a relatively small set of people

2009743
revision	updates
we use in some of our source files and the revision gets updates every time the revision of that particular file changes

2009745
associations	model	associations	containable
if your model has multiple associations you should take a look at the containable behavior

2009752
administration	account
there can be a sprint 0 where some infrastructural elements are handled like a codeigniter server wiki for the team making sure everyone has account in svn and other administration things to get handled

2009776
value	field
i m currently trying to work through asp.net-mvc validation and am coming up against some problems where a field is required depending on the value of another field

2009778
stderr	stdout
you should also scan p.geterrorstream - some programs write to stderr which is indistinguishable from stdout .when run from the command-line

2009795
groovy	java
using groovy or java how can i convert a org.joda.time.localdatetime to a java.util.date

2009797
transaction-log	ldf
i know that the transaction-log ldf file fills up and grows and that i can see how full it is by running

2009803
jscrollpane	jtextpane
jscrollpane contains everything below it and the jtextpane is inside of everything above it

2009808
radio-button	selected	radio-button	button	selected	button
based on which radio-button a user selected depends on which paypal button they are redirected to

2009808
radio-button	selected	radio-button	button	selected	button
however if i selected the radio-button and a venue and press the button nothing happens..

2009836
contains	elements
the input from txtrawcarddata elements is a string contains character which i split into an string arrays

2009864
internet-explorer	safari
without any software i found that testing my applications against internet-explorer 6 and safari at the same actually helped increase the speed of my development

2009864
firefox	safari
.when developing simple code against ie6 and safari i found that going back to firefox and ie8 is incredibly easier

2009873
put	get	py2exe	exe
2 if the .pyc files are actually bundled inside the python exe by py2exe or put in the same directory as the .exe or put into a named subdirectories which is then set as part of the pythonpath variables e.g w pylib i get importerror no module named os os is the first module import before sys and anything else

2009900
value	field
for instances i want to updates the field status in the database called database_old with the value contains in the database database_new

2009900
value	field
as as i said the field status should be updatess with the value from the database_new but only updates if the record_id matches

2009905
version-control	git
other version-control systemd also don t support this and most of them with a similar reasoning for example git

2009941
frame-rate	fps
if you make the animation as a function of time you can be independent of the frame-rate somewhat meaning that if you make your animation for 24fps you can easily adjust the animation to fit a 30 fps scenario if it s dynamic as in defined by a function opposed to frame by frame drawings where planning is everything

2009951
triggers	insert
your triggers is triggerss before the insert .so it is getting the value before constraints have been applied

2009951
triggers	insert
yes you would need to checked the value or apply the triggers after insert

2009953
execute	prepare
prepare statements explicit tells mysql what is sql and what is data .so mysql wonâ t execute any sql-in the data

2009959
inspector	webkit	javascript-debugger	inspector	javascript-debugger	spidermonkey
now in firebug or the webkit inspector or spidermonkey or the ie 8 javascript-debugger or any other javascript read-eval-print loops you can find you can try this function out and test it with different input

2009973
colorbox	jquery
i m using jquery colorbox to display a shopping-cart item

2009996
value	field
does a new std string get created using the value of the username field or does some sort of bitwise copy happen this would be bad

2009998
sys.path	sys
note also about your sys.path idea whether you have import sys already or not would have no effect on whether you could import os

2009998
sys.path	sys
that is the python path visible in sys.path is always available in the sense that it reflects an internal feature of the interpreter which is there whether you ve import the sys module or not

2010003
textbox	button
however if i click on edit button again it then display the textbox

2010043
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
once setting the action for the form in firefox safari google-chrome the submit methods works fine while in ie 8 nothing happens .when submit is called i am submission a form to paypal not that it matters

2010066
implicit-cast	generics
if i write a generics class like class is it possible to write an implicit-cast to types t .so i can do stuff like

2010094
lazy-evaluation	maybe
i suppose i can maybe do lazy-evaluation but at the same time

2010113
base-class	inherited
maybe try doing what you re attempting using a master page and having your model inherited from a common base-class or something like that instead

2010117
contains	sorted
for entity parententity with a collections of types childentity which contains an order properties of types int how can the parent entity be retrieved with the child collections sorted by order specifically through the use of the criteria-api as discussed in section 12.4 of the nhibernate docs here

2010128
jasper-reports	apache-poi
the problem is was that because i m using apache-poi 3.5 and jasper-reports 3.7.0 and generator xlsx excel format

2010128
jasper-reports	apache-poi
apache-poi 3.5 will be supported in jasper-reports 3.7.1 or just get snapshot from svn

2010130
contains	any
it is a gurantee that calling the methods will not have any side-effects on the class that contains the methods

2010139
postback	ajax
if you use ajax then you can postback details return with a fully rendering partialview and display that on the page

2010139
hide	show
the alternative is that all three step be on the base page to begin with and you can show hide tham as required

2010143
revision	svn
if you keep stable release simply tagged within the svn repo then you can just write a batch-file bash scripting to downloading the newest revision whilst backup to old with no user intervention - you can also run any scriptinging required in this way

2010152
required	checked
access to an arrays elements required a bounds checked address arithmetic and a load

2010152
data-structures	tree
other common data-structures like hashtable or balanced tree generally required that you allocate some context somewhere to keep tracking of where you are

2010158
transparency	frame
emacs 23 just added the functionality to change the alpha value of the current frame to make it transparency

2010168
callback	methods
.when the downloading is complete it will call a particular methods on your callback object

2010168
callback	methods
of course there is no guarantee that your callback object actually implements this methods

2010181
bitvector	bitset
it s often called a bitset or bitvector

2010181
contains	set
here you re using an int to represent the set of input sequences that contains this value

2010182
attributes	properties
a while back i put together a pretty nice viewmodel base-class that supports attributes on properties like

2010193
defined	declare
instead classes that implements the protocols declare the methods again in their own interface files and defined them along with other methods in their implementsation files.

2010202
selected	button
at the moment the first action is achieved via a rounded-rect button with a labels i in it and the second action is started by selected the row pressing anywhere else on that row

2010202
selected	button
would the blue i button look like that was the only integration and therefore users would not selected the row

2010210
scheme	sml
i mean types very broadly speaking to include such things as caml module types sml signature and plt scheme units . to communication how a large application works i suggest three things

2010215
put	get
if i just add an int to the structure then if i put too many object let s say 70 .so much less than the limit of the block i get a segmentation fault .when writing

2010233
32-bit	64bit
if you are running a 32-bit .app on a 64bit machine i am using windows 7 and you write this code

2010243
switching	screens
you could switching to using the standards chevron for the item details screens but the i button or a custom button is perfectly acceptable as well and you could set your custom button as the cell s acces.sory view .so it s in the exact same place

2010252
multiplication	division
or will the wonders of pipelining and the absence of multiplication and division make it all come out about even

2010257
environment	building
java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_15-b03

2010280
boost	tbb
you could use the boost threads libs the intel tbb libs or straight pthreads or windows threads for that matter

2010281
webforms	asp.net
the root of the problem is that asp.net webforms wrap everything on the page inside of one large tag

2010285
xsd	xml
i am still building the tree .so that at the end of it i can validation the entire xml tree against the xsd since there are .some things that i can t catch at the cell level

2010292
json	xml
once you discover a network device or machine you can use whatever data format is convenient such as xml json home-grown or binary

2010300
treeviewitem	listboxitem
within that datatemplate is a treeview which display various properties as treeviewitem children of a root treeviewitem which represents the items being display in the listboxitem

2010302
reflection	runtime
i use reflection a lot especially bean properties reflection and i ve just gotten used to late exception-handling at runtime

2010308
updating	updates
then updating to the latest source can be as simple as an svn updates

2010308
.when	ready
you can merge trunk into the release branch .when you are ready for a release

2010336
textchanged	textbox	keydown	keyup
i added a bunch of trace statements in events hooked by this textbox and i found that .when i lost keystrokes the keyup keydown and keypress events all correctly fired but the textchanged event never fired

2010336
keydown	keyup
in case there is a suggestion that i use the keyup keydown events to determine if the text has changed there is an issue there as well

2010336
keydown	keyup
keyup keydown are called multiple time for each key press .so it would be very difficult to determine if .someone was typing the same letter multiple time

2010340
click	mouse
that column is used to delete specific row and it should only display clickable image with associated mouse click action within custom itemrenderer

2010356
postdata	request
use jquery to make an ajax request passing parameter from 3 as get or postdata

2010364
widget	button
the jquery-ui-dialog model form widget has an issue with asp.net .when a button on the dialog is click to submit the page

2010372

i want a internal pop-up or nice modal box which contains an iframe i should able to set the width and height and which is easy to install and has no too much files

2010381
postdata	request
the cgi interface works as follows .when a request comes the webserver runs a process the http input aka postdata is supplied to the process via stdin the generator content and headers are emitted via stdout

2010420
hash	md5
what you need to pass is the md5 hash of the url instead of the actual url

2010420
hash	md5
php has a md5 function that you can use to get the md5 hash of a url

2010420
hash	md5
the api call then would be for story.getall and you pass the previously calculated md5 hash as a parameter link_hash

2010431
textchanged	textbox
.when using a tablet pc input panels the textbox will not get a textchanged notification for every character

2010436
put	get
i put up several other post about the problems that never get satisfactory answers but that do result in a few work arounds

2010437
oracle	mysql
are oracle mysql etc smart enough to do only 10 iterator through table_b

2010442
buffering	streaming
but streaming playing 1 buffering after another is harder

2010444
value	field
please note that in the last example you most javascript encode the value of the named field

2010452
silverlight	wpf
silverlight and wpf seem to be the most appropriate options

2010460
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is a subset of wpf that is used in the silverlight browser-plugin

2010460
silverlight	wpf
silverlight doesn t have all of the capabilities that wpf does partially for security reasons - it is used in the browser

2010466
cos	sin
my problem is that i am running into the compile error the named toradians cos sin todegrees does not exist in the current context... what am i doing wrong

2010479
appdata	temp
the file in question turned out to be c users jason appdata local temp temporary asp.net files root f691a68c a1593a1e hash hash.web

2010482
cos	sin
you should replace sin and cos with math.sin and math.cos

2010494
cos	sin
you will also need to change the call to cos and sin to be math.cos and math.sin

2010507
boolean	int
using an n bit int to represent n boolean is a special case of the data structure known as a perfect-hash table

2010507
any	set
extends the approach to use bitwise-and -or -xor for set operations is common and doesn t required any special named other than set operations or if you need a buzzword set-theory

2010512
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is far less capable than wpf even in versioning 4

2010512
silverlight	wpf
it can run in a browser or out-of-browser and has some advantages - but the main advantages of silverlight over wpf are deployment related

2010531
silverlight	wpf
as gabriel and reed mention silverlight is a slimmed down versioning of wpf

2010531
silverlight	wpf
wpf is intended primarily for desktop applications and it has advanced features around layout animation and data binding that silverlight does not yet have

2010531
silverlight	wpf
wpf also has more sophisticated 3d capabilities than silverlight - though not by much

2010531
linux	osx
siverlight is available on multiple platform like linux and osx via the mono runtime and the moonlight ports of silverlight

2010531
silverlight	wpf	expression-blend	silverlight	expression-blend	wpf
on the development tools front - the best tool out there imho is expression-blend - it has an elegant and powerful user-interface for visually creating either wpf or silverlight user interfaces

2010537
dictionary	arrays	put	get
just find .jpg .png gif with globbing put those filenames to dictionary or arrays and find those filenames againt html css javascript files remove filename if found and you will get unused list and move those images to another folder with same directory-structure it will be good for restoring for just in case

2010548
database-table	mysql
how do i format the string result-of datetime.now in c# for insert into a mysql database-table column of types datetime

2010550
json	xml
use json xml or something else that is architecture-neutral

2010569
any	set
i am trying to match any or all from a set of phrases in a given string

2010581
versioning	upgrade
you do need to upgrade to 7.6 before upgrading to 8.0 from an earlier versioning

2010589
value	field
i ve followed the instructions added the role to my user checked the administer some menus value for that role and checked the make admin field for that role and specific menu in menus

2010590

environment	building
java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_17-b04

2010623
credentials	account
if i set the permissions for the credentials file to 661 .so that public has execute permission but not read permission does this allow the main scripting to access the credentials and connect to the db while preventing .someone with a user account on the server from viewing the contents of the credentials file

2010623
any	set
sub-question if i set all of my scripting to only have execute permission and not read are there any pitfalls i should expect

2010623
any	set
this is assuming that i will leave any files i need explicit read permission data files set to read

2010629
scripting	shebang
execute permission for scriptinging tells the loader or kernel to read the shebang line and pass the scripting to the named interpreter

2010651
implements	abstract
you want a dao interface to abstract succinct db integration or in other words you could implements the data-access contract with various implementsation such as jpa hibernate oracle jdbc etc

2010656
delphi	c++
you can identify delphi and c++ builder apps and their sku by looking for a couple of specific resources that the linker adds

2010660
silverlight	wpf
i am looking at implements prism into my next silverlight wpf application

2010662
imageview	textview
the customview has imageview and two textview

2010662
imageview	textview
the problem is that .when the background changes from the default greyish all the views in the customview imageview and textview still have their greyish background and thus creates very ugly greay boxes on top of the now redish background

2010669
arraylist	treeset
i m having a weird problem with treeset sortednodes and arraylist nodes

2010669
contains	sorted
.when i then printing content of sortednodes it s not even sorted in addition to not contains all the object it should

2010671
abstract	extends
for your form scenario you would probably want an abstract form class that defined how a field is made and its validation then each specific form would extends your abstract

2010678
arraylist	treeset
arraylist does allow duplicates .so it could have more nodes than treeset if you add nodes more than once

2010694
32-bit	64bit
as you say programfiles might mean the 32-bit path in some cases and the 64bit path in others

2010699
authentication	login
the standards model for user authentication on website involves a login authentication event after which if successful a user is inside the wall with a persistent secure session and may see and do things on subsequent request which unauthenticated users may not

2010699
authentication	login
caching and statelessness appear to be broken because the authentication user will probably see html which is different from that which a non-authentication user will see for the same request for instances there might be a login form in a sidebar for the logged-out user

2010726
swing	swt
swing or swt

2010730
python	java	python	c++
we have been moving our forensics code from c++ and python to java for the following reasons

2010730
32-bit	64bit
single java binary will run on 32-bit and 64bit systemd

2010741
logout	login
this should cut out most of the gotchas with things like using custom templates for login logout admin etc

2010765
django-contrib	pinax
this is the tradition that most django applications use pinax django-contrib etc

2010790
exception-handling	try-catch
but if the elements not being there is a valid case that you don t want an exception-handling throw in then yes you will have to wrap the code in a try-catch block and deal with it

2010793
windows-vista	windows
the .app runs fine under iis on windows-vista and windows 7 and vs s built-in webserver

2010807

however you can iterate over the dictionary noting which key map to the desired value

2010812
uiapplication	uiwindow
how to create a uiwindow .when there is no uiapplication in main.m

2010814
document	editing
what you re describing sounds less like a web-based version-control for document and more like a cms with different access-levels that also supports printing to pdf and online editing

2010816
mac-address	lan
how do i get the mac-address of a remote hosts on my lan

2010821
value	field
if you do not existing insert code that does not contains the new field will fail because the field s value will be considered null

2010821
value	field
its al.so useful on a field like a time-stamp .so you don t have to code the value on every insert

2010822
value	field
the benefit is that for a new row you don t have to explicit enter value for every field

2010825
authentication	login
the standards model for user authentication on website involves a login authentication event after which if successful a user is inside the wall with a persistent secure session

2010826
textbox	button
is there a way to allow a button to be click on the keyboard control without causing the textbox to lose focus

2010828
linux	unix
in linux unix arping

2010858
click	mouse
you will still be able to click it with the mouse and it will still call your click event handler but it won t acquire focus or cause the textbox to lose focus

2010884
csv	xml
comma-separated value aka csv for tabular data beats xml any day

2010892
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i see this behavior in safari google-chrome and firefox .so i assume it s my misunderstanding of the html5 web-storage specifications not a browser-specificationsific bug or limitation

2010892
specifications	w3c
updates the w3c eventually changed their minds about the structured-clone specificationsifications and decided to change the specifications to match the implementation

2010909

2015965
arguments	undefined
or you use the call or apply methods with the this arguments set as null or undefined the this keyword inside the invoked function will refer to the global object windows

2015975
derived-class	abc
in the second example the derived-class is cast as a base .so it will use the base abc properties

i ve created logic to generator an invitation code and a temporary login registration on invite view to be used during this dev test phase

2016226

my suggestion is to change the code completely in this manner as show take out either keydown or keyup event handler as they simplistically put it are the same ok technically it is designated respectively for .when a key is pressed down and likewise .when a key is release

2016280
selenium	qtp
selenium is a user-interface test automation framework that is people use instead of hp quser-interfaceck test pro qtp

2016280
selenium	qtp
selenium is very good at testing at ajax applications where qtp can cope with it

2016280
selenium	qtp
with selenium 2 now in alpha there is going to be better support for more native actions like key strokes which qtp is slightly better but once it has fully release then i feel selenium 2 will be the best web test automation framework out there

2016311
implements	extends
java s java.io.closeable interface implements by streaming automagically extends autocloseable .so you can already use streaming in a try block the same way you would use them in a c# using block

2016324
callback	methods
for example i d like to have a methods that invokes other methodss as callback

2016344
selected	button
there is al.so such a thing as a statelistdrawable which lets you defined different drawables for each state the your button can be in whether focused selected pressed disabled and .so on

2016376
expression	brackets
x5b and x5d are the hex escapes for left and right bracket. note that the match of the entire expression will include the brackets that mark the boundaries

2016378
canvas	scale
i have developed an application that in the end will save a capture image of a canvas that s scale up to 4000 pixels then upload the result to the server using zend-amf

2016384
contains	any
the strings may contains any numbers of character sets - english german and japanese or a mix of them even

2016398
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
i know that the derived-class can t access the private-members of the base-class .so why does the derived-class inherited the private-members of the base-class

2016411
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
the derived-class doesn t inherited the private-members of the base-class in any way - it can t access them .so it doesn t inherited them

2016411
private-members	instances	derived-class	base-class
an instances of the derived-class contains instancess of the private-members of the base-class for obvious reasons

2016422
derived-class	base-class	protected	public
the public and protected methods of the base-class can still access private variables of the base-class and these methods are available in the derived-class

2016443
properties-file	jar
to load that properties-file in a portable manner the best way would be to put it on the classpath of the web .application either in a jar under web-inf .lib or under web-inf classes or on the .app server classpath if you want to be able to edit that file without repackaging your web .application and to use class#getresourceasstream string

2016464
implements	extends
wnere the tank and soldier classes both extends from or implements enemy like this

2016468
arrays	loops
hi i m trying to loops through a arrays and set a key value

2016479
exception-handling	try-catch
does the try-catch block immediately force an exit if it catches a std bad_alloc exception-handling

2016489
silverlight	wpf
it is also similar to silverlight meaning you can easily get into silverlight too .when you know wpf

2016499
value	field
as it s not performance critical code i d like to use reflection to printing out field named value pairs x 1 y 2 etc

2016499
base-class	inherited
to be clear the tostring methods in the base-class should reflectively iterate over public vals in any classes that inherited from it as well as any traits that are mixed in

2016506
getter	setter
using getter and setter is good for the encapsulation of code

2016514
perl	ruby
the rest of the code will be in ruby .so i d prefer that but i m happy to use any pthreads tool -- a c program a perl scripting etc

2016520
button	popup
idea is .when user click printing button to pick up html from client send it to server save it and upon successful save open report that use previously saved html in popup windows

2016550
hide	show
enables or disables the show hide grid button which appears on the right side of the caption layer

2016553
arrays	loops
note be sure to unset item after loops .so you don t inadvertantly modify the arrays later by using that variables named

2016558
highlight	selected
think about ms-word where selected the highlight tool turns your pointers into a highlighter

2016576
tabcontrol	panels
i tried to put my tabcontrol in combobox.itemspanelstemplate but wpf wouldn t let me because tabcontrol is not a panels

2016580
json	xml
later i want to transform this query into json xml and send it to the server

2016582
selected	button
navigation between step is doing using the previous next button or by selected a tab

2016582
decrement	increment
the button decrement increment the jtabbedpane s selectedindex

2016608
derived-class	base-class	derived-class	pure-virtual	pure-virtual	base-class
does it mean that we should get derived-class from the base-class with pure-virtual function

2016609
python	java
i have seen mention of java and python

2016617
any	set
the calayer is implements an informal protocols which means that you can set any object to be its delegation and it will determine if it can send messages to that delegation by checked the delegation for a particular selector -respondstoselector

2016633
contains	elements
the javascript you have in your question updates works but it needs to operate on an elements contains your content rather than the content itself

2016636
versioning	upgrade
the xibs compiled fine using 3.0 but .when i upgrade to 3.1.2 i started getting the error pattern colors are not supported by the iphone sdk for iphone os versioning prior to 3.0.

2016652
shipping	tax
it enables you to specify a url-for paypal to call your web service with the buyerâ s shipping address .so you can provide the buyer with more detailed shipping insurance and tax information

2016652
express-checkout	shopping-cart
the instant updates api enhances the express-checkout flow from the shopping-cart page

2016652
shipping	tax
2.your callback server responds with the available shipping options for that address along with any insurance options and tax adjustments on the order

2016656
contains	any	contains	elements
the code runs but does not contains any elements hows a zero-length arrays

2016665
extends	super
extends the defaultsingleselectionmodel and overrides the setselectedindex methods seems to do the job fine calling the super methods only if the switching is to be permitted

2016684
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
python ruby perl etc

2016697
arguments	default
i can only guess that visual-studio i m seeing this with 2005 and 2008 has some default set deep in its bowels that is preventing my command-line arguments from being applied but i ve found no evidence to support this hypothesis

2016704
put	get
i wrote a blog .post on how to get around this issue and i even put up some code for helpers methods you can swipe from my site

2016714
debian-based	ubuntu
for debian-based distro have a look at packaging java apps for ubuntu slider are available here

2016714
opensuse	rpm	packaging	building
to building a rpm have a look at the rpm howto or development and packaging java software for opensuse

2016721
arrays	loops
if the generics types methods didn t exist you d have to loops through each of the object in the return object arrays and cast each individually into a new long arrays

2016724
activation	userid
i generally send a link that contains the userid and the activation key

2016731
virtual-machine	vmware
to run untrusted code at home i use a vmware virtual-machine

2016731
virtualization	vmware
i want to find an alternate lightweight sandbox api for running untrusted applications without the overhead of installing vmware or any other kind of end-user virtualization tool like that

2016732
arrays	loops
again i loops through the arrays getting each brick

2016745
dictionary	map
this doesn t make any less meaningful practical necessary to map dictionary to other object

2016747
linux	uname
uname -a linux myserver.foo.com 2.6.18-164.9.1.el5 #1 smp wed dec 9 03 29 54 est 2009 i686 i686 i386 gnu linux

2016749
reverse-dns	dns
it could be do to a dns setting it s trying a reverse-dns or something in the etc hostss mapping that ip to that hosts

2016755
constructor	object
one common workaround is to based the object for which you want to hide the constructor on an interface

2016756
constructor	private
the closest you have is an internal constructor or a private constructor and a separate factory-method probably internal .so you haven t saved much

2016760
constructor	object
for example java s file object uses pathnamed as the parameter named for the constructor on their file object

2016765
abstract	extends	implements	extends	implements	abstract
basically i want to know why an abstract decorator class must be created which implements or extends some interface or abstract-class

2016765
abstract	extends	implements	extends	implements	abstract
why can t all the new decorated classes simply implements or extends the base abstract object themselves instead of extendss the abstract decorator class

2016765
abstract	extends
to decorator beverage an abstract condimentdecorator class is created which extends beverage and has an instances of beverage

2016765
implements	abstract
edit i tried to implements this omitting the abstract decorator class and it seems to still work

2016772
findstr	cmd
this can be checked with the findstr cmd

2016782
hide	show
then the user can hide and show them via button click

2016783
activation	account
this is useful because if a user sign up but never activates their account and deletes the email and you are using their email as an id just an example they will never be able to complete the activation

2016785
derived-class	base-class
don t forget that the base-class may have methods that are not private and thus accessible by the derived-class

2016785
protected	public
those protected or public base-class methods can still invoke the private base-class methods

2016788
push	pull
however i do not want all of these commit to go on github .so a simple clone and then just push pull approach does not suit

2016788
push	pull
.so pc1 and pc2 should be able to push pull to the local network shared and thus shared code between each other and every once in a while i want to push those changes to my github repository

2016808
perl	php
myself i would use php or perl to clean the data up which will could be tricky at best

2016820
arguments	default
the variables in question seems like it would only be unknown to pydev if it were passed in as a function arguments with no default value.and if you have a function operating on your own class it seems like that should be a class member .so autocomplete would already work

2016828
hash	md5
i would probably base the md5 hash on a combinations of unique identifier and a random numbers

2016843
python	perl
then you could use perl or python to bear down on the problem to your liking before import

2016851
python	php
some people like that particularly people coming from languages that have it built-in like python or php

2016855
put	get
but .when i put struts in my web-inf .lib directory and try to make a struts .app i get the below in the logfile

2016857
attributes	properties
if .so you may have an empty src attributes on an img tag or an empty url definition in a css properties which is causing the 2nd request

2016863
dictionary	arrays
that s called an indexer they allow you to use list arrayslist dictionary and all the other collections using an arrays syntax

2016872
push	pull
if you make a git-clone --bare mygithubrepo.git on your shared and then clone that shareddrepo on pc1 and pc2 you have set up for each of those pc repo a natural destination for them to push pull

2016881
push	pull
developers that don t have push access to the main remote can push pull to a separate remote

2016883
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
note firefox google-chrome and safari use the same service maybe it s of google too

2016884
cursor	row
assuming you are determined to use sql-like you said in your question if you have the skill to hack it with c# you should be able to figure out how to create a stored procedure that uses a cursor in a repeat fetch loops to selected the rows string functions to massage the data and an updates to updates the row

2016887
.when	ready
.when you are ready to push to github change into network foo and push from there

2016890
button	popup
but is there any standards way to create a button not in a toolbar with the little down triangle that automatically popup a menu .when click

2016891
for-loop	arrays
but i d recommend the for-loop to avoid clashing with libs modifications or .when firefox suddenly decide to implements its own each methods for arrays some libs have already been bitten by this

2016893
pixels	line
the 0 line on the y axis is shifted to the right one pixels every time the movieclip is added

2016895
qtcore	qtgui
i m not sure why it wasn t auto-included but i think it has something to do with qtcore only being used by qtgui which is a c++ lib.

2016905
.when	ready
it seems that as soon as data is ready for the hosts such as .when i use writefile to send a cmd to the hid in which i tell the hid to give back some data such as the ports value and the in packets ready bit is set the hosts reads it as confirmed by another usb interrupt before readfile ever is called

2016927
derived-class	base-class
suppose you created a derived-class then replace every instances of the base-class in your program with that derived-class

2016927
derived-class	base-class
the explanation above talks about the case where the resulting derived-class is not fully compatible with the base-class which is dangerous

2016927
derived-class	inherited
a shorter explanation would be that in most cases a derived-class of a class not designed for inherited will either violate liskov s substitution principles or will not be able to accomplish anything useful that could not have been accomplished using composition instead

2016947
solaris	linux	solaris	bsd	linux	bsd
it will only run on x86 systemdd not sparc etc. with directx compliant hardware rendering units graphics cards and it will not run on a systemd with strong hardware abstraction like most unices like bsd or linux or solaris

2016948
contains	set
this msdn article contains pointers about how to further set up such choices.

2016960
bash	zsh
you could switching to zsh instead of bash

2016960
bash	zsh
zsh has lots of other features that bash lacks but that one alone is worth making the switching for

2016969
environment	building
you can then launchd your setup building from a batch-file which prepares the necessary environment variables like this

2016975
buildr	ant
i have a buildr scripting that first loads a java properties-file then creates an ant task

2016999
web-services	api
and i d like to implements a java application that translation application 1 s web-services call to application 2 s jmx api

2017003
json	xml
the only difference is that you are returning some non-formated data as json or xml hey this is the same as generator an atom-feed or only a portion of an html page

2017027
protected	public
or will the current and future versioning be protected while previous versioning fall under public domain

2017070
subclassing	base-class
if they only differ slightly you can still consider creating one base-class and subclassing the different variations

2017071
ruby-on-rails	django
i m new to django coming from ruby-on-rails and i am finding the django-fixtures most commonly json from what i gather to be somewhat awkward and unweildy at least in comparison to the ruby-on-rails fixtures that i am familiar with

2017071
json	xml
do you sit down and write the json xml yaml by hand or are there other tools available to help similar to what ruby-on-rails gives me

2017077
lgpl	gpl
you can even offer dual license use gpl or pay me 100 to use bsd kind of like what the qt guys did before they decided to offer lgpl

2017086
assign	add
you can then add the glyph using either a delphi 2010 button or a previous versioning tbitbtn and assign the bitmap glyph properties to an appropriate image and align right

2017112
python	php
i m familiar with libcurl in php but am using it for the first time in python with pylibcurl

2017118
put	get
recording the time that the webpage request was made you could put that into a database if you liked and then .when the answer is received get the current time and perform some arithmetic to get the duration of the answer

2017124
ubuntu-server	gentoo
we use a mix of centos ubuntu-server and gentoo which are run headless since most of our apps are java apache based

2017125
webforms	asp.net
i ve been working in asp.net webforms and i ve been making a user-controls that depends on a small bit of javascript which is in an external file

2017125
webforms	asp.net
is there an easy way to do this in asp.net webforms

2017126
lgpl	gpl
if you use lgpl or apache or berkeley-licensed code you re better off then using gpl code which required that all code which is written based on this code has to be published as open source

2017132
scriptmanager	updatepanel
alternately if you re using updatepanel use scriptmanager s equivalent register... methods

2017138
ubuntu	debian
in the server debian ubuntu instructions

.when	ready
i want a scripting to run in the near future .when we are ready to deploy the new .app

2017189
any	set
i am willing to write apps on the phones symbian os s60 platform or pc windows but what i can t understand is how do i set up a client or server since any one of these devices could be a client or server

2017218
memset	malloc
i would equate that roughly to someone listing c++ on their resume and being expected to write a short program that uses basic language-features like sizeof memset or malloc

2017218
pixels	line
i would understand if they couldn t pull the exact doctypes line out of thin air or they didn t try to list the pixels dimension of the image but the rest of it is the types of material you would learn in high school and is imo perfectly reasonable to expect someone to be able to do if they are claiming to know html well

2017219
selected	button
if i click the edit button in the navigationbar then selected a row and click the delete button the row is deleted and all ends well

2017222
click	mouse
why do the canvas mouse event handler get called only .when i click in the rectangle control and not in the empty canvas

margins	padding
there is an elements with non-zero margins padding that you re not account for

2017291
value	field
say if a user enters in a value and i need to checked this value against the database to see if it exists and if .so return an error and highlight the field how would i best go about this

2017293
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
swfobject will be execute as soon as it is read and will perform all dom manipulations as soon as the dom is loaded - for all browsers that support this like ie firefox safari and opera 9+ - or otherwise as soon as the onload event fires

2017325
nhibernate-validator	xval
i am using xval with nhibernate-validator and i have a hard time to validation the dates

2017325
nhibernate-validator	xval
second i tried xval itself not using nhibernate-validator but still no chance

2017325
nhibernate-validator	xval
i have tried creating new rules for nhibernate-validator by extends a new class but it needs to be declare in the xval client side too

2017334
any	set
i am not sure if you need to use a particular containers but in any event set the width and height to 100 and use grid gridrow and griditem to size and resize text control you can specify the width of the table or just use it just like an html table in flex to manipulate the size of controls and containerss..

2017343
inline-assembly	assembly
about one third of my job consists of doing just what you re doing juggling c code around and then looking at the assembly output to make sure it s been optimized correctly which is preferred to just writing inline-assembly all over the place

2017348
command-prompt	cmd
edit - you should copy-paste that long zip line to the command-prompt hit windows key + r then types cmd and hit enter to see if it works

2017352
terminal	prompt
looks like you should have done zip -qr c backup 20100106143030.zip c ab a c ab b at the terminal prompt not a python prompt

2017355
perl	awk	python	perl
you could also consider using awk perl or python if there s a lot of them to do or it needs to be really fast

2017362
stdin	pipe
you need two pipe one for the process to send output to you stdout and one for you to send input to the process stdin

2017362
stdin	pipe	stderr	stdout
.so you need to call createpipe twice to create two pipe one for stdin one for stdout and stderr

2017362
stdin	pipe
to send data to the process write to the write handle of the stdin pipe

2017383
msbuild	nant
we use nant instead of msbuild but the concept remains the same

2017398
hash	md5
at a minimum the passwd should be stored as a sha1 md5 hash

2017470
windows-vista	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-vista	windows-server	windows-xp
this api required windows-xp sp2 windows-vista windows-server 2003 sp1 or windows-server 2008 though

2017488
highlight	selected
highlight or selected the row in the datagridview

2017492
constructor	object
if you need a way to get class named to create new instancess of object you could use describetype or go through the instances s constructor but i reckon you would know your classes anyway

2017502
macports	fink	macports	homebrew	homebrew	fink
then use gobjdump you might have to install that yourself from macports fink homebrew to see what s inside the files and compare the two versioning

2017523
cout	cin
my students who learn cin and cout first then learn printf later overwhelmingly prefer printf or more usually printf

2017530
constructor	object
as a points of pedntry there is a difference if the class interface constructor methods declare a bound other than extends object

2017553
for-loop	arrays
the information received in an arrays .so i use for-loop to append them to my html page in this way

2017555
cpu-architecture	32-bit	32-bit	64bit
you could p invoke to getnativesysteminfo which will give the cpu-architecture of the os even from within a 32-bit process on a 64bit os

2017564
order	add
add a 16-bit int in big-endian order

2017592

2017616
administration	account
being part of the local administration grouping doesn t provide the same access as the local administration account the same also applies to windows-vista

2017616
authentication	login	access-control	authentication
during the login process authentication and access-control components that identify an administration are removed leaving a standards user token

2017623
getter	setter
to make sure that in the future if you happen to have a problem to which a good solution would be simply to treat the variables before it goes in and or out of the class you can treat the variables by using an actual implementation on the getter and setter methods instead of simply returning or setting the value

2017623
getter-setter	setter
the same can be applied to some sort of setter or even getter-setter class templates

2017627
contains	elements
it says remove all elements in b that are contains in a

2017629
contains	elements
.so you re removing every elements from b that is al.so contains in a

2017636
any	set
set breakpoints in any of those three functions that you ve defined overrides and see if you can narrow down where it s happening

2017641
zipinputstream	inputstream
for accessing a zipfile in your apk you d have to use something like resources.openrawresource r.raw.zip_file and then wrap the returned inputstream in a zipinputstream and do it the usual java way rather than with the android methods

2017667
contains	elements
each tab has several nested elements that contains checkbox input elements

2017667
selected	checkbox
i need to be able to selected all none of the the checkbox within the selecteded tab

2017667
selected	checkbox
i was thinking that i could get the elements of the selected tab and then iterate all the children of that elements looking for checkbox

2017679
getter	setter
you can also use a getter or setter types methods to get or set computable value much the way properties are used in other languages like c#

2017694
contains	elements
the xsd schema looks quite confusing - instead of sequences containss elementss of certain types the sequences contains references to a elements and this probably confuses xsd.exe all those look weird

2017711
double	int
yet in the getcursorqd you are using a double address of int

2019837
children	nodes
can i find one xml nodes with the most children with xpath

2019846
instances	private
you need to create a wrapper class that holds a reference to the default instances and a reference to a private instances initializer to 0

2019846
instances	private
as long as the private instances is null all getter functions forwarding to the default instances otherwis they forwarding to the private instances

2019846
instances	private
every setter mutators call forwarding to the private instances creating it .when it doesn t exist

2019846
instances	private
this would delay creation for the private instances to the first mutating call

2019851
attachment-fu	paperclip
i m not sure about attachment-fu but in paperclip you can stop thumbnail generator by returning false in before_post_process in attachment-fu perhaps you could do a similar thing in the process_attachment callback

2019854
reflection	runtime
reflection lets a program investigate its own classes at runtime

2019861
reflection	runtime
no reflection allows you to retrieve information about available classes and their members at runtime and to invoke their functionality even if they re not available at compile-time

this will output a recursive diff that ignore spaces with a unified context

2019939
web2py	django
edit django and web2py are very very similar

2019939
web2py	django
i think i prefer web2py because it does more for me that i don t have to do but from the pov of say java frameworks django and web2py may as well be the same thing

2019949
value	field
means the problem is with the securerandom class.i think the value is going as an int in a string value field .so database server is sending exception-handling

2019965
google-chrome	safari
use firebug or google-chrome safari inspector to explore the html content and pattern of interesting information

2019965
xhtml	tidy
for me i d better use tidy to convert to valid xhtml and then use xpath to extraction data instead of regex

2019972
boolean	int	primitive	boolean	primitive	int
if you want to checked if a generics object contains simple properties primitive like numbers int uint string boolean or complex properties subobject instances of some class that you might regards as children to that generics object you do the following

2019978
contains	set
i need to set the current user context on each request for both of these application which would contains userid ip application types etc etc

2019988

show	next
what is more irritating here tabs are not show in this case even .when navigating through next file tab or prev file tab

2020059
json	xml
otherwise we are developing a simple sinatra-based application to work like yahoo-pipes and return the result as a standardized xml json response

2020080
thickbox	jquery
thickbox or any other jquery or mootools based popup is javascript based and hence runs client side

2020091
fwrite	fread
i am writing some binary-data into a binary file through fwrite and once i am through with writing i am reading back the same data thorugh fread.while doing this i found that fwrite is taking less time to write whole data where as fread is taking more time to read all data

2020091
fwrite	fread
.so i just want to know is it fwrite always takes less time than fread or there is .some issue with my reading portion

2020093
value	field
first add a value field to your form field and change them to an arrays

2020108
associations	model
it allows you to limit the associated model data that is returned - it basically has the power of recursive 2 in being able to find deep associations data but has much better performance and is cleaner because it gives you only the data you need

2020112
http-delete	http-get
as of asp.net-asp.net-mvc 2 preview 1 release the following attributes are in the core asp.net-mvc framework - http-post http-get http-delete httpput

2020115
qwidget	qobject

2020182
linux	unix
if you are on unix linux give or take systemd v.4 network handles your data will eventually travel over sockets

2020186
value	field
you can t store a formatted value like that in an int field

2020205
post-increment	pre-increment
i typically pre-increment unless the semantics would change and post-increment is actually necessary

2020210
post-increment	pre-increment
if the types increment is a complex types an iterator and not a simple types the pre-increment is faster than the post-increment

2020213
retaincount	dealloc
if retaincount 1 self dealloc

2020220
value	field
isn t it a pain to work with a database in which a field may contains an arbitrary numbers of arbitrarily formatted value

2020259
post-increment	pre-increment
i recommend reading stl iterator and performance for some background info on the performance penalty on using post-increment for stl iterator short story it takes twice the time as the pre-increment

2020269
binary	hex	decimal	hex
in w-1252 the em dash maps to the decimal value 151 0x97 in hex or 10010111 in binary

2020270
getter	setter
i m eliding getter and setter and hibernate mapping etc. just assume they re the basic obvious case

one-to-many	entity
some other entity having a one-to-one or one-to-many mapping such as a pet field of a human class

2020270
subclassing	superclass
this is similar to the above in that it lets you identify a row in the superclass table but you don t know which subclassing table to inspect for further details

2020272
uniform	points
but since there are only a few points in one portion of the curve as i mentioned in the comment line fitting takes a hit unless you detection which points are spaced out and interpolation between them to manufacture a more uniform series and then use ransac to find two line to fit the l - a little convoluted but not impossible

2020273
protected	public
make it protected public and overrides it in a mock-like object

2020275
des	rsa
it definitely worked with c++ builder 5 and supports rsa md5 sha-1 des triple des rindjael and digital signing of messages

2020290
thread-sleep	synchronized
other idea is defining a synchronized object and using wait instead of thread-sleep

2020300
return-value	arguments
the only interesting information it gives you is arity though as opposed to java where it d also give you the types of the return-value and the arguments which of course isn t possible in ruby

2020302
packets	subnet
a client send out a packets to the broadcasting address for their subnet

2020302
ports	dmz
this required either dmz ports forwarding or upnp

2020302
ports	dmz
dmz will basically forwarding all incoming connections on all the ports to a given local ip

2020302
ports	dmz
if you want the clients to communication directly you can just proxy hosts discovery and then let either dmz manual ports forwarding or upnp do the rest

2020342
compatibility	platform
broad accessibly and avoid the platform compatibility nightmare we ve had here..

2020344

2020376
sql-server	oracle
i don t know about sql-server but in oracle you can verify this by checked the execution plan

2020396
security	owasp
even though it s more of a security specific set of guidelines owasp has pointers in this area and a good numbers of external references

2020409
callback	methods
i use callback in a few cases where i know it will only ever fire once and the callback is specific to a single methods call rather than to an object instances - for example as the return part of an async methods

2020434
shell	bash
similarly for shell scripting is it bash

2020449
postdata	request
i don t believe you can get a browser to postdata by redirecting it in the middle of a request

2020467
innodb	myisam
myisam will be quicker definitely because it s losing the acid-compliance that is inherent in innodb

2020476
python	perl
i am a newbe to python now migrating from perl

do an svnadmin dump which can be done only on the hosts

2020579
margins	padding
i believe the default css for lists in ie is a left margins of 40px whereas other browsers use padding as per a w3c suggestion

2020579
margins	padding
most likely you ve reset the margins but not the padding

2020594
32-bit	64bit
i m guessing the 64bit runtime default compile option on leopard does not collect object as aggressively as the 32-bit runtime .so your call to retaincount does not cause an error

2020604
code-completion	autocomplete
ps in addition to type-inference you might want to take a look at how program history can improve code-completion by romain robbes is explains how to further improve autocomplete in dynamic-languages with most-recently-used information and collaborative filtering

there is some kind of internet truth that you should use exists on sql-server and in on oracle but this might have been true .when dinosaurs ruled the planet but it doesn t apply anymore

2020628
fflush	gets
write performance is then going to fall of a cliff as your program gets blocked until enough data is fflush to the disk

2020634
fwrite	fread
and sometimes one of the many layer of abstraction between fread fwrite and the storage hardware will decide to go off into its own little world for no apparent reason

2020663
google-chrome	firefox
it works find for ie and firefox but google-chrome is fail in the line

2020666
click	mouse
i don t think this is possible without lots of handcoded stuff letting the canvas or whatever listen to mouse events and calculating yourself if the ellipse was click on

2020672
click	mouse
i m going to assume this is a question asking a way to listen to mouse click which are made on an ellipse draw on some swing component using graphics2d.draw

2020672

configurable-product	product
configurable-product instead of showing several variations of simpleproducts the user will see one product with options like color

2020777
swt	rcp
to determine if this is indeed the case i can recommend this useful article diagnosing handle leaks in swt rcp windows-applications which explains what resources are and suggests using process-explorer or dpus to locate leaks

2020791
show	next
i remember reading somewhere it s a good practice to redirect pages using get to show the next page after a .post request

you can do that by dumping out the revision 1 999 into a separate dump file and then using svn dumpfilter to get rid of everything from it then load up the empty revision followed by the revision you want

2021089
malloc	free
programmers should instead preempt call to the relevant functions by defining and export functions like malloc and free

2021089
realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free
the appropriate way to inject debugging malloc realloc free functions is to provide your own libs that export your debugging versioning of these functions and then defers itself to the real ones

callback	methods
to solve this find all the code that should only be execute .when the arrays is full and move it into your getjson callback methods

2021200
value	field

2021618
sql-server	ms-access
currently i am working on ms-access 2007 but my final implementation is sql-server sql-server 2008 being the latest versioning

2021629
google-chrome	safari
since google-chrome is built on webkit testing in safari will get you close but you really can t escape the need to actually fire it up and test

2021631
contains	set
you could perhaps feed the deque to a uiview that contains the text views as subviews with various offset set based on how many line your application is display at one time

2021654
value	field
in sharepoint every item is an splistitem and its field value and i don t use the words properties on purpose here are stored in sharepoint s content database

2021654
put	get
.so in case you put a .txt file in your sharepoint store you will not get any spfile.properties back

2021659
any	set
i don t get any exception-handling yet in testing i see that it does not use the caching for my queries that i have set cachingable true

2021665
object-reference	instances
in vb.net the following line gives an error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2021668
maven-plugin	m2e
for maven you just install the maven-plugin m2e and enable maven dependencies for a project

2021673
base-class	inherited
if this is the case my simplest recommendation would be to have some base-class that all product inherited from with a field representative_product_id

2021697
linked-list	nodes
the polynomialsnodes class is a class which is a linked-list where each nodes in the list represent the terms in a simple polynomials - i don t need to go into details

the market server enforces this requirement to ensure that users can seamlessly upgrade market applications .when new versioning are available

2021730
.when	ready
.when the launchdd has detected that the first program has ended set all references to the first program and maybe object retrieved from it to null to allow the jvm to reclaim the memory again and have it ready for the second launchd

2021746
getter	setter
in this question are the benefits of using getter and setter

2021748
subclassing	nsobject
unless you are not subclassing nsobject .

2021776
absolute-value	sqrt
since the absolute-value of a complex numbers in form of a+bj sqrt a 2+b 2 we get the distance while subtract one complex numbers from another and then apply the abs absolute function over it

2021784
export	csv
or as lpthnc has suggested you can export the data as csv which excel has no problem handling

2021794
hide	show
and s-tab will hide show all text

2021807
implements	abstract
the big deal imo is that interfaces are not tied to a specific inherited hierarchy as classes are and thus they are much more flexible than classes for implements abstract interfaces

2021832
ubuntu-server	gentoo	ubuntu-server	linux	ubuntu-server	ubuntu	ubuntu	linux	gentoo	linux	gentoo	ubuntu
if you have a linux environment that s a target for your code like say redhat or something then go with the desktop distribution that matches your target environment like say fedora for redhat gentoo for gentoo ubuntu for ubuntu-server etc.

2021852
hide	show
if you want to show and hide a form then you should be using the modeless dialog model

2021852
hide	show
form.show returns immediately you can show and hide this windows all you want and it will not be destroy until you explicit destroy it

2021860
arrays	loops
ok .so here s the problem i m reading the streaming from a fileupload control reading in chunks of n bytes and writing the arrays in a loops until i reach the streaming s end

2021876
ubuntu	linux
if you re new to linux i d suggest either ubuntu or fedora

2021888
javascript	dom
edit i think the reason this works is if it is samedomain including creating iframe in javascript otherwise the usual browser security blocks will prevent you from manipulating iframe dom

2021889
show	next
that s ok because in the next section i show you how to building this using the api

2021890
dfa	nfa
first this is not a question asking for the algorithm to convert a nfa to dfa

2021890
dfa	nfa
it s known and proved that the equivalent dfa of a nfa has at most 2 n states even though most of the time it will have more or less the same numbers of states as the nfa

2021890
dfa	nfa
which particular types of nfa will required an equivalent dfa to have 2 n states

2021892
sql-server	mysql
.so say your dal implementation is specific to sql-server but now you need mysql support

2021937
json	xml
more and more often i wish the world would have skipped xml altogether and move immediately to json

2021956
contains	any
.so any reference to the delegation made before will not contains the newly added delegation

2021984
required	checked
you should probably checked if there are any other jars required for esendex

2021985
sql-server	oracle
beyond the data-warehouse and views solutions provided in other answers which are good in some ways if you are willing to sacrifice some performance to get a good to the last second data but still want a normalize database you could use on oracle a materialize view with fast refresh on commit or in sql-server you could use clustered indexes for a view

2022006
dfa	nfa
if you take an nfa where each transitions is uniquely determined a deterministic nfa then it is nothing but a normals dfa

2022006
dfa	nfa
as for an nfa with n states for which the equivalent dfa has 2 n states think about exploiting non-determinism

2022006
dfa	nfa
this gives you a nfa with n+1 states 1 being the starting state where the dfa required 2 n +1 states

2022017
contains	elements
another thing to keep in mind is that if the sub forms contains elements with the same named they will clash

2022045
loading	gif
.when it s checked i want to show the loading gif postback grab the data and return

2022050
deployment	install
you have two options required the assembly to be install in the gac on the target machine in which case xcopy deployment is not possible or include all requiredd assemblies in the bin folder either by copying them in or writing a post-build scripting that does .so

2022060
response	timeout
often timeout are due to web response not being dispose

2022069

from what i understand your problem is not getting the file to downloading but rather finding an alternative to readfile fopen

2022186
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
if not i ve seldom seen a scenario in which a report tool was better than using something like charts director with a language like php perl python ruby etc

2022194
addition	modulo
the addition of 3 is .so that the next multiple of 4 becomes previous multiple of 4 which is produced by a modulo doable by masking since the divi.sor is a power of 2

2022254
python	c++
in python the c ternary-operator c++ example is available as syntactic-sugar

2022258
windows-vista	windows
this works equally in windows 7 and windows-vista

2022262
hash	md5
this is an md5 hash of the entire binary contents of the file

2022262
hash	md5
the points is that if two files have different md5 hash they are different

2022267
selected	checkbox
i have an asp.net-mvc 2 .app lication where i want to display a list of checkbox that a user can selected based on a list of recording in a database

2022267
selected	checkbox
is there a way to get the model populate with the selected checkbox given that the model can t have specific properties for each checkbox because the list is dynamic

2022267
textbox	button
.so in a simple viewmodel scenario if my model had a properties called properties1 then my view outputted a textbox for properties1 .when the form is posted via a submit button the asp.net-mvc framework will automatically populate a model with properties1 contains the text that was entered into the textbox and pass that model to the controllers action

2022275
subtraction	division	subtraction	addition	addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	addition
you would need to implements longhand addition subtraction multiplication division and whatever else you need

private constructor

2022288
hash	md5
on most unix operating systemd you can run md5 or md5sum on a file to get the hash for it

2022297
spring	seam
seam does not use spring they are competitors

2022305
parentheses	operators
has a higher precedence than the dereference operators .so you need to enclose the dereference operation in parentheses

2022309
put	get
to get the remainder of the line passed to the show subroutine i had to put the third variables in quotes

2022321
selected	checkbox
i am trying to renderinging a page with a checkbox that has been selected prior to the rendering

2022336
account	api
for connecting to facebook.i want to use this api in my java application to connect facebook.i am developing a desktop-application for this purpose.i have created account on facebook and registered as a developer

2022357
json	xml
think of json as a replacement for xml you wouldnt put a variables function in xml

2022368
session-storage	cookies
as far as i can tell from comparing trunk to the 0.96 .source the sessions are committed to a cookies the same way and auth stores the userid and backend the same way .so as long as the two apps use the same session-storage and are on the same domain it should work

2022369
malloc	free
according to the specifications malloc 0 will return either a null-pointers or a unique pointers that can be successfully passed to free

2022382
implements	extends
an abstract-class is essentially as mentioned an interface and contains just a templates of say functions that you must later on implements by inheriting extends the class

2022382
protected	public
once you extends that class the static methods does not come along with it that is by default unless the access modifiers is public protected

2022387
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
buffering overruns in flash firefox ie google-chrome safari opera words photoshop yahoo image uploader tool

2022410
realloc	malloc
it is possible to realloc a non null malloc 0 pointers

2022432
viewdidload	addsubview
it seems like it fails if done too early but especially with viewdidload i d expect it to work since i think that occurs after addsubview is called

2022458
decimal-point	numeric
i have to deal with a numeric value coming from a sql-server 2005 numeric column which i need to convert to a string with the caveat that the decimal-point has to be removed

2022480
dictionary	map
it sounds like you need another dictionary which does use it as the key - basically a bidirectional map

2022494
command-line	cmd
.so looks like while installation its not able to execute the command-line cmd though i do see cmd.exe sqlcmd.exe in the task manager

2022509
bazaar	git	version-control	git	version-control	bazaar
this is effectively a choice between subversion or one of the distribute version-control systemd git mercurial bazaar etc.

2022519
javascript	dom
from what i understand about javascript all elements must be loaded into dom for javascript to manipulate them .so the thumbnails all must load up on the page before the javascript kicks in

2022522
fwrite	fread
if the read write call are not types aware which for example fread and fwrite are not then they can t tell the difference between writing endian sensitive data and endian insensitive data

2022529
.when	ready
it is better just to have the .app delegation pass in the context .when it is good and ready preferably in the .applicationdidfinishlaunching methods

2022532
callback	methods
i try to use events and properties as part of the semantic model and use callback methods and field as part of the mechanism

2022532
callback	methods
if i had some mechanism like say i wanted to implements an inorder-walk tree traversal algorithm that walked the family-tree of giraffes and called a methods back on every one then i d say that this was clearly a mechanism and not part of the model and make it a callback rather than try to shoehorn that into the event model

2022548
attributes	properties
having the attributes apply to the backing variables of a properties or event without accessor

2022549
traversal	parent
obviously i could grab it via its index in its parent elements or by traversal the dom but both of those would mean that if the order of the field changed the greasemonkey scripting would stop working correctly because it would then be targeting the wrong elementss

2022551
.war	jar
i was considering including the .source code in my archive file ear jar .war .so we could see what the deployed application looks like

2022558
deployment	install
i was wondering why my clickonce deployment contains the same .dll in multiple folder that reside on the client once it is install

2022568
environment	execution
the environment class refers to the environment where the application is execution

2022570
value	field
value to the field or properties the

2022591
memory-management	out-of-memory
the os and memory-management unit need to know this because they can swap code out-of-memory by simply discarding it and reload it from the original disk file at least that s how windows does it

2022594
push	pull
i m using a gtksheet widget in pygtk to power my application s spreadsheet and it gives me an api to pull and push data out of cell

2022599
contains	elements
i ve got a parent div tag contains a series of span tags to positioning a series of elements inline with each other - to clarify the inline is critical and this is just a single row multiple sequential rows are a requirement

2022606
value	field
you need to know the named of the field inorder to retrieve the value anyways .so it s pretty much nonsense

2022614
authentication	login
can someone please points me in the right directions of where i need to look to not have it send the user to the login form but rather just shoot them a not authentication messages

2022619
average	median
i d like to do a simple report that average does a median and a mode for each dataset per class

2022619
average	median
.so each class will have an average a median and a mode

2022623
put	get
that should get it right - the xml document should be self-describing in terms of the encoding but i wouldn t put it past some webserver to advertise it in headers as having a different encoding which would confuse downloadstring

2022628
display	width
you need to change the fuchsia box to positioning relative to make include in the layout logic and add display block to force its width

2022655
tapestry	jsf	tapestry	wicket	wicket	jsf
if you are using a component-based framework like tapestry jsf or wicket there might be a more high-level way of handling this

2022692
contains	set
this will ensure that the field is set and that it does not contains a empty string

2022714
setinterval	settimeout
here is an article on settimeout and setinterval that may help you further

2022715
widget	button
presumably because the data pointers a gtkwindows and the pointers to the signals widget a gtkbutton are swapped the sole arguments it receives will be the windows pointers and the button pointers which will be passed after will silently be ignore

2022720
contains	set
i have some class c that contains map a set b where a and b has long id and mapped in tables a and b

2022727
display	height
.when i open the generator file in office the addresses are not display in full height

.net	wcf
my service are hosted in iis and are coded with wcf in c# .net 3.5 sp1

2022735
csv	xml
globally replacing them in the original csv file then re-generating the xml solved the problem

2022745
groovy	java
since you know it s supposed to be an exception-handling this works in java or groovy

2022788
contains	any
due to click the button you generator a postback and lv_chapters does not contains any items

2022793
versioning	upgrade
if we could upgrade our versioning of .net i would just return a but that s not going to be an option for some time yet

2022797
double	int
but usually .when it comes from sql-server you should not convert it first to a string than to int double but convert it directly from object in row column1 to needed value this will save you troubles handling cultures and improve performance a bit

2022798
adobe-illustrator	photoshop
tools used to create the design are usually adobe-illustrator photoshop or equivalent these will help create the images and can building basic layout

2022802
arrays	loops
they then loops through the arrays checked if the is a callback with substring

2022804
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
you need server-side scripting for this using a language such as perl php ruby python any .net language or java

2022822
background-color	display
in ie6 display block with a colored background-color extends that color to the far right side of the page

2022823
configuration	environment
your maven scripting could refer to environment variables that you could defined in the environment tab of your launchd configuration

2022846
openoffice.org	uno
i d like to save a textdocument created through openoffice.org uno to a file on the disk

2022850

how can i get the field value from table1 into the report header

2022863
dataadapter	oledb
dataadapter sql oledb etc

2022878
formatting	printing
for reasons relating to drivers and formatting i am using com automation with words to handle printing out the receipts

2022880
python	lua	python	java
i would suggest using java for your image manipulation or wrap it in lua or python or something

2022880
environment	execution
if you continue with c make sure you put restrict the cgi execution environment put it in a jail checked this .post out for some inspiration here is another one

2022889
queue	fifo
high-speed execution for this queue is very critical but .so is proper operation and i m not sure whether i can get away with implements a fifo without any explicit synchronized or if not where i have to disable interrupts

2022894
primitive	boolean
java - boolean primitive types - size

2022894
primitive	boolean
s boolean primitive size not defined

2022895
margins	padding
you could try using display inline-block will keep the elements inline .so that it doesn t take up a full line and have a line break but it will behave as a block elements with regards to padding margins and widths

2022915
getter	setter
i was having the problem of wanting a properties to have an internal getter and a protected setter as describe in this question and i thought i solved that by doing the following

2022915
getter	setter	protected	public
i would rather not make connection a public class while acces.sor needs to be public .so how can i get around this error while still maintaining an internal getter and a protected setter

2022938
authentication	logout
there is no authentication mode - rest is stateless you create a session you ask the server to give you resources using this sid as a parameter and on logout you drop or expire the session

2022942
protected	public
if setconnection is to be protected connection will have to be public

2022956
shell	bash
i want to get only the file named from the string as i read the text file line by line using a bash shell scripting

2022956
perl	awk	python	perl
i can t count on the user having perl python etc just the standards unix utils such as awk and sed

2022957
value	field
first of all using comma separated value in a field is problematic and you should consider storing them in a sepatate table instead

2022957
value	field
adding the comma before and after the field value makes sure that you can find the first and last value

2022963
variables	boolean
theoretically a boolean can be one bit in size but only .when we need many boolean we can use that called flags variables because we are bound to the words boundaries of any systemd

2022969
pixels	line
but the width of the line would still be only one device pixels

2022976
simulator	platform
even though certain components of the rim development platform are java-based such as the jde - other components such as the preverifier and device simulator are implements as native windows executable

2022976
parallels	bootcamp
basically the easiest way to do it is to install windows on your mac using bootcamp or parallels and run inside a real windows environment on your mac

2022978
.war	jar
it s structured contains and ejb .war and jar sub modules

2022983
double	int	boolean	int	boolean	double
the entity for the recording being deleted consists of just strings int boolean and double

2023000
boolean	int	primitive	boolean	primitive	int
java byte code does not have a datatype boolean therefore boolean primitive are converted to int 32-bit except boolean arrays where a boolean value is represented by a bit

2023004
openoffice.org	uno
openoffice.org -- uses uno

2023014
optgroup	selected
i have a selected list with optgroup

2023014
optgroup	selected
i want to add a handler for the drop down selected index change how do i tell which optgroup the selected item belongs to

2023017
xsd	xml
i have a fairly complex xml coming my way and i have the xsd for it

2023017
xsd	xml
could one say with certainty that if the xml file conforms to the xsd specifications that the xmlserializer will be able to read it in just fine

2023039
constructor	object
the exception-handling to this rules is .when you throw an exception-handling in an object constructor

2023044
web-services	api
a snippet from the google social graphing api page with the social graphing api developers can now utilize public connections their users have already created in other web-services

2023046
pkcs#12	pem
i am able to convert a pkcs#12 file to pem using pkcs#12_parse function which returns key and certificate given the passwd

2023050
attributes	properties
they would have all string properties and i d put the xval attributes on them

2023054
communication	messages
think of the wcf contracts soap messages as simply a messages that the service use to communication don t tightly tie that to object in your code

2023063
getter	setter
is there a way to use getter and setter for vectors

2023064
put	get
to get it to work as you expect put the alert inside the anonymous-function you are providing

2023104
arrays	loops
if you weren t deleting elements from the arrays inside loopss you could easily use a temporary variables by changing your while-loops to a foreach loops

2023109
value	field
i am working on a form spam protection class which essentially replace form field named with an encrypted value using mcrypt

2023109
value	field
essentially the hidden-field contains an arrays of all form field which were encrypted with their encrypted value

2023112
authentication	login
.so what you will end up doing is dropping and recreating the login and user with the different authentication methods

2023120
database-agnostic	oracle
this is mainly because i want to remain as database-agnostic as possible i have a sql db now but i might need to implements oracle or db2 later.

2023141
treeview	grid
only a few controls can bind directly to a dataset - those that are coded to analyze the relationships between the dataset tables and represent the various tables data in some kind of hiearchical display like a treeview or a hiearchical grid anything that required a simple list of items with one or two properties for each item can not be bound directly to a dataste it can only be bound to one of the contains datatables

2023164
updating	updates
updates it appears that i missed the points of the initial question .so i m updating my answer accordingly

2023164
.war	jar	maven-antrun-plugin	cobertura
unfortunately while cobertura can instrumentation an ear sar zip .war jar i don t think that the cobertura-maven-plugin supports this out-of-the-box and it may be a better option to use cobertura s ant task with the maven-antrun-plugin

2023164
packaging	building
tbh what you are trying to do is really not easy in terms of building lifecycle packaging report etc and is going to be a tough task because of the lack of support from the cobertura plugins

2023165
command-prompt	command-line
this exact command-line works as expected .when run from the vs2008 command-prompt

2023166
javascript	dom
operation aborted occurs in all versioning of ie because you re trying to modify a dom elements via javascript before that dom elements has finished loading

2023193
constructor	private
but it is sealed internal and has private constructor

2023195
versioning	upgrade
if we could upgrade our versioning of .net i would just return a tuples but that s not going to be an option for some time yet

2023206
defined	declare
the smartest thing to do in this situation is to declare assignment operators and copy constructor but not defined them

2023206
constructor	private
edit also if you make the constructor and-operator private you will get a compiler error

2023220
put	get
i want to get iframe application but on top of it would love to put tabs

2023226
constructor	private
you can t initializer classes with private constructor unless it s a nested-class

2023240
children	nodes
it gets me the string that s inside that nodes and if the nodes happens to not be of types text it goes looking for children and .when it finds a text nodes it returns that

2023265
constructor	private	constructor	object
if it s internal to an assembly that is not yours and the constructor is marked as private the author of the assembly is trying very hard to keep you from creating the object

2023286
getter	setter
for the blobs i tend to use the canonical private attributes + getter + setter since it abstracts the actual implementation from the client

2023286
protected	public
it wreaks havoc on the acces.sor public protected private .so it s best not to intersped it throughout the class

strangely this results in an insert behavior an additional m_attentionflag with the same field value is added to the database with an associated m_permissioncollection

2023431
protected	public
do prefer protected accessibility over public accessibility for virtual members

2023431

also scala isn t a dynamic-languages it s a static language just as java is

2023439
scala	java
one of the primary goals of scala was maximum interoperability with java

this means that scala compiles down to class files that look-and-feel just like java object and can be seamlessly used as java object by external libs and frameworks such as spring

2023448
udp	tcp
uhh jason tcp does not use udp

2023448
tcp-ip	tcp

you might do this after each read or after the whole file has been read if the data read does not contains any information on how to read further data - but there is no way in omitting the conversion

2023733
strtol	atoi
i ran a simple test and the performance of strtol seems to be comparable to atoi

2023742
pixels	line
.so the problem is that the path is at the exact pixels value but the stroke is divided in 2 line one left one right each 0 5 flash pixels wide or 2 actual pixels as we know them wide with 0.5 alpha i think moving the line + 0.5 will .solve the problem

2023759
value	field
however the types field is still with the same value for all rows

2023766
32-bit	64bit
i m calling functions from a 32-bit unmanaged on a 64bit systemd

2023766

2023828
python	ruby
al.so i know ruby has good libs to do all of what is mentioned in your .post as i m sure python al.so does .so there seems little advantage in using the two together

2023830
contains	set
for example if urls are like or all the time then you could store br fab and br err etc in a hashset or similar and then given an incoming url chop off the last part of it and query the set to see if it contains it

2023837
derived-class	base-class
i have a base-class with an attributes and i want to hide it in a derived-class

2023860
tablerow	layout
the display value table tablerow and table-cell basically perform exactly like html table tr and td but you are permitted to omit any of them as i do here using table-cell s directly within table s and the layout engine will do the sensible thing

2023863
contains	any
therefore it doesn t contains hibernate 3.5 which is beta as well as it hadn t containss spring 3 until it was release by the way you don t need to specify special spring repository for spring 3 any more - release is already in maven-central

2023870
jquery-tabs	sortable
is it possible using jquery-tabs sortable to pre-sort them by the current day

2023873

savepoints	rollback
option 1 is to create a savepoints before each insert and rollback to that safepoint if an insert fails

2023892
getter	setter
in a well-designed application getter and setter should be rare not automated

2023900
elementtree	xml.etree	celementtree	elementtree	celementtree	xml.etree
in some cases there are various modules which each implements a common api in my case the old pure-python elementtree celementtree lxml.etree and the built-in xml.etree

.when a user is looking at the catalog he should see a list of product unless there is a configurable-product then he should see it with a selected box for each variations

2023972
configurable-product	product
how do i structure the tables for product and configurable-product and how do i query the db .so i can page through the results

2023986
required	checked
it saves you the trouble of having to do a checked at the beginning of every methods thus eliminating the risk of forgetting to validation but required you to maintain two classes

2023991
identifier	temporary
if using the session is not your preferred solution which is probably wise the best possible solution would be to create your own temporary database tables or as others have mentioned add a temporary flag to your existing database tables and persistent the data there storing a single identifier in the session or in a cookies for later retrieval

2023995
mouseover	mouseout
you can do a mouseover and a mouseout event though to achieve the same effect

json	xml
i highly suggest switching to using xml or json or whatever and writing the file out that way

2024037
debian	linux
the .application and database mysql currently run on a debian linux box as such i ve decided that it would sense to use tomcat to run the web .app

2024063
selected	button
it doesn t benefit from integration though as the source viewer is unusable for stepping trying to selected a line by click on the left margins makes a button appear from nowhere which causes to program to continue to that line in the editor windows which shouldn t relate to debugging in the first place

2024068
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms you cannot escape the fact that framework s entry into your code comes from aspx pages

spring	jsf	jax-rs	jax-ws
i would go for eclipse of course spring or other inversion-of-control containers hibernate jpa + jax-rs or jax-ws for the server layer but not nessecarily jsf jsp for user-interface

2024109
json	xml
the service-layer returns incremental updates in the form of xml or json i swore not to mention the term ajax

2024109
flex	jsf
i don t know why i don t see jsf as a sofea soui approach as jsf and ajax go together well but for some reason jsf didn t win my enthusiasm as much as the above suggestions flex as a favorite

2024113
base-class	inherited
removing features inherited from a base-class violates the liskov substitution principles

2024136
adobe-reader	acrobat
problem might be in used viewer in linux i use document viewer or epdfviewer and output is much worse than in adobe-reader or acrobat which i use in windows.

2024202
javascript	dom
as soon as a dom elements is display to the user whatever functionality that is added to it by javascript is almost immediately available as well instead of waiting for the whole page to load

2024205
associations	model
is there a way to find out what associations a model has

2024240
google-chrome	safari

2024328
websphere	ibm
java ee is a specificationsifications with sub-specificationsificationss that as a whole defined a set of service that implementation such as glassfish or ibm s websphere should provide inorder to be in compliance with the specifications

2024339
getter	setter
you can still use a dp for the implementation by the way the implements directive is on the clr properties and does not interfere with the do not touch implementation of the getter and setter

2024342
hide	show
i m using jquery s slidetoggle to show hide divs

2024342
hide	show
i tried replacing href # with href but that disables the div show hide effect

2024376
rendering	redraw
i m actually subclassing a puzzlepiece uiview class where the puzzlepiece gets rendering but the redraw invoked now with setneedsdisplay since the drawing implementation takes place in the drawrect methods

2024393
mouseleave	mouseenter
in parts of our program we slider it out based on a mouseenter event and slider it back in on a mouseleave event however we are currently using a 3rd party libs s treeview for this which i have been tasked with replacing

2024393
mouseleave	mouseenter
the scrollbar does not fire mouseenter or mouseleave for the control and that makes using mouseenter mouseleave for sliding out the control unusable since the user can not use the scrollbar

2024405
contains	elements
however the connections list should contains at least one elements because the constructor append it there

2024421
calayer	uiview
then put each tile in a calayer and attach all the calayers to the uiview and move them around and rotate them

2024421
calayer	uiview
calayer is similar to uiview in principles but much lighter weight faster and simpler

2024427
keyboard	mouse
many of these methods involve simulating the keyboard .so by far the most important thing is to consider the accessibility of your site without using a mouse

2024450
ref	out
.when i make an assignment to an out or ref parameter is the value immediately assign to the reference provided by the caller or are the out and ref parameter value assign to the references .when the methods returns

2024460
ref	out
since ref and out parameters allow a methods to work with the actual references that the caller passed in all changes to those references are reflected immediately to the caller .when control is returned

2024460
ref	out
it is also important to note that out and ref are identical concepts at an il level - it is only the c# compiler that enforces the extra rules for out that required that a methods set its value prior to returning

2024462
swing	awt
learning java se is not only learning to develop desktop applications or applets which are basically just swing awt

2024462
swing	awt
you can however skip any swing awt chapters

2024465
calloc	malloc
also use calloc in this case not malloc as you are basically implements the former s functionality by multiplying the numbers of rooms by the size of the room

2024472
implements	extends
let s say i have a protocolcodecfactory which extends demuxingprotocolcodecfactory that has a loginrequestencoder which implements and was added via the factory s addmessageencoder methods

2024475
any	set
i thought there might be a way to set the assertwascalled methods to actually return something as .when stubbing a methods but...thanks for any pointers especially if it s simply a design flaw that should be addressed instead

2024490
arrays	map
if you want an arrays of pointsers that each points to your map arrays you need another layer of indirection

2024499
local-variables	eval
i have tried working up a solution to this but keeping hitting a brick wall as i don t know how to defined local-variables using eval in the scoping of the methods or using any other technique

2024503
associations	model
i have a club activerecord model which has a has_many associations to a member model

2024503
implements	super
this makes it hard to implements any kind of super admin who can manage the members in all of the clubs

2024506
background-color	transparency
i have a borderless windows whose transparency key and background-color make it completely transparency

2024509
highlight	selected
.so .when i press on category art all the other catergory s turn to a low opacity .so the selected category stay s highlight

2024550
updating	updates
you ll need to use javascript or ajax and have some variables that keeps tracking of the need to refresh your page this way you can send a request to updates the page to the server .when the formview needs updating

2024558
functional-programming	imperative
here you re doing some very imperative things like writing a statement rather than an expression as presumably the each methods returns no value and mutating state which one can only assume the methodss do as they also appear to return no value yet you re trying to pass them off as functional-programming by passing a collections of statements as a delegation

2024565
configuration	environment
have you tried using openexeconfiguration of the configurationmanager and explicit load the proper configuration for the appropriate environment instead of just using the default web-config

2024569
push	pull
you can t do this with sql alone you d need to pull the data from the database manipulate it and then push it back

2024632
database-migration	upgrade
the database is upgrade using a series of sql-scripts generator by redgate s comparison tool which is essentially the same as an up migration in the numerous database-migration frameworks that seem to have sprung up recently

2024644
python	php
i am hoping that python has a feature like php s set_time_limit function which can stop the scripting and give me a useful backtrace perhaps showing a sock.recv call which is frozen or an endless loops somewhere

2024650
value	field
i created an internal structure to hold my value and then a public methods to create and return such structure .so it is easy to use and faster to parsing though it has the overhead of allocation in stack a albeit small structure which the bit field .solution hasn t but alas

2024652
fontconfig	cairo
game use fontconfig 2.4.2-3 cairo 1.8.8 and pango 1.26.0 to rendering text

2024661
decimal	hex
numeric code has to be decimal not hex

2024671
.war	jar
i thought i had verified this but because i was initializer the client from inside a jar via webstart that was in itself packed in a .war i messed up the placement of the cxf runtime in my build-process

2024691
canvas	scale
it seems to make sense to code up a drawing in canvas to a fixed size ie 800x600 then scale it for specific location - but sizing occurs in 4 places 1 in the context definition ie ctx.width 800 2 with ctx.scale

2024701
subclassing	superclass
you re adding a new methods in a subclassing which does not exist in the superclass

2024701

2024711
ref	out
foo cannot use ref out nor any additional parameters

2024722
margins	padding
you could try using margins instead of padding

2024731
32-bit	64bit
you can either downgrade your python to run in 32-bit mode or try to get a 64bit psycopg2

2024764
contains	any
however apache will by default block any url contains 2f for security reasons

2024768
put	get
to put it simply none of the extensibility methods definitions get generator for any part of this one class

2024772
downgrade	upgrade
it s possible that some things that took hours to upgrade - such as creation of new indexes or addition of new columns - may only take seconds to downgrade drop

2024778
revision	svn
it revert to the svn revision you have as local copy

2024779
rollback	commit
delete the rollback journal this is the commit

2024781
sniffing	traffic
i m open to other options hopefully not sniffing traffic but maybe if someone can make it easy

2024797
highlight	selected
something i love is that if you hold down the alt key while highlight information you can selected columnar information and not just whole rows

2024806
jndi	jms
if it s anything like how jms clients work then you would need to provide the client with a jndi that refers to the address of the service provider

2024817
contains	any
this sql scripting will load the contents of the csv file into a database-table if any row contains errors it will be not insert but other rows will be

2024822
spaces	output
grab the second words out of each line of svn status s output assuming you have no spaces in your filenames... then pass those as arguments to svn revert

2024823
droppable	draggable
another thing which is there is no control over the draggable elements as they hover upon the droppable for example can i make the draggable not the droppable become small as they enter the droppable areas

2024859
linux	unix
unix and by extension linux tends to believe less in things called plugins and more in sets of tools that shared data stored in flat text files

2024876
jquery	dojo
.so no browserside javascript autocomplete yui jquery dojo

2024899
parentheses	operators
that happens because the grouping operators the parentheses can only evaluate expression

2024899
jquery-plugins	jquery
that pattern is heavily used by jquery-plugins since jquery can run in noconflict mode the global variables will not be created .so the jquery global object is passed as an arguments of this anonymous-function and inside of that function you can freely refer to it as the received arguments

2024906
latex	tex
latex tex has limited floating-point arithmetic capabilities whereas an external tool can use sophisticated algorithms to get the scaling better

2024907
configuration	environment
you could include all configuration for all environment in the web-config and prefix their key with the machine named of the appropriate environment

2024915
web-config	app-config
we experimented with the appsettings file configsource attributes in web-config app-config but those only work with relative paths not across project

2024928
compact-framework	.net
there is a system.windows.forms.webbrowser class in .net compact-framework 2.0

it would help if you provided loops code as well as the code that is execute in loops but assuming you have a standards for-loop iterator through an arrays the following code should work

2025849
assign	add
instead use element.onclick or preferably element.addeventlistener which allows you to add multiple functions to be called .when an event fires and thus this plays nicely with other code if two bits of code assign a function to say a click event in the form then the second assignment overrides the firstâ not good

2025879

2025883
python	c++	fortran	cython
if and .when some part proves to be a cpu bottleneck extractionion a stable core and using c code for it or c++ or fortran etc -- they all interface well to python is a reasonable first stab at optimization cython is also often a feasible alternative -- just as at a last resort one can delve down into platform-specific assembly to extraction even more performance gmp the main libs i wrap in gmpy does it .when warranted - the really good assembly parts are actually specific to particular cpu model not even platform

2025883
ubuntu	linux
hard to beat ubuntu though i personally use mostly macs that s because mac os x still offers a superior laptop experience and my personal machines are mostly laptops by now -- my workstation at work does run ubuntu -- though i m pretty sure other modern linux distros would be shoulder and shoulder with it

i guess you can try to play it and see if that raises any error - in fact there s no way to know the set of codecs necessary without opening the file

2026847
iframe	popup
i want the function to popup an iframe dialog box and wait for user integration and then submit the form via an ajax .post

2026854
aquamacs	emacs
if you decide to dive into that maybe aquamacs is something you d like its a mac-flavored emacs

2026867
dialog	pop-up
my guess is that whatever libs you re using to pop-up your dialog box will have some sort of callback that it will execute based on the user action instead

2026907
postgresql	oracle
alternatively since you don t seem to have decided on a dbms yet you might want to have a look at enterprise db based on postgresql which comes with tools for migrating from oracle

2026914
value	field
within this database are a numbers of unique field username and email-address i would also like to be able to initializer my object based upon these value

2026957
textmate	macvim
xcode eclipse macvim aquaemacs and textmate not free but worth the price if you like it are pretty standards

2026965
selected	checkbox
now i d like to add to the column header a checkbox which can be used to selected all and deselected all

2026966
scala	java
the following xml snippet is parsable using standards xml .lib tried with java and scala

2026976
arrays	loops
question #2 if there is a compelling reason to use .post to submit to my web proxy what s the best way to loops through the multidimensional associativity arrays in _.post inorder to building .postvars dynamically without having to hardcode any key value

2026989
expression	brackets
xpath functions may only be used in nodes tests the parts of the expression within square brackets but not in location step

2026997
class-design	base-class
the class-design for your domain model should be clear about or speak for itself why you can t set the properties directly in the base-class and why you can do .so in the derived one

2027013
jquery	.post
i m not sure about this but i think the jquery .post is like calling a web service and as such won t have a reference to your object

2027027
arrays	loops
i should think this is coming in from file which reads each line into an arrays .so trim each line first in a loops

2027039
groovy	java
it s based on groovy a jvm java language .so you can leverage off your java knowledge and allows web development in a ruby-on-rails fashion

2027043
scala	java
scala is a general purpose language which runs on the jvm .so you can use your existing java knowledge

2027047
assign	add
the easiest would probably be to add a static properties to your program class where you assign the closereason you get in the formclosed event

2027065
32-bit	64bit
the c++ long is 32-bit the c# long is 64bit isn t it

2027072
order	add
say you also want to display the last item the user order - fine just add a new properties to the viewmodel

2027087
databound	gridview
i already have a databound and a selected index changed event on this gridview

2027143
any	set
declaring some columns as foreign key will also make it easier to set up any relations

2027143
triggers	insert
if you also want to insert to the view then you ll need to create postgresql rules or triggers on the view that redirect the writes to the correct location

2027156
xcopy	cmd
was thinking vbscript or is it possible thorough dos cmd such as xcopy using switches

2027166
implements	extends
.so how could i go about implements .something as basic as the above example in javascript where there is a base-class or an interface and two classes extends from that base-class each with their own specific behavior

2027173
filtering	sorting
lots of neat sorting filtering and list manipulation functions

2027175
subtract	time
then subtract the time

2027241
configuration	environment
if we have some stand-alone tasks not related with the specific story configuration of new testing environment but changing the architecture also goes to this category we just add them as another story

2027246
defined	declare
while you can trust that php x.y.z has a defined set of functions and behavior be sure to test well before you declare something suitable to run on a different server

2027254
selected	button
on a button cmd i want to read the selected value from this dropdownlistfor which i will use to drive an ado query

2027256
linked-list	arrays
if you need sorting then a linked-list is not the best structure to use - you may be better of with an arrays

2027273
assign	add
if you want to assign the value 5 to a and to b at the same time you must add it on a separate line

2027290
checkbox	textbox	datepicker	checkbox
i m using a facebox to display a form inside a lightbox nothing too exciting just a couple of datepicker some textbox and a checkbox

2027294
put	get
al.so note that urls are of limited length .so you cannot put an arbitrary amount of text into a get parameter

2027300
python	c++
i am familiar with both c++ and to .some extent python but haven t done anything towards either evolution plugins or web-services connections in either .so i am looking for .some help

2027308
for-loop	loops
do you really mean to use i++ in loops body as well as the increment part of the for-loop

2027356
put	get
if i manually put in the url i get the following error

2027357
any	set
i know that to fix this the code should first be checked if urlreferrer is set to null however i am trying to find a way around this problem without having to change any source

2027365
value	field
the date field updates as expected .when switched between recording but changing the value of the date field causes the list entry in the combobox to change to system.data.datarowview

2027379
pygtk	gtk
though does gtk support this or is this a problem with onlt pygtk

2027382
textbox	button
i write the code for captcha from the website but .when i run the code it is working fine captcha image is coming but i place the textbox and a button but they are not visible only capctch image is display this is code checkout

2027382
textbox	button
but button and textbox is not visible .when page execute

2027387
linked-list	arrays
you could also do a quicksort rather easily in fact i ve heard some people suggest that quicksort makes more sense on a linked-list than on an arrays

2027461
boolean	int
if you cast a boolean value to an int then false gets 0 and true gets 1

2027472
32-bit	64bit
we have both 32-bit and 64bit building

2027474
any	set
.when process channels from the selection set ignore any that are already in the set

2027475
constructor	object
binding constructor string object string boolean datasourceupdatemode

2027501
default-value	default
note that my extension methods adds a default selectlistitem in at positioning index 0 with a default-value and selected true

2027501
contains	set
.when i put a breakpoints on the controllers to see what the model contains the list is order correctly and the correct option is set to selected

2027505
selected	button
using idea i would just go to project settings | modules | sources and selected the folder i wanted to exclude and click on the excluded button

2027512
contains	any
your application object task list whatever may not be large but if any of them contains a reference to one of those big object that will get pulled into your session too

2027516
callback	methods
in jquery user-interface what is the types contents of the user-interface object passed to the callback of alot of the event methods and how do i use it

2027518
databound	gridview	updatepanel	gridview
.so i ve got a databound gridview within a updatepanel

2027518
textchanged	textbox
however inorder to know which rows have been changed i have a textchanged event associated with each textbox but the event isn t being fired

2027521
value	field
the meta key stores a field named and the meta_value the value for that field

2027531
output	cat
there are lots of different ways to skins a cat you can use output parameters you can use executescalar you can use return value or you can use dummy recordset

2027533
configuration	logging
all that s required is the appropriate xml to set up the logging in the configuration file and

2027544
testng	junit
.so it seems that the problem was coming from testng jar requiring junit v3.8.1

2027573
uinavigationitem	uinavigationbar	background-color	display
i m wondering if i can change the background-color of just the prompt of the uinavigationbar to red while the rest of the navigation bar stays black .so i can use the prompt properties of the uinavigationitem to display status error messages as a one-liner

2027582
copy-constructor	temporary	copy-constructor	constructor	temporary	copy
here the a bool val constructor is used to construct the temporary value while default compiler generator copy-constructor is used to perform the copy of a to a

2027582
copy-constructor	constructor
the interesting and not obvious fact here is templates constructor is never used as a copy-constructor even if it looks like one

2027582
temporary	copy
here constructor is used first to construct the temporary value and then templates constructor is used to perform the copy

2027594
constructor	object
.so the compiler has to use your templates constructor to create a new object

2027602
scala	java
it s an open source tool that i ve found to integrated well in a java development ecosystem and has extra appeal if any of your team have been looking at ways to introduce scala

2027610
jquery	.post
upon carrying out a jquery form .post the function returns a url to a controllers action

2027610
internet-explorer	firefox
this still works fine in firefox however in internet-explorer the final call to the controllers action now comes from caching and returns therefore returns a full view rather than partials

2027621
duplicates	contains
normally duplicates rows is defined as two or more rows contains the exact same value for all columns

2027633
versioning	upgrade
start with some free express edition of visual-studio upgrade to a commercial versioning if we need the additional features

2027633
version-control	cvs
we are using cvs for version-control

2027639
debugging	exit
in addition to the systemd signals which you can list by doing trap -l you can use some special bash sigspecs err exit return and debugging

2027641
pixels	line
it has no bearing if you are drawing a line which happens to be draw near some other pixels which are of a certain colour - once you ve draw the rectangle the graphics object doesn t know about the rectangle it in effect only holds the pixels

2027709
target-platform	platform
you may be able to use stored-procedures as an abstraction layer for more complex operations and code a set of platform specific sprocs for each target-platform

2027718
entity	poco
that is why if we will return some poco entity it will be only its typename

2027719
dump	temp
to do this i d just whip up a query to dump the unique id s of the potential duplicates into a temp table then use this as an inner-join on your cursor again this would be a first step

2027719
any	set
assuming we ve already limited all of our field except for the timestamp down to a manageable set grab each subset in turn ones that match the remaining field since any duplicates would necessarily have all of their other field matched

2027758
basic	vba
if i call method1 from vba it s failing with arrays or userdefined types expected or function uses an automation types not supported in visual basic

2027768
desktop-application	client-server
i m using a desktop-application but with client-server separation .so the conclusion is that i will use one session per server request as the server side is where all the nhibernate magic happens

2027776
enumerator	any
if you want to expose a collections instead of an arrays to vba you just need to expose an enumerator and any other methods you want the vba code to be able to call add remove insert clear ...

2027788
revision	svn
is it possible to have the built ear files to contains svn revision in their filename something like project-1234.ear

2027790
pointers	stack
will it simply write a pointers into the parameter part of foo s stack frame

2027811
any	set
using setrequestheader is meant to set the http-request headers which are meta-data associated with any http-request

2027817
versioning	upgrade
if the only thing we know about our customers is that our current module works fine which versioning of c# may we upgrade to which will still work with the customers current runtime

2027820
meta-inf	jar
meta-inf spring-yourframework-init.xml is the path of your xml in your jar

2027842
subtract	time
assuming binary input and arbitrarily-large numberss like a bignum representation and n the numbers of bits of input your gcd required at most 2 n subtractions each of which required time o n to run over each digits of the numberss being subtract

2027842
subtraction	division
gcd can of course be done much faster if you use division rather than subtraction o n 2

2027842
addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	addition
2 in practice int input are often fixed-size 32-bit or whatever and operations on them such as addition multiplication and division are o 1 time

2027842
subtraction	division
again this is not ambiguous once you know what the terms of reference are but beware of incorrectly comparing the first analysis i gave of euclid s algorithm with division o n 2 against this analysis of the algorithm with subtraction o n

2027848
children	nodes
.when implements a heap structure we can store the data in an arrays such that the children of the nodes at positioning i are at positioning 2i and 2i+1

2027849
internet-explorer	firefox
the following code triggers an error in firefox but no alert is display in internet-explorer

2027857
environment	building
this will now updates globalinfo.cs only if the environment variables building_number is set which it is .when i building through teamcity

2027863
.net	wcf
stuff like wpf wcf and linq isn t likely to be available if your customer got stuck at the .net 2.0 release

2027872
google-chrome	safari
safari nor google-chrome doesn t respect some attributes

2027892
firefox	safari
updates didn t do anything in safari 4 apart from logging an error in firebug as per usual but show the alert in firefox 3.6 beta 5

2027895
python	php
it required about a minute to setup and install supports atomicity increment is incredibly fast has client libs for python and php and many other languages is durable snapshots journal replication

2027912
binary-search-tree	tree	children	tree
a binary-search-tree can be represented as an arrays of size n using the same representation structure as a heap children 2n and 2n+1 but insert an elements this way is a lot harder because unlike the heap constraint the binary-search-tree constraint required rotation to be performed to retrieve a balanced tree

2027914
constructor	object
copy initialization does not consider explicit constructor .when initializing the object

2027924
hidden	reset
would it not be easier and more maintainable to just create a new content-type perhaps even based on the old one then reset all items referencing the old content-type to the new then deprecated the old one by making it hidden

2027954
priority-queue	heap
the arrays based implementation is useful if you need a heap that is used as a priority-queue in graphing algorithms

2027971
configuration	logging
if there are enable the class in your logging configuration

2027974
base-class	inherited
that s defensible the dispose methods tends to be inherited from a base-class often a very obscure one

2027986
arrays	loops
otherwise you have to write a loops and use a byte arrays as buffering which can be a bit tricky to get exactly right

2027991
solaris	unix
i am working on solaris unix

2027992
expression	evaluation
another case would be to use or .when evaluation expression that perform some sort of side effect that must occur

2028000
msbuild-task	msbuild
add the fileupdate msbuild-task from the msbuild community extensions

2028000
teamcity	msbuild
in your msbuild file you can retrieve the build_number from teamcity by using the environment variables

2028034
spring	guice
spring guice pico comparison

2028034
spring	guice
another spring guice performance comparison

2028036
any	set
if you statically link any unusual libs and keep your set of supported distros to a minimum you should be ok

2028045
ssl-certificate	ssl
another solution would be to configure external authentication on tfs but it seems to required ssl an i don t have an ssl-certificate

2028054
python	java
if its in a language like python and no c binding or java or any other viewmodel based language then i think you can trust the viewmodel to make sure your application will work on the different linux distributions

2028068
null-terminated	c-strings
s is for a null-terminated arrays of 8bit unsigned characters normals c-strings

2028092
ado	jet
i have a delphi 2009 application that is attempting to open an ado connection dbgo to a microsoft access .mdb file in cmsharedenywrite mode using the jet 4.0 oledb provider

2028106
hide	show
i was thinking of rendering for each field both a static and an editable versioning and using javascript to hide and show them as needed

2028140
scala	java	haskell	scala
declarations always give the types in java unlike haskell or scala which are strongly typesd but have good types-inference .so you will never need to look any further than the variable-declaration

2028143
implements	extends
how do i extends zend_db .so i can implements and use the function above as instead of

2028162
double-quotes	single-quotes
the difference between single-quotes and double-quotes is that single-quotes mean that their contents should be taken literally while double-quotes mean that their contents should be interpreter

2028170
textbox	button	listbox	textbox
i have a pretty simple-form with a listbox a textbox and two button

2028170
selected	listbox
the user may chose to selected one or multiple items from the listbox

2028170
listbox	textbox
the textbox is used to write more details about the items in the listbox

2028170
selected	textbox	selected	listbox	listbox	textbox
i want to make it where if any items are selected from the listbox those contents are automatically copy-paste into the textbox field on-the-fly as they are selected

2028170
selected	button
i ve been able to make this happen on the button click event - just not on-the-fly as they are selected

2028181
32-bit	64bit
on 32-bit platform long is 8 bytes 64bit wide in .net and 4 bytes 32-bit wide in native-code

2028182
32-bit	64bit
as lucero pointed out a long in c++ is 32-bit while a long in c# is 64bit

2028182
32-bit	64bit
.so if you pass a 64bit value where the c function expects a 32-bit value the function reads the extra 32-bit as the second parameter which obviously results in a wrong address for the buffer.

2028188
prawnto	prawn
the problem is that although the prawnto plugins loads up the prawn gem no problem it can t .when running through passenger

2028198
click	mouse
given that information you may be able to simply edit perhaps with some assistance from a scripting you can write yourself the file s in question to do the configuration textually without a lot of mouse click

2028200
designated-initializer	initializer
the way i tend to do this kind of thing is for the designated-initializer to be the methods that takes the most parameters and the simpler initializer just send the more detailed -init messages

2028203
numeric	zero
the leading zero don t change the numeric value

2028220
version-control	git
motivation if a directory is under version-control say with git or hg or svn and the user duplicates that dir then i want to run a scripting that searches for the original dir and then makes a tag in version-control

2028220
version-control	git
expanded motivation the problem that i face is that that version-control software like git and hg in my opinion is too complicated namely because it is too disconnect from the filesystems and acts as sort of a shadow-filesystem

2028224
arrays	loops
this loops will continue to the length of the longest arrays and return null for where there are no matching elements in either of the arrayss

2028236
selected	button
what i am looking to do is set the background-color of the selected row in an nstableview .when a i button is click

2028236
selected	cell
i know that i can find the selected row with nstableview s selectedrow methods and set the background-color for a cell with setbackgroundcolor but what i don t know how to do is get from a nsinteger for the selected row to an nscell to set the background-color of

2028268
pyflakes	pylint
i don t need the tests to be run by pylint it might as well be pyflakes or other software feel free to suggest alternatives

2028270
beautifulsoup	lxml
is there an equivalent of beautifulsoup s tag.rendercontents methods in lxml

2028274
instance-variables	local-variables
like views they have access to instance-variables set in the controllers but not local-variables

2028297
json	xml
these have been implements in wcf using webservicehostfactory to expose json and xml endpoint and we now have a nice backend for easily adding new rest endpoint for other areas of the business after a process of factors out to patterns etc

2028308
reference-type	generics
additional info a c# reference-type can points to null nothing a value-type like int cannot points to null although a value-type can be used in the nullable generics reference-type

2028325
textbox	button
then this page would rendering a button under themea and a textbox under themeb

2028331
erlang	python
looks odd to me coming from an erlang python background

2028333
jquery	.post
- i had this .so .post which dealt with launchd a new page from the jquery section of .source page and at the end all worked fine except for this arguments capture

2028336
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work in ie but not firefox or google-chrome

2028344
sql-server	mysql
other than having to rely on mysql my company strives to be mainly sql-server

2028368
subclassing	inherited
and the generics classes do not follow the inherited of their templates types is not a subclassing of - they are completely different classes in c#

2028374
key-value	key
in this implementation the customer-extensible data was modeled as key-value pairs tied to the extensible tables within the model in which user-supplied metadata describe the key and their value constraints

2028388
tapestry	wicket
it s borrows more from tapestry but should have similarities to wicket

2028393
checkbox	textbox
set for the checkbox and textbox

2028396
bubble-sort	heapsort
as an example the sorting algorithms bubble-sort and heapsort has complexity o n 2 and o n log n respective

2028410
textbox	button
i am looking to add one of those up down arrow button that allows you to increment a textbox

2028422
tuples	any
as you ll see .when reading the docs of .sorted first arguments to the .sorted might be any iterable .so you might not need even create the tuples

2028423
rollback	commit
you have to issue a commit or rollback cmd even if you re in autocommit mode apparently before you can try again

2028443
google-chrome	safari
in fact the google-chrome team has mostly aimed for compatibility with safari most prominent webkit user at the time and refused features on those grounds

2028445
configuration	environment
ruby-on-rails install quickly and there is no database or webserver configuration required for your test environment

2028445
version-control	git
version-control git - git lets you learn the basic of version-control without needing to configure a git server

2028447
version-control	git
you will be better off doing your version-control at the command-line or just via tortoise which is lovely - i miss the shell integration now that i am using ubuntu and git

2028457
binary	hex
i wish to open a binary file to read the first byte of the file and finally to printing the hex value in string.format to stdout ie if the first byte is 03 hex i wish to printing out 0x03 for example

2028465
innodb	myisam
i just read a lot of stuff about myisam and innodb as i have to decide which types to use

2028474
getter	setter
in production use nothing will invoke the properties setter .so the first time the getter is called the controllers will call out to your inversion-of-control framework get an instances and store it

2028481
defined	declare
since there s no good way to defined it the standards declare that it is undefinedd and that portable programs simply must not use such construct

2028483
type-safety	generics
personally i would use a list as it is generally easier to use can add remove items no fixed length etc. and with generics there is type-safety just like an arrays

2028528
protected	public
don t think of the private protected public thing as if a programmer would ever need a methods

2028571
protected	public
then as needed you can make things protected or public

2028585
associations	model
i know that we can defined associations with other tables but in my case i need to give access to data that is no way related to the model who s view will be opened

2028592
assign	add
to be sure add wrapping div with explicit width say 1000 and all another assign also explicit width

2028626
ip-address	hostname
your best bet is probably to use the servers ip-address rather than hostname

2028629
protected	public
public and protected methods form the interface to your object public for developers using delegation to your class and protected for developers wishing to extends the functionality of your object by subclassing it

2028629
protected	public
both public and protected interfaces need careful thought especially if this is an api to be used by developers outside your control since changes to the interface can break programs that make assumptions about how the existing interface works

2028642
put	get
.when i navigate to the url and put in a non existent page i get the following error messages

2028645
bubble-sort	big-o
but the big-o is only good as long as you consider process performance of algorithms that are clearly defined and scoping such as a bubble-sort

2028670
conditional	operators
edit as someone else mentioned java in particular does have both short-circuiting and non-short-circuiting operators for boolean conditional

2028684
conditional	operators
if you come across a case in which you would like all expression to be evaluated regardless of previous failed conditional you can use the non-short-circuiting boolean operators

2028689
any	set
.so if the assembly is amd64 and you have any cpu set then the add reference set s the copy local true regardless

2028689
any	set
if you change it to false but you then reference this project from another that also has it s target set to any cpu or not x64 then the reference get s copy-paste through as well

2028697
dialog	pop-up
in .net .when calling messagebox.show ... that creates and show a pop-up dialog

2028701
jfreechart	swing
but you could save your data from matlab in a convenient format and then load it in swing using jfreechart

2028705
cosine	sine
a circle can be represented by the sine function in the x-axis and the cosine function in the y-axis

2028705
cosine	sine
change the radius multiplier to the sine and cosine functions if you want to increase the radius of the circle

2028705
cos	sin
if you want the points to spiral out instead of making a circle choose a numbers of points per circle revolution and replace num with that numbers in the sin cos functions

2028714
constructor	object
if you had your key-value pairs stored in some other types of map object then you could use the hashmap constructor but not with your arraylist

2028715
keyboard	mouse
what i see in your problem is you are dealing more with functional things like does this follow this mouse does this respond to keyboard cmd etc.

2028720
dependency-injection	inject
use dependency-injection di to inject both into your consuming service and let the di containers manage lifetimes of both

2028729
selected	checkbox
how can i instruct jqgrid to directly selected all checkbox .when i initializer it

2028739
png	gif
if matlab saves the plot as an image file say gif or png or something then you can use toolkit.getimage or createimage to read it in and then

2028739
drawimage	draw	paintcomponent	draw	paintcomponent	drawimage
draw it in a component s paintcomponent methods using drawimage

2028760
hashmap	arrays
maybe you would be able to avoid the iterator to insert the data into arrays doing it directly into the hashmap

2028762
gridview	listview
i ve tried to building something with listview and or gridview and i just can t seem to get the behavior i want

2028765
contains	any
the problem is that if any of these contains trailing spacess that spaces is not taken into account .when computing the formattedtext.width properties

2028775
contains	any
how can i checked if a string contains at any positioning one or more character s in regex

2028822
formatting	import
while it s still a wiki and thus has some limits on its formatting etc. it s quite good offer office import office viewers pdf export functionality and a whole slew of other features

2028829
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i am using the wcf json serialization to produce json for use as return data for the asp.net-mvc

2028844
user-stories	waterfall
no one likes to use the words fixed or signed-off to describe how a sprint works because it sounds too old school waterfall but agreement on sprint content such as a set of of user-stories from the product backlog is essentially the same thing for each sprint just done more often than in non-agile project

2028850
javadoc	doxygen
i d also suggest you look at my add-in atomineer pro documentation which makes the generator and updating of docxml doxygen qt or javadoc format comments much faster and easier within vs - an ideal complement to both doxygen and sandcastle

2028863
hashmap	arrays
if you happen to be able to control the order in which you insert the items into the arrays and you can do .so in .sorted order you may not need the hashmap after all

2028863
sorted	lookup	random-access	sorted
while the hash lookup will exhibit amortized constants time you can get lookup in o log n time with binary-search over a sorted random-access sequences like an arrays

2028863
lookup	any
this approach is most beneficial .when you building up the data only once and lookup entries frequently and don t do any subsequent adding or removing of entries

2028894
distance	polygons
the animation of the polygons consists in calculating the distance between each vertex and moving then to a positioning according to elapsedtime

2028902
contains	elements
my other idea was to have a 2 canvas solution where 1 canvas is used for the elements and one canvas who is positioning above the other contains all the grid line

2028924
configuration	environment
at first glance this seems like a purely subjective aesthetics issue but i d be interested to hear opinions especially any technical ones on whether environment variables or the registry is the preferred place for storing configuration data in a windows environment

2028937
administration	account
login to the machine with an account that is an administration domain cubeadmin on the cube

2028939
revision	svn
let maven query svn for the revision and than incorporate it in the earname

2028949
value	field
if i want to store binary-data hash value and they re always 128bytes long what field types should i use

2028954
configuration	environment
use environment variables .when you intend to be configure by other applications or by a technical user and that this configuration could be different you have 2 instances running at the same time with different settings

2028970
internet-explorer	firefox
from a user experience perspective you should be able to answer a lot of these questions by looking at an application like internet-explorer or firefox

2028975
configuration	logging
sounds like another logging configuration somewhere might be overrides yours

2028979
hazelcast	jgroups
i m a big fan of jgroups but i recently discovered hazelcast and will probably give it a try

2028983
implements	abstract
the wonderful thing about abstract repositories is that you can use decorator to implements such cross-cutting concerns as caching

2029025
environment	restart
.when using windows-services environment variabless can be a pain just changing the variables and then restart the service will not help

2029042
any	set
note that if you re storing character data then the standards character set of the operating systemd is used to convert the character to it s byte value .so you d have to take any cross-platform issues into consideration

2029058
selected	button
what s the cleanest way to make that button direct to edit id the ddl selected value

2029064
dynamic-binding	overrides
in the 1994-1997 time frame a lot of researchers figured out that object-orientation came at a cost due to dynamic-binding .when c++ functions are marked virtual and there may may not be children classes that overrides these functions

2029066
radio-button	button
i want to change my site language model from radio-button to auto dropdown button using loops

2029066
radio-button	button
and the radio-button above i want to change drop down button i looking your help please

2029067
output	mode
currently output is in append mode .so if you use the same file it will just add to the end you could change the a to a w if you wanted to start the file fresh each time

2029099
constructor	object
if you initializer an object you are reserving memory for an struct with all its field and a reference to the class it s implements plus all memory reserved by the constructor other object arrays etc...

2029106
g++	gcc
including that header with gcc g++ 7.2.0 generator a warning

2029107
updating	updates
live updating features like intellisense will updates automatically between project to project references as you are changing the apis

2029110
radio	click
otherwise you can use javascript to detection .when the radio button are click and then change the drop down appropriately

2029111
ref	out
first off the correct way to think of out ref parameters is that they are alias for variables

2029112
groovy	java
the reserved-words of groovy are all those reserved by java plus a few others

2029123
xlsx	xls
if you cannot get this to work with oledb have you considered a 3rd party xls xlsx libs like spreadsheetgear for .net

2029142
.when	ready
then in the loginviewcontroller .when i m ready to dismiss the view to show your tabcontroller say i do

2029153
boolean	int
to make it close to perfect it involves a couple of functions as it also should support int boolean and null value but you can take a look at the source code on the database and database_mysql classes on naturephp

2029155
compact-framework	.net
it is a free ms-pl object persistent framework compatable with the .net compact-framework

2029167
updating	updates
updating a scalar properties works just fine but i can t updates a new navigation properties as the avove code succeeds without any changes

2029169
data-structures	tree
essentially the data-structures more than likely a branching tree as it s easy to represent debugging etc. would be crafted by a programmer as would the nodes that represent the object in scripting

2029170
triggers	insert
i am having a problem with a triggers in sql-server 2005 i have created the triggers and i have tested it insert rows manually and it works fine that way however i call a stored procedure from a c# web application and the triggerss does not get fired .so i took same data insert from the web application deleted that row and reinsert it manually and the triggers worked that way again but it does not .when called from the stored procedure from the web application

2029173
embedded-fonts	fonts
this webpage has a great reference for how to work with the 14 embedded-fonts in itextsharp as well as how to embed and use any fonts of your choosing

2029188
factors	numeric
i believe i ve nailed the problem down to the fact that these two search algorithms do not factors in the relevance of punctuation numeric

2029195
calayer	uiview
the most powerful of these are imho uiview s transform properties which takes cgaffinetransform struct as input or calayer s transform properties which takes catransform3d struct

2029197
union-all	union
by using a union and not a union-all you will get the distinct time stamps

2029211
deployment	migrating
i am considering migrating to osgi to simplify deployment and updates

2029217
selected	button
control-drag in interface-builder from your button to the file s owner icons in your xib file and selected the dooooit methods there

2029219
compact-framework	.net
this solution might not support the latest versioning of the .net compact-framework as fast as it is release on windows-mobile but it certainly provides some c# support for n95

2029236
implements	extends
1 if i have implements an interface with a methods in a superclass where im declaring that methods and then i extends that superclass in another class

2029236
contains	any
it didn t contains any methods from the instances

2029241
attributes	properties
unfortunately this means some modifications to attributess in ie that are actually only stored as properties will not be copy-paste such as the the named attributes on an input

2029244
superclass	inherited
right it will inherited the implementation of the methods from the superclass

2029248
implements	abstract
if the superclass is abstract then the child class either needs to implements it or to be declare abstract as well

2029248
implements	abstract
declare the class abstract if you don t want to implements it

2029249
versioning	upgrade
in the last week some of our clients have upgrade their systemd to windows 7 x64 bits versioning and start to fail .when they printing text via com to the printinger

2029263
protected	public
it the ivars are marked as public or protected yes they will be exactly the same

2029267
selected	button
i am trying to convert selected boxes to radio button on-the-fly using jquery and i m not sure the best way

2029281
if-statement	arrays
2 with all the components and arrays in my uipickerview the only way i was able to get my data from the arrays to properly display .when a certain combinations of pickerwheels is selected was to write a lot of if and else if-statement

2029284
selection-sort	bubble-sort
you can sort the list either through selection-sort or bubble-sort

2029294
selected	checkbox	value	field
i have a form field checkbox and am unable to pass the boolean value even though it is selected

2029305
user-interface	splash-screen
the user-interface guser-interfacedelines say you shouldn t have a splash-screen - you should present a dummy versioning of the view the user will see .when the application loads without any data in it

2029320
coffeescript	javascript
also if you wanna save yourself some typing you might have a look at coffeescript which is more or less a sweetened versioning of javascript

2029328
echo	die
you can also use die instead of echo it will work

2029351
ruby	php
this applies to other languages like ruby php et al

2029356
widget	button
that s where the widget toolkits come in you would have to pick a toolkit platform that can offer you button images load and save the image files maybe some specialzed widget you can use to create your color swatches etc

2029356
click	mouse
if you want a very simple thing just for the taste of i did it - you can use pygame you have to do all the drawing on the windows including text - but have straighter access to pixels colors mouse click and coordinates than with gtk or qt in a sense it would be a lot less of overhead for you to learn in terms of api s and internal working

2029363
put	get
if you want to get rid of it you could just remove the reference in ruby-on-rails init.rb of the plugins or put an if around to checked if the constants already exists

2029368
abstract-class	superclass
as mentioned in other answer by balusc if your superclass tells that it implements an interface and doesn t provide implementation of methods s in the interface then you have to mark the superclass as an abstract-class

2029368
abstract-class	superclass
but you cannot initializer the superclass since it is an abstract-class

2029424
protected	public
this is why i find it much better practise to default all methods and properties to protected visibility and only mark those methods not properties though supposed to allow integration with my class from another class or scripting as public but only a few things private

2029428
punctuation	words
the article include punctuation upper and lower case words numbers and abbreviations

2029466
nsstringencoding	nsstring	nsstringencoding	nserror
id stringwithcontentsoffile nsstring path encoding nsstringencoding enc error nserror error

2029478
triggers	insert
instead of triggers use the direct insert statement from your web application

2029481
profiling	trace
use the profiling to recording a standards set of queries over the course of a couple of hours and use that trace file in the tuning wizard to identify possible redundant indexes

2029485
value	field
then you must understand the range of legal value for each field and write data validation procedure for each one in the form of check-constraints stored-procedure regexes or whatever else makes sense

2029496
automapper	nhibernate
it s not a restrictions imposed by fluent or its automapper but by nhibernate itself

2029505
deep-copy	object
if you want to pass these object by value you need to do a deep-copy yourself in which you allocate a new matrix and copy all of the value from the original matrix into it

2029505
copy-constructor	deep-copy
as drew points out in c++ the preferred way to implements that deep-copy is via a copy-constructor

2029505
deep-copy	object	copy-constructor	deep-copy
a copy-constructor allows you to perform your deep-copy any time your object is pass-by-value without having to explicit copy the object yourself

2029506
hide	show
i want to dynamically hide show controls in an activity based on a button touch-event .when the user presses the details button i want to show more controls in the same activity

2029514
webforms	asp.net
i ve been manually adding the following line every time i create a new user-controls web form in one of my asp.net webforms project

2029520
revision	svn
since the oldest branch and tag refers to revision 10 it means that every svn fetch reads the entire repository history from revision 10 and forwarding which can takes hours on the slow connection

2029520
revision	svn
i usually look at git log -1 on the branch i m at and gets the svn revision from the comment .so i can do git-svn fetch -r7915 head or similar

2029529
any	set
i could maybe improve it by adding a hidden-field to the form that gets set whenever any field on a row gets modified

2029540
any	set
find any expression consisting of any char in the set 0-9a-fa-f followed by another char in the same set

2029562
savepoints	rollback
another approach is using savepointss being able to rollback and discard everything past that savepoints but i like prefer the first approach

2029570
constructor	object
but since in java object are always on the heap and have user-defined constructor object can t be initializer with anything analogous to c++ s static initialization which is done by the runtime before any user code is execute

2029572
oracle-xe	oracle
how can i make oracle procedure with oracle-xe how can i checked if input is valid or not

2029582
pixels	line
if you are going to go down this route make sure to have a look into guidelineet s for positioning your guide line more details here since you ll probably want to have your guide line snap to the device s pixels .so that they draw sharply

2029588
fwrite	fopen	fwrite	fread	fwrite	fclose	fclose	fopen	fclose	fread	fopen	fread
if using ios binary doesn t help you would need to use the c function fopen fread fwrite and fclose of stdio instead or as another user suggests the boost serilization libs

2029596
postgresql	mysql
with a bit of luck you ll have mysql mysqli pdo_mysql and postgresql pdo_postgresql already install -- which means it ll be ok from the php side you ll just have to use the right functions classes to connect to your postgresql and or mysql servers

2029598
instances	private
if you re going to be running a large numbers of ec2 instances then it will be less effort to have them sync themselves from a central location ie you sync to private bucket app-servers sync from that bucket

2029605
pthreads	openmp
for example relying on openmp or on pthreads to keep it compatible with at least all unix-like operating systemd

2029606
python	c++
i m an intermediate c++ programmer just starting out on python .post some online tuts etc i can do some basic pythoneering but was wondering if there are good places i can look online for simple ish --pref console based-- code that i can learn from ideally with some sort of commentary

2029637
sniffing	packets
after sniffing the packets that were being sent it turns out that the problem was caused by a 5 minute timeout in the network that was closing what it thought was a stale connection

2029665
oxygene	delphi
prism is a replacement for delphi .net - it has been developed by remobjects and its original named were oxygene and google-chrome

2029686
malloc	free
.so you have to overload delete to use free and the normals new to use malloc

2029686
malloc	free
in practice though all implementation use malloc free themselves internally .so even if you don t do it most likely you won t run into any problems except language lawyers yelling at you

2029732
photoshop	layer
is there a way in photoshop i m using cs4 to copy the current view of a document including many different layer to another application such as indesign without having to flatten the image

2029746
dictionary	arrays
you can then sort by the song title by calling -keyssortedbyvalueusingselector on the dictionary which returns an arrays of media items

2029781
environment	execution
it can create new scripting blocks to perform any unsafe or unreliable action that it could accomplish were it operating in the same execution environment

2029781
google-chrome	firefox
ie doesn t offer a feature to do what you re asking and i m not convinced that the firefox and google-chrome features work the way that you expect that they do

2029803
perl	ruby
your best bets in either case would be perl and ruby

2029803
perl	ruby
the business justification for perl or ruby is low cost free tools and greatly reduced development time

2029803
perl	c++	perl	ruby
if you can go from code change to test in 10 minutes with c++ you can usually do the same with perl ruby in about a minute

2029814
value	field
it is obvious that if one can remember the old field value at the start of model instances s lifetime __init__ there should be no need to retrieve a copy of the model from the database

2029825
windows-mobile	symbian
if you are fine with just covering a large range of phones you should include symbian s60 s40 windows-mobile blackberry and android

2029826
buildout	plone
however it is a production site and .so i can t easily take it down to upgrade plone to 3.2+ inorder to use buildout

2029826
directory	folder
what i thought i could do is add this collective folder to plone directory zope .lib python as a python-module

2029827
.when	ready
.when you are ready to open up your application for everyone just remove the view and the three lines-of-code in your global-asax file

2029833
.when	ready
just decorator your controllers with it under beta and delete them .when you re ready to go

2029836
.net	wcf
note we are a .net team using c#3.5 wcf msmq and sql 2005

2029843
web-config	app-config
i m actually wondering why you d have a send email methods at all given that the system.net.mail namedspace handles just about every case and is configurable via the app-config web-config file .so you don t need to pass it a server named or ports

2029843
webforms	asp.net
for asp.net webforms i actually took the one jeff atwood wrote years ago ported it to c# and made a few changes like ignoring 404 errors

2029867
perl	ruby
cant use perl or ruby needs to be regular shell or mysql call

2029878
directory	folder
updates for what it s worth i found the actual class files in the configuration component source folder on my hard-drive but adding that to the classpath as well as the components directory did no good

2029904
virtual-machine	vmware
thanks to a professor i knew at illinois you can now do this in a vmware virtual-machine

2029907
installation	environment
if you are running windows i assume .so because of irb.bat you might want try to add the path to your ruby installation into the windows path environment variables

2029918
arrays	loops
given that there is a fixed amount of variables you can building an arrays of them manually and loops through it

2029936
radio-button	selected
basically i just want the radiobuttonlist without the radio-button on it i will code the rbl .so that selected items have a different background-color and make it look more professional the radio-buttons themselves i want to be able to get rid of in terms of apperance.

2029942
macros	let
you could also use a callback architecture link-time dependency or macros to let your caller tell you how to synchronized

2029948
getter	setter
see the little manual of api-design which describe the benefits of classes having minimal constructor and lots of getter setter over the alternative of using constructor methods having many parameters

2029965
for-loop	arrays
at that points you could run a for-loop on the arrays and get your properties inorder

2029970
radio-button	checkbox
accessible custom designed checkbox and radio-button input styled with css and a dash of jquery

2029987
windows-xp	windows
i m using windows 7 but the problem is also under windows-xp

2029991
dictionary	arrays
i figure an arrays will take less memory i don t really need a key + value although a dictionary might lookup faster

2029998
linux	osx
as many others here i do not like objective-c and am pretty much fed-up with having to learn different environment frameworks for each platform i write for i use linux and osx daily windows on occasion

2030005
uitextview	uiwebview
having more than one uitexfields in the cell or combinations of uitextfield and uitextview or uiwebview in the cell

2030005
uitextview	uiwebview
tapping between uitextfield and uitextview or uiwebview results in unpredictable scroll positioning either the click uitextfield jumps out of view or covered by the keybaord

2030010
windows-mobile	windows-ce
i have a .net application that is being targeted to run on windows-mobile 5 and windows-ce .net 4.2 and there are some minor difference between how forms display that i m trying to converge

2030039
32-bit	64bit
using perl how can i determine whether my program is running on 32-bit windows or 64bit windows

2030039
32-bit	64bit
checked the pe_header of some windows file eg c windows explorer.exe - maybe i can use the details in how can i test a windows dll to determine if it is 32-bit or 64bit

2030039
64bit	x86
checked for the existence of c program files x86 - if it exists then it is a 64bit os

2030049
any	set
perhaps for any of you reading this can try to set the background to none in the input in the css

2030056
keyboard	mouse
i m fine using the managedwinapi wrapper around p invoke working in c# to recording mouse and keyboard activity which works but i think that inorder to make the recordinging more useful i need to know more about what happens .when the user starts an application

2030056
click	mouse
.so supposing the user started my recordinging application then went over to the start menu and click on paint i would like to be able to recording paint.exe starting up as an event or if they click a shortcut that passed .some parameters it would be the value of that shortcut including the parameters because if i want to play back the recordinging on a different machine menu items may be in different places .so the mouse activity could be deceptive

2030092
any	set
if set to true any caching data used

2030093
value	field
.when you click on the capacity tab and enter value in each of the three field enter double or triple digits to activate the paginator and then click on the show capacity charts it brings up another windows with data

2030107
triggers	insert
insert rollback would create extra gaps in the identity-column or launchd triggers

2030129
dictionary	arrays
if i had a similar problem my first instinct would be to wrap them up in some sort of collections ivar ns mutable arrays dictionary set and then you can have a normals getter-setter on it and just do

2030171
callback	methods
return value of asynchronous methods are handled in callback methods

2030171
callback	methods
you would place the call to the second methods in the callback of the first one if you need to execute them in sequential order

2030172
show	next
.so if i have 3 elementss and my available height is 100 pixels and jquery returns a height of 35 pixels for each elements i d show the first two and then add the last to a queue to be show .when the user click next

2030176
put	get
dynamic-linking means some of the required code does not get put into the executable and will be found at runtime

2030182
postback	ajax
of course you d need to checked this somehow either by using a hidden ajax postback which fires an event or something similiar

2030198
python	tcl
i know that tcl python and guile are designed to be embedded in this fashion

2030198
python	tcl	scheme	tcl
i d personally recommend python since scheme guile is a little esoteric and tcl seems to be losing ground generally

2030200
random-seed	generator
the best salt are chosen from a cryptography pseudo-random numbers generator initializer with a random-seed

2030204
32-bit	64bit
you can t load 64bit dll in a 32-bit process

2030206
rijndaelmanaged	aes
rijndaelmanaged as aes you need to

2030226
triggers	insert
there s a triggers on the table after insert that increment all the recordingorder numbers for that key by 1 .so the recording i just insert becomes 1 and all others are increased by 1

2030228
contains	any
since you asked about alternatives another possibility is to use adorner and adornerlayer with any of the solutions above rather than stack your canvas using eg a grid or contains canvas

2030229
distinct-values	lookup
the points of salting is to make it .so two chronologically distinct-values hash differ and by .so doing break pre-calculated lookup tables

2030251
post-increment	pre-increment
a simple example of such a tip use pre-increment ++i rather than post-increment i++ .when possible

2030260
hide	show
on postback you could hide the fileupload control and show a literals that display the value of the file

2030262
any	set
why not just set permissions to hide those secret items from the consultants and branch as you would any other time

2030271
inspector	webkit
google-chrome has webkit web development inspector for web debugging

2030271
mongodb	mysql
mysql sqlite you might want to look into mongodb

2030280
processor	cpu
note that it incorrectly identifies my laptop s cpu as being 64bit see intelâ coreâ duo processor t2300 mdash

2030282
put	get
if you make the combinations of those two a unique and put retry logic in your client code on the rare chance you get a race conditional you should have no problems

2030282
triggers	insert
the idea of firing a triggers to modify lots of recording .when insert one is a bad idea since it becomes more and more expensive as recording get added

2030318
xml-documentation	stylecop
stylecop actually provides rules for xml-documentation as well

2030334
tcl	lua
if you want true scripting there are tons of tools out there to add in scripting to applications with languages like lua tcl rexx etc

2030339
value	field
the dragover events come frequently .so save the value of datetime.now in a field each time you call lineup or linedown

2030354
firefox	safari
firefox seamonkey and safari - see this table

2030357
firefox	safari
silverlight 3 supports firefox ie safari on the mac

2030358
firefox	safari
operating systemd | ie8 | ie7 | ie6 | firefox 2 3 | safari 3 | safari 4

2030358
freebsd	linux	solaris	linux	solaris	freebsd
for linux freebsd solaris see novell s moonlight

2030358
32-bit	64bit
moonlight should work on any modern 32-bit and 64bit linux distributions under firefox 2.0 3.0 and 3.5

2030358
ubuntu	linux	opensuse	ubuntu	enterprise	platform
we make sure that the plugins available from this site works on the following platform suse linux enterprise desktop 11 opensuse 11.x ubuntu 9.10 and fedora 12

instances	private
inaccessible due to its protection level means you re trying to reference an item outside its intended scoping ie creating an instances of a private class from another unrelated class

2030408
defined	declare
don t declare actually defined object variables before their use initialization as in c

2030408
constructor	object
this necessitates that the constructor and assigment operators functions will run and for complex object could be costly

2030408
post-increment	pre-increment
prefer pre-increment to post-increment

2030409
subtract	formula
second if you want to have a negative-numbers for .when you work under an hour you can use a conditional that says that .when minutes worked is 59 to use the formula but otherwise to subtract 60 from the numbers of minutes difference from 60 mod

2030412
deduplication	large-data
such an data deduplication algorithm is not as exact as xdelta but it is faster and more scalability for large-data sets

2030419
subclassing	superclass
imagine that a superclass a has two subclassing b and c

2030419
subclassing	inherited
we say that the inherited relationship between a b and c is disjoint .when a instances cannot be at the same time b instances and c instances instances of a supertype only appear at most in a subclassing

2030428
ironpython	ironruby
if we are to make a new versioning of our scripting engine we would now be looking forwarding to using the new dlr-enabled language ironpython and ironruby

vb.net	vb6
.so i ran reg32 u on the vb6 dlls and that seemed to fix the vb.net issue

2030492
vb.net	vb6
not exactly sure why this fixed it since i was not referencing the vb6 dlls i m guessing something to do with ambiguous entries in the registry confusing the vb.net project

2030500
oxygene	delphi
oxygene fka delphi-prism replace delphi for .net but it is not a new versioning of it

2030500
silverlight	wpf
instead it focuses completely on supporting the .net gui frameworks wpf silverlight prism winforms asp.net etc

2030500
delphi-prism	vcl
you can create you pure business-logic as code compatible between delphi native and delphi-prism but all the gui and io code anything that makes use of the vcl or rtl will be specialized

2030503
pointers	stack
in many modern systemd allocation an object from the heap uses exactly the same instructions as allocation from stack test and increment the heap pointers

2030513
coalesce	isnull
isnull can easily give different results as coalesce on sql-server because of data types precedence as per my answer comments here

2030520

2030582
constructor	object
note that i m not saying it is the constructor of the user-controls that is slow - it could be that the user-controls initializer many sub-object .when it is databound or that it include object that are slow or complex a subobject loads a file or many other possible causes

2030591

2030620
put	get
as implied this particular project required me to use get put and .post request

2030650
contains	elements
the spring-roo shell is based on jline but contains a large numbers of design elements oriented around usability that are not present in jline

2030684
double	int
i assume i should not use quotes around any of the int float double and real

2030685
getter	setter
to take a simple example .when you add or remove a field roo will updates the tostring getter setter jsp pages etc for you automatically

2030698
endpoint	uri
.when a wcf 3.5 rest endpoint via webservicehost handles a uri request does it invoke the associated procedure asynchronously

malloc	free
first to answer the title no dynamically allocated memory with new malloc etc is not free .when function exit

2030754
memcheck	valgrind
i d suggest having a test run using valgrind memcheck and helgrind tools in that order

2030758
protected	public
oncreate is public not protected

2030773
firefox	opera
ideally i would also want to keep and shared settings and files for other applications firefox add-on opera keyboard shortcuts mail and chat account eclipse settings etc but that s probably another issue

2030773
virtualbox	vmware
is virtualbox or vmware a solution

2030774

the methods get head put

2030797
environment	restart
restart eclipse .so that it is aware of the new environment

2030797

most java tools will now be able to find your java installation either by using the java_home environment variables or by looking for java.exe javaw.exe in the path environment variables

2030814
perl	ruby	python	java	python	ruby	python	perl
i know that python ruby perl are all open source but is java really an open source programming language

2030829
put	get
to do this i m running through the table looking for the event divs which sit inside td and then get the start and duration and put that into a seperate div adding them up as i go .so i ll end up with 9 00 5 events 10 00 3 events.

2030835
spring	grails
we have both grails and spring-roo because we deeply care about developer productivity and unquestionably both of these tools deliver a serious boost to what teams can achieve on top of spring

i m working with a language that has explicit parentheses syntax like lisp but has keyword that are only reserved against the left paren

2030850
nsmutablearray	plist	nskeyedarchiver	plist	nskeyedarchiver	nsmutablearray
it seems that store more than around 230000 bytes via an nsmutablearray will cause the nskeyedarchiver to create a broken plist file

2030858
virtual-machine	vmware
your best bet is setting up vmware or another virtual-machine with linux install and compiling it there

2030884
dbd	dbi
if not then its probably a bug in dbd mysql or dbi

2030893
charsequence	textwatcher
found a better and working way to implements this use edittext.addtextchangedlistener with a textwatcher class and implements textwatcher.ontextchanged charsequence s int start int before int count works perfectly also on the milestone droid

2030915
keyboard	mouse
it uses global systemd hooks to detection all mouse and keyboard events even outside your application

2030937
duplicates	contains
in your versioning the wordlist a will contains all words but duplicates aswell

2030937
unique	words
if you want to count the unique words then do the same as above and the desired result is the collections size

2030937
unique	words	sequences	unique
.so if you entered the sequences a a b c --- the result would be 3 as there are three unique words a b and c

2030940
where-clause	sql
the generator sql doesn t look good in profiling with all the columns in the where-clause then you have to selected the current object to set the field from the edited object before running submitchanges

2030970
histogram	plot
i ve got a series of x y value that i want to plot a 2d histogram of using python matplotlib

2030973
default-value	default
the used as the default-value will be created only once .so by default all instancess of your types will shared the same instances which is probably not what you want.

2030974
radio-button	selected
.when i run the application the first grouping box automatically has the first radio-button in it already selected and the second grouping box does not have a radio-button selected by default

2030987

hash	md5
i m storing only their user named and a md5 hash of their passwd

2031021
arraylist	treeset	arraylist	treemap	hashtable	sorted	treeset	treemap
instead of arraylist string use hashset string not sorted or treeset string sorted if you don t need a count of how often each words occurs hashtable string int not sorted or treemap string int sorted if you do

2031023
put	get
or to put it this way i use .post for administration and get for navigation

2031047
windows-xp	windows
the specific problem is the support of condition-variable on windows begins from vista for early versioning of windows windows-xp i have a emulated condition-variable code sort of solved the problem

2031056
web-services	security
additionally knowing full well that there are elevation of privileges security concerns to take into account is there any way that i could declare the web-services the widget call as safe for instances adding to the trusted sites in such a way that silverlight would be able to perform the call without the security exception-handling

2031069
directory	folder
the templates are located in the visual-studio install directory common7 ide itemtemplates csharp|visualbasic web asp.net-mvc codetemplates folder

you can now add quickly many possible order ways to form new order do a binary or linear search easily over them

2031216
any	set
would using map be any faster than this current set of for loops

2031224
constructor	object
you are trying use this constructor but you re not passing in a types object

2031245
push	pull
if you really want to be developing on the master and a feature branch at the same time i suggest cloning your repository working in the clone and the master and then using push and pull to move changes between them

2031259
google-chrome	firefox
it s slow both in firefox and google-chrome .so it does not seem to be a browser issue

2031275
e-commerce	product
for example say your rules engine was an e-commerce engine and you allow your users to defined rules that will reward customers with a discount if they add a particular product to their basket

2031285
properties-file	jar
.when you wrap your .app up as a jar file your properties-file will be one possibly compressed file within that jar and it would be a bad idea to try to write to your own jar

2031296
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
i would suggest merge-sort on the list as it is o n log n while bubble-sort or insertion-sort are both o n 2

2031328
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s very difficult to say if asp.net-mvc is more appropriate for you application than webforms without knowing more about the application

2031338
pointers	stack
in unsafe blocks you can use stackalloc to allocate object on stack and use them as pointers

2031360
realloc	malloc
a more common way is to wrap malloc and realloc and keep a list of sizes and pointers

2031378
twitter	gmail
what do facebook twitter and gmail use as their backend account provider

2031387
typedef	struct

compact-framework	.net
if it mathers to ppl this is on a windows-mobile and .net compact-framework 2

2031400
32-bit	64bit
changing from 32-bit to 64bit will consume roughly 20k extra

2031405
if-statement	arrays
the thing i think might be better is only redim bytetempbuffer if intread is less than 1024 the redim is to prevent empty bytes from being added to the end of the arrays .when there are less the 1024 bytes left to read from the networkstream basically is it more efficent to redim every time or to go through and if-statement and redim only if needed

2031421
boolean	int
the types of the full collections is then something like t int t string t bool if you are contains int strings or boolean respectively

2031421
contains	elements
examples include lists zero or more elements of types a the maybe types zero or one elements of types a sets of elements of types a arrays of elements of types a all kinds of search tree contains value of types a and lots of others you can think of

2031421
boolean	int
convert a list of int to a list of boolean

2031421
boolean	int
convert a tree of int to a tree of boolean

2031426
contains	any
some of the worst potential possible changes employees committing fraud or wanting to maliciously destroy data also are frequently from places other than the application especially if you allow table level access to users which you should not do in any financial database or one that contains personal information

2031432
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
i d recommend investigating the thinking-sphinx gem which is a ruby interface to the sphinx full-text search-engine

2031451
put	get
i haven t put this as a live site since it s in development hell right now and i want to get things right as much as possible

2031456
checked-exceptions	runtimeexception
checked-exceptions -- those that do not extends from runtimeexception -- are declare on methods signature and must be caught or declare on the signature of other methodss that use those methodss

2031456
unchecked-exception	runtimeexception
unchecked-exception -- runtimeexception and subclassing -- are not declare and may be throw by any methods

2031477
compact-framework	.net
i m writing a .net compact-framework .app in c#

versioning	upgrade
however in the last few days my server hosts upgrade to a new versioning of centos but says they did not change the versioning of php

2031521
compact-framework	.net
is there a way to use cleartype text in an application using the .net compact-framework

2031532
any	set
basically the first nib gets loaded based on whatever is specified in the yourappnamed-info.plist for main nib file base named and that will initializer any object defined in there and then set iboutlet to points to them as specified in the nib file

2031539
selected	textbox
for example i can change the bold on a selected amount of text in a textbox with rdl while in rdlc it s is not possible

2031547
value	field
furthermore i d like to use it on whatever table whatever field checked the uniqueness of a value against a table and field i specify passing it all into the attributes constructor

2031562
csv	xml
text formats like csv ini xml can be used to store structured-data but imo aren t flexible or efficient to be used as databases

2031594
value	field
a const field required a value to be provided #1

2031595
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is pretty close to wpf where the mvvm design pattern fits very well

2031596
silverlight	wpf
the implied architecture of silverlight and wpf is model - view - viewmodel mvvm and this is supported directly in silverlight via the data binding infrastructure

2031596
silverlight	wpf
the closest microsoft has to a framework for silverlight and wpf mvvm development is prism

2031598
jquery	.post
i always prefer to do an ajax .post to the server with jquery then somehow have the file come back and pop-up for the user

2031601
dictionary	map
the text will also have another dictionary insert to it that will map each button to its bound control a dictionary for each function this will be used .when a function gets called to distinguish between button different bound controls

2031601
textbox	button	subtract	add
for now it will do simple calculator jobs 1 textbox a couple of button and functions like add subtract and such

2031617
any	set
you should be careful with using modules for this -- all the timers callback must be set up in the module code not just using the observers object defined in the module and you shouldn t use any references to the windows in the module

2031621
value	field	abstract-class	base-class
if you want to have particular field in your abstract-class but don t want to defined them in the base-class you can required that implementers supply the value through the constructor

2031628
derived-class	base-class
if a base-class required a value to be provided by a derived-class the two most common ways are

2031645
value	field
the only way i can do this is to eather store a real timestamp in an int field in mysql or else get the value 2010-01-06 23 17 28 and then convert it to a timestamp which just seems like to much overhead .when i can store it already converted in an int field

2031653
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
in the end i tried the jquery cooke plugins in ie 6 7 and 8 safari 4 google-chrome 4 firefox 3.5 opera 10.2 and on a few different configuration and it worked in all of them

2031658
hide	show
depending on the value chosen in the drop list i use javascript to show hide divs on the page which all contains different form input for the user to fill in

2031663
keydown	keyup
you ll have to use keydown in conjuction with keyup to tell if the user pressed shift to produce the letter

2031672
configuration	environment
what i ended up doing now was to put this code in the end of the configuration environment development.rb file to make sure it s only execute while in development

2031700
postdata	request
firebug .net panels or httpwatch can tell you the size of the postdata sent with a request

2031719
radio-button	selected
the radio-button makes the most sense logically since one option should be selected by default and only one should be selected at a time

2031740
hide	show
currently i am using jquery to hide show selected options using following code

2031740
google-chrome	opera
how to i hide options from selected in google-chrome opera and ie

2031744
environment	building
the asp.net-mvc environment is just a layer on top of the .net .so anything you can building with .net can be used in an asp.net-mvc application

2031745
any	set
is there any way to set the request headers

2031746
signals	sigint
i added signals sigint terminate

2031748
google-chrome	opera
you don t it s not supported in ie and assumably not in google-chrome or opera either

2031761
javascript	dom
the dom loaded event fires something that will kick in javascript integration on the page which i want to be as early as possible

2031764
spaces	output
i enter two numberss separated with spaces in application output but application don t react on any numbers

2031778
primitive	int
java starting with versioning 5 will automatically convert between 5 and int.valueof 5 which construct a wrapper of types int from an int primitive

2031792
double	int	boolean	int	boolean	double	primitive	boolean	primitive	int
in addition to object java also include primitive datatypes such as boolean byte int long char float double

2031792
boolean	int
there are also matching numbers object boolean byte int long etc that can be used which like all object are passed by reference instead

2031792
primitive	int
modern java has autoboxinging and auto unboxing to silently convert between the primitive and object which allow the syntax as you ve used it to autoboxing a primitive 5 into an object int

2031796
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
have you instead considered alternative text serialization methods such as csv json or xml using xstream

2031799
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
however oracle mysql sql-server etc are still definitely preferred for multi-user applications even small-scale applications if you have the ability to access utilise a database server

2031803
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i have font-face working well in webkit safari and google-chrome and opera but not in firefox 3.5 or ie 8

2031805
parentheses	operators
how can i use the java or regular expression operators | without parentheses

2031819
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
as it turns out ie and firefox do not honor font-face declarations wrapped inside media safari google-chrome and opera do

2031820
vb.net	vb6
the vb6 functions work just fine in vb.net

2031822
toolchain	cmake
cmake can help you keep your building portable across several toolchain

2031823
constructor	object
this will not work because the int class does not have a no-args constructor what would the resulting object s int value be

2031823
constructor	object
it means the same as above an int object is created passed the content of the variables i probably a loops index as constructor arguments and then the resulting object s tostring methods is called which yield a string representation of the numbers

2031826
radio-button	selected
after this list is populate i m trying to call a change event .so that whenever the default option is changed in the selected list or in a textfield with the same class it disables a radio-button set in another part of the form

2031828
vb.net	vb6
if you haven t yet converted the code you could choose to buy artinsoft s vb upgrade companion which can do some of the conversions you ask for as part of the vb6 to vb.net conversion

2031852
value	field
i added properties that make accessing the value of the bit field easier

2031885
32-bit	64bit
intptr is 4-bytes wide in 32-bit code and will be 8-bytes long in 64bit mode

2031886
instances	private
if you have many different instances of your application running simultaneously you want to minimize private bytes and maximize shared bytes

2031893
json	xml	webrequest	webclient
you can of course write a .net client for this - but you ll find it a lot easier to write it using webclient webrequest manually formatting reading the xml json request response or use datacontractserializer and datacontractserializer to help out with that

2031900
value	field
try on the afteropen event on the tadoquery looping though tdataset- field settings the readonly value to true

2031901
contains	elements
those contains functions to find elements by id and .so on

2031913
artifactory	nexus
your best bet in this case is to use a managed proxy such as artifactory or nexus

2031917
double	int	boolean	int	boolean	double	primitive	boolean	primitive	int
you had primitive int char byte boolean float double long and the rest in the java world were classes including the corresponging wrapper int character byte booelan float double long

2031953
json	xml
webget webinvoke do not expose any metadata that would tell the client to use json instead of xml

2031958
put	get
assuming that op can precalculate this arrays he can put any reasonable numbers of cars into the arrays and get sensible results

2031964
setcontentview	oncreate
luckily all i wanted to do was to set the title text differently and i soon realized that just calling settitle inside of oncreate worked for me i called it after i called setcontentview

2031967
highlight	selected
you can highlight the member named edit and right click the context menu will have an option namedd find usages after selecteded it a menu will open up and you can selected where to search and the results will be display in an output windows at the bottom

2031978
g++	gcc
you can also suppress using this by using the option -mno-cygwin as compiler option for gcc g++

2031984
jquery	.post	dialog	pop-up
now i have a jquery .post that goes to this methods and now i am not sure how to take the outputstream result that the jquery .post will get and make it pop-up with a save dialog box

repository	entity
after having roamed the astral realms for aeons in desperate search for an answer i have come to the final conclusion that yes it s unnecessary to pass a repository into your entity instances because a repository for an entity types should always be a singleton

2032032
repository	entity
if you have a scenario where you would say but the repository can t be singleton because i have a complex scenario where i for example access more than one data.source and it depends on the actual monster instances where to get the victim s from then i say well you must create a repository implementation which knows all data.sources and keeps tracking of where the entity instancess come from and where they will go and .so on.

2032032
repository	entity	entity	poco
if you feel this approach is not poco enough then you must create another loosely coupled business-logic-layer which wrap or derives from the poco entity and implements the repository integration there

firefox	opera
this works in firefox 3.5 and opera 10 however not in ie8

2032059
capacity	storage
.so you can see that a n b n cannot be regular as it required a machine that can count the numbers of a s and b s and thus must have infinite storage capacity inorder to compare them

2032078
exponential	inverse
how would a programmer like myself learn how to find an inverse exponential of a numbers

2032078
exponential	inverse
note here is an example of what i am needing to compute then 0.91831 is raised to the power of the inverse exponential of .773848284 or 0.91831 2.168332164 0.831282

dialog	pop-up
you can t make a file dialog pop-up via ajax

2032170
home-directory	privileges
if it really bothers you to use sudo you can use local .lib and install modules in your home-directory - where you don t need super-user privileges

2032198
any	set
any help with specific suggestions would be greatly appreciated as even with the excellent set of tutorials by robert mcmurray i am still having these issues

2032201
private	self
self by the way is declare as a private variables for the function dialogbox which is invloked by the jquery function in this fashion

2032205
reflection	runtime
one solution could be to use reflection to call the methods which enables you to fill in types parameters at runtime

2032209
contains	set	implements	extends
.solution is be a component class a class extends fl.core.uicomponent implements the icellrender interface .so it can be set as a rendering and contains the labels and textinput components

2032213
csv	xml
in several formats too csv xml and .po for the translation

2032227
value	field
i believe this is because there is already an entry with a nothing value and mysql doesn t allow the empty field to be duplicates

2032229
configuration	installation
if you just want to know basic trends in coverage or whatever then there s probably a hudson or maven-plugin that will do the job just fine with less configuration and installation overhead than hackystat

2032281
function-overloading	optional-parameters
neither optional-parameters nor function-overloading are supported in go

2032291
expression-blend	wpf
i m using expression-blend preview for .net 4 wpf project

sql-server	ms-access
i am developing a vb.net application in sql-server 2005 now i would like to import ms-access database tables from a network into sql-server 2005 database using stored procedure or vb.net code without using sql-server 2005 wizard

2032361
double	int
i understand that int and double are not polymorphism types

2032361
derived-class	base-class
however i also found that static_cast can be used between base-class and derived-class

2032366
derived-class	base-class
static_cast can perform conversions between pointers to related classes not only from the derived-class to its base but also from a base-class to its derived

2032368
required	checked
dynamic_cast checkeded the types of an object and may fail static_cast does not checked and largely required the programmer to know what they re doing though it will issue compile errors for some egregious mistakes but they may both be used in polymorphism situations

2032369
double	int
please note that other varinat types int double can be successfully convert back and this error ocus only with bstr

2032377
double	int
you are right that static_cast works on types that are not related by inherited double - int etc and the others answers points out how the casts work

2032405

i have a swig c++ function that expects a function pointers wndproc and want to give it a python function that has been wrapped by ctypes.winfunctype

2032502
compatibility	platform
.so then is abi compatibility only relevant for running statically linked applications on different platform since the systemd call would be embedded into the binary

2032507
freebsd	linux
for instances freebsd allows using the linux syscall abi only through an emulation module

2032511
order	add
to get the more complex comparison that you re after you should be filtering on posts_where_paged to add in more comparisons and posts_orderby to construct the order by clause that you need

2032532
callback	methods
and the callback methods

2032534
highlight	selected
i use firefox with the extension advanced url builder this extension allows me to highlight a few words and then using the context menu selected find with... google or any other site i have programmed in

i have a project using seam + spring and i have to set in create true .when i want to inject a spring-bean into my seam component otherwise i get a nullpointerexception you should try it

2032584
solaris	linux	solaris	osx	solaris	bsd	linux	osx	linux	bsd
incompatible abi is why even though osx linux solaris windows and bsd all run on intel x86 cpus a simple posix-only hello world program compiled on one os that does not use any vendor specific or proprietary systemd call and or libs generally cannot run on one os .when compiled for another os

2032584
linux	bsd
note .some oses like linux and bsd support foreign abi .so that a simple linux command-line program can .sometimes be execute on bsd without modification

2032599

getter	setter
an actionscript class can include field variables properties getter setter and methods

2032621
getter	setter
these classes act as templates to hold data and generally won t contains functions other than getter setter

2032621
constructor	object
the as3 language reference here has used this term for an object that s passed to the constructor of a class to initializer its properties

2032621
arguments	default
an alternative to this methods more robust and less error prone one imo is to specify each properties as arguments to the constructor and assign default value to them

2032640
google-chrome	firefox
im trying to close a child windows with javascript and in firefox everything works fine but in google-chrome the windows doesnt close

2032644
python	php
what i m more specifically asking is what are the circumstances in which you should actually decide to store data using serialization in php pickle in python et cetera

2032644
csv	xml
we also have a dynamically generator form normally i would assume i would not serialization anything because it s server-side generator and dynamic but our form field labels are internationalized and the user requested this page in spanish therefore we are using a translation class which grabs form field labels stored in mo csv xml format

2032645
order	add
add a textinput event-listener to the textfield and add trace statements to both event handler to know the order of events

i have a qtablewidget with 5 columns in it how do i set all items on column 2 to be a qprogressbar

2032691
logging	trace
to what others mentioned i d add trace and fatal levels the former is good for very verbose logging the later is to indicate total show stopper

2032691
debugging	trace
your users will hardly ever need trace or debugging statements but they will definitely want to nail problems and report them to you

2032692
textbox	button
wrap everything in a form tag and place the textbox and a button in there

2032706
virtualenv	pinax
make sure you are in a virtualenv that has pinax install or create one with pinax-boot.py

value	field
i don t know how to save multiple audiences in a splistitem but if i had this problem i d try to printing out the value of this field from a powershell scripting

2032745
value	field
edit found some information about what the audience field value actually is

2032750
constructor	object
the one exception-handling to not being able to call a methods on an object that is not fully construct the constructor has not yet returned is that a constructor itself can call a methods on the partially construct object

2032752
constructor	object
constructor are special because they are called only .when the object is uninitialized

2032764
authentication	login
.when the .post comment button is click the user is redirected to a provider and they login there after which they are authentication on my site to .post

2032769

remove the -werror setting and it compiles but then show the next problem that you have - the one of not checked for error indications from functions that can fail

2032769
32-bit	64bit
with the obvious revision testing on macos x 10.6.2 gcc 4.2.1 32-bit and 64bit compilations i get one not very sane answer

2032769
32-bit	64bit
same value - even in 64bit instead of 32-bit

2032794
double	int
it turns out that int float and double are instances of the typeclass real and any real may be converted to rational

2032798
solaris	linux
for linux and solaris all the instances will definitely shared the memory pages that hold the code or text as it is properly called

2032813
contains	any
note article table contains more than 200 million article and i using solr for index only not store any field data except article id

2032852
google-chrome	firefox
it works by sitting in google-chrome part of firefox which has special privileges

2032889
push	pull
but if you need git hooks on the git side i would recommend setting up an intermediate bare git repository bare for easy push pull

2032902
updating	updates
php is used to rewrite the static pages .when user asks them to be updates or a full n user rewrite is performed .when templates needs updating

2032904
pure-virtual	base-class
the second an neater versioning is to add a pure-virtual clone function to the base-class

2032929
attributes	properties
if i ve implements the properties using the default-value attributes and made them overridable the attributes can be overrides with the new value

2032929
attributes	properties
the problem with this is there s no way to just make just the attributes overridable as opposed to the whole properties

2032934
google-maps	gps
what google-maps does on every device without gps is that it send the id of the current cell tower to a server that knows where all

2032934
google-maps	gps
better positioning in google-maps is possible with a built-in gps

2032948
client-server	security
if you have to regard security issues better use a full-fledged client-server database

2032948
sql-server	ms-access
since you are looking for something as an alternative to ms-access and if your server os is ms windows microsoft sql-server may be an option for you

2032961
python	c++
the good news is that a lot of languages like python have a c++ interface which makes it possible win32com python-module to use from other languages

2032961
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
json is language independent in a way that it does not map directly to any language although python perl and ruby

is dotnetopenauth only usable on the regular .net or is there a compact-framework versioning as well

2032997
compact-framework	.net
oauth libs that i could use oauth on a .net compact-framework 3.5 application

2033017
arrays	loops
moreover with the echo in loops you ve lost the arrays structure inherent to databases and you need this structure to manipulate your data

2033023
constructor	object
you could design an underlying class filenamecollection or directory that has a methods which returns an appropriate iterator for this types of object an iterator factory-methods instead of requiring that a parameter be passed to your iterator s constructor

2033031
assembly	lc3
i m writing a simple code editor for the lc3 assembly and i ve run into a small problem

2033031
stderr	stdout
originally i attempted to use systemd to call the lc3 assembler and redirect the stdout and stderr to a file like .so

2033032
keyboard	mouse
it doesn t open on mouse over you need to use context menu or keyboard shortcut in source code

2033040
command-prompt	command-line	command-prompt	cmd	command-line	cmd
you can open words document from the command-prompt starting a new words process but there is no easy way of sending any cmd to a runnning instances of words by a simple command-line scripting

2033040
vbscript	vba	macros	vba
if you want to save words document programmatically you can for example use vba macros or vbscript for it

making changes to your code to checked invokerequired in the timer event handler and use invoke if necessary to change propform.opacity results in the opacity changing after the form is show as required

2033067
rollback	commit
then make a commit and rollback spaces and that is pretty much all there is to it

2033069
value	field
what s the cleanest way to convert data field value .when storing loading into from a database

2033089
quadtree	octree
use proper acceleration tree such as kd-tree cover tree octree quadtree etc

2033091
output	mode	buffering	streaming
once you redirect output the output streaming switches from fflush after every write to fflush only .when buffering full mode

2033091
stderr	stdout
your stderr output is now going be completely out of sync with the stdout output

2033098
gethashcode	equals
if you don t specify a comparator in the union extension methods like in my example it will use the default equals and gethashcode methodss in your person class

2033104
jcifs	ntlm
jcifs code seems to work well enough although the jcifs people say they re not interested in supporting ntlm http filtering any more

2033104
jcifs	ntlm
i recently made an ntlm filtering using jcifs which can authentication against either of two domains

2033110
double	int
the first can be either an int double or float .so and the second is always a string literals my string .so i guess const char const

2033115
contains	any
but bll can contains any object for business operations and business validation

2033116
dictionary	arrays
if you want to sort an arrays of dictionary by an arbitrary dictionary key then i think what you want to use is nsarrays sortedarraysusingfunction context with a comparison function that looks up and compares the key you want to sort by

2033125
double	int
the first can be either an int double or float .so and the second is always a string literals my string

2033144
dictionary	arrays
if you have an arrays of object could be applied to dictionary each object a contains first named last named age and you want to sort on age

2033147
double	int
the first can be either an int double or float .so and the second is always a string literals my string .so i guess const char const.

2033147
double	int
this would work for any types for the first parameter int float double whatever

2033147
double	int
now if you really want to restrict the types of the first parameter to be only int float or double

2033150
subclassing	base-class
in other words if i understand correctly the consensus seems to be .when you subclassing all methods including initialization must have the same signature as the base-class methods

2033156
double	int
a better versioning of numtoint would be to convert to a double first and then convert to int

2033168
versioning	upgrade
most wiki based approaches just tracking the head and quickly become useless to anyone stuck working with an old versioning of your api ok maybe this is less of a problem if you re a webservice and just going to force all users to upgrade

2033195
cherrypy	pylons
which python framework do you think is more appropriate or you would suggest over the other cherrypy or pylons

2033201
lookup	any
without any other information i usualy google the code org.jboss.ejb.txtimer.databasepersistencepolicy.listtimerhandles and lookup what happens there

2033236
arrays	loops
i want to assign these results to another arrays in loops .so that i can access these value via this new arrays outside loops

2033244
contains	elements
the selection can be done cross-elementss by this i mean that the selection can contains some text from one elements like div or table and some text from another elementss

2033247
entity-framework	nhibernate	entity-framework	data-access	data-access	nhibernate
just use a good data-access technology linq-to-sql entity-framework nhibernate and access that database directly

2033252
credentials	security
however winhttp does not checked the security zone settings in internet-explorer to determine whether a website is in a zone that lets credentials be sent automatically

2033254
constructor	private
on the other hand you could write a containers extension for unity that can use private constructor via reflection

2033254
constructor	private
i would prefer the extension methods though something like this code below should get you into the private constructor

2033264
contains	elements
the arrays will either contains the numeric index of the option elements or the value if this attributes is specified

2033272
concatenation	comma
to be explicit the plus in the expression is doing concatenation but the comma is not doing concatenation

2033280
.war	jar
as there is no module wide .ser file i manually combine those .ser files from the ejb .war jar and ear file using the command-line solution given by cobertura

2033283
while-loop	arrays
although middaparka s answer is right be sure to first declare the individual new arrays before entering the while-loop

2033295
udp	tcp
the best strategy to ensure no lost data would be to use tcp over udp

2033299
versioning	upgrade
for now you can try to upgrade locally the pmd versioning used in the plugins with

2033305
jquery	dojo
and there are lot of frameworks like dojo prototype yui jquery etc

2033309
user-input	output
how could i write the user-input and display output data .when i choice show book list option

linux	unix
if you want the same .app to run under linux or unix platform they look different

2033333
python	php
what are the circumstances in which you should actually decide to store data using serialization in php pickle in python et cetera

2033348
windows-server	windows
windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5

2033353
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
possible replacements for udp include tcp and sctp

2033396
boolean	int
and the types bool is an alias for boolean in the same way that int is an alias for int32

2033397
pixels	line
the line width is indeed 1 pixels wide but 0.5 pixels wide on one side and 0.5 pixels wide on the other side

2033397
pixels	line
sticking it to the pixels grid makes appears to be 1 pixels wide at 50 opacity on both sides making it a 2 pixels wide line at 50 opacity

2033399
dependency-injection	inject
you would be much better off using dependency-injection to inject an iblogrepository instances into your consuming classes

2033411
callback	methods
the beginsend methods include a parameter asynccallback callback

2033415
constructor	private
the trick is to use non-instantiable util class whose constructor is private and defined all the constants as public static final

2033416
data-structures	dictionary
not calling it may result in improper behavior since you can t know where dictionary is holding its internal data-structures

2033418
reliability	robustness
what is the best systemd to run django on operating systemd database webserver etc considering robustness simplicity maintence cost maintence reliability pricing upgrade for the application and upgrade of the django and other systemd component

2033435
reliability	robustness
the google-app-engine hits most of your requirements mainly those about costs maintenance robustness and reliability

2033438
lighttpd	apache
i ll lay my head on the chopping block and suggest that probably apache with mod_wsgi for django and some other webserver lighttpd

2033448
hash	md5	salt	md5
the other salt which essentially is only a hash of a random string you might wanna go for md5 here as you mentioned that the length is an issue should you then save into your database

2033457
sql-server	postgresql
maybe full-text-search provided by sql-server itself i m using postgresql 8.3

2033492
put	get
it seems that if you have a function and put the op s code which is a php.net example inside that function you will get answer 2

2033511
postgresql	mysql
this issue differs from a debian vs some other distro postgresql vs mysql or lighttpd vs nginx types choice since choosing .app engine most probably will required you to write code specific to it or make modifications in your existing codebase

2033520
swing	awt
a gui would be used to give the user something other than the command-line to look at but swing or awt don t provide the functionality you seem to associate them with - namely connecting the server and client allowing the user to log into the running instances of the server

ip-address	proxy
you could get a better measurement of the client ip-address by pushing out a flash or java applet which connect back to the server via a non-http ports which would therefore reveal transparency proxy or cases where the proxy-injected headers are false - but bear in mind that where the client can only connect via a web proxy or the outgoing ports is blocked there will be no connection from the applet

often browsers will apply their own margins padding to different elements

2034007
debian	linux
edit debian linux for example has mingw in its repositories

getter	setter	subclassing	inherited
that way subclassing have full access to their inherited variables and don t have the artificially created overhead of going through getter setter to access them

2034129
subclassing	base-class
this is fine for member variables that are used in direct simple ways within the base-class and all subclassing

2034129
getter	setter	protected	public
in this case it can be made private and public protected getter setter can be provided instead

2034129
subclassing	base-class
an example is an internal buffering mechanism provided by the base-class where accessing the buffering directly from a subclassing would compromise the integrity of the algorithms used by the base-class to manage them

2034130
getter	setter
there s nothing preventing you from marking a field as public although generally it is considered bad form use getter and setter instead

2034351
protected	public
what s indeed a little bit irritating or even a design flaw in c# or the whole .net cli possibly is that you can defined a public constructor in an abstract-class as it is always effectively protected then in that case

2034355
internationalization	localization
are you talking about internationalization and localization

2034363
cos	sin
w out using a specialized .lib you could approximate the distance a few ways calculate it just as if it were planar rectangular then use the haversine formula to sort the subset later use a lookup table that approximates cos sin etc grouping location into 5 sq

groovy	java
cause if i learn groovy it feels like i code in groovy and not java

2035010
groovy	java
.so if i use groovy a lot for web-applications i will just be worse and have to start over to be good in java .when i code desktop applications right

2035021
groovy	java
if you want to keep yourself current then learning groovy is a good way to do it without abandoning all your investment in the java platform

2035029
contains	elements
updates after rereading the question once more you actually want to selected the tr elements contains the td s in question and thus not only the td s

2035034
groovy	java
.so go ahead and learn groovy - the result will be that you ll miss grovy features .when you try to use java again

2035037
groovy	java
this seems like a more general question about learning programming languages than learning a new language groovy which runs on top of the java virual machine

2035037
groovy	java
if you were going to learn groovy but don t want to forget how to write java then why not continue to use both languages at the same time

2035044

built-in formatter are nsdateformatter and nsnumberformatter

2035078
groovy	java
i m not a java guy but i believe groovy targets the jvm

2035078
groovy	java
if this is the case then programming in groovy will make you a better java programmer because you ll still be targeting the same framework as java the language .so you ll still continue to gain experience with the java libs

2035088
value	field
the original value for this field is something like below in iis7

2035097

groovy	java
while java is a language to be compiled deployed and often run on enterprise servers where performance matters groovy is a language where you can quickly create a program to get something done

2035098
groovy	java
because java has more boilerplate and formalism in it you can do this kind of program more quickly and hence more efficiently in groovy

2035098
python	perl
python is a fresher cleaner scripting language than perl and is these days preferred by many as a scriptinging-language

2035098
groovy	java	python	java	python	perl

2035098
scala	java
scala is like java on steroids

2035098
scala	java
it dispenses with a lot of java s boilerplate .so scala programs are typically about 30 shorter than similar java programs

1 pointers per nodes for a stack

2035172
firefox	safari
it s aligning right in ie but not firefox or safari

2035185
any	set
each database vendor has its own protocols for connecting to the database binding variables and such to database cmd but the jdbc api abstracts all that and defined a common ground what allows all java programs to use the same set of functions to talk to - ideally - any database

2035190
json	xml
this controllers can now return xml or json as the response to an http-get request

2035221
any	set

2035234
silverlight	wpf
if you use wpf or silverlight on a future project you ll want to checkout an alternative pattern called mvvm but that doesn t work too well with winforms.

2035234
backgroundworker	winforms
yes backgroundworker is a good bet for winforms background tasks because it provides a convenient way to deliver progress and completion notifications

2035236
callback	methods
for example let s say i have a utility methods called dosomethingasync and i pass it a callback

2035246

2035254
logout	login	registration	login	registration	logout
since login status usually resides in the cookies your login application will need to set those login cookies to both sites simultaneously on successful login registration and delete on logout

2035254
registration	login
this is because new registrations won t be visible on other sites until transactional is committed - .so for example - you can not call api from within login code to retrieve cookies before committing the transactional with the new registration

2035254
include	ssi
server side include ssi methods

2035254
python	php
i ve once built common user registration for mw php and cnprog python django

checkbox	textbox
is there a way to take multiple checkbox and have the related id named automatically populate in an un-editable textbox textfield

2035442
checkbox	textbox
.so since i m a novice programmer where php sql and advanced languages are concerned i figured the easiest and quickest way is to have the checkbox id s insert into a single textbox then take that dynamic info from the textbox into the db field since this information has to correspond w other textbox on a single transactional

2035453
checkbox	textbox
you could use jquery.each to loops through the checkbox and add the id nme to the textbox field

2035459
python	c++
i opened a starter application to see how it works but i only see c++ files nothing in python

2035471

2035550
nstextview	nswindow
apple s dragging file contents section in its drag and drop programming topics for cocoa documentation confirm that dragging onto a plain nswindow rather than into an nstextview etc. is possible and seems to discuss exactly what i m trying to do but as a relative newbie i still find its reference to images and frame confusing

2035563
value	field
.when insert unicode data in a nvarchar field always preceed the string with n as in insert-into table stringfieldname value n data to be insert which will ensure the correct storing of the data .

groovy	java
going from java to groovy isn t a lot of work

2035569
groovy	java
i really like groovy for one-off apps and for scripting existing java code

2035569
python	ruby
if the goal is to learn a dynamic-languages to add to the toolbox python and ruby are both good choices

2035572

i don t see any useful events to handle on the listbox and if i bind to the collections s collectionschanged event the binding hasn t updates yet .so if i set the listbox.selectedindex at that points i get an exception-handling that the value is out of range

2035620
.when	ready
if it s taking hours i would suggest a separate thread for this and perhaps email a notification .when it is ready to downloading the result from the server send a link to the finished result

2035628
contains	elements
assuming displayname is a jquery object you can use .each to call a callback using this as the contains dom elements which is very conveniently the same conventions as an event handler

2035631
cakephp	symfony
get at least an overview on cakephp symfony zend a lot of people seem to be asking about these

2035645
synchronous	.when

lighting	quad
weird thing is that .when i enable lighting at the first line of code i cant see the light_map textures rendering at all in the multitextures quad

2035680
lighting	quad
also the lighting doesnt seem to affect that quad at all it works on other quad which arent multitextured in my .app

2035697
notepad++	vim
edit you could in fact use to cause vim to act very much like notepad++ though this mapping won t care whether you press shift or not

2035704
perl	ruby
you could also take a look at the ruby source code to see how the hash is generator for string object in case you want to write something similar in perl

2035734
vbscript	basic
visual basic 6.0 and of course classic asp code because it uses vbscript have the same bizarrity

2035748
tuples	set
for example given several tupless from the installed_apps of various submodules you might simply concatenation them into a new tuples for the installed_apps attributes of the package as a whole or if possible duplications are a problem .so .something smarter to remove the duplications in this case you may not care about order .so simply tuples set tup1+tup2+tup3 might suffice

2035756
triggers	insert
you could create a triggers that fires on insert but a better way to approach this might be to simply have a scheduling job that runs periodically say once a week and deletes recording from the table

2035769
json	xml
having written a few ruby-on-rails apps that talk to iphone apps i would also recommend against this and instead communication by posting data in json or xml format

2035786
double	int
now we could do the conversion by allocation a new methods that fixed it up -- that takes the 4 byte int and turns it into an 8 byte double

2035789
execution	exit
without execution the callback the thread will never exit and .so the main thread is al.so stuck

javascript	dom
the javascript and dom implementation of current web browsers don t really have good mechanisms for doing this sort of thing

2035899
stdin	pipe
my initial inclination was to use popen but the program takes a numbers of options and rather that fighting with shell quoting escaping i decided to use a combinations of pipe fork dup to tie the ends of the pipe to stdin stdout in the parent child and execv to replace the child with an invocation of the program passed all of the options it expects as an arrays

2035899
fflush	stdout
the program output many line of data and fflush stdout after each line

2036167
value	field
the plugins also provide various methods to get the field s value such as formserialize

2036172
32-bit	64bit
i also know that with gcc i can easily do overflow detection on a 32-bit machine by upcasting both arguments to 64bit int which will occupy two registers and take advantage of instructions like ia31 adc add with carry

2036176
linux	unix
normally i m a linux unix guy but they re making me do this

2036263
common-lisp	lisp
the first chapter of peter seibel s excellent practical common-lisp covers his reasons for liking lisp

2036268
type-safety	generics
you can t because c# doesn t support generics variance see here for discussion of terminology and even if it did it wouldn t allow this case because if you could cast myitems to you could call add someitemthatisntamyitem which would violate type-safety because a myitems can contains only myitem object not arbitrary items

2036279
linked-list	tree	binary-tree	tree	binary-tree	linked-list
it s easier faster to delete items from a linked-list compared to a binary-tree which could required few operations to fix the tree

2036282
hide	show
i have a list of items with some details that i would like to reveal upon click a show hide details link

2036282
hide	show
i m having trouble making it .so that the show hide link only reveals the div of a specific item

2036282
hide	show
right now it is revealing all of the divs .when click any of the show hide links

2036284
binary-tree	linked-list
if the tail of a linked-list is stored then insert into a linked-list is decidedly faster than insert into a binary-tree

2036289

storage capacity

2036308
keyboard	mouse
the machine where the gui is display and which handles in the keyboard and mouse is the server

2036311
fflush	stdout
you re not seeing the first printf because the program crash before stdout is fflush

2036314
hide	show
it looks to me like all your show hide links are calling the same function show_details etc which show hide all post because of loops not specific ones

2036319
linked-list	tree
deletion is quite fast in linked-list but in case of searching it is better in tree o log n for height balance tree while o n in linked-list

vba	vb6
vb6 and vba is also com based and that is a problem if you want to run as a standards user and not have write access to the registry

2036338
linked-list	nodes
a linked-list is often un.sorted and .so addition of new nodes is simply an o 1 operation normally by append to the tail of the list

2036338
binary-tree	nodes
on the other hand a binary-tree must store nodes in a specific order mechanism and possibly enforce balancing to provide for a more efficient searching retrieval operation

2036338
linked-list	queue	data-structures	linked-list
queue and stack are examples of data-structures that can be happily implements using a linked-list

2036358
32-bit	64bit

in java getter and setter are completely ordinary functions

2036988
getter	setter
the only thing that makes them getter or setter is conventions

2036988
getter	setter
a getter for foo is called getfoo and the setter is called setfoo

2036988
getter	setter
they also must have a specific declaration as show in this example of a getter and setter for named

2036988
getter	setter
the reason for using getter and setter instead of making your members public is that it makes it possible to change the implementation without changing the interface

2036988
getter	setter
also many tools and toolkits that use reflection to examine object only accept object that have getter and setter

2036988
getter	setter
javabeans for example must have getter and setter as well as some other requirements

continuous-integration	teamcity
since we will be sharing .some of the codebase beneath our business-logic .so that business-logic classes only have to be written tested and bugfixed once we ll be using continuous-integration teamcity to be specific to make sure we don t write code that doesn t compile in silverlight or vice versa but are there other tools that would help us in that regard

2042441
google-chrome	firefox
this test html page works both in google-chrome firefox ie

2042445
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
the reason this may help is because your code is not calling certain functions like viewwillappear viewdidappear etc. whereas presentmodalviewcontroller animated call all the right functions for presenting new views

2042456
configuration	environment
another approach that we have used in our environment is to have a configuration file per environment and let our deployment process push the correct file to the correct location

2042487
contains	any
just make sure you get any invisible files too especially the .git directory in the project s root which contains all the configuration information for the repo

2042498
16-bit	8bit
convert the byte arrays to int merging consecutive pairs of 8bit value into 16-bit value like this

2042504
common-lisp	lisp
it has a few lisp dialects and the base is zetalisp but common-lisp works

2042510
any	set
also note that despite errors being hidden any custom error handler set with set_error_handler will still be execute

2042516
any	set
any publicly available code samples to get started say a memory mapped file backed map or set

2042554
value	field
if you know which field need to be checked from the front-end then you should just send the selected value from the drop down boxes to the ajax page .so that it can decide what query needs to be run and return the results xml j.son would be great for this

2042564
python	php
i think we cannot embed python code in html like we do with php jsp

2042584
jquery	.post
.when i .post this using jquery ..post the callback is initiated where i consume the returned json object

2042587
value	field
an important side-effect in the case of this example is that remaining field one doesnt specify value for get initializer to zero

2042588
bmp	png
png bmp jpg

2042611
template-engine	jinja2	template-engine	mako	jinja2	mako
you can use a template-engine like jinja2 django s template-engine or mako templates

selected	button
on the dialog you could have a list that the user could selected from and a delete button to delete the selecteded item s

2042637
environment	building
have you looked into using a building tool that would let you target your different environment

2042646
any	set
the main problem is that annonymous users can t view any content even though in permissions they are set to access content

2042648
profiling	trace
as for how to solve the problem you could try using the sql profiling to create a trace and then run the sp

2042649
superclass	inherited	protected	public
as far as i know in inherited all attributes and methods private public and protected in superclass are passed child class

2042652
lookup	any
is there any way to remove the need to specifically defined regions that a zipcode could be approximated to a nearest county assign a rep if .so would it only be possible with a full geolocation lookup to do distance compari.sons to find the nearest representative or perhaps could the zipcode itself be used to closely approximate the distance

2042658
calling-convention	dllimport
i ve tried several alternatives returning a native string from the exported function changing the calling-convention to stdcall on the assembly and the shared libs changing the charset in the dllimport

2042675
datepart	getdate
i am not sure how to compare for the weekend in the where-clause - i know i should be using datepart dw getdate but i cant seem to see the entire picture to solve it

2042685
protected	public
protected and public members are passed on

2042688
sql-server	oracle
i ve had a favorable experience with postgis and i am aware of both oracle and sql-server spatial extensions

2042692
hide	show
i am working with a pretty complicated .aspx page that is full of controls telerik ajax etc. that all expand collapse show hide etc

2042693
floating	padding
because width auto default to 100 that is minus borders and padding see here if you are not in a floating positioning environment

2042693
safari	opera
this page gives a cross-browser implementation targeting ie6+ ff2+ safari 3+ and opera

2042699
margins	padding
essentially auto means taking all the other specified padding borders and margins into account fill the remaining spaces assuming only the width is set to auto

2042699
margins	padding
.so effectively 100 minus borders padding and margins

2042699
contains	set	contains	elements
to fix just set it to match the other elementss or stick them all in a contains elements with a set width

2042700
dialog	pop-up
if your dialog is a regular pop-up windows it is not possible to prevent the user from closing the windows

2042700

you could use a jquery modal-dialog plugins such as jqmodal

2042704
hash	md5	key-value	key
i have implements a key-value file caching where i md5 hash the key to determine the file named for the hash file

2042707
authentication	login
the templates has built-in functionality to login to a forms authentication website

2042764
key-value	key
however if you are already using xmldocument and or need to be able to updates the xml dom its probably just a easy to dump the result-of selectnodes into a sorteddictionary using the value of the key attributes as the key-value

2042765
static-methods	setter
some tips eliminate static-methods thus avoid singleton provide setter or constructor allowing to inject dependencies

2042765
easymock	jmockit	easymock	mockito	mockito	jmockit	powermockito	jmockit	powermockito	easymock
i m thinking to jmockit or powermockito the later extends easymock and mockito and provides the ability to mock static-methods

2042777
execute	prepare
you prepare stmt_name but execute stmt - is this just a typo

2042790
textbox	onblur
to get around this you could tie the custom javascript validation function to the related control event such as a textbox onblur event but without knowing more detail about what value you are trying to validation it is difficult to speculate further as to whether this could be a solution

2042797
kernel	mmu
it s amazing that basically the same kernel is used in tiny embedded devices with no mmu and in supercomputers with huge memories and thousands of processor

2042799
lgpl	gpl
if the libs isn t available as a static libs it might be under the lgpl or even gpl

2042800
ruby-on-rails	django
an issue arises here that in my country java and c# .net developers are easiest to find while later languages frameworks are harder such as django or ruby-on-rails

2042800
python	java	python	php
we both know python django this is where we are most confortable php and java no web based .app experience for java but java se

2042807
callback	methods
you need to call document.formname.submit or at the callback handler of the .post methods

2042833
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i have a simple ajax scripting that works perfectly fine in google-chrome internet-explorer 8 firefox 3.5.5 but fails in firefox 3.5.7

oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
for example google searches show that sql-server oracle and mysql all support regex

2042843
webforms	asp.net
the converter would be used in an asp.net 2.0 application we re upgrading to 3.5 shortly but still sticking with webforms using sql-server 2005 soon 2008 as the db

2042857
any	set
if you have any thoughts on the styles of how i set this up .so its efficient and performs well please let me know

2042859
callback	methods
then add the callback methods

2042876
yahoo-api	yahoo
well you can easily get the latitude-longitude from the google or yahoo-api in my last project we had an issue with google not finding a certain zipcode in nj that yahoo found fyi

2042904
listbox	textbox
consider a different approach you could use an actual listbox that you make visible .when the user click a glyph that looks like an arrow next a textbox

2042908
32-bit	64bit
i believe azul s 64bit versioning of hotspot use a 32-bit compact pointers to shorten the header size

2042909
getter	setter
in ecmascript-5 there is support for getter setter and you can spoofing the document reference if accessed from within a scoping which redefines it

2042916
contains	any
find all int in the z range x y such that z a does not contains any repeat digitss of length 4 and a digits larger than 4

2042919
versioning	downgrade
upgrading to eclipse 3.6 didn t work the plugins wont install as it s the wrong versioning nor the downgrade to 3.4 for the same reason

2042937
conditional	operators
is there an operators in java that will give a result-of false if either conditional are false but if both are true or both false the result will be true

2042940
.net	wcf
depending on the versioning of the .net you are using and the types of application i d recommend using wcf

2042943
oracle	mysql
db - my experience limits me to oracle 10g prohibitive for startup mysql

2042945
base-class	inherited
i am currently defining a base-class for my views which itself inherited system.web.ui.page

2042950
value	field
form field b is mandatory only if field a has any value

2042950
value	field
form field b is mandatory only if field a has a specific value

2042950
value	field
either field a or field b needs to have a value they cannot both be empty

2042950
value	field
either field a or field b needs to have a value they cannot both be empty or both have a value - xor

2042976
value	field
isn t assignment of a value to a field atomicity

2042980
execute	prepare
generally the prepare and execute statements are client-side operations that the server-side of the dbms does not normally see

2042980
execute	prepare
however given that you have problems i recommend splitting up the second chunks of sql into two separate operations - and omit the prepare blurb and the execute blurb

2043013
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has been this way for awhile and google-chrome i believe has always been this way

2043022
data-members	instances
it sounds like the methods really should be static it doesn t access any data-members and it doesn t need an instances to be invoked on

2043022
constructor	private	data-members	instances	data-members	constructor	data-members	private	instances	private
make the class a singleton make the constructor private and have a static data-members in the class to hold the only existing instances

2043025
linked-list	nodes	linked-list	tree	children	tree	children	nodes
unlike a linked-list a tree is a more general form it can have multiple nodess that follow a given nodes that are called its children

2043025
children	nodes	value	field
defined a nodes class that has two field one for the value of the nodes and the other a list of children

2043025
children	nodes
then you iterate over the items of your list adding the second elements of each pair to the children list of nodes corresponding to the first elements of the pair

2043025
children	tree	children	nodes
after the tree is built you use a recursive printing function that printinging the current nodes and call itself on its children if there are any

2043055
version-control	git
in your case there is one of these repositories on each development machine and on the main codebase machine this is why git is called a distribute version-control systemd

2043071
response	timeout
since your process is a long-running one icefaces doesn t send the response and it timeout

2043075
jquery	.post
i want to do the same thing but with the jquery adaptor and using asp.net-asp.net-mvc 2 rc as opposed to asp.net-mvc 2 beta that the .post uses

2043077
children	tree	children	nodes
i assume that the root nodes in the tree always comes before all its children in the original list

2043080
.net	wcf
wcf gives you a lot of flexibility to change the design of your client-server architecture simply by changing a few .net attributes

2043088
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
it generator code for c# java perl php python and ruby if you need to customize the scripting

2043090
http	ssl
and these are all through http ssl

2043106
callback	methods
the callback methods is execute .when the methods is complete not necessarily successful

2043112
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
but you really should look at using perl or python php etc if you can as glenn jackman suggests

2043123
archive	backup
also auto-generated documentation does not required any extra effort to backup or archive since it can be re-created from the source code which you are keeping in a version-control repository right

2043123
any	set
however doxygen and probably others can generator a fairly decent set of docs even without adding any doxygen-format comments

2043134
toggleclass	addclass
probably you want to al.so allow deselecting of object .so you should use toggleclass instead of addclass

2043138
contains	any
the request.cookies given to the view does not contains any cookies except those from subdomain.example.com .so i can t write just response.delete_cookie ... inorder to delete it

2043151
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
mechanize linked to in another answer is a browser in a libs and there are clones in perl ruby and python

2043182
mapping	unique
i ve tried mapping it as one-to-many but one-to-many automatically assumes that it should perform the join using calendarentry s id column presumably since it s the only properties that is guaranteed to be unique which it must be to be one-to-many

2043207
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and .so on just refresh the page like a charm but ie dont

2043210
any	set
any idea how i can set datagridview.iscurrentrowdirty to true

2043222
textbox	button
i have a user-controls that is comprised of 3 textbox 3 button and a gridview

2043222
textbox	button
each textbox button combo should have a behavior that .when the textbox has focus pressing enter should fire its associated button

2043222
textbox	button
as far as i can tell .net will only allow one default button - it doesn t provide to explicit associate textbox and button

2043228
constructor	object
you can take in your two guids as strings and convert them to actual guid object using the guid constructor that accepts a string value

2043236
textbox	button
try creating a separate user-controls for each textbox button set

2043236
textbox	button
that way each textbox will fire it s associated button

2043248
bionic	glib
this already runs with glib rather than bionic

2043259
duplicates	contains
but with this occasional order contains two or more items the order would appear be duplicates

2043261
error-code	hresult
instead of returning an error-code hresult you return a return_code hresult which assert if it goes out of scoping without the value being read

2043277
jndi	jms	jndi	jdbc
using the administration console you can load weblogic server j2ee service and components such as rmi jms ejbs and jdbc data sources in the jndi tree

2043277
deployment-descriptor	web.xml
afaik the standards way is to put an env-entry in your deployment-descriptor web.xml ejb-jar.xml

2043289
textbox	button
you can disable the default button and handle the textbox s onkeypress event

2043303
specifications	w3c
for example the w3c originally wanted to adopt a rand license for its specifications but after significant protests from project such as mozilla and apache they decided upon a royalty-free model

2043309
short	base
in short in catch ex as system.servicemodel.faultexception-handling i want to examine ex and get the base real types of the exception-handling either as a types mostly for debugging .so i can add another catch block or as a string for logging

2043321
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
in firefox and ie8 but not in opera or google-chrome

2043321
margins	padding
i m guessing it has to do with borders padding and margins

2043329
groovy	java
the requirement that all non-static inner-classes need a reference to their outer class is imposed by java rather than groovy

2043381
data-members	private
make data-members private except in behaviorless aggregate c-style struct

2043381
constructor	object
while making it easier to construct a positioning on-the-fly the constructor also kindly zero-initializes default positioning object for me

2043397
datagridview	databound
this list is databound to a datagridview and show details relevant to the shipment such as shipping address etc

2043399
directory	folder
for example in a project where foldercustomnamespaceres.resx is placed inside a directory named folder

2043406
contains	elements
you also probably need to play with positioning .top which is the distance the elements already is move away from the top of the contains elements

2043412
conditional	operators
for future searchers negation operators equalss false equals to false not conditional

2043426
contains	lookup
this methods contains the logic prventing lookup field from being copied.

2043445
authentication	login
.when a client opens a new conneciton the handshake and login authentication authentication are done by a task which required a worker

2043445
transaction-isolation	isolation-level
under snapshot isolation-level the query will not request locks at all but instead a versioning mark will be used to possible serve the data requested from the versioning store see sql-server 2005 row versioninging-based transaction-isolation

2043469
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
i have a viewcontroller with a mkmapview which is pushed into because of the navigationcontroller

2043471
value	field
i ve got a swing form and want to use the preferences api to set the value of field .when loading gui

2043481
getter	setter
you should create public getter and setter

2043485
value	field
if you want to change the value of the field you can use the set methods

2043506
expression	evaluation
if you were checked a value rather than performaing an operators on it there may be a theoretical performance benefit as the expression evaluation becomes a no op

2043511
jlabel	jlist
i created a jframe object and added a jlabel and a jlist to the frame but both object are being placed on top of each other

2043558
boolean	int
aindex int boolean

2043566
webforms	asp.net
i frequently use regular .aspx views as partial-views because you can make them reference a master view inorder to provide templates content like what you can do with user-controls in asp.net webforms

2043573
3des	des
between des 3des rc2 and rijndael this is what ms has to say

2043574
hide	show
this should work to hide all onclientclick then show the specific player directly following the button in the dom

2043576
silverlight	wpf
as far as i know there is no built-in multi-binding support in silverlight as there is in wpf

2043578
dependency-injection	inject
instead of custom validation your testing suite could inject code via dependency-injection that does robust tests of your key hitting the database to verify each change as the tests run and that inject production code that omits or restrict such tests for performance reasons

2043579
attributes	properties
i cannot change the attributes of the excludefiles properties because they will be overwrite the next time any setting changes are made

2043582
selected	textbox
the problem arises after the user selected an option from the drop down i cannot seem to get the textbox to updates it s value with the new selected one

2043582
itemtemplate	gridview
this is the itemtemplate from the gridview column

2043602
text-editor	editor
i just came across this wysiwyg rich text-editor rte for the web that also has an html to rtf converter cute editor for .net

2043609
3des	aes
i d use 3des or aes for any encryption

2043614
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
what tools are available to convert an openoffice.org or excel spreadsheet with all its formula into a java object that can be called at runtime

2043635
dialog	pop-up
if you need a more specific answer to your question you ll need to do a better job of describing what you mean by return -- do you want to see the text in a labels appear in a pop-up dialog etc

2043643
access-control	authentication
compared to raw git servers it notably include access-control and it also has useful web interfaces to the code for authentication users

2043647
spreadsheet	apache-poi
the apache-poi project provides java code that can read mostly excel spreadsheet

2043654
duplicates	lookup
remove all lookup tables first and their field include into resulting dataset and then checked for duplicates

2043654
duplicates	lookup
start adding lookup tables one by one checked each for duplicates

2043657
installation	building
i ve done this recently and the trick was to building a standalone versioning on a leopard installation

2043667
defined	declare
.so regardless of how you declare it in the class or out you will normally always have to deal with the detriment of having to defined it in cpp file

2043667
protected	public
access specifiers public protected private don t control visibility of the named

2043690
python	ruby
it has sample remote servers in python and ruby

2043693
administration	account
or if you want to change the owner to that local administration account then it should be

2043693
administration	account
because renaming the machine to devpc has eliminated the local account that used to be named win-nd... administration and this has also invalidated the current owner of the database

2043739
show	next
if the div you want to show is always next use next but you say you have tried that

2043755
sql-server	mysql
i though of implements local sql-server database as i worked earlier with mysql and connect to it via sqlclient interface

2043760
value	field
i ve attempted different character value in the field parameter to retrieve maintainer and author info from the package files but have not been had luck

2043771

.when user selected one or more items and press submit button selected items should be converted into project

2043777
callback	methods
ok i have a flex .app and i am adding a callback methods like this

2043799
jquery	dojo
i know dojo and yui libs have something like this but i am looking for something which i can use with jquery

2043799
javascript	dom
is there anyway that i could say begin execution any javascript only after dom has loaded in a global way than just writing document-ready within every user-controls

2043800
textbox	button
i m trying to create a toolbar with a button that will change the languageid for all shapes and textbox in a powerpoint document to englishus

2043813
linked-list	nodes
reusing the same list the main cost is coming from deleting the nodes and updating the appropriate pointers in linked-list

2043833
put	get
a component i have created works fine if i put it in the main project and reference it from any res layout xml but .when i put it in a project on which the main project depends i get a classnotfoundexception in the xml

2043840
subtract	add	subtract	time
this way we always know the date time in the database is correct to utc and if we need to adjust for client display or report we can add subtract the offset for all date time value regardless of which server s the data came from

2043841
youtube	vimeo
personally i prefer to see videos on something like vimeo rather than youtube or a similar site

2043852
selected	button
for a very specific reason i want to selected listviewitem s on mouse button up not actually on mouse button down

2043862
entity-framework	ado.net
dataset will be around for a while but don t expect any new dataset features because ado.net entity-framework is the new dataset

2043878
hide	show
by using show 0 media controllers will be show until hide is called by an integration with the player

2043913
callback	methods
by the time you close the alert the dom and contents are finished loading and you can make your externalinterface callback methods

2043919
default	reset
yes there is a reset to factory default option but it s rather brute

2043973
contains	elements
this function will return a nodelist contains all the elementss that use that class and you can access each elements and hide it through that list

2043975
any	set
if you need a properties which can be set with any types the most reasonable solution here is to simply use properties of types object

2043977
execution	jobs
quartz can be used to create simple or complex scheduling for execution tens hundreds or even tens-of-thousands of jobs

2043977
execution	jobs
to tune resources for jobs execution have a look at the configure threadpool settings .doc

2043995
crypt	salt	crypt	hash
this would work but the purpose of using salt is to differentiate the hash key to strengthen the crypt algorithm

2043996
youtube	vimeo
while vimeo is more of a professional site youtube offers html5 h.264 video playback support for all videos .so they ll play on iphone

2043999
required	checked
also checked for disk free spaces will required changing the code everywhere i write a file which is not what i want - finally this solution is exactly the opposite of what iâ m trying to test how my .app will behave .when it cannot write any more

2044002
click	mouse
i cannot speak for telerik s grid but with the infragistics grid you would attach the context menu to the grid and then use the mouse location to determine what the user right click on in the grid

2044021
double	int
here s why many common architectures including x86 have a hardware instruction to convert signed int to double but do not have a hardware conversion from unsigned to double .so the compiler needs to synthesize the conversion in .software

2044021
double	int
gcc s software conversion from unsigned int to double may very well be suboptimal it almost certainly is given the magnitude of the slowdown that you observed but it is expected behavior for the code to be faster .when using signed int

2044021
32-bit	64bit	double	int
assuming a smart compiler the difference should be much smaller on a 64bit systemd because a 64bit signed int - double conversion can be used to efficiently do a 32-bit unsigned conversion

2044025
linux	osx
i m not sure of how to do it on osx but on linux i d probably put a disk quota on my test user and then run the .app

2044027
value	field
but if you re plugging this value into a database you re better off using an auto increment field for ids

2044042
deployment	install
whats the best way to create the multi language install for office addin deployment setup

2044053
order	add
if this isn t random enough if you think you re going to have two order being placed within the same exact second simply add another layer with mt_rand 0 9

2044061
simpletest	phpunit
it can be used with any unit test framework like phpunit or simpletest

2044065
function-call	inline
alternately stephen s suggestion of writing the c++ methods as an inline wrapper around a simple c function-call is a good one

2044081
wordpress	blogs
simple blogs cms and wikis like drupal and wordpress are good at classification and retrieval

2044083
managed-code	unmanaged
is there a simple way to tell if the memory being leaked is from unmanaged or managed-code

2047455
shell	bash
feature bash the korn shell ksh93 and the z shell each allow subscript arrays with variables with or without a dollar-sign

2047455
arrays	loops
without the dollar-sign it s performed twice once to calculate the index for the lookup and again to calculate the index for the assignment .so in effect an assignment at one step in loops might look like which totally scrambles the arrays

2047475
for-loop	loops
a for-loop allows several options for terminating loops

2047511
javascript	dom
the reason you may hear of properties in terms of html is because of how javascript interacts with the document as a document object-model dom

2047511
attributes	properties
if you defined a variables as document.getelementsbyid blah that variables is now holding an object and various properties in that object will coorespond to various aspects of that elements some of which may be pre-definedd attributes such as the border-color or value and other things not definedd at the html level such as it s positioning on the screens or rendering fonts height

2047512
google-chrome	firefox
supported and tested on ie8 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 3.0

2047550

if it is general purpose data structure i d suggest to use key-value based api as you do not know in advance the relation between key and value with comparator constraint on tkey

2047554
screens	hdpi
however .when the device has a hdpi high-dpi screens the image is still pixel-by-pixel accurate which look small on the device screens

2047558

constructor	object	derived-class	base-class
at the time the constructor of the base-class run the object of the derived-class basically doesn t exist

2047582
constructor	object	derived-class	base-class
a solution might be to have a helpers object passed from the derived-class to the constructor of the base-class

2047590
.when	ready
.when the code is ready to test everything is merged to the main branch and published to our test environment

2047599
constructor	object
i have seen this done before providing quite some pain to the developers extends the ace_task class to provide a periodic thread that could be extendsed with concrete functionality and activating the thread from the periodic thread constructor only to find out that while in testing and more often than not it worked but that in some situations the thread actually started before the most derived object was initializer

2047619
uiscrollview	subviews
every time the zooming panning stops the delegation of the scrollview recalculates the frame of that uiimage which is a subviews of the uiscrollview s contentview and call setneedsdisplay

2047619
frame	width	height	frame
the frame gets smaller and smaller in width height measurements as you zoom into the scrollview because i want the image to stay the same size on the screens

2047619
pixels	line
i thought i could just scale the line width down and the radius of the circle i m drawing cgcontextaddarc but it looks as if the iphone has tried to draw a thin lined circle over two or three pixels and then enlarged those pixels rather than zoomed the view in and draw a highly accurate circle over it

2047619
uiscrollview	subviews
this is the viewcontroller resizing the uiview which is a subviews of the uiscrollview s contentview

and the viewmodel here is a singleton that lives much longer than the view itself will i get memory-leaks or do the listbox and datagrid controls in silverlight 3 already take care of this

2048047
constructor	object
you could possibly even call a constructor on some object from the component and verify that it initializer correctly

2048072
javascript	dom
this is because the javascript will execute once the dom has loaded .so all the actual html code but not necessarily the images within it

2048076

2048140
constructor	object
based on the assumption that you can t change your three backend systemdd to all access a central systemd for user management which would be better the only change i would suggest is for your proxy where you are hard coding call to each of your three systemdd - it would be better to create a list of provisiondata object in your constructor and then in your delete create call loops through that list and call the appropriate methods on each

2048156
png	gif
furthermore the executable file-format differs with the os the same way a png file differs from a gif file

depending on the query the output file may not be as you expect it column headers etc as typical of sqlplus .so your query.sql should contains .some set cmd to adjust the output to your needs

2048169
piping	spool
another methods is to use the oracle spool cmd instead of piping the result to a file

2048181
execution	exit
alternatively if you can join only one of the threads if there is a single thread that controls the execution of the application and the other threads will be killed on exit

httpwebrequest	webclient
i have a question regarding the performance of the .net httpwebrequest client or webclient gives similar results

2048408
google-chrome	firefox
if i use httpwebrequest to request an html page in this case news.bbc.co.uk and analyse the speed using httpanalyzer at which the response is read by the application this is significantly slower than a browser firefox google-chrome ie requesting the same resource all caching cleared etc

2048426
selected	button
you can go back from this combined mask to individual masks inorder to selected different button of a segmented control

2048439
3g-network	wifi
it works surprisingly well over wifi but hang bombs out over the 3g-network

2048447
margins	padding
.so far i only use float + margins + padding now if i can mix positioning and save time and get pixels perfection easily then float

2048453
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
i seem to have a weird bug in microsoft sql-server 2005 where freetext searches are somewhat case-sensitive despite the collation being case-insensitive latin1_general_ci_as

2048455
moss	wss
upload .stp file and using it was straight forwarding in moss and wss

2048463

john resig the jquery dude did a super simple template-engine that you can use clientside rick strahl has a good .post about it

2048480
margins	padding	floating	padding	floating	margins
otherwise you should be fine floating padding and using margins

2048486
primitive-types	generics
.so most likely you cannot restrict a generics class to primitive-types as opposed to c# which allows a where t struct

2048493
unhandled-exception	try-catch-finally
in c# will the finally block be execute in a try-catch-finally if an unhandled-exception is throw

2048512
display	width
could even be the width as remember both printing previews in ie and firefox will have difirefoxerent viewport dimension from the normals browser viewport and each other a few pixels out could completely change the display of it

2048524
duplicates	contains
to solve this duplicates the entire folder contains the default themes

2048538
order	join
just query the order and use setmaxresult and do a fetch join to ensure all orderitems for the selected order are loaded straight away

the normals use of an abstract methods is to force every subclassing to implements a methods with the same signature

2048663
json	xml
even a json true or an empty xml document is better than nothing at all

2048698
temporary	copy
you cannot pass this by reference to the add_item function because it does not exist anywhere it s just a temporary copy returned by that function

postgresql	oracle
if you want special support for xml tools like xpath you can look into databases with xml support like postgresql and oracle and store xhtml in them

2048753
.when	ready
git allows for separate branches for instances for each user or feature that is implements that are merged .when they are ready

2048783
version-control	git

shell	bash
preferably the solution should work in bash but any other shell is also ok

2048812
shell	bash
since bash was .so easy what about other shell

2048835
malloc	free
as long as the libs api s use only raw-types and do not try to free passed in pointers or pass out pointers to internally malloc d memory that they expect the application or another libs to free you should be ok

2048835
fortran	pascal
its easy to fall for the fud that anything can go wrong if c-runtimes are mixed but you have to remember that libs and dynamic libs .so .dll .dylib have traditionally been developed in a wide variety of languages allowing code written in assembly c++ fortran pascal etc to comminicate via an effective cpu efficient binary interface

2048879
.when	ready
take a look at the link provided by hughes get ready for delphi 2009 and up .when developing with delphi 7

i personally use eclipse to code in c++ perl php and do javascript as well inside of it

2048915
compact-framework	.net
i m attempting to debugging a .net compact-framework c# application on a windows-mobile 6 device using visual-studio 2005

2048952
include	ssi
if your server supports server-side include ssi then you use the following 404.shtml as your errordocument

2048968
scaladoc	javadoc
however there was a request that a function be provided that translation scaladoc into javadoc format for use by ides .when display help

2048976

other special trap signals that bash understands are debugging return and exit as well as all the systemd signals which can be listed using trap -l

2048993
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
also it is very fast and quite memory-efficient compared to perl php python ruby especially if you are using luajit

2048993
c++	lua
.so what we are using is our own httpserver written from scratch in c++ which integrated lua as a scripting-language for our business-logic

2048993
c++	lua
this allows us to do customization of the business-logic in lua quickly compared to what we had to do if it was pure c++

2048998
margins	padding
i tried to set padding and margins to 0 but the gray line stays on.

2049014
required	checked
dimecasts.net seems to be dead now - the links have been updates to archive.org though the videos seem to required flash i was unable to checked if those are still up

2049041
hide	show
we have several places where we show hide elements using and and calling them accordingly using javascript function-calls

2049041
hide	show
is there any other way to show hide elements other than using styles tags

2049060
selected	button
there is a â œsubmitâ button to upload the selected file

2049064
contains	any
proces.sor understand programs in terms of opcodes - .so your intution about executable contains opcodes is correct and you guessed correctly that any executable has to have opcodes and operands for execution the program on a proces.sor

2049064
coff	elf
a couple of formats that have been used for storing information in an executable file are elf and coff on unix systemd and pe on windows

2049086
hide	show
then you would have to rely on page refreshes to show hide elements

2049086
hide	show
.when you click to show hide something refresh the page and then you server-side code would perform the logic of whether the field was incldued on the page

2049086
hidden-field	input-field
if it is an input-field i suppose it could still be include as a hidden-field

2049087
positioning	slider
this should make your views slider into positioning

2049091
dictionary	map
first solution would be to use a dictionary to map the loader instances to named

2049129
python	c++
remove and sort usings in .net import in python include in c++

2049132
required	checked
this might be too simple to required antlr but it wouldn t hurt to checked it out for future reference

2049138
png	gif
but if it is a static file like png gif then maintenance will take more time as you cannot control the individual images separately anymore

2049152
google-earth	google-maps
grand canyon usgs drg overlay for google-maps google-earth

2049154
click	mouse	hide	show
having things that dynamically hide and show on mouse move or click is not all that good for accessibility

2049167
directory	folder
yes it s normals and no the current directory is not always the application folder

2049174
rollback	commit
if you commit them along with real code changes and you have to rollback those changes then you lose your cosmetic fixed

mousedown	mouseup
it appears that the behavior we are seeing occurs because the click event is being fired both from the mousedown and the mouseup events instead of just the mouseup as it would in windows or previous versioning

2049192
mousedown	mouseup
it will become checked from the mousedown event and will stay checked because the mouseup event is not fired .when you lift your finger from a different positioning

2049192
mousedown	mouseup
inorder to prevent the double click behavior you must suppress one of the mousedown or mouseup events

2049192
onmousedown	mousedown
i ended up creating a control that inherited the treeview and used wndprochooker to hook the onmousedown methods and mark it as handled .so that the mousedown event never actually gets fired

2049193

2049333
python	java
it would force you to create lock-checking and retry logic at both sides java and python

2049341
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i thought for sure this was an asp.net-mvc issue .so to make sure i tried it on a regular webforms project and was meet with the same issue

google-chrome	safari
at least it does in google-chrome but like i said before google-chrome and safari shared the webkit rendering engine .so it should work for safari too

2049412
defined	declare
since these functions aren t actually a part of the language itself neither are they defined in math.h only declare will the constants ones get precalculated at compile-time or will they be wastefully calculated at runtime

2049414
uniform	points
xml rdf creates some confusion by using urns which do resolve because they happen to also be urls uniform resource locators which points to object describing their meaning but this is merely a conventions

2049434

as you reported that you re getting an object-reference not set to an instances of an object you might want to checked for a null reference

2049585
javascript	dom
a page that uses javascript to create the final dom its client side rendering

2049615
click	mouse
i don t really know why you are going to the effort of enumerating link positioning .when for a mouse click down event you can quite reliably get the elements that was click on using event.target srcelements

2049636
boolean	int
public boolean isremoved int idx return flags.get idx

2049643
where-clause	sql
.so even if a filtering works in a where-clause on an sql statement it does not necessarily mean that it will work as a filtering

2049643
where-clause	sql
as a workaround you might try setting it all in the where-clause of the sql statement

on os 3.0 .when allowsselectedion no it s not possible to selected any row and it also cancels row highlight

2049734
contains	any
but if part of the design is that any hirearchy can only contains items of a single hirearchyitem types then you may want to make hirearchy itself a generics class

2049738
lookup	any
there are minor difference which you re expected to lookup prior to using regexp in any specific language

2049742
abstract	extends	implements	extends	implements	abstract

if i try to add an object b to the datastore which also has value k for the field object b overwrite object a

2049827
numeric	zero
you could format it as a string with leading zero but the int itself is just a numeric representation

2049850
decimal-point	zero
an int is a numbers and in our numerical systemd leading zero on the left of the decimal-point do not change the numbers and are therefore irrelevant

2049862
base	zero
whilst in byte form it will have a representation along the line of 001 or 0000000000000001 the runtime doesn t know which base you want to represent the numbers in .so the 2nd and 3rd columns the other two zero are ambiguous

2049865
versioning	upgrade
versioning upgrade scripting for each development iterator

2049869

the basic idea is to provide the class the re.sources that it needs access to via the constructor .so you don t have to make use of long-lived object references and static-classes

2049964
getter	setter
upd the problem is even more stupid .when i commented all stuff related to category class my selectmanylistbox my converter all related setter and getter and left only methods action it still isn t being called

installation	packaging
yes i appreciate that it may seem academic from your perspective but your vendor s packaging permitted a non-standard installation that break otherwise working programs

2050153
linked-list	queue
but if you just want a mutable queue using two stack is a great way to make it slower and more complicated than just using a linked-list

2050162

2050235

selected	listbox	selected	button
but if i start the program and first selected an item in the listbox and then press the button the current combobox item will not change with the current listbox item

2050235
selected	listbox
if the binding is working have not selected anything in the listbox and then filled the combobox if you choose an item in the combobox the binding will break

this sort of dynamic methods attributes resolution which is common in dynamically typed languages such as php python and ruby is not directly supported in the java language

2050595

no loops one if-statement

2051892

updates tom smith advises that splines interpolation is to be preferred to polynomials interpolation for this kind of thing and wikipedia bears him out

2052091
interpolation	derivative
you can either interpolation some kind of it through the points then calculate the first derivative also numerically but for a larger numbers of points or you can just calculate the first derivation from the points you have which will be better depends on how many points you actually have

2052095
interpolation	splines
splines interpolation is probably more useful for you than polynomials interpolation if you fit a polynomials it must inevitably head off to + - infinite outside your data range

2052357
versioning	downgrade
if you are using the apple-supplied python 2.5 on 10.5 leopard which comes with pyobjc 2.0 built-in probably the easiest way to downgrade is to remove the 2.2 versioning from its site-packages directory libs python 2.5 site-packages

2052357
versioning	upgrade
if you are using another versioning of python and install pyobjc yourself you still may be able to use easy_install to revert to it since normally easy_install does not remove previous versioninging .when you upgrade

failing that possibility - is there any way to ensure that all the field keep their value if i were to php redirect the user back to the form page

2052418

2052468
for-loop	arrays
i just wrapped your iterator generator in a for-loop and built up an arrays of iterator functions

2052494

aside from the encoding issue i don t think there s any guarantee that value will always give the field in the same order

2052502
while-loop	for-loop
you can use a for-loop instead of a while-loop

2052503
exception-handling	try-catch
now you just use the class and wrap the call that might throw the exception-handling in a try-catch block

2052533

jquery	.post
if you really want to do just simple messages with your .post i would look at using jquery and its ajax .post methods to .post to alternate pages or web-services

do not enumerate every value on range 0 2 35 instead enumerate a manageable subset say 100 000 value at a time and .when all value are consumed simply generator another 100 000 value in sequences and continue

2052720
messagebox	alert
initially the problem cause was click on ok to messagebox which was generator by javascript alert

2052734

2052747
digits	base
where f b n is the sum of the digits of the numbers n in base b

2052747
digits	base
for base 10 it s clear that as the ones al.so known as least significant digits move from 0 1 2 ... 9 that n and f b n proceed in lockstep as you move from n to n+1 it s only that 10 of the time that 9 rolls to 0 that it doesnt .so

2052747
subtract	time	digits	zero
in the remaining and easily identifiable 10 of the time the 9 rollback to zero and adds one to the next digits which in the simplest case subtract 9-1 from the running total but might cascade up through a series of 9s to subtract 99-1 999-1 etc

2052756

now .when i call try updates model it replace the subs list with a new one rather than just updating the isset properties at the correct index

2052813
return-type	arguments
.so the func has 2 arguments types and 1 return-type

2052814
json	xml
what you will find more and more obvious is the use of xml and json for data and communication between client and server applications

2052819
revision	updates	revision	svn
you d have to fetch the current revision numbers decrease it by one and svn updates to that revision until you find a building that works

2052833

2053001
twitter	tweets
the language i m using autoit does not really have the features needed to create a working oauth systemd unless anyone will prove me wrong please do .so my idea is to create a php scripting that my application will contact and then send the tweets through to twitter that way

2053020
contains	set
you could set the collation of the database field contains the accented character to utf8_general_ci to support them

2053021
dictionary	arrays
that is can i assume that the order of the numpy arrays created at each iterator from the dictionary will not vary

2053021
dictionary	arrays
for example if a dictionary has the format glucose 10 fructose 12 if an arrays created from this dictionary will always have the same order it doesn t matter what that order is as long as it s deterministic

2053026
firefox	safari
css3 makes it possible explanation description here but it s not widely supported yet only recent versioning of firefox and safari as well as other webkit-based browsers probably support it

2053033
scala	java

2053107
jquery	.post
to .post a from to the controllers via ajax call you can use the appropriate features of your client-side javascript libs if you have one for example .post and serialization in jquery

2053111
environment	building
this question is due to operation in an environment where most systemd are building on java which apparently allows for setting the cypher programmatically

2053111

2053209
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
if you re running in 32-bit mode even on a 64bit os specialfolder.programfiles and programfiles will return ..program files x86

2053209
32-bit	64bit
64bit system.in 32-bit process

2053213
web-config	app-config
the most likely reason for failure is that you are exposing an entity-framework objectcontext from another assembly and you haven t copy-paste the ef connection-string from the other app-config into the web-config this is required

2053214
value	field
but apparently copyfield is called on .source and dest before any analyzers are invoked .so even though i ve specified that dest is case-insensitive through anaylyzers the case of the value copy-paste from .source field are preserve

2053214
value	field
i m hoping to avoid re-transmitting the value in the field from the client at recording creation time

2053223
traversal	parent
will traversal the parent until it finds a ul

2053228
javascript	dom
my javascript say file 1 needs to fetch another javascript file say file 2 from my server and have it finish execution before the dom is done rendering

export	report
i have a report that rendering out text sometimes that text is a long string of characters and .when i export to words the columns that are generator are stretch out

2053251
realloc	malloc
oh and add error-checking on the call to malloc and realloc which was omitted in that answer because it was omitted in the questioner s code

2053251
linked-list	arrays
depending on the usage pattern and your requirements on code-complexity speed and memory use you might want a linked-list or you might want a hybrid list arrays strategy similar to the std deque class in c++

2053257
push	pull
i realize there is a webservice for querying list data using splistitem but that is a pull model not a push model

2053267
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
it seems to me like this is best handled on the java side with an objectinputstream objectoutputstream pair and classes that implements java.io.serializable and have their own writeobject and readobject methods

2053268
selected	button
.when i click the button browse in my control panels and selected a different image file to be display the paint event is not called after this action

2053424
dictionary	arrays
i would suggest creating an arrays and a dictionary one to hold all of your filepath and one to hold your arraysstructures

2053424
dictionary	arrays	arrays	loops
loops through the filepath arrays and do the exact thing that you were doing for each iterator except at the end of each iterator you should call addobject forkey arraysstructures dictionary

2053431
any	set
now let s say i don t know what is set for the onclientclick event and at runtime i need to read the function or any code set to onclientclick and run it

2053456

you can see that your code is repetitive .so what you need to do is extraction the similar component from each elements as a loops extraction the different compoenent as an input or output arrays and you are done

2053464
stable-sort	radix-sort
this can be solved in worst-case o n time using radix-sort with count sort as a stable-sort for each character positioning

2053496
shell	bash
or if you have modern shell such as bash

2053500
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem

2053500
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
assuming self is the uiviewcontroller of the view that s visible inside the uinavigationcontroller set

2053507
contains	elements
edit the elements keyword call returns the an enumerator contains the all of the keyword elements that are directly within the document-root

2053511
output	mode	buffering	streaming
.when you redirect the output of a program written in c++ the stdout streaming switches to buffering mode

2053511
buffering	streaming
the prompt is there it just never got fflush from the internal buffering to the streaming because the buffering didn t get filled to capacity

2053520
for-loop	arrays
i often use a for-loop with an arrays splice such as

2053529
google-maps	gps
i get some gps coordinates from google-maps and i need to find the distance between them

2053529
google-earth	google-maps
i have tested the value from google-maps by passing them back into google-earth and a geocoding on the internet and everything checked out

2053537
tokenize	parsing
you could write a php parsing with php using the tokenize extension but that would be crazy

2053557
salt	md5
i can envisage another developer accidently choosing the wrong algorithm and having some passwd as sha512 and some as md5 some with one salt and some with a different salt etc

2053559
user-interface	drawing
some use their own drawing widget construction others abstract the native user-interface elements

2053559
swing	awt	swing	swt	swt	awt
examples swing awt with bugs read below and qt with caveats or swt people seem to like it

2053561
binary-compatibility	compatibility
this makes it .so it is very easy to make changes that don t break .source compatibility but break binary-compatibility because .when you add a new methods to a traits along with an implementation you have to recompile everything that implements that traits .so that they will pickup that implementation

2053573
revision	svn
i was trying to have a base versioning numbers set in my target info for example 0.9.5 but then append my svn revision numbers at the end of it

2053581
swt	rcp
if you want your application s user-interface to be windows-like on windows mac-like on mac and .so on take a look at the swt and rcp technology that underpins eclipse

2053581
swing	awt
the downside if you want to call it that is that your application won t be able reuse any existing awt swing based libs

2053587
groovy	java
this is great news for those of us who love java and groovy

2053587
linux	osx
on osx you need to make a .app very simple and there are many launchd options for windows and linux too

i equally need help on limiting file types permitted for upload gif jpeg png only as well as the file size not more than 100kb

2053680
void	main
defined a modalviewdone protocols with - void modalviewdone id sender have your main view controllers adopt that protocols and implements the methods then defined the delegation in the other view controllerss as a properties of types

2053682
value	field
if the 4 typess really do have 3 common field each why don t you have those in a section which never gets hidden and have any only the information unique to each types in a special section which can be show or hidden .when the value of the selected elements is changed

2053698
access-control	authentication
but certainly once you have implements a spring-security based solution to authentication access-control it should be easy to apply it across multiple website with a unified user account-base .

2053708
display	height	display	width
as guffa said using the width and height attributes of the image tag just affects the way it is display by the browser

2053710
execution	exit
if it does you can use javascript to determine whether it supports what you are looking for and if not divert the execution to either a simpler path or to exit altogether

2053722
value	field
if the methods was not found reflect again to find a field of types system.windows.idataobject get its value and go back to step 1 recursion is safe here

2053748
formatting	printing
if you are really going to printing the matrix you need to think about formatting mainly column widths

2053756
shadowbox	jquery	shadowbox	lightbox	lightbox	jquery
we ve all seen the popular lightbox effects on the web jquery lightbox and shadowbox

2053764
command-line	cmd

2053793
sql-server	mysql
i m attempting to insert some data from mysql to sql-server

2053793
sql-server	mysql
how can i replace the r n strings in the mysql insert statements .so that they will end up as carriage returns in sql-server

2053796
any	set
.when you are done you want to uncheck the nszombieenabled variables for your executable because the systemd will not really free any memory while it is set

2053803
callback	methods
your async methods should call a callback which continue process

2053828
textbox	button
that means that both the button and the textbox can receive logical focus at the same time each in its own scoping

2053845
modal-dialog	lightbox
i think lightbox are useful wherever a modal-dialog pattern would be appropriate in the user-interface

2053862
ubuntu	linux
any of the new linux distros should be fine though ubuntu is very user friendly .when you are starting

2053862
emacs	vim
but do make an attempt to learn emacs vim

2053878
value	field
since you have set this field as the datatextfield for the control that value will always rendering

2053901
cos	sin
noting that cos 90âº - x sin x and sin 90âº - x cos x we can write

2053901
cos	sin
cos c sin ï ams

2053901
cos	sin
sin ï dub + cos ï ams

2053905
conditional	operators
that is the subquery generator a list of all id s that are in both tables .so the not in conditional is equivalent to an outer-join to operators and a simple test where o.id is null

2053905
conditional	operators
this means the case expression in your select-list is meaningless since it will certainly be 0 if your conditional match only visitor rows that don t match any rows in operators

2053906
mpfr	gmp
the rmpfr package r binding which interface to both gmp above and mpfr mpfr is in turn a contemporary implementation of gmp

2053906
mpfr	gmp
note to use either of the last two you ll need to install the native libs gmp and mpfr

2053914
configuration	environment
otherwise have a look at using the configurationsource attributes and storing the environment settings in 3 separate configuration files

2053936
highlight	cell
i derived a similar solution to change the highlight color for grouping table view cell

2053948
getter	setter
consider how many getter and setter you can get rid of

2053948
getter	setter
here s how you can have a person with no getter or setter involved in order a drink

2053948
getter	setter
and every time you write either a getter or a setter let a little voice in the back of your head ask you if there s a way to have the object export behavior rather than data

2053949
32-bit	64bit
im running 64bit osx and both libs are compiled for 64bit but i have a hunch that occ only likes 32-bit numbers still

subclassing	superclass
accessible no-args constructor a no-args constructor in the superclass visible to the subclassing

2054040
protected	public
that means it is either public or protected or if both classes are in the same package package access

2054040
subclassing	superclass
subclassinging constructor may specify as the first thing they do which constructor in the superclass to invoke before execution the code in the subclassing s constructor

2054040
subclassing	superclass
if the subclassing constructor does not specify which superclass constructor to invoke then the compiler will automatically call the accessible no-args constructor in the superclass

2054040
subclassing	superclass
if the superclass has no no-arg constructor or it isn t accessible then not specifying the superclass constructor to be called in the subclassing constructor is a compiler error .so it must be specified

2054040
constructor	private
this is also an error because base s no-args constructor is private

2054048
digits	zero
it s a slightly bizarre one in that it only seems to affect numberss with an even numbers of zero before the first non-zero digits and only if that digits is 5 or greater

2054051
contains	any
if you don t need the panels to contains any child controls you should consider using shape object tshape instead you could use a combinations of existing ones or create your own

2054064
constructor	object
object does have such a constructor .so if object is the only superclass there is no problem

2054074
environment	building
java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_07-b06

2054076
any	set
assuming the types of the mapped properties is an iesi set is there any difference between

2054080
javascript	dom
i do want to make just one suggestion though rather than having a massive escaped html string within a javascript variables you should just create a templates dom elements and clone it .when you need a copy of it

2054084
nswindow	nspanel
how do i show a sheet plain nswindow nspanel with and without the nice animation

2054084

2056379
contains	elements
to the iframe document s body elements you will also need to add the allowtransparency attributes to the iframe elements in the contains document

2056379
json	xml
maybe there s another source you can use for the data that provides it in a different format such as xml or json

2056380
put	get
--its probably something simple but i cant get what im supposed to put as linker its using gcc here..

2056386
base-class	inherited
also what about if i wanted to turn it around and execute base-class code first followed by the inherited class code

2056415
concat	where
ghostscript can concat where the bookmarks are preserve but i experienced trouble where it in one case failed to generator any output.pdf

2056415
tcpdf	fpdi
the same document could i successfully merge with fpdi + tcpdf however bookmarks wasn t preserve

2056424
.net	wcf
i can get a .net client to talk to the esb toolkit wcf service esb.itineraryservices.wcf processitinerary.svc with no problem at all however we use a client technology that cannot process wshttpbindings at all it can only see the basichttpbinding

2056425
g++	gcc
try g++ instead of gcc or throw out the c++ code libs

2056430
wicket	spring
i receive a task for a project which uses spring hibernate and wicket

2056434
order	add
add a selected min p.price as price and then order by price

2056435
filtering	grouping
in short my question is how do you prefer to expose filtering sorted grouping observablecollection to views in waf

2056435
filtering	sorting
i think the following prinicple applies if the filtering sorting functionality is a properties of the view only an alternate view might legitimately not provide such functionality then collectionview should be used in the view with code-behind as necessary

2056435
filtering	sorting
if the filtering sorting functionality is a dimension of the model then this can be dealt with in the viewmodel or model by other means

2056449
http-request	postdata
i think you mean if it is a simple html based form i can easily construct an http-request using libcurl that submit the same query-string or postdata as using a browser would. i m going to proceed on that assumption

2056453
entity	poco
aside from faster development time visual-studio 2010 beta 2 has no t4 templates for building poco entity object that i m aware of are there any advantages to using the traditional entityobject entities that entity-framework creates by default

2056504
triggers	insert
you could write an insert triggers that does this for you

2056552
ruby-on-rails	django
i don t know ruby-on-rails but i know how i d do it in django

2056583
filtering	sorting
but for most things searching filtering sorting paging etc you can just fetch the data page s you actively need from the database which often isn t nearly as many

2056590
notepad++	textmate
i believe that notepad++ is a similar tool for windows but i am unsure if it is as customizable as textmate

2056617
contains	elements
where params is a map contains the field submited for the controllers which the key are the named of the input elements you defined on your gsp file

2056633
any	set
set the httponly flag on any cookies

2056633
ip-address	proxy
note that you can t rely on the client ip-address not changing some isps use load-balanced proxy mid session but the browser headers don t change - however thats not going to help in an attack from someone who knows what they are doing

2056641
value	field
the problem was that there was no proper key defined on the model for the view it had set about 6 field as the key which would still not give a unique value

2056647
python	c++
since you are writing your main program in c++ you can do whatever you want to protect your python files

2056649
ubuntu	linux
test platform but the production home will be a linux machine ubuntu 9.1 perl 5.10 64bit activeperl 64bit

2056661
selected	button
i want to load editor with for example selected bold button or with rtl directions instead of ltr defaultly

2056745
stderr	stdout
the popen object is effectively just a wrapper for the child process pid stdin stdout and stderr plus some convenience functions for using those

2056745
launchd	daemons
the proper way to approach this is to launchd the child as a daemons like tobu suggested

2056748
authentication	login
the user authentication on the first domain we encrypt the login details and redirect them to a known page on the second domain log them in there and then redirect back to the original server

2056752
python	java
i m new to java and i d like to create some class-variables that are dynamically calculated .when accessed as you can do in python by using the properties methods

2056752
python	java
what is the java equivalent of python properties

2056759
ip-address	proxy
for me the problem was that i forgot to exclude my mac s ip-address from the windows browser s proxy settings i was using a corporate proxy in the browser

2056760
if-statement	while-loop
if it s null the program will not get into the while-loop and will go directly to the first if-statement after the while-loop

2056762
getter	setter
do you want to create new field getter setter in the class

2056772
order	add
make views field in articles increment it .when the recording is viewed and then add it into order by clause

2056775
json	xml
the .html view works showing the correct jsp view too but nothing else i tried for getting json and xml up and running seems to work setting the defaultviews properties was just one of the things i tried

2056781
getter	setter
you have to write all the getter and setter explicit by yourself

2056781
getter	setter
you might want to have a look at project lombok which provides the annotations getter and setter that are somewhat similar to python properties

2056801
sql-server	oracle
the table in variables in oracle not the same as table variabless in ms sql-server

2056801
sql-server	oracle
but if you want something in oracle that does exactly the same as table-variable of sql-server you can use cursor

2056840
sql-server	mysql
is there a good query analyzer for mysql that s either free or has a trial that can analyse a query and make suggestions for indexes like the display estimated execution plan in microsoft sql-server management studio

2056842
terminate	timeout
they will be terminate after a timeout

2056853
uisegmentedcontrol	uilabel
i have a uisegmentedcontrol that has six segments i want them to call a methods .when the value changes but also .when each segment gets a uicontroleventtouchdragin because i want a uilabel to show up with it s named .when the person is trying to selected something on it and drag their finger across the control but the segmented control does not sen this call even .when i drag into the thing

2056899
arrays	loops
if i remember it correctly php runs loops with an empty arrays because that is the result-of the dynamic types cast from not an arrays into arrays

2056908
contains	any	value	field
basically what i have is an arrays of ids and i want to return any recording where a particular field contains any of the value

2056918
entity-framework	nhibernate	entity-framework	data-access	data-access	nhibernate
dao data-access object entity-framework or nhibernate

2056919
ref	out
foo param1 in type1 param2 in type1 c out ref cursor

2056928
getter	setter
as others have noted java has getter and setter but there is no strict analogon

2056928
getter	setter
there is a third party libs called project lombok tha uses annotations to generator the getter and setter in the .class files at comile time

2056932
default	reset
one option is to use setsyscolors to change the active-window caption colour .when your application has focus and to reset it to the default .when it loses focus

2056963
python	java
the tags say you re using python .so this might not be particularly useful but i do know there s a pure java implementation of git jgit which might work on the .app engine

2056963
python	java
it doesn t look like you can really call java code from python but you could use a separate instances that you create yourself and use some sort of secure communication channel between this and your .app

2056982
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
in some cases asp.net webforms with a direct queries into the database will be the most appropriate architecture in some cases asp.net-mvc will be the right architecture in some cases a windows forms application built on top of a web service that connect to a relational-database through an orm like linq-to-sql or nhibernate

2056982
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
if i need a common set of queries that i m likely to need from multiple-projects i ll write them as stored-procedures to get the performance benefits and building a data-access-layer that will leverage these stored-procedures to give me standardsized business-objects in a standards dal data-access-layer bol business object layer bll business-logic-layer approach

2056982
asp.net-mvc	webforms	any	set
this is advantageous because it means that once i ve got this set of libs built i can float any application over the top - for instances a webforms or asp.net-mvc application

2056990
protected	public
if you are storing the data as a public private static protected variables in one of your classes it would be best to store it as a stdclass

2056991
constructor	object
this has the downside that i theoretically could have any object of any type...on the other hand i could just throw an illegalstateexception in the constructor if t was not one of the 4 allowed types.

2057006
boost	stl
you can either use those from boost or ones supplied with your stl if modern enough

2057069
required	checked
it is therefore required by the specifications that all object stored in the session must be serialization although most servlet containers also tomcat do not checked this explicit

2057073
boost	stl
if you have some unexplained phobia against stl or boost you can always pull your own smart pointers class with relative ease if you don t required super exception-handling safety

2057075
subclassing	base-class
have a base-class with the common parts then subclassing and add what you need

2057085
hashmap	arrays
and then go over the file line by line parsing each line and saving the stuff to some internal data storage arrays hashmap

2057085
parsing	comma
and of course if you do use the csv comma separated value format it s better to go for a csv libs to do the parsing for you instead of writing the parsing yourself

2057093
put	get
if i put the types definition above the function i get an error

2057093
put	get
before i get to this solution i want to put another guard in the list of guard

2057112
contains	any
will i gain any performance if i go through and create clustered index s that only contains the columns involved in my join and nothing else

2057125
getter	setter
it s not about generator getter and setter for member variables

2057130
floating-point-precision	numerical
anyway floating-point-precision issues are quite likely more relevant in numerical algorithms usually

2057137
hide	show
show hide nested ul on hover

2057158
prerequisites	installshield
installshield does not provide a built-in way to pause your install and direct a user to a downloading although you could certainly create a prerequisites which runs an custom executable to do this

2057169
expression-blend	silverlight
i am developing a sketchflow silverlight project in expression-blend 3

2057171
digits	short
according to the documentation a single m is month named short and yy is four digits year.

2057177
autotools	cmake
if you compile opencv using cmake which is now preferred over autotools i believe the new python binding are actually the default while the swig binding are disabled

2057179
linux	unix
on a unix or linux systemd that should do it

2057180
value	field
non-clustered indexes repeat the include field with pointers to the rows that have that value

2057180
duplicates	lookup
you can further optimise by using include columns in your index - this duplicates the row information directly into the index which can remove the performance penalty of having to lookup the row itself to perform the selected

2057180
order	join
it is useful to pay attention to the order in which your join occur - the sequences of columns in your index should match up to this

2057238
.net	wcf
i would suggest you use wcf instead of .net web-services

2057268
difference	count
the only difference would be some arrays with pairs of string positioning in textarea - tootl tip text and while user mouse_over the textarea function count what positioning is user over and looks up in arrays for adequate tooltip

2057274
http	ssl
tls transport level security is the slightly broader term that has replace ssl secure sockets layer in securing http communication

2057283
directory	folder
if you need want to organise your plugins folder - use the zend underscore.js directory naming conventions - .so this

2057289
margins	padding
have you checked if the labels is having some top margins or padding applied on it or some css rules with vertical-align middle

2057319
google-chrome	firefox
webgl is include in the latest versioning of google-chrome and firefox

2057361
comma	words
the points is i don t know in advance how many comma separates the words

2057397
children	nodes
xnodes.tostring returns the xml representation of the nodes and its children

2057438
put	get
if i put some more other panelgroups after one i get as result 1 span class which include all other input and labels

2057442
contains	set
if your ihttphandler implementation contains state perhaps setup in the constructor and later used in processrequest then it can sometimes be useful to set isreusable to false

2057459
imageview	textview
each view row in this listview is a linearlayout which contains 3 views - checkbox imageview and a textview horizontal

2057459
highlight	selected
instead in each row which should be highlight as a result-of the scrolling the textview becomes selected and i know that since i set the textview to be ticking truncateat.marquee

2057464
linked-list	hashmap
recently i implements a lru caching using a linked-list spread over a hashmap

2057486
.when	ready
.when install macports automatically updates your .profile to include opt local bin in your path and .so .when mvim is install as opt local bin mvim during the install of macvim you ll find it ready to use straight away

2057490
authentication	login
on a successful login i want to load my own custom page for the authentication user called person mainpage

2057516
selected	checkbox
you ll receive in mycheckbox a list of the value of only those checkbox that were selected

2057523
http-get	get
here actually i am trying to get the body of my get request and removing the http-headers from the http-get request s response

2057535
attributes	properties
it creates a page parameter and because of value attributes not required it is assign to coursehome.courseid properties

2057558
icollection	ienumerable
even if you returned your list as a readonly interface say ienumerable or icollection nothing prevents a caller from performing a runtime cast and getting at the list

2057565
versioning	upgrade
to fix this problem either install wasce in a path without spaces or upgrade to the latest versioning available

2057576
hide	show
another idea i have is to use cookies s to checked if a user has chosen to hide a messages i think this would be faster but maybe not as good since user can login with differnt computers and if a new messages is show they may not see it right away

2057576
hide	show
however if i decide i need to .post a new admin messages for all users to see then even a user who chose to hide and not show the admin messages will still see it again until they choose to never see it again

2057604
twitter	bit.ly
all the twitter status updates on the wordpress sidebar have bit.ly links

2057605
ubuntu	linux
i m using netbeans on linux ubuntu 9.04 to building a c project

2057613
difference	zero
as with other objectives the numbers for each individual were around the zero mark which meant that a single comment about someone could mean the difference between infinite exceeded and did not meet

2057616
code-reuse	legacy
legacy code-reuse - all we have to do is get our legacy code and throw it on the .lib or src folder and it s done

2057624
logout	login
and logout login

2057638
linux	osx
i guess it s something similar in linux or osx

2057659
callback	methods
to get rid of the messages you d just have the close button triggers an ajax callback to a methods on the server that takes the messages id

2057662
c++	lua
store the table in a c++ class by holding a pointers to the lua state and the reference returned for the table as specified using this api

2057673
directory	folder
however if you use compression then the current working directory will be some sub-folder in your temp folder rather than the directory where your setup.exe is

2057679
triggers	insert
use triggers to capture the insert updates and delete and log your entries to a new table

2057737
tuples	set	unique	words
then you need to insert or updates the appropriate tuples entity for each set of 3 unique words in your text

2057749
basic	vb6
it was written in vb6 and was able to take a words document and turn basic formatting information - lists bold italic and even tables into html which was upload to the server

2057765
altera	xilinx
however both altera and xilinx have had their free limited versioning for long enought you would be safe using them

2057765
verilog	vhdl
since you would be just writing standards verilog or vhdl you could take your source to another vendor just like c

2057767
swing	awt
automatically added to all components in the whole tree of awt swing components

2057774
python	perl
binding for perl and python would be a bonus

2057778
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
hittest is used by the framework to determine which view is being hit and thus which view to send the touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended touchescancelled messages to

2057789
put	get	display	width
put it in an absolutely-positioned div then use clientwidth to get the display width of the tag

2057804
buildpath	libs
do i have to add the libs to the buildpath somewhere else

2057809
selected	button
also is there a built-in browse button to selected a file from disk

2057818
silverlight	wpf
for wpf or silverlight have a look at prism

2057819
contains	elements
the document contains two absolutely-positioned elements a and a

2057819
specifications	w3c
is this documented in w3c specifications

2057819
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
ps i tested this page with ie 7 ie 8 opera 10.10 safari 4.0.4 google-chrome 3.0 firefox 3.5 all rendering the document exactly the same on win7 x64

2057823
any	set	virtual-functions	base-class
is there any issue with partially overrides a set of virtual-functions defined by a base-class

2057825
linguistics	term
if this is the case then there are a few things to consider first of all neither from the perspective of computational linguistics nor of theoretical linguistics is it clear what the term semantic similarity means exactly

2057829
hash	md5
it calculates the md5 hash of the passwd after converting it to utf-8

2057836
put	get
simply put i d like someone to be able to click a link and get a one-time-use pdf

2057840
istream	ostream
.when i use ostream istream i seem to be restrict to using byte aligned

2057867
parsing	comma
the problem is that on form-submit the value sent in the .post include the comma forcing me to parsing as a string on the server side

2057881
internet-explorer	firefox
on internet-explorer a contenteditable div creates a new paragraph each time you press enter whereas firefox creates a tag

2057904
derived-class	base-class
you can avoid this by adding a using directive to the derived-class that import the overloads from the base-class

2057914
background-image	transparency
.when i had a 1x1px semi-transparency png set as a background-image on a div with css ie would rendering this as a funky vertical transparency gradient

2057934
firefox	opera
this limit is increased to 50 by firefox and to 30 by opera but ie6 and ie7 enforce the limit of 20 cookies per domain

2057936
installation	upgrade
the only other alternative i can think of is to have the new installation stop the service of the old installation but this is undesirable because it required the installation to have information about all old installation that it can upgrade stopping this particular service may involve more than just a simple call to the service manager to stop it

2057948
revision	svn
getting the head revision from svn would be like doing a get latest... in vss

2057957
environment	building	environment	execution
in practice however running every test in a test suite often means adding execution time of minutes or hours to building time depending on size of codebase and building environment - which is prohibitively expensive for a developer and continuous-integration environment both of which required rapid turnaround to provide relevant response

2057957
environment	building
the ability to specodeigniterfy explicodeignitert test lists allows the developer codeigniter environment and final building environment to selectively target bits of funcodeigniteronality without sacrificodeigniterng quality control or impacting overall productivity

2057987
unicode	wstring
as mike weller pointed out if unicode macros is defined then the strings will be and hence you would have to use std wstring instead

2058013
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch is definitely slower since a throw exception-handling causes stack information to be gathered

2058029
attributes	properties
after the document has been parsing and the dom tree has been created the elements s attributess are really just properties of the individual dom object .so while you could remove the attributes from the .source it will still be present but empty on each object in the dom

2058058
stderr	stdout
if you re looking at this as a diagnostic tool i recommend redirecting your application log to stdout and then redirecting both stdout and stderr into a file

2058062
contains	set
each form contains it s own set of field and always contains one or more blocks of field which are the same for multiple forms

2058074
profiling	debugging
also have a look at creating a debugging and profiling agent with jvmti

2058082
subtraction	addition
is it better to defined the types say addition subtraction conditional control flow elsewhere and just bring them together as predefinedd types in the union

2058092
macros	vba
in excel a line break within a cell is encode as ascii code 10 n determined through the handy use of the macros recorder and inspector of the generator vba

2058124
instances	private
we use static class-variables to shared data between all the instancess of the class and we use static-methods preferably private static to compute something required for the class functionality but independent of the class instances state

2058133
getter	setter
which is closer to the c++ call i guess assuming these are declare as properties or have getter and setter

2058138
object-detection	viola-jones
does anyone know of a purely matlab implementation of haar feature extraction the kind used in viola-jones object-detection algorithm

2058141
istream	std
i m searching for a solution that allows sdl_rwops to be used with std istream

2058143
.when	ready
you can do this in a thread and .when the thread is ready connection established it can send a messages back to the main thread to let it know that the dbx connection is now available

2058158
getattr	setattr
attribute-handling built-in and special methods getattr setattr __getattr__ __setattr__ ... work just the same way across the single namespace of the object whether referring to plain attributes or not

2058158
python	ruby
in ruby methodss and attributess of an object live in separate namedspaces .so you can have an object with a methods and an attributes with the same named which in python you can t and just mentioning an argument-less methods implicit call it .so might be just taking an attributes reference or it might be calling a.b

2058161
ref	out
do i need to use the out or ref keyword since this is a class i am passing

2058176
protected	public
why is readonlyobservablecollection.collectionchanged protected and not public as the corresponding observablecollection.collectionchanged is

2058189
.war	jar
also .war file is about 20m including jar libs around 500 classes and 200 compiled jsp pages

stack are used for expression evaluation eg in a calculator or your compiler first the expression is converted to rpn then a simple stack machine is used to evaluate

2058191
credentials	security
it seems that for some reason the authentication credentials cannot be found in the security context

2058193
ref	out
no you do not want ref or out here

2058194
show	next
the next time any javascript code execute firebug will break into the debugger and show you that line of code

2058195
ref	out
if this is what you mean by modify the instances then you you don t need ref or out

2058208
value	field
here is my question why should i use autoincremental field as primary key on my tables instead of something like uuid value

2058211
ref	out
if the reference b is not being modified and only b s properties are being modified then you need neither ref nor out

2058211
ref	out
i ve expanded your sample code a bit to include usage for ref out and neither

2058227
32-bit	64bit
for most practical purposes 32-bit or 64bit int can server well as the primary key

2058262
private-key	rsa
breaking a particular rsa public key and retrieving the private-key required factorization

2058262
private-key	rsa
the process of constructing an rsa public private-key pair include primality testing

2058264
nattable	swt
or ktable nattable nebulagrid but they are for swt

2058300
put	get
to get the image glued to only the last work of the link you can either take the last words out of the link or put the image in and then the same non-breaking spaces between the last words and the image will give you the layout you want

2058304
subtract	add
first to get the edges effects between different colored areas add or subtract some fractions of the r g and b channels to the textures image

2058320
ref	out
the right way to think about this is use ref out .when you want to create an alias to a variables

2058328
boolean	int
just i mean _i to be class proper named not int which handle some boolean for example operations f with same meaning for all classes

2058334
click	mouse
.when i look at a given call i want to be able to reference every data types every related call and any other details of the api with just a mouse click

2058346
export	report
if you want to design your own just think of all the data that might be useful as variables all the data that might be useful for troubleshooting problems and all the data you might want to have to run managments report about import and export process

2058371
google-maps	openlayers	openlayers	mapserver
i would like to improve the performance of my application that display thematic maps using openlayers google-maps mapserver with tilecache

compact-framework	.net
i used once bitblt to save a screenshot to an image file .net compact-framework v3.5 windows-mobile 2003 and later

2058380
formatting	import
you might be able to just import it as a module and then write it back out after formatting it

2058383
command-line	cmd
execute systemd fork - any of the cmd can you help executeute command-line programs with varying levels of control blocking nonblocking

2058390
shell	bash
awk is typically line oriented and bash is a shell with limited numbrer of string manipulation functions

2058405
instrumentation	profiling
however .when i create a new profiling of types instrumentation in vs 2008 and run the profiling the report show my main function calling run but in turn .when viewing the caller callee report for my run methods the report show that the run methods is the bottom of stack

2058424
delta	diff
vc++ 8 supports this a delta on previous revision and it makes quite a bit of perf diff in frequently used code

2058429
configuration	installation
after installation users on some target computers get the following error messages after launchd the application executable â œthis application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect

no they are not the same and yes linux shell programming books should have significant portions or be entirely about bash scripting

2059201
ubuntu	linux	shell	bash
ubuntu is a distribution of linux which contains bash as an available shell

i know you could add all the key to an arrays and add it to one side of the dictionary but i m curious how you can add or insert a value at a certain points in the dictionary

2059406
python	ruby
ruby has gem and other installation tools that are probably similar to python

value	field
basically .when you pass some value into the form and it s not valid you just rendering the site again but django will automagically fill field

2059422
subclassing	superclass
it looks like you should be able to subclassing nspredicateeditor and overrides predicateforrow declare in nspredicateeditor s superclass nsruleeditor and do your substitution there

2059427
put	get
or you could put a comment inside the elements and use dom methods to get the comment object and extraction its data

but how could i deselect the other button that were selected i just want one button selected

2059461
superclass	inherited
a class can inherited from one superclass and can implements as many interfaces as it wishes

2059461
inherited	accessor
the missing inherited features such as overrides abstract virtual accessor etc are missing from interfaces not from interface inherited

2059465
instances	self
.so if you are actually using myadvanceddate which extends date youre always going to get an instances of the parent because self and __class__ are always going to refer to the class the methods is actually in

2059470
configuration	environment
it is show how to avoid checked of signed assemblies .when an .app runs in a non- or slow-connected environment by using the generatepublisherevidence tag in the .app s configuration file

silverlight	wpf
i found a silverlight s visualtreehelper.findelementsinhostcoordinates methods but apparently it s not available in wpf

2059496
contains	set
the way you describe your needs it sounds like you want the web service to contains a non-trivial amount of logic - perhaps not as complex logic as the final production web service but a set of heuristics rules at least

2059519
cos	sin
sin angle disty hypotenuse and cos angle distx hypotenuse assuming x and y rise up and to the right

2059523
masstransit	nservicebus
have a look at nservicebus or masstransit

2059532
getter	setter
many javascript engines support getter and setter on javascript-objects

2059539
getter	setter
you can do it using rhino 1.6r6 or higher with javascript getter and setter

2059539
getter	setter
now if we wanted to instead defined getter and setter within the context of our object prototype and where having private data is less of a concern we can then use an alternative object syntax for that

2059542
getter	setter
rhino versioning 1.6r6 support getter and setter you could write something like this

2059545

2059680
arrays	loops	digits	zero
the obvious solution is to do a loops from the first to the last numbers convert the counter to a string with or without zero to the left extraction each digits and use it as an index to increment an arrays of 10 int

2059680
digits	zero
for digits 0 if not using leading zero n 10 n-1 - 10 n -1 9 are needed

2059680
digits	zero
for digits 0 if using leading zero n 10 n-1 - n are needed

2059680
digits	zero
for digits 0 without leading zero we need 6 10 5 â 10 6 -1 9 600 000 - 111 111 488 889

2059680
digits	zero
for digits 0 with leading zero we need 6 10 5 â 6 599 994

2059680
digits	zero
digitss 0 - -power adjust digits 0 leading zero formula

2059680
digits	zero
if range 700 to 1 000 with leading zero is needed use the algorithm for 10 700 to 11 000 and then subtract 1 000 - 700 300 from the count of digits 1

2059690
exception-handling	try-catch
the advantage of this in the .net world at least is an easier-to-use domain surface and more succinct and readable code no huge try-catch blocks or roundabout exception-handling mechanisms

2059705
defined	declare
if the class class is later defined as a member of different namespace - it is a completely different class that has nothing to do with the one you declare here

2059710

perl and ruby have the __end__ and __data__ tokens that allow embedding of arbitrary data directly inside a source code file

2059716
samba	jcifs
i don t think there is an out of the box ant task for that but you could easily building one around jcifs a java implementation of the samba libs

2059720
required	checked
i m not sure if there is a better methods but you could use sfvalidatoror to checked if one of the field validation i.e set required to true

2059730
configuration	environment	environment	building
there is no easy or mathematical formula to predict scale in the description you gave if you or your company are serious about this then the best way is to building a performance scalability test environment where you can easily setup teardown various client configuration and send load at them to see how they will do

2059730
environment	building
because you are building custom components one poorly written component or missing index can mess everything up .so having an environment like this is where you can iron these things out before giving to the client

2059739
linux	unix	linux	osx
unless you are a mac osx unix linux cygwin or mingw user of course in which case tr and tr -s will be part of your daily arsenal.

2059762
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms

2059788
modifiers	final
final modifiers in certain cases is only used to ensure const-correctness

2059800

inherited hierarchies are there to model the notion of i can use an instances of a derived-class anywhere that an instances of a base-class is required right

2059814
generic-list	dataset
i d recommend you covert the dataset to a generic-list and use linq to sort

2059818
octal	hex	decimal	hex	decimal	octal
according to the documentation valueof only takes strings that can be interpreter as signed decimal value while decode takes decimal hex or octal strings prefixed by 0x # or 0 - though valueof is overloaded to also take the radix explicit

2059832
octal	hex
the decode methods allows you to specify the radix hex octal in the string itself using 0x 0x or # for hex and 0 as a prefix for octal numberss while valueof allows you to pass the radix as a numbers 8 or 16 as an optional parameter

2059835
arrays	loops
is alias to the value in the arrays - this allows you to modify the arrays inside loops

2059852
python	perl
there are ways of accomplishing this even with plain .cmd files using environment variables however if you can use something more sophisticated like perl python etc

2059863
scons	jam
see it appears to still be more widely used than newer improved alternatives such as scons jam rake cook and others

2059865
16-bit	8bit	unsigned	short
at 48bits per pixels with 16-bit per color you can t return an 8bit value you must return a 16-bit short or unsigned short otherwise the data gets truncated

2059869
unsigned	short
simply read your data as uint16_t or unsigned short and you get the 16-bit extraction properly

2059882
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i can see no rendering difference with the default stylesheets in ie firefox opera or google-chrome

2059882
radio	click
notably in the typical graphical-based browser you can click the labels to focus the associated control and tick it for checkbox radio which is handy because otherwise it s quite a small target to hit

2059895
googletest	cppunit
are there any frameworks out there like googletest or cppunit that solely focus on unit-testing threads thread pool thread queue and such

2059913
similarity	distance
for other types of data you might have to assign a score to each data point--a similarity metrics might i suppose in a sense that s actually what the search result order is an distance from the top of the list

2059918
memcached	ehcache
i m looking for information on things like ehcache and other alternatives to memcached for a project that will likely involve 3-4 webserver and something like 2-10 million distribute object that need to be available to all servers

2059918
memcached	ehcache
for example in looking at documentation for things like ehcache it s not clear to me if by distribute they mean a strategy similar to memcached or something more like replicated synchronized

2059920
children	nodes
what i would like to do is display an unordered list of root nodes with another unordered list inside each child that al.so contains children and .so on

2059924
typedef	struct
alternatively you can typedef it as datastruct if don t want to use the struct everywhere

2059932
attributes	properties
ideally i d like to specify the domain model object as a metaclass via a metadata attributes this is also often referred to as buddy class but that doesn t work since xval throw .when the metadata class has properties that are not present on the viewmodel

2059938
png	gif
example or png or gif will return true

2059946

i m trying to set the where-clause on a linqdatasource object bound to a gridview programmatically on a button click but .when the gridview rebinds data for instances .when the user sorts the where-clause resets back to the empty string

2060009
png	gif
i suggest making a http head request .so you won t need to downloading the entire image and then based on the string returned parsing and make sure the content-type is an image jpeg image pjpeg image gif image png or similar image content-type

2060016
firefox	safari
if you need to get the exact same behavior in all browsers and want to add the deactivated scrollbar to firefox and safari checked my recent question

2060020
text-editor	editor
since this seems like a good idea i have started programming .some scripting and editor add-on to do this very kind of thing .so that the user of a text-editor can open or operate on links of the following styles

2060020

i m trying to use jquery user-interface to make a block of text draggable and later droppable and resizable

2060117
jnetpcap	libpcap
the underlying libpcap c libs that they both wrap has continue to evolve .so i would go with jnetpcap for that rea.son

2060125
webserver	upload
it has to be upload from the user s browser to your webserver and even high-speed broadband connections tend to have much slower upload speeds

2060133
silverlight	wpf
i would like to understand the general requirements for wpf silverlight layout for making it possible to implements pan zoom drag and zoom features

2060141
order	add
to have consistent results you will need to add at least more column to the order by clause

2060145
boolean	int
it uses the macros null which is equivalent to the int constants zero and zero in a boolean context is treated as false

2060152
actionscript	mxml
since repeater component won t generator radiobuttongroup in mxml and since i can t do the same through actionscript because radiobuttongroup doesn t have an id properties .when i try to create it that way is there a way to disable radiobuttons at all

2060152
actionscript	mxml
i also tried actionscript approach but with httpservice mxml component to fetch xml file

2060160
checkbox	button
there is a checkbox in column 1 of both listview and a button on the page

2060169
google-chrome	firefox
i wrote this code and it is working nicely in google-chrome but .when it comes to firefox and other major browsers it is not even changing a little bit thing

2060170
row	col
the third digits specifies the order of that particular subplot windows relative to the other subplot windowss--in this case this is the first plot which places it on row 1 hence plot numbers 1 row 1 col 1

2060170
row	col
the arguments passed to the second call to add_subplot differs from the first only by the trailing digits a 2 instead of a 1 because this plot is the second plot row 2 col 1

2060170
row	col
the third right-most digits in each of the four arguments encode the order of that particular plot windows in the 2 x 2 matrix--ie row 1 col 1 1 row 1 col 2 2 row 2 col 1 3 row 2 col 2 4

2060176
contains	elements
then there is a tab object that contains the data methods related to the tab showthrobber hidethrobber reload and creating the actual dom elements for the tab

2060176
hide	show
it makes sense to have the controllers tell other tabs to hide and tell the new tab to show

2060176
hide	show
but it also makes sense to have the tab tell all the other tabs to hide and then show itself

2060221
.net	wcf
.when using a .net environment 3.5 using traditional web-services no wcf which is better and why

2060229

2060236
getter	setter
at first i figured that is making two call instead a block first the setter and then the getter to gather the return-value

2060236
getter	setter
however instrumenting the setter and getter methods with nslog call proves this isn t the case

2060258
configuration	environment
the idea being that this would make deployment easier since instead of modifying the configuration files we simply set the ip-address of the fake domain named on the environment hosts files

2060261
textbox	button
however since you didn t ask that yet the simple answer is just that on button click event you should initializer a new textbox and insert it into the controls before the button

2060262
any	set
does any one know the rss feed for 3.0 iphone sdk .doc set

2060267
hide	show
internally it would ask the tabset to hide all other tabs and show itself

2060267
hide	show
i m assuming exactly one tab must be show at all time .so there s no points in having a public methods to hide an individual tab

2060276
arguments	default
scala 2.8 introduced default and named arguments which made possible the addition of a new copy methods that scala adds to case classes

2060278

2060335
json	xml
solr is a nice search server built based on lucene that supports rest-like xml and json apis

2060363
32-bit	64bit
the problem is that we only have a 32-bit drivers and the install simply won t run on our 64bit servers

2060367
.net	wcf
in .net 3.5 the wcf clientbase 1 class base-class for generator client proxy was updates to use caching channelfactories channels

2060367
constructor	object
consequently unless you re using one of the client use creation strategies which disables caching client constructor that takes in a binding object or accessing one of a few certain properties before the backing channel is created even though you re creating a new client instances it could very well still be using the same channel

2060368
websphere	ibm
supposing that i have a standards ear file and the source files that were used to generator it what additional process needs to be done to convert it to an ibm websphere enhanced ear

2060369
swing	awt
unfortunately awt components don t have the setopaque properties like swing components do .so they are rectangular

i could copy the same background-color as the parent but if you wanted to display this on top of some data it would be pretty obvious

2060384
any	set
cmd is for any extensible and composable set of actions

2060398
32-bit	64bit
looking in qt s source code in the file src gui kernel qwindowdefs.h you ll find that wid is typedef d to long for 64bit osx it s int for 32-bit osx

2060400
fflush	gets
except in your case where you exit the program right after writing and have the unfortunate luck to run out of disk spaces at the exact moment the buffering gets fflush

2060404
unique	words
that code looks like a fragment of something which count unique words which isn t your problem

2060408
unique	words
the key in the map would be unique wordss and the value would each be lists of wordss that followed that unique words

2060409
any	set
there is never going to be any set answer it is something you need to feel out for yourself

2060432
parsing	comma
i have a text file its comma delimited with some field wrapped around in double-quotes .when i parsing through it using this

widget	button
to submit a widget for review the user click a button which also does a put to myapp widget 123 but now the form-data just has has one field a status of submitted i don t send all the form-data again just the field i want to change

2060474
value	field
it is sooo tempting to pass an action field along with the form-data with a value like updates or submit for review in the put

2060482
derived-class	inherited
note that you do not need to explicit list inherited from idisposable in the definition of the derived-class

2060509
web-applications	enterprise
for web-applications understanding at least at a rudimentary level the patterns describe in patterns of enterprise application architecture has proven valuable to me

2060509

i usually don t use singleton except as a client of logging and service-locator dependency-injection tools

2060509
activerecord	datamapper	datamapper	poeaa

2060509
ruby-on-rails	django
most of those are probably more usefully learned by starting with an opinionated web development framework like ruby-on-rails django or castle-monorail than in the abstract

2060510
required	checked
waitforsingleobject on a win32 event handle allows you to detection the required signals pseudo-immediately depending on what other threads in your process are doing and not do redundant checked how many needless loops do you have to execute before the signals arrives

put	get
you can model the basic functionality with .post put and get

2060534
put	get
.when a widget needs review get it and put it back with the needs-review updates

2060543
javascript	dom
my question now is how can i transform this into a dom elements structure to create javascript which will remove the elements

2060545
hashmap	arrays
the heart of the problem is probably that you re filling your heap with weakreference-object the weak-references are cleared .when you re getting low on memory but the reference object themselves are not .so your hashmap is filling up with boat-load if weakreference object not to mention the object arrays the hashmap uses which will grow indefinitely all points to null

2060545
triggers	insert
this is exactly how weak hashmap works where the poll is simply triggers on insert

2060551
google-chrome	firefox
tried with firefox 3.5.7 google-chrome

one is to have a that holds the link between a button and its related textbox and use that in the click event for the button both button can be hooked up to the same event handler

2060609
textbox	button
yes it is basically you need to keep a reference to the button that was click and then a mapping of a textbox to each button

2060619
python	java
in python i ve made it with a hash of strings named of tags to lambda self.methodname and i want to translation it to java

2060636
arrays	loops
you re using for..in to loops through the indexes of the arrays

2060636
arrays	loops
for..in loops through the properties named of an object not the indexes of an arrays and therefore this usage break in non-trivial situations

2060638

2060663
void	main
public static void main string arguments

2060669

websphere	ibm
an enhanced ear is an ear with some xml files added to the meta-inf directory to configure specific resources at the application-server or cell level see the ibm redbook websphere application-server v7 packaging applications for deployment for more details on this

2060743
websphere	ibm
updates ibm provides ant tasks for websphere that you could also use from maven using the maven-antrun-plugin this seems to be the preferred way but i don t think that wsdefaultbinding is exactly what you re looking for default ibm websphere binding don t offer the same features than enhanced ear - but they might be useful and enough though

2060789
constructor	private
first static constructor cannot be public private

2060797
sql-server	mysql
for example this works with sql-server and should be faster because it eliminates the need to go to the tags table twice but will fail on mysql because mysql doesn t do ctes

2060814
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
they show up correctly in ie 8 firefox google-chrome opera etc

2060864
oracle	mysql
oracle has made similar sounding pronouncements with regards to mysql

2060864
oracle	mysql
people may scoff but i think oracle will keep mysql going partly because larry thinks they can make money from it but also just to spike microsoft s attempts to swipe the mysql customer base

2060866
execute	declare
in c variables previously had to be declare at the top of the scoping before any code is execute

i have an asp.net webforms application that i m trying to switching to asp.net-mvc for new development

2061049
put	get
to load this code from a file you may have to file_get_bytes into a string eval that then put in in a variables but you get the points i hope

2061050
hide	show
you may also want to edit your preferences in xcode to always show the building results while the building is going on and only hide the windows if there are no errors or warnings

2061078
asp.net-mvc	webforms
we did that with our migration and we found it much simpler than trying to thread asp.net-mvc into an existing webforms .app

2061113
put	get

2061113
put	get
how can i get the t to put quotes around all field

2061119

it is a fair question to ask why would the compiler call the setter on the properties .when assign the value to it and not call the getter .when using the value of mcinst.foobar afterwards

2061123
cassini	iis
i had visions of complex mail-server detection methods but it turns out that i just have an smtp service running that is tied in to iis on my local machine which is why localhost works as the mail-server in cassini

2061145
directory	folder
you can use it by just putting the folder on your path somewhere like where you project s directory is

2061154
decimal	hex
for example workng with byte arrayss that just happen to be populate with 160 bit hex string which then has to be outputed in decimal form made me think about the case where if i just do a simple assignment to a long 4 byte arrays my worries would be over

2061154
32-bit	64bit
however then i read about endianess and how 64bit reads msb vs 32-bit which is lsb

is it safe to shared a performance counter object cross-thread for increment decrement

2061208
pointers	stack
al.so to clarify his comment about storage declaring won t put the struct on stack since it is dynamically allocated and allocate s in the heap what it will do is interpreter the first bytes of your arrays as a pointers .so you won t be operating on the data you think you are and probably will be fatal

2061211

subtraction	division	subtraction	addition	addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	addition
for example a basic rules is to perform multiplication before addition this is because multiplication and division using floating-point numbers does not introduce inaccuracies as great as that of addition and subtraction but can increase the magnitude of inaccuracies introduced by addition and subtraction .so it should be done first in many cases

2061273
dictionary	arrays
a dictionary has a few different meanings in programming as wikipedia will tell you -- associativity arrays the sense in which python uses the term also known as a mapping is one of those meanings but data dictionary and dictionary attacks in passwd guess attempts are also important

2061303
positioning	slider
i am currently using a loops to compare the positioning and size of the slider placeholder with the positioning and shape of each placeholder shape in the slider s layout but this isn t fool-proof

2061303

this required one words of storage to keep tracking of where you are - you could cut down the numbers of passes by a factors of 64 by using all 64 wordss to keep tracking of where you re up to in several different location in the search spaces - checked all of your current ones on each pass

2062057
digits	zero
we know that for each multiple of 100 each digits occurs at least 20 time but we have to compensate for the numbers of time it appears in the most-significant-digits positioning which is going to be exactly 100 for digitss 0-3 and exactly zero for all other digitss

2062071
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
simulate mouse click keyboard input on blah

2062081
contains	any
i understand that the thinking behind this is that the clr believes that the problem is that we have not yet loaded the or any assembly that contains the types sought but the way i think of it is that the problem is that the clr cannot find the class given its named

create a web user-controls ascx that encapsulates the interface for a single package set of associated tasks

2062207
databound	gridview
i imaging you would use something like a gridview or other databound control to recording the tasks

2062207
updatepanel	ascx
if you use the asp.net-ajax control toolkit you can wrap each ascx in an updatepanel .so only that package is saved

2062220

2062291
selected	cell
that s what i have at the moment .when you selected a cell in the current table view

2062311
python	php
beaker is pretty popular for wsgi reliant python web apps but you have to understand that python is an all-purpose programming language it is not geared 100 toward the web like php

2062316
any	set
.so i would like to know if any of the above options will speed up the application if i set them to true

2062329

ability to store data in some caching mecanism apc memcached files ... in which you can only store strings

2062454
json	xml
in those cases you can use xml json see json_encode and json_decode .

2062466

the way it works is that you click a parent nodes and it uses the jquery .load api to make an ajax callback to the server to see if this nodes has children

2062466
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
everything works fine in safari google-chrome and firefox

2062470
g++	gcc
the reason for this is gcc essentially says use c rules .when driving the toolchain and g++ says use c++ rules .when driving the toolchain

2062470
g++	gcc
g++ knows that to create a working executable it needs to pass -lstdc++ to the linker stage whereas gcc obviously doesn t think this is necessary even though it knew to use the c++ compiler at the compile the source code stage because of the .cc file ending

2062470
llvm	gcc
the llvm- compilers use the gcc front end to parsing the c code and turn it in to an intermediate representation and then use the llvm tools to transform that intermediate representation in to code

2062470
g++	gcc
it s a common compiler drivers technique to have cmd like gcc and g++ sym-link to the same all-in-one compiler drivers executable

2062470
g++	gcc
then at runtime the compiler drivers checked the path and file named that was used to create the process and dynamically switching rules based on whether that file named ends-with gcc or g++ or equivalent

2062500
png	gif
the difference between gif and png actually comes from traditional conventions -- gif was traditionally saved as 8bit whereas png which came later was often saved as 32-bit true color + alpha-transparency

2062500
png	gif
hence if you were to compare a 8bit png to a 8bit gif the file sizes should be very similar

2062500
png	gif
the same applies with true color png vs true color gif

2062504
directory	folder
literally all i did was move the directory into my folder structure and try an import

2062531
selected	textbox
if i add a new row and thus a new textbox that value should get added to my selected

2062531
selected	textbox
as i edit the named in one of the textbox the selected dropdown will updates itself to be in sync with my editing keystrokes

2062549
oracle	mysql
i did eventually find out how to do this but only for mysql and oracle which makes the generics functions no longer valid universally

2062551
value	field
if you required various value to be stored together in a single field then you will likely be best off storing them as a delimiter-separated string of value

2062560
constructor	private
why should we make the constructor private in class

2062570
jprofiler	yourkit
you may use jprofiler or yourkit profiling for this

2062578

and put the dll under bin folder of the root of sharepoint virtual directory

2062592
constructor	private
you shouldn t make the constructor private

2062592
constructor	private
it doesn t do any good to just mark the constructor private

2062598
constructor	private
private constructor can be called by other constructor using the this ...

2062598
constructor	private
by making the common initialization code in a private or protected constructor you are al.so making explicit clear that it is called only during construction which is not .so if it were simply a methods

2062616
32-bit	64bit
object field 1 pointers 4 bytes on 32-bit viewmodel 8 on 64bit plus size of object itself if not a reference to a preexisting object

2062617

logout	login
audit login sql batchstarting rpc starting and audit logout for each loops in for-loops below

2062623
logout	login
i can see that every 15ms i can get 100-200 login logout per second reported at the same time by profiling

2062623
logout	login
the after 15ms i have again a series fo 100-200 login logout per second

2062623
triggers	insert
there is a pretty complex insert triggers that copies insert detail recording to an archive table

2062623
profiling	trace	logout	login
.when i run profiling on the test server that is almost equivalent with production server i can see that there is about 120ms between audit logout and audit login trace entries which almost give me chance to insert about 8 recording

2062623
value	field
i manage transactional manually by setting a field to a value and do an transactionalal updates changing that value to a new value that other applications are using to get committed rows

2062623

2062708
solaris	linux
-works on windows mac os x linux and solaris

2062711
constructor	private
quoting from effective-java you can have a class with private constructor to have a utility class that defined constants as static final field

2062711
constructor	private
for example say there is no private constructor for class-constants

2062711
constructor	private
also i think a private constructor conveys the intention of the designer of the constants

2062711
constructor	private
is provided and if your intention is to prevent initializer then a private constructor is

2062725
gethashcode	equals
you should use gethashcode to rules out equalsity and then use equalss to checked the actual equalsity of any potentially equals value

2062725
benchmarking	profiling
now your question mentions speed - this sounds like the perfect place to use a profiling and some benchmarking tests

2062741
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiview
the nice thing about all this is that uiview and uiviewcontroller and their subclassing all implements these as well .so for instances if you encode a uinavigationcontroller you will automatically have all of the view controllers that exist on the navigation stack encode for free as well which should get you what you need if you implements the nscoding methods in your own classes as well

2062745
binary-tree	nodes
if the binary-tree is balanced then it height is a function of its nodes n

2062749
any	set
if i add any new row to the dtmovies table and set the datasource again it is getting reflected

2062756
directx	gdi
you won t be able to squeeze much more speed out of that code without losing quality or changing to a faster rendering gdi opengl directx

2062756
directx	gdi
but gdi will often be quite a bit faster maybe 2x and directx opengl can be much faster maybe 10x depending on what you redraw

2062781
put	get
now what happen is if user a send request to downloading assets to approver and approver approves it this will updates respective item in assets list and put a downloading url in downloading link column but if user b get look for the same recording in assets list the downloading link will be visible to this user too which is wrong

2062786
silverlight	wpf
you should consider a different graphics stack and if you like .net but have issues with unmanaged apis like opengl and directx go with wpf or silverlight it s quite powerful

value	field
the effeciency part is hard because searching in a string is much much slower than looking at the full value of a field moreso if you could use an int

how can i make methods and data-members private in python

this is most likely down to a missing attributes on the base properties

2064323

python	java	python	c++
i d like to emphasise the difference in philosophy between python on one hand and languages like c++ java which i presume you re familiar with based on your question

2064400
python	perl
the general attitude in python and perl for that matter is that the privacy of an attributes is a request to the programmer rather than a barbed wire fence by the compiler interpreter

2064435
value	field
your query by example is probably including some other field with default value maybe something like

2064441
functional-java	guava
for earlier versioning there are libs alternatives for example guava s optional or functional-java s option

2064441
scala	java
but like many functional-style patterns using option in java even 8 results in quite some boilerplate which you can reduce using a less verbose jvm language scala or xtend

2064447
exception-handling	error-handling
should my exception-handling inherited from runtimeexception and rely on the transport for the error-handling everything will end up wrapped in a soapexception

2064450
version-control	git
most good books on any version-control systemd the subversion book for subversion and the pro git book for git for example will give you some introduction to version-control itself divorced from the actual tool they cover

2064451
asp.net-mvc	webforms
webforms or asp.net-mvc it doesn t matter

2064470
concat	where
it doesn t explicit say where to import it from or even where you would put the import statement .so i figured finding a way to concat would be the lesser of the two evils

2064473
installation	environment
using the 32-bit emulation environment versioning of regedit and regsvr32 to perform the installation manually

2064486
linux	unix
if you are on linux unix have a look at mbstowcs and wcstombs defined in gnu c from iso c 90

2064505
put	get
or to put it another way if you change something or more importantly accidentally delete something or do something really stupid and you get the ball clenching feeling that you ve just lost hours of relatively unrelated work that could have been committed and saved then you re not committing often enough

2064510
directory	folder
assuming #1 is doable is there a way to have there not be any trunk directory and just have the files reside in a folder with the named of the repository

2064513
uilabel	uiview
searchdateview.xib is basically a uiview with a uilabel inside the view is wired up correctly

2064516
selected	cell
normally only selectable or selected cell can be tracked

2064517
directory	folder
apparently there are hidden folder called .svn spread around in the working directory which i kind of knew about which contains among other things very crucial empty directory which i didn t know about

2064517
revision	updates	revision	svn
i tried to do svn updates clean up updates to revision revert and .so on

2064528

please not that certain browser such as firefox have the built-in autosuggest feature that sometimes will interfere the autocomplete from plugins

2064533
ubuntu	linux
any idea why i m getting this error on windows-xp but not on ubuntu linux 9.04

2064550
32-bit	64bit
i used to believe it was for performance reasons but then on a 32-bit or 64bit machine where registers are 32 or 64bit wide what s the performance advantage

2064551
google-chrome	firefox
..appears with question marks instead of the offending characters in both firefox and google-chrome

2064562

what is the main benefit from learning a language such as scala or groovy

2064621
virtual-machine	vmware
it s running in a vmware virtual-machine

2064629
cvs	git	version-control	cvs	version-control	git	svn	rcs
i ve used sourcesafe clearcase cvs svn sccs rcs and git in development and for me the tool that got me using version-control on a regular basis in hobby programming was git

2064633
.when	ready
one option might be to place placeholder instead of the external content and asynchronously load it .so .when all the scripting are loaded and ready all you need to do is throw the markup into the placeholder

2064638
groovy	scala
to be more specific groovy is a good language for mocking up code quickly and scala while i ve never used it is suppose to great for writing concurrent applications due to it s functional approach

2064639
groovy	java
groovy is like a super versioning of java

2064639
groovy	java
.so in many cases it does make sense to use groovy over java

2064642
contains	elements
this selector combines the elements selector matching all elementss with the classname selector matching all elementss that contains the classname class to find all elementss with that class

2064643
controllers	routes
this implements the restful routes to your controllers

2064644
scala	java	groovy	scala	groovy	java
but because groovy and scala run on the jvm and you know java you can integrated existing libs and code if you want or need to

2064659
opera	gecko
in browsers that do webkit and gecko maybe opera

2064663
groovy	java
i know with groovy you can load scripting from files at runtime from your java application

2064670
versioning	upgrade
the discussion focuses on how the function can be used to upgrade versioning of custom tables but it s probably used for the upgrade of wordpress itself

2064683
phpmyadmin	heidisql
i m using heidisql to manage my databases at work i prefer this over phpmyadmin

2064685
spring	jsf
once you re familiar with the basic of how java serves things up as a webpage move on to more sophisticated frameworks such as jsf spring web asp.net-mvc or struts

2064685
spring	jsf
as a note i feel that jsf has a steeper learning curve than either spring or struts

2064685
seam	jsf
if you are that interested in jsf i recommend looking into the seam framework which utilizes jsf but also somewhat simplifies its use

2064691
annotations	mapping
for exception-handling-handling that match the pattern describe in section 2.5 exception-handling-handling that have a getfaultinfo methods and webfault annotations the faultbean is used as input to jaxb .when mapping the exception-handling to xml schema

2064695
subclassing	nsobject
since you don t need all this functionality for a non-fullscreen subviews i suggest you subclassing your searchdateviewcontroller directly from nsobject

2064712
for-loop	loops
the main subtlety which catches people is that in non-pure languages closures close over variables binding rather than value which means that things like variables scoping are very important and this is where unexpected difficulties arise in the for-loop examples since the scoping of loops variables is not always what people expect

2064718
32-bit	64bit
since the unmanaged has the same named for both the 32-bit and 64bit versioning we are having trouble moving the correct unmanaged to the output bin directory

2064718
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
if the building configuration is x86 we want to copy the 32-bit versioning and with x64 the 64bit

2064718
32-bit	64bit
we found this link targeting both 32-bit and 64bit with visual-studio in same solution project but this seems to reference some dll that already exist on the machine

2064719
constructor	object
beyond that i don t see that it s particularly clunky - although if this is all that the email-address class does i d do this in the constructor or a static methods and make the object immutable

2064723
silverlight	wpf
an example of this would be silverlight or web-deployed wpf applications

2064728
put	get
you haven t put any value to the showlist that s why you get nullpointerexception

2064733
value	field
i have 2-3 user-input which should take multiple value for each field from list of value and i wanted to implements this using popup based search and add methods other alternative was to use dropdown with checkbox but the list is .so big and it is not user friendly to use that

2064757
return-value	arguments
first of all if anything it should be g.f not f.g because you want a function which takes the same arguments as f and gives the same return-value as g

2064769
32-bit	64bit
truncation to int32 would be no good - how could you then properly hash 64bit value which had all zero in the lower 32-bit

2064787
base-class	inherited
you must make that file_ classes to inherited a base-class and return it

2064789
memcached	apc
for caching use apc or memcached

2064791

what i ended up using was a tool called socketsniffer that peeks at winsock s call and monitor tcp udp socket connections

2066819
sniffing	traffic
microsoft messages analyzer is now capable of sniffing loopback traffic out of the box

2066827
instances	private
think about it this way if you truly have private value that can be internalized within the object say for instances the int value of the speed of a car object then you have no external dependency and no need to invert or inject that dependency

2066827
constructor	object
you can either initializer that engine -- for instances new gmoverheadcamengine -- internally within the car object s constructor preserving encapsulation but creating a much more insidious coupling to a concrete class gmoverheadcamengine or you can inject it allowing your car object to operate agnostically and much more robustly on for example an interface iengine without the concrete dependency

2066841
base-class	inherited
i have a base-class and two class that inherited it

2066852
value	field
in php you can use the header function to set the proper value for content-type header field like

2066891
internet-explorer	firefox
which works fine in firefox and internet-explorer afaik all other browsers .

2066897
export	csv
export your query with all the necessary arguments to make it a csv format like field optionaly enclosed by and delimited by

2066911
logout	login
the best you could get would be to use an absolute types datasource but this would only work for creating something like a login logout rate statistic .

2066911
logout	login
you could answer how many login and how many logout per-hour you had .

2066914
.when	ready
better to just rendering .when ready even if it is scattered over the place either as single line or better yet as blocks as some have suggested

2066926
debugging	trace
and then call status my messages here... within my javascript to emit any debugging trace messagess that i required

2066943
callback	methods
what are some methods you may have used in the past to best operate the callback that notifies if the transactional has been approved or declined

2066982
export	csv
best bet is to export from excel to a csv comma separated value file

2066983
getter	setter
one huge advantage of getter setter is that you can put debugging code in the functions to keep tracking of .when value are changed and accessed .when testing

2067008
derived-class	base-class
the derived-class incorporates the base-class

2067008
superclass	inherited	base-class	inherited	base-class	superclass
this is why stroustrup chose the term base-class rather than superclass to refer to the class being inherited from

2067008
extends	super
the words super implies that the class being inherited from is larger but it is the other way around the inheriting class extends the class it inherited from

2067026
sql-server	oracle
i work in an environment using microsoft source safe and oracle sql-server

2067035
background-color	transparency
if you have soft edgess or just need really good edges quality you ll need to employ an algorithm that for each edges pixels estimates background-color foreground color and transparency

2067056
constructor	object
i used all four possible constructor and i used them both as sqlbulkcopymapping object and just by providing the same information to the add methods of sqlbulkcopy.columnmappings.add

2067061
expression	evaluation
evaluated from left .when a true value is found non-zero it stops evaluation since the expression now is true and never can be false again

2067068
class-variables	accessor
now with that said you should always mark your class-variables as private and create accessor for them which will give you a better way to expose only what needs to be exposed to the outer world

2067068
getter	setter
also .when you use getter and setter you have control on the data if you need to you can format both input and output

2067076
callback	methods
pass a callback methods that the

2067081
expression	evaluation
the first x++ evaluates to 0 and increment x to 1 and evaluation the expression continue

2067083
any	set
it should be noted that the solution to this problem should take into account that reading a sufficiently large file 100mb+ from disk is going to be disk bound and likely to outrun any timeout that your webserver has set for scripting execution-time

2067083
handler	service
2 write a service handler scripting that .when invoked from the browser say . readfile

2067083
handler	service
3 use a paginator widgit or a scrollbar as suggested by the other contributor to make the call to the service handler via ajax

2067087
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
because inherited break encapsulation subclassing that implements equals and hashcode must necessarily account for the peculiarities of their superclass

2067096
double	int
do different data types in c such as char short int long float double have different memory-alignment boundaries

2067097
nsxmlparser	nsdata
use nsxmlparser after converting the string to nsdata

2067101
button	popup
assuming you don t want to disable the button you could always popup a modal on the page

2067125
boolean	int
relatively speaking the string concatenation in your code is probably going to be slower than the int and boolean comparison operations you have here

2067150
hide	show
why dont you just put the content in their own divs and just hide show the divs

2067166
core-graphics	quartz-core
ideally i would like to do this using only quartz-core core-graphics

2067167
android-emulator	ddms
just press that button and a screenshot of whatever device you have ddms connect to either a real android device or the android-emulator will be created and opened in a new windows where you can save it as a png

2067183
getter	setter
the reason i like having getter setter is that i can put all kinds of logic in them if i need to

2067190
double	int
do different data types in c such as char short int long float double have different memory-alignment boundaries

2067196
buffering	streaming
later on the code has to read from the streaming a buffering from the start till the end

2067197
subclassing	superclass
consider a superclass that checked for field x and y and subclassing checked for x y and z

2067197
subclassing	superclass
.so a subclassing superclass subclassing where z is different between the first instances of subclassing and the second violating the transitive part of the contract

2067197
subclassing	superclass
in the above example if subclassing or superclass does an instanceof checked it would break symmetry

2067205
.net	wcf
i have a .net application with a web front-end wcf windows service back-end

2067205
instances	private
the job class has private instances of these interfaces and uses di to construct the actual implementation by default but allows the class user to inject any interface

2067216
contains	elements
what i am attempting to do is see if a jquery object or even dom elements for that matter contains a particular class using the same selectors as the sizzle engine

2067219
base-class	superclass
super somemethods means - call this methods for the base-class superclass in objective-c lingo

2067243
triggers	insert
and here s my technical problem i ve got an after insert triggers on the table where the upload of the document is recorded

2067253
pointers	stack
section 8.2.4 of the cli specifications call value-type which can contains pointers into the evaluation stack byref-like types and says that they cannot be boxed

2067272
32-bit	64bit
.so the 32-bit release building would go in win32 release and the 64bit debugging building would go in x64 debugging

2067272
32-bit	x86
its output directory are similar to the unmanaged c++ dll s except that the .net compiler uses x86 whereas c++ uses win32 to denote a 32-bit architecture executable

2067279
contains	any
the heap can in general grow in any directions since it may contains many allocation and deallocation holes .so it is better to think of it as a loose collections of pages than as a lifo-stack types structure

2067299
contains	set
the named of that domain should correspond to a static set that contains all current instances of the class.

2067310
communication	messages
we are generator c++ and would like to use sockets for inter-system communication rhapsody currently communication between object and threads in the same process using messages queue

2067320
form-submit	onsubmit
in the end i want the dojoattachevent onsubmit submithandler in the xmlhttprequest returned templates markup to result in an event connect from the form-submit to the widget submit handler methods

2067321
typedef	struct
the core of it is just a struct and two typedef s

2067330
value	field
basically if i pulled that value out and put it into its own table it would be the only field in that table

2067332
any	set
to start it seems like you set frame size to 1000x8000 because you didn t see any change right

2067340
sata	ssd
use fast disks performance wise ssd fc sata

2067351
exception-handling	try-catch
.when i put that into a try-catch from within the file throw the exception-handling my application_error methods never gets reached

2067362
display	height	display	width
.when the first item is hidden due to the filtering its display is set to none .so its width and height become 0

2067371
swing	awt
i recommend reading painting in awt and swing if you haven t

2067392
nsthread	cocoa
in cocoa is nsthread faster than pthreads

2067408
lookup	any
you can declare a foreign key constraint to the lookup table .so you can rely on the column in the main table never having any value other than the 10-15 value you want

2067419
execution	restart
it is working after restart the toad.some issue with toad while execution this

2067433
required	checked
i m writing a multithreading program that needs to be able to checked if a row required updating and act accordingly

2067444
click	mouse
.when you click and drag the mouse

2067444
google-chrome	safari
however in safari and google-chrome 3 the handler are never called .when i press the middle mouse button

2067444
google-chrome	firefox
the middle mousedown event comes through on ie firefox and google-chrome 4 just fine

2067444
google-chrome	safari
or perhaps i need to wait until safari fixed the issue like google did with google-chrome

2067448
32-bit	64bit
if it s a 32-bit .app running on a 64bit os then calling wow64disablewow64fsredirection before your call to createfile will read from c windows system32 instead of c windows syswow64 which is probably what s h.appening to you

2067453
children	nodes
of course php lacks generics but i just want a class which give me ability to store my object in it and iterate through nodess using php5 iterator from root to children from selected nodes to root etc

2067456
selection	highlight
i want to highlight the previous selection made

2067456
selection	highlight
is it possible to highlight in that default orange the previous selection

2067457
32-bit	x86
the components are x86 and i am using the 32-bit regsrv32

2067486
constructor	object
my constructor in the object that s part of my observablecollection wasn t declare public

2067495
dedicated-server	dedicated
i need to use the dedicated-server ip i have .so the remote_addr of the other server has to be my dedicated ip

2067495
ip-address	proxy
this eliminates libcurl because libcurl uses a proxy to load the remote url and the proxy changes the ip-address which does not work

2067498
callback	methods
they simply run from a main methods and contains callback like glutmousefunc mousebutton where mousebutton is the named of a methods

2067504
key-value	key
handing out a key then becomes converting the next key-value to the base36 string then increment the next key-value

2067531
contains	any
the xml file should contains all the domain that are allowed to load anything from your domain in this case it should just contains a to allow any domain to load from your domain

2067585
children	nodes
the simplest is to just start with the roots and parsing each nodes and it s children

2067591
contains	set
in addition to this lock the transmit queue also maintains an owner field which contains a cpuid which is set .when this spinlock is held

2067614
difference	count
one thing i see in your code that could be making a difference is that you are not typing your iterator count

2067668
children	nodes
documentation says that the children of the elements in this document replace the elements in the including document .so i would think that given the include directive has worked i can selected g registered nodes like if they always belonged to the inluding document

2067672
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo just like xhtml xslt svg and other public standards may not be perfect and may not have all the traditional technologies and file-format have

2067673
subtract	time
if you do want to start with year 0 then you need to account for that by subtract your epoch time

2067686
selection	highlight
however the determination of whether the selection is highlight is determined on whether the user was using the touchscreen

2067686
selection	highlight
if they have used the touchscreen more recently than the trackball d-pad whatever the device is in touch mode and selection highlight are not show

2067687
callback	methods
second inorder to be able to call that methods the callback would have to know which object this-pointer your methods belongs to that s pretty much why the types are different in the first place

2067693
hide	show
or are the possibilities of what control to load .so small you could just hide show div s that are already in the page

2067697
attributes	properties
datacontract serialization default to assuming that members are serialization in alphabetical order instead of the order of declaration unless you specify value for the order properties of the data-members attributes to control order explicit

2067704
margins	padding
you probably need to assign zero to the padding and the margins of body html

2067705
delphi	c++
we are adapting our client side relatively complicated application activex .net delphi c++ com to use sxs to achieve non admin deployment and isolation from older versioning of our product

2067705
delphi	c++	any	set
at the moment our application invokes from it s c++ portion an out of proc activex server delphi activex exe which in turn itself invokes another set of out of proc activex servers third party plugins any thing goes here delphi c++ any thing as long as it s out of proc activex exe and implements our interfaces

2067711
margins	padding
you probably aren t removing the default padding and or margins different browsers have different default

2067720
versioning	upgrade
i building my own versioning because i don t want to be forced to upgrade all the dependencies of fluent .when i just want to upgrade fluent-nhibernate

2067720
msbuild	nant
many .net project use rake instead of nant or msbuild because the syntax of the ruby language is easier to read than xml

2067721
stderr	stdout
if you choose this route and consume stdout stderr separately note that .when you consume the output stdout you need to consume stderr as well and concurrently otherwise buffering will block and your spawned process waiting for your process to consume this

2067756
postgresql	rdbms
most commercial and some open-source rdbms platform postgresql can support partition tables which can be used to do this types of thing one way or another

2067756
rolap	olap
this is done by configuring the leading partition as pure rolap the olap server simply issues a query against the underlying database and then rebuilding the trailing partition as molap the olap server construct its own specialised data-structures including persistent summaries known as aggregation

2067756
linux	unix
default filelock semantics on unix linux allow you to do this this is how tail -f works but the default behavior on windows is different

2067776
query-cache	memcached
this is why the general recommendation is to not attempt to use memcached as a query-cache

2067780
windows-vista	windows-xp
for example windows-xp has 34 file properties windows-vista mdash

2067780
windows-vista	windows-xp
not only the properties indexes can differ but also the properties named duration in windows-xp length in windows-vista which is quite confusing

2067784
ruby	php
for example flex in large mostly intranet enterprises with desired desktop like user-interface flex can be used on the top of the any server platform jvm .net php ruby coldfusion

2067784
smartgwt	extjs
except some advanced components like extjs gwt and smartgwt ee

2067803
haskell	ocaml
functional languages like ocaml and haskell actually use closures implicit all over the place

2067806
tokenize	parsing
of course it won t ensure that the regular expression parsing correctly - it just identifies where it is say for a tokenize

2067808
double	int
here you can see we match either an int and then lookahead if we find a double period then we know that the int is really an int and not a real

2067817
svnkit	svn
for the svn stuff use java svnkit api

2067820
administration	account
.when it asks me to make an administration account and passwd for it should i just types in whatever to get it to install as i won t be using it directly

2067828
svnkit	svn
you could use svnkit for the svn part and include directly the jars in your classpath

2067832
lisp	let
i m working with clojure and while i ve dabbled with lisp before i m having trouble finding a clean way to nest let statements in cond statements

2067834
administration	account
administration account and passwd for

2067840
callback	methods
contrary to what everyone seems to be saying you most definitely can use a non-static member function as a callback methods

2067841
msdeploy	msbuild
on his blog you ll also find tips on building msdeploy package with msbuild

2067841
build-process	msbuild
you can run psexec from your msbuild scripting or potentially from a customized build-process templates

2067852
stderr	stdout
p subprocess.popen cmd stdout subprocess.pipe stderr subprocess.stdout stdin subprocess.pipe

2067852
stderr	stdout
p subprocess.popen cmd stdout subprocess.pipe stderr subprocess.stdout stdin subprocess.pipe

2067855
credentials	account
i d like account and login credentials to have a one-to-many relationship one account can have a numbers of login credentials attached

2067859
authentication	login
we customised the login authentication methods significantly and have an additional table of login

2067859
account	userid
the problem we ran into was that the usernamed field in the membership-provider couldn t be empty and while in our schema everyone had a userid it was their account named they didn t have a usernamed that was unique

2067864
blender	3ds
sunflow can import 3ds files and blender files

2067872
registration	login
i call it advanced because it consists of three screens one for the actual login user passwd one for passwd retrieval and one for new user registration

2067879
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have a mixed asp.net-mvc and webforms environment that works just fine in vs2008 .when i debugging

2067890
postgresql	firebird
postgresql has had it for a while firebird nã e interbase promise it in the upcoming 2.5 release but that s about it.

2067893
keydown	keyup
i need a way to get keydown and keyup events quickly without a gui

2067901
jquery	.post
i have an html form to which i dynamically add a textfield and perform a .post request for that form via jquery to an asp.net-mvc-controller

2067907
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
.so i m aware of the big ammount of general-purpose scripting languages like ruby python perl maybe even php etc

2067908
contains	any
if the ip listen list contains any entries the httpserver api will only bind to those ip addresses that the list specifies.

2067917
groovy	java
in java it is based on the compile-time types of an arguments whereas in groovy it is based on the runtime types

2067917
groovy	java
would invoke the methods with the string parameter if groovy code and the methods with the object parameter if java code

2067920
png	gif
i just wondered if it would be possible to create a small simple jpg png gif with a given text in powershell

2067929
lgpl	gpl
python combined with pyqt is a very solid combinations for gui desktop applications note that while qt is lgpl pyqt the python binding is dual licensed gpl or commercial

2067929
python	c++
it offers the same gui library-wise as qt on c++ but with python specific strenghts

2067931
communication	messages
the windows communication foundation channel infrastructure revolves around the physical address since itâ s responsible for receiving incoming messages using a particular transport protocols at a specific location

2067931
communication	messages
the windows communication foundation dispatcher on the other hand is shielded from such networking details and instead focuses on mapping the incoming messages to an endpoint and ultimately to a methods call

2067961
subclassing	base-class
finally .when you are inheriting from a class you don t need to copy the members from the base-class into the subclassing

2067966
instances	destroy
finally .when the webapp is about to shutdown unpublish destroy of context then the destroy will be invoked for any of the servlet instances kept in server s memory

2067972
shallow-copy	deep-copy
it will be a deep-copy rather than a shallow-copy

2067975
ogre3d	ogre
i have been trying to learn to use ogre3d and have gotten to the stage where i want to start .something more serious than the examples it comes with .so i found and copy-paste the basic ogre framework

2067975
ogre3d	ogre
i am using ubuntu 9.10 but have compiled ogre 1.7 from the ogre3d website i am using the netbeans 6.8 ide with the c++ plugins

2067981
installation	upgrade
i have an existing bugzilla installation that i m trying to upgrade via cvs as per the instructions found here

2067981
shell	bash
i just get dumped back to the bash shell

2067983
click	mouse
a contextual menu is just a div contains a few links positioning at the mouse cursor and show on a right click

2068024
javascript	dom
in particular i need to be able to take a widget clone it and place it somewhere in the document and the widget should take care of managing any subwidgets and of keeping matching dom object and javascript object in sync

2068029
margins	padding
browsers have different default styles and this likely explains the extra margins or padding that you re seeing

2068061
assign	add
if you have parameters in your function assign only the function named to the commandtext properties and add parameters to the npgsqlcommand.parameters collections as usual

2068061
postgresql	oracle
in oracle i can directly convert refcursor parameter to sqldatareader but in postgresql i cannot

2068065
httphandler	httpmodule
it s much better to use an httpmodule .so that you can intercept request for all pages and make sure users are authentication even before the httphandler has a chance to run

2068072
comet	chat
im going to use ajax comet to create a chat

2068078
keydown	keyup
you can use getkeystate or getasynckeystate but that won t give you keydown keyup events

2068078
keydown	keyup
.so if you really need to get the keydown keyup events you could install a hook

2068084
kiosk-mode	autostart
the application on windows-mobile phones are run in kiosk-mode where the application autostart in fullscreen-mode after booting and with the users unable to accidentally or willingly access any other parts of the phone

2068099
publish-subscribe	messaging
in publish-subscribe messaging with jms topics jms publisher send a messages to jms provider and jms provider send the messages to jms subscribers and receives their acknowledgement

2068110
nstextview	nswindow
in a simple case suppose we have a button in a nstextview in a nswindow in a nsapp

2068110
nstextview	nswindow
the button will have the first opportunity to handle the event then its controllers then the nstextview then its controllers then the nswindow then its delegation then the nsapp and its delegation

2068111
authentication	login
if they don t have a valid subscription or aren t authentication we display a summary of the page in-place along with a call to login or register using standards asp.net-controls

2068129
authentication	login
for example to use novell or oracle or ping you would still need to implements a directory or some other user store authentication the users somehow iwa or login page using a service provided by the product for instances and then federate that user to the wif based rp right

2068129
authentication	login
we need to support several options for authentication 1 iwa into the rp using our internal ad for users within our enterprise 2 provide a way for our customer s users to login using users we own and control as their idp assuming a new directory for them seperate from our internal ad and 3 external idps where our customers authentication the users and federate into us

2068135
contains	elements
both the application and the server need a manifest that contains a elements for each proxy stubs dll and elementss for each interface that is remoted

2068136
data-structures	tree
using these features one can setup data-structures such as linked lists and tree

2068139
value	field
i want to write a simple calculation to return a value based on a heirarchy of field

2068155
kerberos	ssl
my environment has been set up to use kerberos over ssl

2068156
alignment	spacing
even though i have set the spacing 0 and alignment left the widget still have spaces between them

2068156
widget	button
please see the code here for the widget c tor and the function that adds a new tab toggle button

2068161
perl	c++
perl beats c and c++ for simplicity of code

2068179
any	set
it s impossible to control the printinged page from javascript html css because you don t have any access to the printing drivers .so you can not know what paper size or margins the user has set

2068198
listboxitem	selected
the selecteditems are a list of all the selected items not a list of the listboxitem that are selected

2068200
any	set
is there a set of wrapper add-on for all of the major browsers that will let me write one piece of code which can then be execute in any of the major browsers

2068200
google-chrome	firefox
something along the line of greasemonkey for ie firefox and google-chrome would be nice

2068208
exception-handling	try-catch
simple the program throw scannerexception-handling but your try-catch can only catch numberformatexception-handling you need to add another catch clause inorder to catch scannerexception-handling or catch only the generics exception-handling

2068210
shell	bash
i just get dumped back to the bash shell

2068212
keyboard	mouse
process mouse keyboard input on msdn

2068213
profiling	trace
while my test is running i m capturing an sql profiling trace which i load in to an sql table .when the test has finished .so i can analyse the stats

2068216
value	field
hidden field are needed because if checkbox is not checked form doesn t send any value

2068226
gethashcode	equals
i m concerned about the list while trying to implements the equals and gethashcode methods

2068253
gethashcode	equals
nope equals will just do a reference comparison and gethashcode will return the standards code allocated per object

2068254
authentication	login
authentication happens in the iis pipeline before the request is handed off to your page object and if the user s authentication fails it will never get there being redirected to the login page instead

2068255
checkbox	button
however have you thought of this create a large radiogroup or checkboxgroup then make individual radio button checkbox invisible as required to get the pattern you want

2068255
radio-button	selected	radio-button	checkbox	selected	checkbox
this should be trivial for checkbox and a bit more complicated for radio-buttons since only one radio-button should be selected at a time

2068286
python	php
how would i go about building a similar systemd with python maybe a built-in module or php

2068286
python	php
some examples preferably in python or php will be greatly appreciated

2068298
contains	set
is there a particular class or set of classes that groovy knows about which use the contains methods

2068300
selected	listbox	selected	button
selected a row in listbox #1 and pressing the add button remove the object from list box #1 and move it to list box #2

getter	setter
one would have setter and another getter

2069098
primitive	int
as any java programmer knows you canâ t put an int or other primitive value into a collections

collections can only hold object references .so you have to box primitive value into the appropriate wrapper class which is int in the case of int

2069098
put	get
.when you take the object out of the collections you get the int that you put in

2069101
udp	tcp
testing tcp and udp socket servers using c# and .net

2069118
strtok	strchr

2069128
addition	modulo
you need to use modulo specifically modulo 256 addition .so that the operation is reversible

2069137
hide	show
i need to hide show a div based on a dropdown box the dropdown box only has a named no id

2069209
environment	building
writing portable code doesn t mean you can actually building all targets from a single environment

2069209
virtual-machine	vmware
it s probably possible if you like a lot of pain and hassles for no great reward but the sane way to do it would be to just have a linux machine sitting nearby or in a vmware virtual-machine on the same computer

2069213
mapping	unique
use a conventions to add the unique to your mapping

2069218
arrays	loops
i m not sure if your key arrays is all you need but i typically loops through maps like this

2069232
rational-team-concert	rtc
has anyone used teamcity with rational-team-concert rtc

2069237
arrays	loops
or if you only want to deal with object loops through each methods and hand-create the arrays

each unique words would have an associated list empty to begin with

2069283
any	set
and any given permutation can be thought of as a mapping of source indic from the original sequences into a set of destination indic in the new sequences

2069283
contains	elements
the second numbers is an index into a list that contains every elements but the one removed at the first index and .so on

2069288
web-applications	webserver
upgrading the webserver os is out of the question since this webserver also hosts other web-applications in our country

2069288
.net	wcf
this .app server currently has .net 3.5 sp1 install hence wcf service is possible

2069288
.net	wcf
my question is if it is possible to add a web reference on wcf web-services through our asp.net website that hosts only .net 2.0

2069298
messagebox	alert
messagebox doesn t exist but look at the javascript alert function

2069300
arrays	loops
if i create a heap arrays inside a loops do i have to delete it at the end of each loops before i reinitialize it at the beginning of loopss again or will reinitializing the exact same thing again simply overwrite the old arrays and i can just skip the delete cmd

2069317
buffering	streaming
streaming implementation if they do not do buffering by default

2069320
buffering	streaming
it s smarter to allocate a buffering of a specific size say 8192 bytes well that s what i tend to do a lot anyway and just always read and send that much as much as necessary until your read operation returns 0 and no errno set for end of streaming

2069328
32-bit	64bit
you might care to study the output of this program - compiled for both 32-bit and 64bit on an intel mac running macos x 10.6.2

edit i am trying to fill out a form basically click a few checkbox and then a submit button but i would like to know if its possible to automate this task

2069339
arrays	loops
then no you can reuse the arrays across multiple iterator of loops

2069371
bluetooth	usb
ethernet would be nice hmm maybe also wifi usb and bluetooth if they don t add too much to the cost

2069374
writetofile	nsstring
you don t need to use a plist to store a string you can use - nsstring writetofile atomically encoding error methods and just create a single file

2069376
buildpath	libs
go the libs tab of java buildpath add variables add a variables named and libs folder location

2069387
variables	boolean
variables defaultdraw boolean

2069390
value	field
then automatically the value of the field will be set accordingly it s just that simple

2069391
arrays	loops
adding to ephemient s answer why are you thinking about re-initializing the arrays inside of loops

2069391
arrays	loops
if this doesn t sound like what your code needs to do then the answer to your question should probably be don t create or delete the arrays inside loops

2069391
arrays	loops
create the arrays before loops and delete it afterwards

2069399
lgpl	gpl
the program must be under a free license that is compatible with all the plugins you eventually want it to be used with ie lgpl or gpl with exception-handling for that api

since the xmlserializer uses reflection to work with object there is no way to keep it from seeing that your base-class reference references an instances of your derived-class

2069441
.net	wcf
finally if you control both applications and can use .net 3.0 or above consider hosting a wcf service and sending the data that way

2069459
margins	padding
margins are on the exterior padding on the interior relative to the border

2069459
margins	padding
if you re not doing anything remotely design-complex then it shouldn t really matter but one thing you should look out for is margins collapsing if you have elements coming before after with vertical marginss and you specify marginss the value will collapse sometimes you d use padding to navigate around that

2069461
qvector	qlist
reversing a qlist is going to be o n however you do it since qlist isn t guaranteed to have its data stored contiguously in memory unlike qvector

2069466
margins	padding
margins spaces outside border while padding inside

2069492
subtract	add
just add or subtract as appropriate once you get close

2069507
perl	awk
make perl behave more like awk or

perl	awk
the main reason you would find the variables would be if someone used a2p to transform an awk scripting to a perl scripting

2069537
groovy	java
i m interested in using groovy to replace some of our java classes where we can benefit from it s dynamic nature

2069539
multiplication	multiplying
unlike multiplication in decimal where you need to memorize the time table .when multiplying in binary you are always multiplying one of the terms by either 0 or 1 before writing it down in the list addends

2069548
any	set
.so you can multiplying x by any numbers by performing the right set of shifts and adds

2069549
ftps	ftp
i strongly suggest starksoft ftp ftps component for .net and mono

2069565
key-value	key
of course you could manually open each sub key manually create the progid and extension subkey and then set the key-value but a nice thing about the setvalue function is that if the key or value don t exist they will automatically be created

2069570
binaries	install
note that i ve never had sl 2 binaries or development components install on my machine it s only a month old

2069578
carbon	cocoa
the most notable example is again mac os where there was initially a versioning for carbon but only much later did a cocoa versioning show up

2069593
webforms	asp.net	forms-authentication	session-timeout
here s the situation - most of this asp.net webforms application which uses a single master page for all pages with forms-authentication has a standards session-timeout but there are some modes where we store an encode cookies that links the user to their account

2069690
nsmutablearray	nsarray
- since this can be modified you better represent using nsmutablearray instead nsarray

2069700
font-size	height
then you will have to constantly synchronized the body height with the font-size

2069705
javascript	dom
because loading a page portion of a page with ajax does not affect the dom tree of the page and hence the newly added elements will not be identified by javascript functions..

2069717
contains	any
given that this doesn t contains any parentheses at all you can probably interpreter it as proving whatever you wanted to believe

2069724
sftp	scp
vfslogfilepatternreceiver uses jakarta commons-vfs .so it supports sftp and scp

2069728
font-size	width
.so if i designed my form-for re.solution a and re.solution b is 1.2x larger the width of windows a will be with 1.2 the fonts will be font-size 1.2 the textbox dimension will be dimension 1.2

2069733
ogre3d	sdl	bullet	ogre3d
this game libs links against several libs including ogre3d bullet physics and sdl which are in the libs files libogremain-1.6.5.so libbulletcollision.a libbulletdynamics.a libbulletsoftbody.a libsdl-1.2.so.0

could the hierarchy fit some combinations of list map data-structures

2069795
radio-button	selected
now i want to load one partials view based on the radio-button selected

2069815
puts	gets
.when the button is pushed the gui manager puts a messages on the event handler queue and gets on with gui managing the event handler pick up the messages from the queue sees it s a button push fires up the myaction program and move on to handling the next event

2069838
automake	gnu
here you set up the named and versioning numbers of the program initializer automake with the foreign arguments .so that it won t complain to you about missing files that the gnu project requiredd tell it that you required a c compiler tell it to building your makefile and finally tell it to output the results of the previous configuration

2069840
derived-class	base-class
therefore your pchild pointers calling doit int x will fail since you are using a derived-class pointers to call the base-class function

2069840
derived-class	base-class
to be able to call that base-class function using the derived-class pointers you can

2069840
derived-class	base-class
use a using directive to bring the function named from the base-class into the derived-class as seen in the previous post

2069844
nstextfield	nstableview
for example you can have your mycontroller instances be the delegation of an nstableview an nstextfield an nswindow and any other object that compose your interface

2069847
arrays	loops
then write a loops to iterate over the arrays and checked the address

2069884
javascript	dom
at the time a very large numbers of web developers were looking for any way to avoid javascript which had an undeservedly terrible reputation due to dom incompatibilities

2069886

2069952
multiplication	addition
mathematically speaking multiplication distributes over addition

2069952
subtraction	addition
any real numbers in your case 7 can be presented as a series of additions such as 8 + -1 since subtraction is really just addition going the wrong way

2069979
derived-class	base-class
i understand that this behavior is to give you flexibility to overrides the behavior of base-class methods in your derived-class

2069979
derived-class	base-class
lets assume that you have a function foo int in base-class and you want to change the behavior of this function in your derived-class

2069979
derived-class	base-class
now if the base-class methods is not hidden by your derived-class methods which has same prototype as that of base-class s methods it will introduce ambiguity in overload-resolution

you can try updating to a more recent versioning of the rad-controls suite or look through the telerik forum to see if there is a css workaround for this issue in ie6

2070122
asp.net-mvc	webforms
but i have been paralysed with uncertainty about which way to go webforms or asp.net-mvc - plus the fact that there always seems to be some new release about to launchd that seems like it would be worth holding out for to improve the learning curve

2070122
asp.net-mvc	webforms
.so i spend hours reading about webforms then read .something that tells me i might be better off thinking about asp.net-mvc then read about asp.net-mvc and wonder whether it actually suits what i m trying to do

2070125
traceroute	ping
imo your best bet is to make use of existing command-line tools such as ping and traceroute and learn to read tea leaves

2070129
attributes	properties
is there any attributes for custom named of a class properties

2070152
ruby-on-rails	django
both are low-level in the sense that they don t provide as much features as django or ruby-on-rails but leave you with a maximum of freedom to code your way in the respective language

2070161
asp.net-mvc	webforms	web-applications	enterprise
my rules of thumb is trending towards this asp.net-mvc for website webforms for enterprise web-applications - maybe.

2070165
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think you ll find asp.net-mvc fits requirements a and c much better than webforms too and both satisfy b

2070195
attributes	properties
decorator your properties with that attributes

2070200
ip-address	proxy
i do wonder if perhaps you should iterate over the explode http_x_forwarded_for in reverse order since my experience has been that the user s ip-address ends up at the end of the comma-separated list .so starting at the start of the header you re more likely to get the ip-address of one of the proxy returned which could potentially still allow session hijacking as many users may come through that proxy

2070207
account	userid
id userid i imagine you d have some user account solution questionid alternativeid

2070211
nsimage	appkit
nsimage is not available on the iphone since it is part of the appkit framework in cocoa

the problem is how do i know which one to show or hide

2070240
response	timeout
however as it turns out the timeout is set on the actual response from the webservice

2070240
any	set
but if it has a response i can set the test status to succeeded withouut any problems

2070243
arrays	loops
this will output all key of the arrays as table head columns and then loops over the arrays and create one row per entry with the value of the arrays for table cell

2070270
interface-builder	iboutlet
if interface-builder only allows me to access the file s owner and iboutlet in my given view how do i access these properties in the superview that dynamically adds it

2070274
double	int
looping through a char arrays checked for 0 works because c-style strings have a conventions that int double and most other types don t have null-termination

2070274
double	int
since int and double arrays do not have this conventions you must use something else

2070274
double	int
replace double with int or almost any other types and everything here works the same

2070284
triggers	insert
if you are doing that often i would consider parsing the data on insert updates delete via a triggers into a separate table say my_table_elements and then selected from my_table joined to my_table_elements

2070290
versioning	upgrade
is there a way to upgrade my octave versioning on ubuntu without downloading the latest versioning and reinstalling from scratch

2070312
checked-exceptions	runtimeexception
the static-block must not throw checked-exceptions but still allows unchecked runtimeexception to be throw

2070322
design-time	designer
it looks like your control is trying to establish a connection with a database on design-time and the database cannot be found probably because the designer tries to look in the visual-studio bin directory

2070330
contains	any
well i couldn t find any information on that kind of meta data .so i had to crud up my viewmodel to contains that index and another properties

2070344
environment	execution
otoh depending on the complexity of your task you can also roll your own by including any numbers of scripting languages and providing their execution environment

2070344
groovy	java
groovy has a more natural syntax for an average java programmer .so it is al.so a good choice.

2070349
selected	cell
what i do is have column a with all the value in selected the cell which need the list or do this to one and do the cell corner drag to the other cell choose data- validation from the menu in settings tab change allow from any value to list

2070349
selected	cell	selected	button
selected the cell in column a then click the button again

2070350
gridex	janus
i am using the janus gridex windows forms and would like to export the contents to excel

2070376
database-table	postgresql
the actual file data is stored somewhere outside the database-table by postgresql

2070378
constructor	object
i can t do this via a constructor in the base because the types of the field required a reference back to the object creating it

2070391
derived-class	base-class
alternatively you can make the base-class constructor accept an arguments of types baseimplementation and have the derived-class initializer it

2070414
getter	setter
with automatic properties you must have both a getter and a setter but you can make the setter private eg

2070431
hide	show
you use toggle hide and show them correct

2070464
execute	declare
you can not reference variables declare in the execute like your temp-tables statement outside that statement

2070472
thickbox	jquery
i had a similar problem with the jquery thickbox a lightbox-style dialog widget

2070473
triggers	insert
however this ain t that easy as it seems as given a set of lists i would have to move .some of them between ready and waiting and al.so have special code to gather all jobs before a signals and tag .something onto them .so that they can triggers the signals if and only if they have all finished meaning for instances that it s no longer possible to add jobs to the list while it is execute as following signalss access the previously insert jobs.

2070473
execution	jobs
i also wonder how to best scheduling the job list execution right now each core grabs a job list and scheduling all jobs in it which gives pretty good scaling for 32k jobs ã 0.7 ms i get 101 which i guess is partly due to the fact that the single-threaded versioning is being scheduling onto different cores some times.

2070499
ubuntu	linux
the codeigniter systemd running the build-process is on an ubuntu linux server

2070503
qmainwindow	qwidget
mainwindow mainwindow qwidget parent qmainwindow parent

2070567
base-class	inherited
and i publically inherited a class student from the base-class person

2070590
prawnto	prawn
had a quick look at the prawnto source and it should pickup your prawn options not sure why it isn t but at least you ve got it working for now

2070615
linked-list	nodes
you need to defined a nodes data structure which contains some data and a reference to the next nodes in the linked-list

2070629
hide	show
static forms don t get garbage collected .when their dispose you have to implements your own init reset methods .when you show hide the form if the static form has references to other object then your .app will slowly leak memory among other things

2070632
actionscript	mxml
you need only exchange a single file rather than the mxml or actionscript files and images and other resource-files

2070643
contains	elements
this should throw an exception-handling if a does not contains all elements in b

2070645
codeigniter	cakephp
i haven t used zend_controller_router but codeigniter and cakephp router explode a url parameter by and map them to different controllers and methods which i think is not difficult to implements one from scratch

2070649
vb.net	vb6
you may want to try passing nothing from vb.net and seeing what happens if the nothing persistent to the vb6 dll then you know it is possible to pass it in and will find the answer by looking at the il code

2070658
value	field
.so guests and users without this field or without the right value in this field will get url1 but the other ones url2

2070665
derived-class	base-class
constructor of base-class always should be called before constructor of derived-class

2070665
copy-constructor	constructor
it will call default constructor for all the members of the class and copy-constructor of base-class just as your hand written constructor actually should

2070680
contains	elements
now i see you wanted an exception-handling if a does not contains all elements added it instead of passing the valueerror

2070698
any	set
if you payload is string or any other format which you want to parsing manually then set the result format to text which will return you a string and you can process it later

2070709

all types of set brackets dictionary set list tuples can be broken across several line without problems

2070739
linux	bsd
the linux bsd and windows sockets apis at least

2070818
jquery	.post
i m using the jquery form plugins and more specifically the ajaxform methods to hijack a normals form and .post it using ajax

2070842
attributes	properties
consider using cellspacing and cellpadding attributes for table tag or border-spacing css properties

2070848
asp.net-mvc	webforms
another option would be to add a reference to the system.web.routing libs that was introduced in .net 3.5 sp1 - there are a numbers of tutorials out on the web on using this with webforms as opposed to asp.net-mvc

2070851
compact-framework	.net
sql-server 2005 ce .when using the .net compact-framework data provider for sql-server mobile has a possible parameter

2070872
lookup	any
to improve on john feminella s last suggestion quicker than a binary-search for any sufficiently long string would be a lookup in a hashset

2070872
duplicates	elements
from the hashset or the clear the boolean elements in the arrays .so that it won t be found again to beware of duplicates characters in the second string

2070873
c-strings	pascal
the first of these is academic in this instances since you are not using the standard-library the second is easily overcome by creating functions or macros that provide conversions from c-strings to a more efficient conventions such as pascal strings

2070876
contains	set
now selected your custom action and set the customactiondata properties to contains something like note that these are key-value pairs

2070883
superclass	inherited
suppose you have two entity classes subclassa and subclassb which both inherited from superclass then you can query for these entities like .so

2070889
firefox	opera
unfortunately firefox as of 3.5 and opera as of 9..something do not maintain the x-requested-with header in the second request after a redirect .so isajaxrequest returns false in this situation .when these browsers are being used

2070890
controllers	routes
i understand i can specify an action named attributes and support hyphens in controllers namedd which out manually adding routes to achieve this however i am looking for an automated way .so save errors .when adding new controllerss and actions

perl	php
a generally accepted option is to use a hybrid perl php solution which however required you to be able to run cgi scripting on your server

2070932
invoices	product
then you can on the nightly basis for example checked for internal order that have not been converted to invoices and subsequently remove them from the database increasing the stock quantity in your product table based on the numbers of units that were reserved but not invoices

2070939
virtualbox	vmware
vmware and virtualbox certainly do have os x binaries

if you run this little example program you will find that selection works as expected to start with entire rows are selected .when you click a random cell

2071120
selected	cell
i still want to be able to selected an entire row by click a random cell

2071138
stderr	stdout
a bit ugly but if you just want to get it up and running as fast as possible you could redirect stdout and stderr to dev-null which should make it a bit faster as it won t be writing to disk or console

2071149
contains	elements
this will contains the td elements .when fadeshow is execute

2071155
portrait	screens
i have a screens layout that is forced to be portrait mode

2071248
sequences	unique
it is almost impossible to find say a unique sequences of n nops or smth

2071262

2071303
panels	grid
in this panels a grid with a height of 50px

but risc cpus mips etc have instructions moving immediates into registers - these immediates can have special recognizable value as well although only 16-bit for mips iirc

2071314
value	field
with the or in there as originally written i think you ll get back every row in the table where a.varcharfield1 is not null as the field not null predicates will allow in all non-null value and since the two predicatess are joined by an or the second predicates won t matter

2071329
csv	xml
the only way to do this efficiently is to use character -based csv or xml xlsx format because they can be written to the output line by line .so that you can per saldo have only one line at once in the memory all the time

2071329
csv	xml	export	csv
i would recommend using csv for this as it may be more efficient than xml plus you have the advantage that the any decent database server has export capabilities for that .so that you don t need to program include anything new in java

2071357
sql-server	mysql
i have been tasked with estimating the amount of time it will take to rewrite the data-access-layer of a .net application from using sql-server to use mysql

2071593
multiplication	addition
what a libs needs to provide is support to store these numbers and perform calculations on them addition multiplication integer-division with rest

value	field
firstly if you were to use the query as specified above this would not return null value as you are using an inner-join unless the actual delivered field contains null value

2071629
g++	gcc
how does gcc g++ handles this

2071629
base-class	inherited	subclassing	base-class	subclassing	inherited

2071846
contains	any
the jsp should not contains any single line of java code

2071870
compact-framework	.net
is anyone working on a .net compact-framework ports of automapper or are there any similar mapping libs for the .net compact-framework

2071881
child-process	spawn
you can use reactor.spawnprocess to set up arbitrary file-descriptor mapping between a parent process and a child-process it spawn

2071881
stderr	stdout
for example to run a program and give it two extra output descriptors in addition to stdin stdout and stderr with which it can send bytes back to the parent process you would do something like this

2071888
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-asp.net-mvc is built upon asp.net .so alot of things will seem similar with webforms but you need to understand asp.net-mvc pattern

2072746
naming-conventions	getter	getter	setter
the easy way of using javabeans was to use naming-conventions to defined the attributes of a bean--hence getter and setter

2072746
getter	setter
.so the getter and setter made it easy for the user-interface .software to discover user-viewable or editable attributes

2072752
toupper	tolower
the work performed is a set of alternating call to toupper and tolower on a string

2072752
arrays	loops
i tried the same example using small and large int arrays in which i loops through each elements and change the value

2072769
value	field
you can only use it to switching the value of one field in a query

2072772
controllers	routes
the trouble with this approach where you have one controllers that serves two entirely different routes is that generator error messages such as user not found versus .post not found

2072782
or-operator	operands
the bitwise or-operator is being used on a sign-extended operands the int

2072789

converting binary into hex without ignoring leading zero

2072797
double-quotes	single-quotes
.so far i have determined a need to escape single-quotes double-quotes and newline and tab characters

any	set
also in the set area you don t need the references to m although i don t think they do any harm it makes it a smidgeon harder to maintain

2072803
value	field
.when pulling data from a database that has a null value stored in a nullable field that maps to a .net value-type

2072806
skype	bots

communication using http which is served normally on tcp which in turn is transported normally over ip v4 v6 at which points the lower layer protocols vary greatly over the lifetime of the connection to the client ethernet pos packets over sonet sdh mpls etc.

2072888
selected	cell
i m creating an .app in which i have an uitableviewcontroller and .when the accessorybutton in the right side of a cell is selected a new instances of a uiviewcontroller should be created contains the interface found in a .xib-file

2072899
instances	self
another option to prevent the perceived problem is what python does mandate the qualification of instances members with this or self .so that you have to prefix every instances member access with self

2072909
put	get
still worth trying as it might make things a bit better -- it s also very easy since queue s are intrinsically thread-safe and besides a queue s put and get all you need is basically an __import__

2072922
put	get
i managed to put something together to get the html to the correct structure to use jquery-ui-tabs on - hopefully someone can learn something from this

2072938
textbox	button
a save button can extraction the ids of each item to create a comma-delimited string of those ids added to a hidden textbox

2072944
pixels	line
then look through all the possible segments restrict by the found x and y if there are a lot of black pixels between x_i y_j and x_i y_k there probably is a line probably

2072950
directory	folder
.so i have this code below that creates a directory and gives asp.net permissions on the folder created

2072977
administration	account
.when the database is on the same box as the wcf service everything runs fine - however we are probably using an administration account as this is our debugging setup

2072980
keydown	keyup
add a keylistener to your swing component assuming you re using swing and mark the keydown and keyup event

2072980
keydown	keyup
specifically on keydown set a boolean for movingleft and on keyup unset the boolean

2072980
put	get
then put and get as necessary

2073007
contains	any
this effectively removes any extraneous path information that may be in the original string and will usually return a zero-length string if the uri supplied does not contains a valid scheme the http or http etc

2073015
postback	ajax
this second postback was the result-of the ajax code firing another postback behind the scenes to ensure that the history list is maintained

2073016
constructor	object
give very unwanted result object b creates and a.b is set as reference to it but just after constructor of a finished object b destructs

2073017
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the exact same application works fine on windows internet-explorer firefox google-chrome opera and on safari for macs

2073069
minimum	max
at a minimum you need a single pass to just figure out the max and a second fetch hopefully on indexed columns to retrieve the full dataset

2073073
subclassing	base-class
if subclassing does not defined a methods on base-class then base-class s methods will get called

2073073
subclassing	base-class
if subclassing overrides a methods on base-class then the subclassing s methods will get called

2073073
subclassing	base-class
if subclassing defined a new methods which also exists on base-class then the methods to get called will depend on the reference to the object whether your variables is typed as base-class or subclassing

2073073
subclassing	base-class
edit a quick note about interfaces if base-class implements iinterface then subclassing which derives from base-class already has the implementation of iinterface and does not need to re-implement it

2073077
constructor	object
or you use a reference member and store the object on stack and pass it along to the constructor like you were showing

2073077
virtual-functions	member-functions
then you can also get away with a non-virtual destructor and may call virtual-functions on b - provided they are const member-functions

2073094
constructor	object
the b object passed to a s constructor is a temporary object which is destructed as soon as a s constructor finishes as you observed

2073094
constructor	object
you could use std auto_ptr if you want transfer of ownership semantics a object to have ownership of the b object that is passed to it s constructor or otherwise a shared pointers such as boost shared_ptr

2073104
xlsx	docx
these reps are given readonly access to the libs as to not change the document posted by management however we find that if management upload an office 07 document either docx or xlsx to be more specific the reps cannot open the file unless we give them higher either add edit or even delete permissions

2073119
credentials	integrated	basic-authentication	http-authentication
you can t ask for http-authentication whether that s basic-authentication or integrated windows-authentication without causing the authentication dialogue box to pop in the case where there are no credentials yet

2073119
authentication	login
.when the user accesses a page without either kind of auth you spit out a page with a login form-for the cookie-based auth and also a link to the one url that allows only authentication access

2073126
webforms	asp.net
what about using web-config like in asp.net webforms

2073134
output	mode
try removing the line that sets the datacontext to _categories as your itemssource may be looking for a _categories properties on the datacontext checked the output windows in visual-studio .when running in debugging mode for clues to data binding failures

2073148
any	set
that means inorder to construct the form on another thread you would need to marshalling any call to actually set properties using begininvoke

2073150
contains	set
please set android_swt to points to the folder contains swt.jar for platform

2073179
implements	abstract
once you remove the abstract keyword you will also need to make your class implements all three methods in the errorhandler interface

2073188
value	field
maybe one day you change the code .so that a getter will not only return the field value but do .something more or create the result in a different way

2073189
linux	unix
this only works on unix linux os x not windows including cygwin

2073192
value	field
using accessor methods might be preferred if they provide any additional logic on top of just returning the field s value like uppercasing a string or something like that

2073194
implements	abstract
you will have to either remove the abstract keyword or implements an additional class that is derived from mycsserrorhandler

2073202
administration	account
.when the database is on the same box as the wcf service everything runs fine - however we are probably using an administration account as this is our debugging setup.

2073203
cvs	git
design and implements a bridge use cvs subversion git etc

2073231
base-class	inherited
a class that inherited an interface implementation is permitted to re-implement the interface by including it in the base-class list

2073239
any	set
finally as already intimated the set of indexes on the tables is crucial and ensuring that any statistics the dbms needs are up to-date is often important

2073245
pointers	stack
additionally it is possible for arrays to be allocated on stack and that is not possible for pointers although pointers can be set to addresses on stack but that can get ugly

2073248
firefox	safari
i ve tested it in firefox ie and safari

2073257
contains	any
the error i am receiving is the methods contains is not supported any ideas

2073258
any	set
one thing to remember is that any row that has fewer columns specified in it both single td columns and tds that span more than 1 column will fill in as many columns as it can left to right unless rtl text is specified in the css .so you can have rows of differing numberss of columns because a td cell cannot spill out of it s column unless a colspan attributes is set in other words a td has to occupy an int numbers of columns not partials columns

2073265
instances	private
would be the best way to do this becuase the .getxxx methods might have logic in them that you want like converting null references into empty strings or some default-value that you would not get by just blindly accessing the private instances

2073291
getter	setter
if your class has getter and setter for field you should be consistent throughout the implementation of that class in whether you use getter and setter or access the field directly

2073291
getter	setter
in terms of performance it shouldn t matter - your trivial getter and setter should be final methods anyway .so they should be inline anyway

2073308
panels	grid
i have an image + text in a column..when i chaange the width of the column the row height of grid panels is changing.i think it is because of the image because .when i change the width of the other columns which dont have image in it row height doesnt chage.how can i prevent this from happening.however this issue is not seen in firefox

2073311
explode	implode
sql-ouery for .sorting_array the db-field conf is setup as text maybe this is my problem .so that i have to first explode and implode the entries before i could use it for the next query.

2073312
core-animation	core-plot
in the meantime every visible elements in core-plot is a core-animation calayer .so you can animate these using existing core-animation methods

2073321

.so should anyone stumble across this again - simple answer is to upgrade to the latest versioning

2073449
contains	any
this will get any input object with the named contains key

2073453
dictionary	arrays
you re treating as if it were a json string which is not always the case i could send a request with an invalid value if i wanted to nor will it always be a json string representing an arrays or dictionary

2073476
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms are generally enveloped in only one big form hence the term webforms

2073477

2073542
groovy	java
unit tests are just groovy or java classes .so there s no spring application context and hence no transactional support

2073561
tuples	set
in that case you need to set the fieldet attributes of your modeladmin subclassing and wrap those two field inside a tuples

2073569
python	ruby	turbogears	django

if any member of the key set does not exist as a key in the key-value list i want to add it to the list with a value of 0

2073599
execfile	setup.py
you could make a version.py in your package with a __version__ line then read it from setup.py using execfile mypackage version.py .so that it sets __version__ in the setup.py namespace

2073608
put	get
my question is i am trying to see .when the functions below get called i have put nslog cmd in there to printing to the console but i don t see any of the below printinging either .when running or exiting my .app do they get called should i see anything

2073730
digits	zero
fill each row with the count of digits required to get to that numbers from zero

2073766

i am trying to assign value i ve gathered from a json feed to my own types a class in which i have defined certain field properties to put the json elements into plus elements that are derived from a regex pattern-matching process

2073778
operators	keyword
you might have to manually add it to the designer or else in vb explicit use the handles keyword or in c# explicit wire up with + operators

2073787
filtering	sorting
filtering and sorting is something the database is generally better at than php code

2073803

2073853
innodb	myisam
if .so i recommend using the myisam table types as it supports full text indexes innodb does not

2073854
revision	updates
another possibility is that their revision is simply a descendent of yours in which case you will by default have a fast-forward merge in which your head is just updates to their commit with no merging happening this can be disabled if you really want to recording a merge using --no-ff

2073858
put	get
i personally have nothing against default_scope but it can get messy and in the few time that i have used it i ve always had to either go back and remove it or put in ugly with_exclusive_scope helpers methods in my model to explicit get around it

2073875
jeditable	jquery
i m using the jquery jeditable plugins to edit some part of a website

2073879
arrays	map
you would obviously first load this file into some kind of map or arrays checked to see if it exists first

2073879
onchange	onfocus
you will obviously not want to call logusage on the onchange methods in a textbox etc but probably all onfocus click or whatever you are really wanting to keep tracking of

perl	ruby
i am not incredibly familiar with ruby but since it has perl roots there may be a construct that allows you to write it like this

2073886
perl	ruby
i am not familiar enough with it to give a ruby example but in perl the above could also be written

2073922
value	field
i have a function that checked validation and returns a boolean value that uses some field of the datagrid

2073926
contains	any
that code is the messiest code in any of my controllers and i d be inclined to factors it out into something with more contains responsibility an ximporter class perhaps but for now it works. i m sure someone more clever than me would have a better solution

2073954
value	field
the frame duration field in the gif header is only two bytes long interpreter as 100ths of a second - allowing value from 0 to 32.768 seconds

2073960
silverlight	wpf
is there any way to store a silverlight page s state in the browser s history as with iprovidecustomcontentstate a wpf class

2073975
any	set
i have a mysql table with 9 million recording that doesn t have any indic set

2074010
hide	show
i want to switching the show class to a hide class depending on the click link

2074013
inlining	inline
inlining nearly universally gives a performance improvement because it avoids all the work necessary to make a call and return from the call unless the optimizer secretly inline it for you

2074016
c-strings	c++
if your eventual goal is c++ and not c you may prefer to focus less on c-strings make sure you understand the basic and just use the c++ string from stl

2074043
contains	set
i think if you set to a string it should work - contains is only implements for string value but i know we do have this working

2074070
contains	any
also remember that in lighttpd syntax the variables does not contains any path

2074084
python	ruby
instead of the backend being passed c# code why not pass python or ruby and take advantage of the dlr

2074101
callback	methods
.when the timer fires start a new thread with the callback this methods is supposed to answer in a best effort manner and should refrain from using blocked call

2074112
udp	tcp
you could at least avoid one level of protection by using a udp scheme instead of a tcp one

2074139
rollback	commit
all txn begin and commit rollback must be paired .so that trancount is the same on entry and exit

2074142
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
i don t program in .net i usually use dynamic-languages like php python or perl

2074148
boost	stl
this one illustrates the old smart pointers from the stl and the new ones from boost -- in adequate detail

2074149
value	field
in this class the value field is a bigdecimal and the iso4217code is a string

2074159
perl	ruby	macros	vba
.when i previously did a lot of perl and later ruby automation of excel and wanted to know how to achieve this and that i usually recorded a macros and inspected its code to see how vba interacted with the object

2074162
sql-server	mysql
that said i d hate to have an access .app that was using sql-server table named .when the mysql tables were not named the same thing -- that s just confusing and will lead to maintenance problems it s simpler for the linked-tables in the access front end to have the same named as the mysql tables wherever possible

2074162
sql-server	mysql
if i were in your positioning i d get a search and replace utility and replace all the sql-server table named with the mysql table named throughout the entire access front end

2074206
checkbox	button
if view_test button was click initializing the dialog before the form postback the checkbox ch1.checked properties in .net is always false

2074220
exception-handling	try-catch
a finally clause will execute regardless of whether an exception-handling is throw or not .so you could just wrap your code in multiple levels of try-catch finally.

2074232
strcpy	memcpy
obvious choices for your example are strcpy or memcpy

2074251
frame	width	height	frame
obviously frame based onion skinning types animation characters cartoons etc. is still best left to flash but nearly any types of animation you d do in flash with tweens positioning size color opacity width height etc. can easily be accomplished with most of the modern .js libs including jquery

2074306
google-chrome	firefox
can t comment on google-chrome but mozilla is releasing firefox 3.6 now without web.socket and it s not a feature likely to be include in minor release 3.6.x .so the earliest release it is likely to ship in is the next major release assuming the implementation is finished .soon

2074338
radio-button	selected
now i want to load one partials view based on the radio-button selected

2074338
radio	click
radio click function

2074346
upgrade	migrate
unfortunately with the table in production migrating it across to this technique will take some t-sql coding knowledge and a weekend to upgrade migrate it

2074347
firefox	opera
this works great in firefox ie and opera

2074347
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome safari it gives the input focus but fails to actually put the cursor inside the input i know it gives it focus because the safari google-chrome focus borders appear

2074361
.net	wcf
after some research i settled on a wcf service with both a rest webhttpbinding and soap wshttpbinding endpoint that way i can support a wide range of platform and still make the .net coders happy

2074376
contains	set
in the actions of your parent report set the parameter contains your data structure to

2074378
required	checked
for now assume the systemd functions perfectly and no error checked is required

2074396
mousedown	mouseup
the purpose of the function is to place the french phrases into the document and set up the event handler for the mousedown and mouseup events

2074396
for-loop	loops
to create the for-loop it says create a for-loop that loops through each of the object in the phrases collections

2074396
mousedown	mouseup
2.run the swapfe function in response to the mousedown event occurring within the object s second child nodes 3.run the swapef function in response to a mouseup event occurring within the object s second child nodes

2074399
export	csv
.when export it to a csv file it looks like ã â and if i set character set utf8 before printing it on the screens using php it looks like a normals spaces

2074409
visitor-pattern	visitor
essentially i have a class which implements the visitor-pattern and there are many possible implementation of visitor

2074428
buildpath	libs
the maven-build classpath file should include something appropriate or you can go into the buildpath dialog and add the jre via the libs tab

2074433
dialog	pop-up
there shouldn t be any issues if you are binding elements from your pop-up dialog to corresponding hidden elements in your main view

2074436
contains	elements
this can be accomplished a few ways the simplest being creating an elements to contains the button and triggers creation of a custom button elements every time something happens that should triggers the url change

2074437
linux	bsd
linux pthreads bsd are all similar

2074437
linux	unix
however many vendors unix linux windows etc provide c libs to perform networking operations hence the many apis you noted above

2074453
lightbox	colorbox
hi all i use colorbox as my lightbox to display a div frame or different page

2074469
derived-class	base-class
the overrides methods in the derived-class is actually a new methods unrelated to the one defined in the base-class hence the new keyword

2074470
.when	ready
it s better design to have an instances methods .so you can swap out your mockroleservice with a real service .when you re ready

2074512
any	set
is there any way to programmatically set these options

2074514
contains	set
given a set of a object is there anyway to use the orm to get a set of b object contains the most recent object created for each a object

2074517
javascript	dom
i haven t worked with javascript for many years but what this assignment essentially asks you to do is to manipulate the dom the tree that represents your html document

2074520
derived-class	base-class
in a base-class constructor the derived-class has not yet been construct .so the overrides function on the derived-class is not yet available

2074522
constructor	object
.when calling a virtual-method from within a constructor you don t the full dynamic types of the object being built you have the static types of the current constructor invoked

2074546
constructor	object
in its constructor the types of the object is helpers .so the call to init call helpers init

2074546
derived-class	base-class
there is no way to call a derived-class function from a base-class constructor

2074559
frame-rate	fps
with regard to frame-rate if you re vehicle is going 30 miles per hour a 30 fps web cam will capture one frame for every 44 centimeters the vehicle travels

2074563
javascript	dom
here is a reference to the document object-model dom the javascript that will help you complete your assignment

2074567
twitter	tweets
twitter does not push tweets out

2074585
class-members	derived-class
there is also a special case if you derive a comvisible types from a types that is not comvisible public base class-members will be exposed to com as members of the derived-class unless those members are individually

2074592
response	timeout
if no response is garnered within a timeout assume disconnect and close streaming

2074609
logout	login
i could updates this every time login logout occurs but i can t tell if this feels right

2074610
triggers	insert
to eliminate the potential problems with triggers what are some of the alternatives one may use to get the same functionality of reacting to an event fired on a insert action

2074614
ubuntu	linux
the linked article describe how to install those in a ubuntu linux environment

2074614
png	gif
the best-known pdf-generation libs fpdf can do this but for jpeg png and gif only

2074636
triggers	insert
alternatives to plain-old insert can be done using stored-procedures triggers or more complicated insert statements

2074637
triggers	insert
triggers are the way to perform an action after an event insert updates delete occurs on a sql table

2074637
triggers	insert
since you say that the latter isn t possible -- you can t change the insert statements -- then you re left with just triggers

2074657
output	mode
i get this messages the thread has exited with code 0 sometimes in the output windows in debugging mode .when running a .net asp.net-mvc c# application

2074666
selected	textbox
selected the textbox

2074669
carbon	cocoa
also the python building are primarily using carbon frameworks rather than cocoa and they do not use xcode to manage the building of the product

2074692
sftp	ssh
the .net 2.0 does not include any support for ssh sftp

2074705
restart	exit
i mean the application should exit and restart itself onclientclick of a button

2074725
android-browser	google-chrome
the two team android-browser and google-chrome are very busy getting their own product ready

2074740
macros	vba	selected	cell
i have the below vba macros to export the selected cell into a text file

2074744
buffering	streaming
well one way you can do it is streaming the buffering within a thread within a loops

2074793
activerecord	datamapper
it relies on the datamapper pattern instead of activerecord and uses an entitymanager to handle persistent logic

2074794
selected	checkbox
the order are approved by selected the checkbox against each order

2074794
selected	checkbox
1 book depends if the user selected checkbox or not

2074794
selected	checkbox
2 pen depends if the user selected checkbox or not

2074800
regasm	tlbimp
being c# i ran tsuserex through tlbimp and created tsuserexlib.dll then registered it with regasm

2074833
javadoc	doxygen
a popular alternative is doxygen which supports its own formats javadoc format and the visual-studio docxml comment format

2074834
any	set
from that systemd you can set up any roles and users you need

2074855
contains	elements
self.request.arguments contains all the elements that you could retrieve separately using self.request.get field_name if you knew field_name

2074869
globalization	localization
what is the difference between globalization and localization

2074877
selected	button
i have a macros that changes the selected text and i have it assign to a button

2074877
macros	basic	selected	button
it works perfectly .when i run it directly from visual basic but .when i click the button the button gets the focus and my text is no longer selected .so the macros change the selected elements to button

2074877
selected	button
how can i selected the text and run the macros by click on the button and still have the text selecteded

2074883
revision	svn
if you have 1000 revision in your svn repo try to branch by 100 revision or .so

2074885
children	nodes
wrap contains 22 children the last one is and in firebug i get all the way down to finding the nodes with the classname but then it jumps the a.push

2074890
culture	locale
given culture and locale

2074890
culture	locale
...globalization focuses your applications capibilities on users as a generics user-base whereas localization focuses on subset of users in a given culture or locale

2074890
globalization	localization
.so you can think of globalization as a strategic venue where as localization is tactical

2074894
value	field
no you do not need to delete instances of value help in a field which is tagged with threadstatic

2074894
value	field
it s much simpler to not have value which implements idisposable and are in a threadstatic field

2074894
value	field
the field will reference a different value per accessing thread

2074899
python	php
if you can install the dropbox client on the webserver then it would be simple to let it sync your folder and then iterate over the contents of the folder with a programming language php python .net etc and produce the gallery page

2074901
32-bit	x86
i need the target to be a 32-bit x86 types not x64

2074903
attributes	properties
you need to specify the range .when you access the multi-value-attributes then instead of just specifying member in the code accessing the properties value you specify to get the first 500 value from that multivalue attributes

2074910
any	set	display	width
.when i set a column width to 1.0 in excel any numbers display in that column simply disappear and vba show that the .text properties for those cell is which makes sense since the .text properties gives you the exact text that is visible in excel

2074916
duplicates	contains
i ended up making duplicates functions for another listview that contains the labels and then putting them in a table

2074922
key-value	key
for most key the result should be directly convertible from a key-value

2074929
contains	any
it won t work for any classname that contains non-ascii or non-alphanumeric characters as that would put the words boundaries in the wrong place

2074936
if-statement	loops
the same goes if the line was move into or out of a loops or if-statement

2074938
python	java	python	c++
i have a working implementation in c++ c# java and python but the common-lisp implementation has some bugs that i just can t figure out

2074938
clisp	sbcl
the bug is identical in both clisp and sbcl

2074939
show	next
what i want to do next is show an encode gpolyline as an overlay on my mapview

2074964
value	field
protected function addstartperiodcolumnquery query field value

2074968
nullreferenceexception	unhandled-exception	object-reference	instances
i am getting an unhandled-exception of nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2074969
ironpython	ironruby
i know ironruby ironpython are supported

2074976
getter	setter
usually it won t make a big difference and i settled on just accessing the variables directly from inside the class with the exception-handling of getter and setter which do something beyond just getting or setting the value

2074979
shell	bash
in bash which is likely to be your default login shell no external cmd are necessary

2074983
queue	fifo
queue is fifo fifo

2074987
internationalization	globalization
read up on asp.net internationalization globalization features

2074988
value	field
.so i guess my approach would be to use the properties unless i needed to write to the value directly in which case i d go with the field - as my properties is readonly and thus can t be written to

2074989
put	get
use a queue .when you want to get things out in the order that you put them in

2074989
put	get
use a stack .when you want to get things out in the reverse order than you put them in

2074989
put	get
use a list .when you want to get anything out regardless of .when you put them in and .when you don t want them to automatically be removed

2075005
value	field
the properties are introduced to hide eventually more complex structure than returning a single value from a field

2075008
punctuation	words
and my readpunctwordss readnumwordss and readcapwordss are quite the same just checked if the words has digits or capital letters instead of punctuation like in here

2075024
accessor	ivar
in that case i sometimes access some private ivars through objective-c private accessor which usually checked if the ivar is nil null and will load the data back in memory in a lazy-loading ad-hoc way

2075025
linked-list	queue	linked-list	arrays
the difference between a linked-list implementation of a stack or queue and an arrays implementation has the same basic tradeoff as any arrays vs

2075029
queue	fifo
fifo for queue filo for stack

2075045
subtract	add
this way is preferred to the multiple join against same table methods as you can simply modify the in-clause and the count without needing to add or subtract more tables to the query .when your list of ids changes

2075051
increment	is-empty
nowhere do you increment the iterator .so either nothing will be printed if the map is-empty or else the first item will printed over and over again and loops won t terminate

2075054
32-bit	64bit
.so we are migrating an old web .app from a 32-bit server to a newer 64bit server

2075054
32-bit	64bit
the pool is set to run in 64bit and cannot be set to 32-bit due to other components

2075060
interpolation	splines
if you are doing more than three points however i would strongly recommend using interpolation as using guassian elimination scale incredibly poorly o n 3 and splines or another interpolation technique are less likely to fail

2075065
jspx	jsf
aside from the fact that you need to set the proper doctype and content-type .so that the browser knows what to do with the page you al.so should get rid of the old fashioned jspx format and use xhtml format to get the most benefit of java ee 6-shipped jsf 2.0 and facelets

2075072
multiplying	formula
to get the coefficients a b c in terms of x1 x2 x3 y1 y2 and y3 you just need to multiplying the formula out and then collect the terms

2075076
value	field
i know this is old but here is what i do inorder to have a hidden-field populate with a unique id that is never display and present to the user an autocomplete field that is based on display value

2075084
fireworks	layer
.when i load the outputted pngs into fireworks i note that the background and the resize image are still seperate layer

2075085
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfect in ie but refuses to work in any other browser like firefox or google-chrome

2075092
arrays	loops	if-statement	loops	if-statement	arrays
and .when i run the application it quits out at the if-statement the console report - nscfstring stringvalue unrecognized-selector sent to instance. mine.metal is defined through a fast-enumeration loops across an arrays

2075111
duplicates	contains
with inline-functions and templates in c++ it can t do that anymore - different compilation units will often contains duplicates of the same function .so the linker just assumes they re the same

2075114
queue	fifo
stack lifo - last in first out and a queue fifo - fifo establish and order in which your elements are insert and removed from a collections

2075114
linked-list	queue	linked-list	arrays
you can use an arrays or a linked-list as the storage structure to implements stack or the queue pattern

2075121
python	ruby
thus the styles is different from what one might write in python which usually either is object-oriented python or call to some c code or ruby

2075129
droppable	draggable
your mileage may vary but what i did was add logic to my drag event handler that would checked to see if the grid was being scrolled which is .when i needed to force the droppable positioning to be refreshed and if .so i set refreshpositioning to true on the draggable

2075151
exception-handling	try-catch
do try-catch blocks hurt performance .when exception-handling are not throw

2075157
lookup	any
any idea on how i can force this query every time i types in my lookup field and not like ie refer to the caching page

2075161
updating	updates
distribution and updates of your software is going to be a breeze air has done a great job of building out the mechanics experience of updating an application

2075165
protected	public
while sensitive data is protected via user authentication the unprotected data is hardly public but as far as i can tell is totally open for public consumption

2075167
fireworks	layer
the super user answer how to read fireworks png multilayer files without fireworks explains that fireworks has png extensions to store multiple layer in a png file

2075191
exception-handling	try-catch
i m sure there is some very minimal cost to setting up up a try-catch block but it is by far outweighed by the cost of not catching the exception-handling at all and having your program crash

2075192
exception-handling	try-catch
while it is true that you should never use try-catch for program flow control i am not aware of any performance issues if no exception-handling are actually throw in the code

2075194
exception-handling	try-catch
this is language-dependent but as far as i know in java if no exception-handling is throw there is next to no performance cost to having a try-catch

2075195
email-validation	validation
ideally though you would be able to validation your input properly beforehand but email-validation is fairly complicated .so it may well not be worth it in this case

2075196
for-loop	arrays
the arrays are loaded once then accessed as many time as you want in this case i was using the for-loop that steve wortham posted as a test

2075203
pointers	stack
my guess is that the one location you are missing in each of the first three assignments is the saved frame pointers the pointers to the current stack location before local-variables are allocated

2075203
pointers	stack
the frame pointers needs to be restored on exit of the function .so that the return address is indeed at the top of stack before the function returns

2075262
constructor	object
.when you construct a cachedbitmap object you must pass the address of a graphics object to the constructor

2075269
code-coverage	jscoverage
to find out what functions and javascript files are used in a project you need code-coverage tools like jscoverage or code-coverage for firebug

2075291
version-control	git
if you want to use distribute version-control systemd like git in an easy way then try mercurial hg

2075294
32-bit	16-bit
then you need a far jump to a 32-bit code segment kernel file must be linked together in a way that the 32-bit code is at an absolute positioning at offset 512 right after the 16-bit real-mode stuff

2075304
keyboard	mouse
i wanna modify the document selection user currently selected by mouse or keyboard how to do it in a cross browser way

2075317
plugins	add-on
maybe there is a plugins add-on or similar

2075357
children	nodes
you can certainly visit the children of the root elements look at the types of each nodes and printing what you want to printing

2075385
put	get
but you don t get to put an exception-handling handler around the wpf binding code

2075397
required	checked
this will still required a runtime checked wherever you inject raw numbers

2075431
hide	show
use hide if you want to show the windows later on

2075432
python	java
any api for programming languages java python

2075474
png	gif
if by flash images you mean jpg png and gif files then you use any of the standards server side software package or language specific libs that utilize these package

2075504
shell	bash
sometimes i just need a bash shell for something

2075520
writetofile	nsstring
look at nsstring s writetofile atomically encoding error methods

2075526
grouping	sorting
sorting priority typesname types grouping unit value

2075527
shell	bash
works out of the box the alt key maps to meta just fine and the bash shell buffering is there whenever you need it

2075538
arrays	loops
your addentry function places a copy of these pointsers into the list but the memory they points to is still owned by the caller it is in fact the first last and num arrays you declare in main that you then proceed to overwrite on the next iterator of loops

2075539
shell	bash
in bash shell you can do

2075547
dynamic-memory-allocation	c++
in the case of embedded systemd and code written in c++ i try and avoid dynamic-memory-allocation as much as possible

2075550
windows-xp	windows
the fix in the answer below works for windows 7 but on windows-xp i get this

2075566
hide	next
this will hide the loading div for you .when you finish and will re-show it next time you invoke this methods

2075572
contains	elements
an iframe would contains contents from some other domain and if that domain could issue code to affect the elements of the first domain security ruin would ensue

2075598
contains	elements
as an example and the easiest one let s say you want to move the user s selection to contains the contents of an elements

2075606
callback	methods
the api which needs the callback will take a callback object as a parameter and if neccessary create a callback.withparms as a methods variables

2075606
callback	methods
inorder to be threadsafe the parameter arrays needs to exist uniquely for each invocation of the api methods and for efficiency the same one should be used for every invocation of the callback

2075606
callback	methods
the withparms nested-class then is optional and serves two purposes it contains the parameter object arrays needed for the callback invocations and it provides 10 overloaded invoke methods with from 1 to 10 parameters which load the parameter arrays and then invoke the callback target

2075606
callback	methods
this example illustrates the beauty of this approach - the application specific logic is abstracted into the callback and the drudgery of recursively walking a directory tree is tucked nicely away in a completely reusable static utility methods

2075610
callback	methods
the api which needs the callback will take a callback object as a parameter and if neccessary create a callback.withparms as a methods variables

2075610

2075628
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
it gives you a chance to clean up whatever you ve been doing in touchesbegan and touchesmoved

2075642
value	field
but i want to get a value from b for example b has a field call id

2075646
callback	methods

.when	ready
this doesn t work .when the carousel is loaded via beforeclick because it .when the dom is ready this tab hasn t been loaded yet

2075934

if you don t need this encapsulation a better alternative can be to checked the conditional before trying to show the form-for instances by embedding the form2.show call in a function that tests all the required conditionalal first

2075945
instances	self
instances-variables are like items in a struct where you need a particular struct the class instances to get at the exact right value - self is just a way for a methods to look at the value held in its own class

2076025
calloc	malloc
in c there is no need to cast the return-value of malloc or calloc

2076025
calloc	malloc
calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

2076031
append	input
you could do it in client scripting by append removing the order ids from a single hidden input as the user ticks unticks

2076043

.when the user logs in you connect using the restrict account get the credentials for the real account and then do your work using that account

2076226
debugging	trace	target-platform	platform
the methods i found useful to debugging in such scenario is to building the code for the target-platform and for the platform where it s known to work and debugging trace these buildinging in parallels using a numbers of use cases

2076229
formatting	printing
for example in the below the password_field would be formatted differently in the event of an error i don t want that and the error_messages would have additional formatting around it .when i d just like the text of the error messages to printing

2076242
where-clause	sql
the filtering would be something like the sql where-clause the sort would be something like the sql order clause the start would be the starting nodes for the traversal and the path would defined things like bfs and dfs traversal as well as .when to stop searching

i click my mouse again

2076248
click	mouse
the mousedown event also clearly show that the click count has increment even though i ve waited several seconds between mouse click odd

2076253
value	field
although mysql does let you get away with expressing a grouping by clause with field in the selected tha that might conceivable vary over the grouping by field theoretically picking an arbitrary random value the results of this ill-conceived logically not well-founded operation are sometimes surprising as you ve noticed

2076261
base-class	inherited
this v-table allows the proper calling of inherited or base-class methods

2076261
malloc	free
don t mix malloc free with new delete

gridview listview

2076281
textbox	button
button textbox panels controls

2076311
private-inheritance	member-functions
a legitimate long-term use for private-inheritance is .when you want to building a class fred that uses code in a class wilma and the code from class wilma needs to invoke member-functions from your new class fred

2076326
iphone-3gs	simulator
your iphone-3gs and the simulator have far more memory than the other iphone os devices

2076365
python	java
i am primarily a sql developer with only a bit of python and java experience .so the simpler the better

2076392

2076415
ruby-on-rails	django
almost any language can be used for web development via cgi although it s more common to use a framework such as django or ruby-on-rails

2076420
base-class	inherited
public inherited makes the base-class accessible to the outside world

2076420
derived-class	base-class
for example a pointers to the derived-class can be converted implicit no less to a pointers to the base-class

2076420
linked-list	arrays
you generally would not want somebody implicit converting your arrays to its base linked-list which would allow them to do things not allowed for a stack such as insert or deleting items in the middle

2076420
private-inheritance	base-class
the usual meaning attributed to private-inheritance is is implements in terms of -- which means we normally do not want to allow the outside world user to see know care about the fact that this class has a base-class

2076420
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
public inherited should follow the liskov substitution rules which says that a derived-class can be substituted anywhere a public base-class is called for

2076420
derived-class	base-class	private-inheritance	base-class	private-inheritance	derived-class
with private-inheritance we re specifically not saying that the derived-class can be substituted for the base-class

2076468
pointers	stack
however i notice that stack overflow is using cursor pointers in its css

2076487
minimum	median
another approach that might work is splitting the graphing up into 200 points bins and discard all but the maximum minimum and median pointss in each interval

2076572
malloc	free
you never want to use sbrk instead of malloc or free

2076572
malloc	free
finally malloc and free are not cumbersome - they are the standards way to allocate and release memory in c

2076572
malloc	free
even if you want to implements your own memory allocation it s best to just use malloc and free as the basis - a common approach is to allocate a large chunks at a time with malloc and provide memory allocation from it this is what suballocations or pool usually implements

2076578
multiplication	addition
this however does not mean that operations like addition and multiplication are atomicity

2076578

2076673
annotations	mapping
the mapping annotations on either the

2076673
getter	setter
there are a couple reasons why property-based access is discouraged but one is that they you re forced to add getter and setter for all of your persistent entity field but you may not want those same field susceptible to mutation by external clients

2076679
jquery	.post
you can even .post parameters .so according to those parameters you can do .some work at server-side and send html portion back to the client and your cute jquery code takes it and inject it into #feeds html elements in the example right above

2076680
getter	setter
i think you need to put the annotations on the getter and setter themselves if you want them to be used

2076688
linux	unix
standards linux patch hardcode only for unix text files

2076826
pointers	stack
my this problem is .solved and in .solving this problem the per.son having id stakx really helped me the only problem was that i was using stack treenode .when i saw the push methods of stack carefully there is a copying process .when i write head- object numbers .so finally i made stack of pointers like this stack treenode and it really .solved the problem i have no problem now i am very very thankful to the per.son stakx.

2076838
subtract	add
if it has been used add or subtract one from the numbers and checked again keep repeat until i hit an unused numbers

2076838
subtract	add
if it has been used add or subtract another randomly generator random numbers and checked again problem is we re back to simply generator random numberss and checkeded as in solution 1

2076838
hash	md5
5 generator much larger random numbers and hash them using md5 to get a smaller numeric value we should rarely get collision but i end up with larger than needed numbers again

2076846
put	get
if i put the two append in comment then my linq query does work and i do get the right data

2076854
pointers	stack
hint yes in your pop methods you work with pointerss but most likely with a pointers to a copy of the object originally pushed on stack

2076865
newlib	gnu	implements	extends
if for example you are using the newlib c libs commonly used on bare-metal embedded systemd with the gnu compiler you have to implements sbrk yourself .so how it works in those circumstances is up to you .so long as it achieves its required behavior of extends the heap or failing

i always feel that i am missing functionality that can be gained in .net by simply applying attributes to classes methods properties etc

2077097
derived-class	inherited
from an oop points of view is there any difference between a derived-class and an inherited class

2077558
implements	extends
the purchasecontrollers is actually a simple managed-bean not extends anything an implements only serialization annotations with controllers

2077564
file-access	filesystems
file-access to repositories is only meant for local disk because of among other things the locking semantics of network filesystems

2077574
aspect-ratio	scale
basically i solved it by using equals coordinates .when building vertices and using a vertex-shader to scale on y axis by the right aspect-ratio

2077583
uiimage	nsdata
could it be that the previous programer has skipped the uiimage stage and only uses nsdata to store the textures without any further encoding

2077583
32-bit	16-bit
it seem to use 16-bit or maybe 32-bit

2077587

2077626
triggers	insert
i want to create a table triggers for insert and updates

2077640
triggers	insert
within the triggers you can use a table called insert to access the value of the new recording and the new versioning of the updates recording

2077647
required	checked
then work backwards through your code checked debug_backtrace if required to find where it went awry

2077672
entity-framework	nhibernate
if you need to do cascading updates altering table a in turn changes table b i would either use a stored procedure which can be tested and debugged more easily than a triggers or if you re fortunate enough to be using an orm entity-framework nhibernate etc. perform this function within your model or repository

2077676
selected	button
i want to have user selected between two different button on a view if the the user selecteded the imageone a labels is created called imageone then i ll save the labels into an arrays using the following technique

i m fortunate to have access to a staging environment with a full copy of production data .so i can perform integration-testing with full regression against previous .software versioning

2077682
effective-java	type-safety
in addition to better type-safety you can also defined custom behavior in your enums refer to effective-java for some good examples

2077701

.when you building the java project in netbeans it creates a jar file on the dist folder in the current project directory

2077702
textbox	button
.so i created an asp.net form and placed asp textbox and asp button on it

2077702

2077822
for-loop	arrays
edit you ve asked for a string arrays specifically but in case you re flexible about the requirements i would prefer a to avoid the need to determine the arrays length prior to the for-loop in the first example and simply add items to it

2077824
required	checked
for instances checked if the list is-empty before trying to pop off the first elements required an atomicity pop-if-not-empty operation

2077843

2077938
playlist	playing
note that woplayer has to support playing a playlist in the same way as mplayer or the trick won t work - you may not necessarily be able to just substiture one program for another

2077947
python	java	python	c++
my girlfriend is one semester from graduating mit where they mainly use java scheme and python with a computer science degree and she is currently working at a company whose codebase is in c++

2077947
python	c++	python	ruby
similarly in c++ it is much more apparent that primitive are just the compiler treating the same sets of bits in different ways as opposed to a language like python or ruby where everything is an object with its own distinct properties

2077961
selected	textbox	highlight	selected
if i selected this textbox on my mobile phone the android webbrowser highlight it with an orange border

2077966
data-structures	dictionary
.when your c# or java program balloons on memory usage understanding that references which are basically just pointers take memory too and understand how many of the data-structures are implements which you get from making your own in c helps you understand that your dictionary is reserving huge amounts of memory that aren t actually used

2077975
any	set
.so the language itself is not important but having a deeper appreciation for how all of the bits come together and how to work effectively at a level closer to the hardware is a set of skills beneficial to any .software developer

2077982
cursor	row
put the ids into a temporary table-variable and then iterate throught each row you do not need to use a cursor which will be considerably slower

2077985
python	php
however sometimes knowing another language such as c can make you do the wrong thing because there might be an assumption that is not true in a higher-level language such as python or php

2077986
button	popup
as a workaround have you tried to use an additional calendar button and make the datepicker just popup if you click on that calendar button

2078005

i want to protect the files in a specific directory .so that people cannot link to them - but i still need my program to be capable of rendering them .so passwd protecting the actual folder won t work

2078057
instances	private
if your server is behind a router performing masquerading the server doesn t have a public but private ip-address like 192.168.x.y for instances you have to configure the router to pass a connection from the internet to the computer running the server

2078058
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari

2078058
google-chrome	safari
now in google-chrome and safari this animation performs beautifully

2078070
standard-library	boost
the various boost libs provide some very useful extensions to the standard-library

2078087

directory	folder
all the directory and content apache folder wsgi-script martfiles have the permission 775 root devusers with the grouping devusers including my user http and root

2078162
value	field
ok .so it .sounds like the tousers field can contains value like stuff test option whatever and foo test2 .something blah blah and you want to match the first but not the second

2078177
hide	show
also jquery s show hide functions don t affect the visibility attributes

2078204
32-bit	64bit
saying that you may not find the difference at first depending on the code and depending on your compiler-options but the more different machines you try 32-bit machines and 64bit subtle updates difference in the same distro etc

2078206
parsing	comma
there is also a parsing conflict for invoke it cannot decide between rparen and comma .when empty_stmt_list is indeed an empy list of statements

2078206
function-calls	void
what i m trying to achieve is being able to parsing function-calls which have no void parameters

2078207
getline	istream	istream	std
between std string std stringstream and getline std istream std string you should be pretty good

go back to lisp or scheme since they re the source if you want to be old school

2078227
fflush	stdout
fflush stdout

2078246
contains	set
the various explanations of why things were done this way in java don t seem to apply as much here as map and set do implements the type-safe versioning of contains and friend

2078246
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
is there any way to do a type-safe contains on a seq short of cloning it into a set

2078249
headless-browser	htmlunit
i was doing it by using a headless-browser provided by htmlunit but it takes time to load even simple webpage .so could you please suggest me other apis if any that provide headless-browsers that are fast in loading webpage

2078249
selenium-webdriver	htmlunit
unfortunately the first alternatives i can think of are either htmlunit based like jwebunit or webtest or slower selenium-webdriver - that you can run in headless mode

2078253
callback	methods
we do this by having a single tableview and then doing an if case-statement in each tableview callback methods to return the right data based on which value is selected in the segmented control

2078253
show	next
next .when the segmented control is changed you need to load the data for the new segment and reset the table view to show this data

2078266
swfupload	uploadify
if you can t alter your server environment use one of the flash based upload solutions like swfupload or uploadify

perl	php
perl cgi instead of php

2078341
attributes	properties
cellpadding is not suggested because the padding css properties sufficiently overrides the default properties for the cellpadding table attributes

attributes	properties
as the other answer says there is no compatible css properties for cellspacing in older browsers leaving an html attributes as the only way to completely reset this setting to 0

2078350
mobile-phones	blackberry
if mobile-phones as a whole won t be your primary platform you shouldn t dwell into this that much find something that works such as checked if user-agent string contains blackberry and be satisfied with that

2078350
combinations	permutation
if however you really do want to do it properly you have to develop a feature-detection framework to do the job with all its possible combinations and permutation for you - there s no easy path .when going down that road

2078362
zend-amf	amfphp
from the creator of amfphp but zend-amf is supported by both adobe and zend

2078365
void	main
for example i used void main instead of the standards int main

2078368
scheme	lisp
i think lambda is simplest in lisp since it was designed for that kind of thing and of the dialects scheme tends to be the simplest

entity-framework	nhibernate
both entity-framework and nhibernate are o-r mapping framework

2078381

2078490
clisp	sbcl
this again works fine in clisp but in sbcl it still reads then output

2078491
contains	set
naturally set t can be relaxed to the least specific types that has a contains methods

2078498

this function takes a pointer-to-pointer to an int as an arguments but this argumentss is optional and has a default-value of 0 i.e null

2078596
parallels	bootcamp
if building something is truly not viable your other option is to either virtualize windows using vmware-fusion or parallels desktop or to use bootcamp and create a windows partition

2078645
vba	vb6
the vba libs itself actually got an for the first time since vb6

2078647
arrays	loops
i get numbers of column to declare dynamic 1st arrays then used loops to store value and sum them

2078650

2078654
ppl	tbb
if you arent tied to pure c i would encourage you to look at the c++ tbb libs and particularly the ppl subset you will find more generality and composability like for nested parallelism

2078663

2078836
hash	md5	salt	md5
.when you prefix your salt with 1 you get a hash with an md5

2078836
hash	md5	crypt	hash	crypt	md5
the next part of your confusion is that the md5 function is giving you a hex hash whereas the crypt function is giving you a hash coded in base64

2078849

callback	methods
is the standards in jquery really to use the barebones ajax methods whenever you need an error callback

2079133
python	java
python is not java and you re hamstringing yourself if you re just writing java styles code in the python language

2079133
python	java
if you re lucky enough to be working with a codebase that contains unit tests a great way to go about this is to ports your unit tests from java to python and then write new python to match the unit tests

2079133
python	java
if that s not something that you have then it s much more important to recognize what the software does in java and then write python code that does the same thing

2079143
reflection	runtime
reflection becomes important for this to look at an object and determine it s class at runtime

2079155
value	field
the store object has several field not only id that should not be updatess during this updates had problems that the tryupdatesmodel null-ifies all these field .so i added the includeproperties value with the cleartext of all the params

2079168
malloc	free
malloc will then look at this list for a free block that is the right size or larger

2079170
scala	java
if .so then why does scala complicate things by introducing a new value wrapper instead of following a simple approach used in java

2079178
malloc	free
the answer is that it depends most of the potential slowness rather comes from malloc and free in combinations and usually #1 and #2 will be of similar speed

2079178
malloc	free
writing my own almost standards compliant malloc replacement tool malloc free time from 35 to 3-4 and it seriously optimised those two factors

2079178
malloc	free
it would likely have been a similar speed to use some other high-performance malloc but having our own was more portable to esoteric devices and of course allows free to be inline in some places

2079181
malloc	free
malloc has to run through a linked-list of free blocks to find one to allocate

2079181
malloc	free
in addition if you malloc many small blocks then as you free those blocks you will fragment the heap much more than if you only allocate and free a few large blocks

2079196
value	field
the moment you click the button the field will lose focus and the value will be stored in the field .so you cannot undo it through the default browser procedure

2079196
value	field
on blur of the field the event .when you lose focus you should store the value and .when you click the button revert to the stored one

2079215
python	java
you need a reasonable understanding of both languages to know how construct in java relate to the similar in python and how libs play roles in the translation

2079215
python	java
.so to produce a fair translation i would have relied on a python framework that does for python what servlet containers do for java

2079215
python	java
my points being a java servlet is wrapped up in a significant set of standards .so it makes sense that the python versioning follow a similar route which at a minimum probably means wsgi

2079261
malloc	free
of course this completely depends on the malloc implementation but in this case with no call to free most malloc implementation will probably give you the same algorithmic speed

2079268
hide	show
i have 3 button-images in one page such that .when you press 1 it should show the iframe related to it and hide the others

2079268
hide	show
how can i show 1 frame 1st then .when the other button-image is click that iframe will hide and the iframe corresponding to the button click will be the only 1 showing

2079282
filtering	sorting
it expects primarily numbers because you use this stuff for sorting and filtering after sphinx has already done the search

2079284
arrays	loops
in your generator loops you walk from i 0 to i 12 which is 13 step instead of the 12 of the arrays

2079296
linked-list	nodes
my linked-list class is implements in a seperate class and needs to initializer a nodes .when adding new nodess to the end of the list

2079306
contains	elements
the user can click-and-drag a path which will close itself and the elements contains within the path draw will be selected

2079323
subtract	time
why can t subtract two time object

2079339
arguments	default
overrides your views block argumentss review of nodes title and under action to take if arguments is not present selected provide default arguments - php code

2079353
triggers	insert
i found it easier to add ordinary columns for some field and use insert updates triggers to keep them in sync

2079356
subtract	time
the time object have no date .so for example the 12 00 might be say on a wed and the 11 00 on the preceding tue making the difference 25 hours not one any multiple of 24 might be added or subtract

2079366
client-server	multi-user
5 i want to have the two programs just talk over a ssh channel but both client-server are running on machines that are multi-user

2079367
google-chrome	opera
opera and webkit should be accessible to anyone as far as ie goes there s a plugins for google-chrome that rendering like ie afair and there s a google-chrome plugins for ie too

2079386
inkscape	cairo
my only thought .so far was perhaps using .something like inkscape for model generator svg files and then use cairo to import and rendering them

2079402
constructor	object
an alternative might be to add the session object as a protected member of your class in the constructor and then accessing it from each methods as

2079404
uiscrollview	subviews
uiscrollview is just a subclassing of uiview .so it s possible to add and remove subviews at runtime

2079407
constructor	object
run your methods in the constructor of each class and store the resulting object as an instances variables

2079445
variables	boolean
.when the user connect you can store a boolean in a session variables that says if the user is an admin

2079455
uploadify	.post
if you use latest versioning of uploadify the data in scriptingdata will be passed to scripting as either _.post or _get default is now .post variables

2079510
constructor	private	instances	private
all the other stuff an enum is capable of can just be done with plain vanilla class with a private constructor whose instances in turn are declare as public static final field of the class in question the typesafe pattern

2079514
instances	private
the most notable is you had to overrides the private methods readresolve to stop java creating new instances on deserialization which would break simple reference checked ie using the operators instead of equals

2079514
constructor	private
less error-prone boilerplate private constructor readresolve etc

2079527
any	set
in python 2.6 with its user specific site-packages directory it s possible to set this up on a per-user basis though you may want to find any system-wide sitecustomize.py file and either copy it into yours or find a way to explicit import it in yours

2079529
ironpython	ironruby
ironpython and ironruby will be the only officially supported dynamic-languages

2079534
difference	zero
you will need to adjust your other ul declaration margin-left 10px to suit your needs but this rules will zero it out the difference

2079534
margins	padding
the reason is that each browser uses a different combinations of padding and margins to indentation the ul

2079534
margins	padding
by zeroing out both and setting only one padding or margins you can keep the display consistent

2079534
quirks-mode	doctype
additionally you need to use a valid doctype in your code .so modern browsers don t revert to quirks-mode

2079541
variables	boolean
i tried creating a boolean function to pull out the user variables above and return a true or false of whether the current user has subscribed to that service

2079542
archive	backup
one thing to checked wouldbe if the wildcard path of the log backup is picking up some archive or if the large backup is generator enormous log files for some reason.

2079543
uiimagepickercontroller	uiimage
i use uiimagepickercontroller to let the user take a picture and set the background uiimageview image to the returned uiimage object

2079582
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
regarding filtering sorting and grouping as per aron s answer these are not available on a view over a compositecollection

2079586
contains	any
an aspx file is a separate request from any linked content it contains

2079590
hide	show
i m doing this to show hide the navigation bar

2079600
data-members	instances
however if i add a string data-members the float in both instances is uninitialized

2079615
ready	live	.when	ready
.when the site is completed and ready to go live i created another folder for the actual domain client1.com

2079619
double-quotes	single-quotes
use single-quotes instead of double-quotes

2079626
value	field
to test i had default value in each db field and the methods returned the primary key but the field were blank

2079626
value	field
i removed the default value from the db and i get a sql error cannot insert null into the first field

2079627
double-quotes	single-quotes
ih php double-quotes evaluate expression single-quotes do not .so

2079631
compatibility	platform
you might want to consider using a canvas to do this which works cross platform very well with excanvas include for msie compatibility and of course is supported natively in webkit gecko

2079632
data-members	constructor
i considered having one data-members be the fstream itself opening it in the constructor and closing it in the destructor

2079632
data-members	constructor
since it has no data-members providing a constructor isn t even necessary

2079648
nsnumberformatter	nsformatter
the proper way to validation user-input in cocoa is to use an instances of an appropriate subclassing of nsformatter in this case something like nsnumberformatter

2079649
keydown	keyup
rather than sending shift keydown and shift keyup messages as instructed in the docs you need to set a modifiers flag on the keypress

2079653
double	int
however i want this to work for double or int or any arithmetic types

2079669
environment	building
the correct answer is that i am a idiot for not reliseing that my building environment did change

2079670
value	field
the only thing i would do differently is to model bind to custom viewmodel with the exact field you need and then do the rightly-lefty code to assign just those value

2079671
configuration	environment
set your enhanced improved path in the environment variables configuration of your systemd

2079673
contains	set
i ve been using the backcolor properties and set it for both the menu and the menu.dropdown but its still not changing the colour of the background nor the part of the menu item that contains the image for that menuitem

2079682
swing	awt
but if need to look for alternatives and evaluate them before you decide how to write a gui checkout this list of alternatives to swing and awt

2079710
authentication	login
the code for the login authentication page is something like this

2079724
value	field
whenever an action is initiated that would affect this field say the member gets more points we simply updates this field by running a query to calculate the new value

2079729
jquery-plugins	jquery
i am building a site that uses two jquery-plugins a jquery menu that i modified a bit and the jflow slider

2079733
display	height	display	width
os scrollbar are uniform in width whether display vertically or horizontally .so you can use the width returned as the height of a horizontal scrollbar

2079734
openvpn	ipsec
two use ipsec or openvpn and some local-user rules in the firewall at each end to restrict use of the tunnel to only the user running the tasks in quesion

2079757
virtualbox	vmware
the easiest way is to simply install virtualbox or something similar vmware install centos 3 or any suitable old distro with a 2.4 kernel and building test your .app on that

2079758
scala	java
of course because of its interoperability with java scala allows nulls just as java does

2079758
scala	java
.so if you use java libs if you use badly written scala libs or if you use badly written per.sonal scala libs you ll still have to deal with null pointers

2079765
selection	highlight
you re just setting the whole arrays at once which is inefficient and may cause display problems such as selection highlight disappearing

2079773
innodb	myisam
doing a sort like this is useful only .when you want to backup a myisam table and restore it to an innodb table

2079774
ubuntu	linux
install ubuntu linux free as another partition on your hard-drive

2079777
.when	ready
.so .when you are ready to measure then start the optimizations

2079780
librsvg	cairo
librsvg - uses cairo as a primary backend to rendering svgs

2079790
any	set
make sure you set the background-color or any styles in fact

2079795
web-services	security
http security and asp.net web-services

2079796
silverlight	wpf
i am in silverlight and haven t confirmed this behavior in wpf

2079804
standard-library	boost
boost for the everyday stuff they left out of the standard-library parsing networking threading smart pointers memory pool date time matrix etc.

2079809
callback	methods
with sax you implements callback methods which are called by the parsing as it goes through your document

2079811
selected	textbox
paste a test-url into the textbox on that demo page to see it selected the corresponding link

2079811
selected	textbox
change the textbox value to a new test-url to see it deselected any selecteded links and selected the new link that corresponds to the url provided

2079812
silverlight	wpf
what is the difference between wpf and silverlight

2079822
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is a subset of wpf that runs within a browser much like flash

2079822
silverlight	wpf
silverlight 3 extended its reach onto the desktop as a counter to adobe air .so there isn t much of a gap between silverlight and wpf to the points where one has to question the future of wpf

2079826
terracotta	jgroups
ehcaching supports terracotta rmi jgroups jms caching server as distribution mechanisms and supports both invalidation and replication

2079833
base-class	inherited
compiler error messages asp.net make sure that the class defined in this code file matches the inherited attributes and that it extends the correct base-class page or user-controls

2079837
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is a subset of the functionality in wpf

2079837
silverlight	wpf
wpf is desktops silverlight is cross-platform web apps

2079837
silverlight	wpf
if you want full blown wpf and access to everything wpf can access on the client you can t do silverlight out-of-browser - just building a wpf .app

2079837
silverlight	wpf
wpf and silverlight use xaml at its core to describe the layout

2079860
boolean	double
int64 single double boolean char

2079883
document-management	content-management
i was originally an asp.net developer building web content-management systemd and working with document-management systemd

2079885
administration	account
i wrote a game server plugins last night that allowed me to create a user account and set it as administration which is a huge problem

2079885
account	api
i guess i want to just make sure that .when the client s game servers account are move to limited access account we won t have to worry about any of them using the windows api to sabotage the machines

2079892
administration	account
i wrote a game server plugins last night that allowed me to create a user account and set it as administration which is a huge problem

2079892
administration	account
that s what running as an administration account means administration permissions

2079908
jquery	dojo
why are you using both dojo and jquery

2079915
directory	folder
as a result in my solution i have the main website as well as the virtual directory website which is actually a folder inside this main website

2079925
msbuild	nant
do you have nant install and knowledge of msbuild

2079925
environment	building
you could use msbuilding to compile your project and then use an nant scripting to perform any .post building operations such as deleting your stray web-config file or updating connection strings for a particular environment etc.

2079933
antivirus	security
the problem may be caused by anything from antivirus security software to actual viruses

2079991
mouseover	mouseout
you just need to add a few more mouseover s and mouseout s

2079996
directory	folder
it is necessary to put all .elc files i a folder or just in the same directory has their original .el

2080033
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops	arrays	loops
the each methods for arrays just loops through all the elements using a for-loop i think

2080034
contains	elements	abstract-factory	factory-method
elements of reusable object-oriented software book contains two entries abstract-factory aka virtual constructor and factory-method .

2080034
swing	awt
in turn several implementation would be defined to produce swing widget or awt or whatever

2080034
abstract-factory	factory-method
i believe that a concrete factory is any non-abstract implementation of abstract-factory or factory-method

2080045
duck-typing	mixins
you don t need interface inherited because duck-typing doesn t really care about actual types and you don t need code inherited because mixins are just better for that sort of things

2080048
buffering	streaming
the standards streaming buffering has this functionality

2080057
binary-data	chunks
i m assuming that your input data is binary not text and that you want to extraction chunks of binary-data from it

2080057
boost-serialization	boost	binary-data	chunks
you can combine boost-iostreams basic_array_source and boost-iostreams stream_buffer from boost-iostreams with boost archive binary_iarchive from boost-serialization to be able to use convenient extraction operators to read chunks of binary-data

2080092
linux	unix
an ideal solution for running maintenance scripting executable is to scheduling them using crontab on unix linux systemd or using schedulingd-tasks in windows

2080101
spaces	output
with a spaces followed by the output from toy.play on the same line

2080108
firefox	safari
what happens if the computer s default browser is configure to be a different browser such as firefox or safari each of which has a much longer maximum url length

2080110
matplotlib	scipy
i write scientific software in numpy scipy matplotlib

2080110
matplotlib	scipy
example user upload image or audio file my program process it using numpy scipy and output is display on the browser using matplotlib or perhaps the user can downloading a process file

2080110
matplotlib	scipy
for those interested in numpy scipy matplotlib audiolab here is my ubuntu cheat sheet whenever i launchd an ec2 instances

2080112
data-annotations	xval
.so can anyone provide .some guidance on how to use xval if i m not hand coding my model classes or going to use data-annotations or .something similar i m open to an alternative to xval but i haven t seen anything and i need to stick with asp.net-mvc 1.0 and i need client side validation support

2080127
return-value	arguments
then you can start addressing the bugs in your play implementation why are you making a new toy rather than use the arguments why are you printinging none .when that s not part of the specifications how you re uselessly printinging the return-value of the toy.play methods which returns none implicit rather than working along with the fact that the latter methods is printing ing .something and never increment count and .so ending up in infinite loops

2080134
chi-squared	cdf
at this points you would use the cdf accessor function cumulative distribution function from the boost libs to lookup the p-value corresponding to a chi-squared score of .660 with five degrees of freedom

2080134
chi-squared	probability
you should get something close to 0.015 which would be interpreter as a 1 - .015 98.5 probability of observing a chi-squared score at least as extreme as 0.660 if one assumes the null hypothesis that the die is fair holds

2080134
any	set
.so for this set of data the null hypothesis cannot be rejected with any rea.sonable confidence level

2080138
matplotlib	scipy
.app engine does not support any of numpy scipy or matplotlib alas

2080138
installation	building
if you know exactly what os and cpu your hosts is using you could make an identical installation for yourself downloading and install the same versioning of python they re using downloading the sources of package you required and building them into .so or .pyd depending on the platform files and upload those -- sounds like a real tour de force

2080141
callback	methods
this works fine but i do not like having two callback-related methods for each callback

2080144
submitchanges	datacontext
also checked if you re not swallowing any exception-handling the datacontext may raise on submitchanges

2080149
first-class-functions	lambda
but from the list you give it sounds like what you want is how to program effectively with first-class-functions value which is what lambda evaluates to

2080149
first-class-functions	lambda
most people use first-class-functions heavily find lambda rather annoying and hard to read

2080149
first-class-functions	lambda
schemers like first-class-functions and scheme s notation forces more explicit lambda on the programmer than many other functional languages

2080151
environment	execution
you can t - subsonic works from provider settings that are set for the execution environment

2080154
user-controls	ascx
from what i recall user-controls located in ascx files are never run in the designer

2080154
user-controls	ascx
inorder to run the code in your user-controls visual-studio would have to compile your ascx into a dll then load it and then run the code

2080154
user-controls	ascx
because of this limitation in the clr the user-controls designer doesn t actually compile or run the ascx file

2080154
design-time	designer
for each control it finds in the ascx file it will create the associated control designer and rendering that control s design-time html

2080154
user-controls	ascx
instead of using an ascx user-controls you can write a regular custom control that derives from control and the code is written in a cs or vb file

2080155
lightbox	jquery
tried setting wmode to transparency and also tried several lightbox libs jquery and also mootools based but not prototype yet

2080166
cos	sin
consider a math class that contains some common value like pi or e and some useful functions like sin and cos

2080170
filtering	sorting
i would approach a pipeline design with processor implements sorting filtering aggregation etc

2080170
push	pull
consequently the user-interface needs to be implements in a pull styles rather than push you only want to updates it every second

2080176
value	field
basically i want to to search for the row that has a match in the symbols field then return the value from the securityinfo field in the same row

2080222
contains	elements
can be contains in a dom elements div .so that i can layer it as a background

2080261
dreamhost	bluehost
however dreamhost bluehost for sharedhosts provide ssh access and with shell access you can install numpy using the methods i describe above

2080265
execute	prepare
i ve written a sql query based on qt assistant and it says that you can use the prepare methods instead of execute then you can pass your parameter by the help of two methodss called

2080265
row	col
selected id row col from sometable where row

2080265
row	col
selected id row col from sometable where row

2080270
constructor	object
what you might want to do is implements a factory for your object that take a string defining what class to load and an optional arrays for the constructor parameters

2080275
dependency-injection	singleton
the general concensus is that singleton are ok in a few rare instances for example logging but in most other situations you want to use dependency-injection

2080286
constructor	object
because php handles object by reference technically you could have a base-class that capture an instances of the session in the constructor

2080304
conditional	parentheses
try adding some parentheses to your chospital conditional otherwise the or will not be what you expect

2080312
unsigned	short
the nsevent class has a keycode properties which is defined as unsigned short

2080316
any	set
make sure any labels or anything else you add has and a background-color set

2080319
ref	out
perl 5 has ref count and destructor that are guaranteed to be called .when all references fall out of scoping .so raii is available in the language although most perl programmers don t use the term

2080319
python	lua
i believe python and lua use reference count

2080323
constructor	object
is it possible to pass an object into the constructor of a php class and set that object as a global variables that can be used by the rest of the functions in the class

2080338
any	set
java .sources can be in any encoding .so you can put that string right in the .source and use compiler s options to set the codepages

2080358
perl	php	perl	tcl	python	php	python	tcl	python	perl
perl python c php and tcl are reference counted and have mechanisms to destroy an object once its reference count goes to zero which can happen as soon as a variables goes out of scoping

2080358
python	php
there are some edges cases global-variables might not be release until the end and circular references may not be release until the end though php has recently implements a gc that handles this case and python 2 added a cycle detection

2080361
scaletransform	pan
in code use make a translatetransform and a scaletransform in a transformgroup to pan and zoom

2080373
sql-server	oracle
because it may just be ok what you re seeing as depending on which sql-server you re using the binding could be done by the server oracle

2080373
execute	prepare
if a prepare query with placeholder is execute on a dbms that does not support it the preparation of this query is emulated

2080391
value	field
the problem is that your form is missing first_name and last_name field .so while saving it doesn t even look for these value

2080430
opengl-es	fps
the tiler rendering utilization statistics in the opengl-es instrumentation show that the duty cycle of the gpu is between 20-30 for rendering at 20-30 fps which suggests that the gpu could run at 60 fps if fed fast enough

2080436
gethashcode	equals
unfortunately doesn t overrides equals or gethashcode

2080441
put	get
highlight a shell cmd or just put your cur.sor on it call up the man bundle view manpage and you ll get the full text of the manpage for that cmd in an html windows separate from your scripting with proper headers and other formatting .so that you can actually read it--no rtf symbols no scrolling etc

2080451
postgresql	oracle
if you have to use postgresql instead of oracle or db2 what feature would you miss the most

2080451
postgresql	oracle
let s assume you have the same level of expertise in postgresql oracle and db2

2080460
linux	unix
as a solution to both problems and assuming by unix you mean linux you could look into using dbus

2080482
implements	extends
this not meant to write your own hosts you can to implements ioperationinvoker as in this sample extends wcf with custom behavior

2080486
usergroups	userid
usergroups userid groupid groupkey

2080486
usergroups	userid
the manytomany mapping in usergroups mapped by userid and groupid

2080488
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
for ie there s trixie or ie7pro there s built-in opera support for userscripts and for safari there s greasekit and for google-chrome you can enable user-scripts as well

2080495
windows-xp	windows
windows-xp and windows serverâ 2003

2080495
windows-server	windows-vista
windows-vista and windows-server 2008

2080495
windows-server	windows-xp
.so to answer your question properly this time in windows-xp and windows-server 2003 ip4 no but for ip6 yes

2080495
windows-vista	windows
and for windows-vista and windows 2008 yes except for certain circumstances

2080506
python	java
i do have a background of various other languages incl java c python

2080530
postgresql	mysql
i know this has changed much in recent years as mysql postgresql and other more open less costly product get mentioned in management business news articles and used successfully in critcal systems.

2080539
attributes	properties
it is strange asp.net textbox with multi line attributes does not support max lenth properties

2080546
python	c++

2080724
csv	xml
save the whole lot quick solution is csv or xml - later probably some sql database

2080733

2081037
.when	ready
it will be called .when the document is ready

2081049
any	set
i note that it is possible to call a gurobi plugins dll within msf however i cannot find any place in that api to be able to set the types of the variables correctly i think gurobi call it the vtypes .so i assume it is either not exposed in their .net api or not available in the versioning of gurobi that msf uses

2081052
.when	ready
the function that is passed to document .ready is execute .when the page is loaded and the dom is ready in other words the document has been loaded in memory

any	set
what would be the code to have get accessed by any types within the assembly and set only by derivated typess within the assembly

2081257
contains	any
.source code doesn t carry any intrinsics encoding information .so it is easy to corrupt string literals that contains characters outside the basic ascii range

2081269
abstract-class	derived-class
you can still extends the abstract-class and call the abstracts class constructor in your derived-class

2081287
aggregate	grouping
if you don t do anything special all rows in the entire table will be used as one big grouping and .when an aggregrate function like max is there all these rows will be condensed into just one aggregate row

2081287
aggregate-functions	sum
that condensing effect would have occurred also for other aggregate-functions like min sum group_concat and friend see

2081287
filtering	grouping	aggregate	grouping
you can al.so apply specific groupinging using the grouping by construct but if you don t the occurrence of the aggregate-functions will just bunch up all rows into one row but this bunching-up occurs after applying the where conditional .so only the filtering rows are aggregate

2081298
getter	setter	protected	public
since the class itself is only visible in the declaring assembly due to the implicit internal access modifiers just make the getter on the properties public and the setter protected

2081374
vba	vb6
an link to an vb6 or vba solution is just fine here

2081375
oracle	mysql
i m not all that familiar with mysql but here s how i d do it in oracle

2081425
value	field
you basically just need to defined that shape of your data - the field in your individual line in the csv - by means of a public class and .so well-thought out attributes like default value replacements for null value and .so forth points the filehelpers engine at a file and bingo - you get back all the entries from that file

2081441
children	tree	children	nodes
i am trying to understand why .when deleting a nodes in a bst tree and having to keep the children and adhering to the bst structure you have to either take the nodes s right child higher value then nodes being deleted and if that right child has a left child take that child

2081446
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
also you should be calling it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

2081538
webrick	thin
i ve tested it with webrick and thin

2081552
updating	updates
a crontab scheduling task would work well to make sure everyone is updatess but in some situations it might be better to simply measure how long it s been since you ve updatess each user s resources and then updates them on every page load they make while logged in by multiplying the time they ve been away by the rate at which they gain resources - that way you avoid updating until you actually need the new value

2081553
32-bit	64bit
alternatively checked how much ram is on your 32-bit box is it comparable to the 64bit box

2081561
instrumentation	profiling
this is actually nicely capture by the wikipedia page on profiling which mentions that instrumentation can causes changes in the performance of a program potentially causing inaccurate inaccurate results and heisenbugs due to the observers effect observerss affect what they are observing by the mere act of observing it alone

2081561
performance-testing	benchmarking
but if you want to benchmarking your libs you should use a performance-testing tool for example something like jmeter that will be able to give you an average execution-time per call

the concept of singleton have many uses logging configuration not to mention .when the domain you re working actually has things where there is ever only one instances of them and you wish to model that

2081617
constructor	private	constructor	object	instances	private
in java we enforce an object can t be construct by declaring the constructor private the problem with this is we also have to provide a global points of access to the instances through the concrete class

2081617
constructor	private	instances	private
in the context of guice it guarantees one instances but it doesn t achieve this with the evil private constructor global points of access mechanism

2081626
json	xml

i have only tested turbo-pascal and free pascal with fpc objfpc tp delphi model .also the gcc g++ and msvc produce the same result.that is assigment from int which is size of 4 byte on my computer to short int size of 2 will not triggger any compile errors while you could set proper options to make the compilers generator possible lose of data warnings

2081692
click	mouse
it will not make the browser perform the default actions for a user-generated action like a keystroke or mouse click

2081692
value	field
if however you want the value that was present at the time the field was last focused as ie behaves .when there is no reset button you will have to do some variable-remembering eg.

2081711

2081964
attributes	properties
you do this via attributes on the properties like this

2081967
for-loop	loops
the prohibition on modifying what pascal call the control variables of a for-loop combined with the lack of a break statement means that it is possible to know how many time loops body is execute without studying its contents

2081967
arrays	loops
without a break statement and not being able to use the control variables after loops terminate is more of a restrictions than not being able to modify the control variables inside loops as it prevents some string and arrays process algorithms from being written in the obvious way

2081967
while-loop	for-loop
clearly we never need to be able to modify the control variables in a for-loop because we can always rewrite using a while-loop

2081968
attributes	properties
you can add and attributes to make it nicer but as long as it s a public properties it should show up in the properties panels

2082010
decrement	increment

derived-class	base-class
the documentation is quite clear that there s no way to tell from an instances of a base-class whether or not it should actually be an instances of a derived-class

2082039
value	field
then you can filtering on the value of this field

2082052
checkbox	textbox
then you could loops over those field to output the form field though you may have to hardcode some logic to handle what s a textbox what s a checkbox etc.

2082055
protected	public
like a private or public or protected variables

2082070
xsd	xml
to validation you need a xml schema for these xml files coming in - you can fairly easily create one using the xsd.exe tool in your windows sdk directory which takes a xml file and turns it into a xsd xml schema file

2082079
attributes	properties
here s a full example that removes one properties xmlignore changes another to an attributes and leaves a third as an elements

2082084

2082130
for-loop	loops
it s probably safe to conclude that pascal was designed to prevent modification of a for-loop index inside loops

2082130
fortran	pascal
it s worth noting that pascal is by no means the only language which prevents programmers doing this fortran is another example

2082131
any	set

contains	elements
you will not find an elements in the resulting arrays contains the string |p

2082169
getter	setter
if i understand you correctly and you want a way to key dictionaryionary in a non case-sensitive fashion one way would be to subclassing dictionary and overload the setter getter

2082186
constructor	private
you can make the class nonconstructable by making the constructor private to make sure that noone does try to initializer the class

2082211
arrays	map
this is easily done with pure ruby with the map instances methods of the arrays class

2082211

arrays	map
.so what i would like to do next is to map and .sort the elements in the newarr arrays into new arrayss for each different .sort

2082285
arrays	map
i know how to do this with the .sort methods but i cant figure out how to do it from within the map methods .so that i can make it into a new arrays

2082286

2082294
duplicates	sorted
i want to get output with removed duplicates and sorted too

2082318
spring	grails
it s quite decent compared to the previous plugins versioning and since spring source has acquired the company responsible for grails and groovy you can expect that sts will become better quickly

2082331
itemscontrol	tabcontrol
if i ditch the tabcontrol and use an itemscontrol will i encounter a similar issue

2082333
contains	set
set the properties java.library.path to the directory contains the dll

2082348

i m not as versed in cms design as i could be but i know c# pretty well and it s hard for me to see what advantages c# offers over python in this problem domain especially given robust frameworks like django and pylons as a starting points

2082358
python	perl
a somewhat ugly solution would be to write a small perl or python scripting which converts the binary streaming to textual hexadecimal numbers and then use expect to work with that

2082364
zend-debugger	xdebug
i use eclipse-pdt as ide and it supports debugging for both webpage and command-line scripting using the xdebug extension -- and zend-debugger should i add even if i have never used it

then i would loops over the vector again and fill the new arrays

2082453
base-class	inherited
suppose i have a base-class person and i publicly inherited a class teacher from base-class person

2082453
derived-class	base-class
now the problem is suppose i write the copy-constructor for the base-class only what happens is the default copy-constructor of the derived-class will call my written copy-constructor

2082453
derived-class	base-class
now the copy-constructor of the derived-class i.e teacher will call the default-constructor of the base-class but not the copy-constructor why

2082453
derived-class	base-class
is only default copy-constructor of the derived-class can call the copy-constructor of the base-class automatically

2082472
frame	width
if your sprite is 32 pixels wide and your textures is 256 pixels wide thus contains 8 frame you ll want to divide the width of the sprite by the width of the textures giving you a numbers between.

2082489
arrays	loops
then allocate an arrays that size and loops over your old arrays again copying matching elements into the new arrays

2082511
pipe	tail	tail	eof
since tail needs to work with pipe that you can t rewind you ll have to keep a rotating buffering of the last n line you ve read which you will dump on eof

2082527
wireless-connection	ethernet
i was able to easily complete the task but .when i tested my application over my wireless-connection and tried communication with my desktop computer ethernet on the same network i found some odd behavior

2082545
environment	building
having an automated repeatable building-process and being able to prove that the current building passes all tests and runs in a server environment is worth the effort on any size project imho

2082549
copy-constructor	constructor
this constructor is generator in a way that it call the copy-constructor of the base-class

2082549
copy-constructor	constructor
if you implements the copy-constructor yourself you also specify what base-class constructor should be used see motti s answer

2082549
copy-constructor	constructor
.so the compiler automatically generator a rea.sonable copy-constructor but if you want .something special no further magic is going on and you have to specify yourself how that constructor exactly should look like

2082567
function-call	inline
to inline is to remove the function-call and place it s contents directly where the call would be made

2082570
inlining	inline
the compiler will make up its own mind whether to inline a function or not - it might take the programmer suggests inlining this into account but on most compilers simply declaring a function as inline doesn t guarantee it will be

2082587
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if you have an nsdate you can use the current nscalendar to retrieve that date s nsdatecomponents

2082587
nsdateformatter	nscalendar	nsdatecomponents	nscalendar	nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
then use the nscalendar to convert both the nsdatecomponents back to their respective nsdate object after which you can use an nsdateformatter to create your string representation

2082589
show	next
and also i know you can show the first last days of the next previous month as well but these are standards not selectable it is possible to make these selectable

associations	model
is for .when you re working with model that have associations

2082900
getter	setter
.so i create an instances of that class .somewhere and now i want to change position.x that would be impossible now because the getter and setter set and get the whole object

2082903
constructor	object
you can make the instances creation easier by providing useful constructor or adding methods that return a modified object instead of modifying the value

2082910
firefox	safari

2082912
value	field
upon selected an option it returns to the previous view with the selected value filling that field

2082921
any	set
the simplest way would be to set a custom view with any numbers of images as the cell s contentview

environment	building
what you do need is the tests the building automation revision control and a controlled building environment

2082933
margins	padding
a needs to have padding margins set to 0

2082993
initializer	setter
since debugfile seems an optional dependency i d suggest to initializer a sane default on creation of the class and then allow changing it by setter injection .when needed

2082994
ubuntu	debian
i know there are ppa-repositories for ubuntu and maybe for debian also

2082994
bazaar	git
neither mercurial nor bazaar or git does encoding conversion like subversion see characterencodingonwindows

2082994
bazaar	git
mercurial is not designed for this purpose and i don t think bazaar or git would be more fun on this

2082998
widget	button
however i now want to implements a button on my widget that updates the info in my widget textview

2083002
constructor	private
if you want a real c-style arrays you have to add a pointers private member to your class and allocate dynamically the memory for it in the constructor with new

2083002

if instead you want to do a deep-copy you ll have to allocate the new memory and copy all the object of the source arrays to the target arrays

2083008
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
lookup user-agent strings for ie firefox opera safari and you ll start to see what s going on

2083009

as a simple example you could add a md5 hash of the id parameter and the current session s id and recreate compare that checksum during a postback

2083057
mersenne-twister	generator
if you re using a good random nunber generator such as the mersenne-twister which is the default in the standards .lib for most modern languages though not for c and c++ and you re not using any saved state from previous rolls other than the mersenne-twister generator itself then your rolls are for all practical purposes independent of one another

2083098
uninstaller	msiexec
you can force a recache reinstall using with msiexec the recommended way to updates buggy installation package that cannot be otherwise removed is to recache with a fixed package then uninstaller as usual

2083182
great-circle	haversine
haversine is a php function that should return the great-circle distance in miles or km given a pair of latitude and longitude value

2083182
latitude-longitude	location
one of these pairs should be provided by php and the other pair should be provided by each latitude-longitude row available in the location table

2083205
haskell	c++
i recommend spending .some quality time with haskell and fp in general before jumping in to develop a fully-fledged application .so you can get more familiarized with haskell since it s quite different from c++

2083206
put	get
as said above just put all the data you want to get back in an arrays and encode that

2083235
attachment-fu	paperclip

2083320
javafx	swing
but you can try javafx s scripting language might be easier to master first. you can easily learn your way in the simple cases from the generator code then continue using swing javadoc and google

2083344
any	set	value	field
you will have to manually tracking each field since the dataset only keeps per-row or per-table changes and any change is a change even if you set the same value

2083373
asp.net-mvc	webforms
we have a large webforms application here that we would like to ports over to asp.net-mvc piece by piece

2083373
asp.net-mvc	webforms

normally what you would do is declare an iboutlet in your .app delegation that points to the view controllers then use interface-builder to connect that view controllers to the outlet in the .app delegation

2083465
lookup	any
as you have pointed out the bar pattern guarantees a table-scan for every lookup which nullifies any possible search ingenuity in the database software

2083471
groovy	java	python	java
you would be better off looking at implements your application in java c# vb.net python or groovy and innumerable other more suitable languages

2083471
actionscript	haxe
if you really have your heart set on actionscript javascript-style syntax then you should look into haxe

2083487
codeigniter	kohana
kohana as well as codeigniter and most of other frameworks relies on the front-controller pattern index.php .so unless you deeply hacked it i cannot see how you don t need to rely on it

2083514
contains	lookup
if very hypothetical reasoning one creates a database which optimized lookup time without using indic then such a database contains only one index is not a bad idea

2083516
children	nodes
then the left-most child of the application root which has two child nodes which each have two child nodes would checked if it s in the right state if it s children are transitioned out

2083517
arrays	loops
.so you loops through the arrays holding the audio file and replace the previous value for each sample with the value 1.8

2083522
dictionary	arrays	nsstring	nsdata	nsarray	plist	nsarray	nsdate
plists are always loaded into arrays or dictionary of plist object nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary

2083522
dictionary	arrays
.so the only way to deal with them is to load the plist into an arrays or dictionary then iterate through the resulting object inorder to building new arrayss or whatever of the appropriate types

2083546
buildpath	libs
edit the project s properties right-click project properties java buildpath libs remove and add libs

python	perl
simple text filtering is probably easier to write in perl my choice because i ve been using it for years or python what i recommend to new people because it s a more modern language

2083796
asp.net-mvc	webforms
any advantage that you may possibly get from converting a large webforms .application where you use the session object quite heavily to an asp.net-mvc .app will be swamped by the costs of rewriting the .application

2083796
delphi	vb6
their motivation was that they had heard just how wonderful one of microsoft s new technologies was going to be vb6 if you need to know - the original tech was delphi

g++	gcc
you are better off not using the linker directly because it is much simpler to use either gcc or g++ and give them specific linker options if required

2083834
contains	any
it saves a small amount of memory and a small amount of disk spaces if you distribute any archive form contains only the .pyo files

2083836

.so what i ve done is created a new table changed the old table to a view and created triggers on the view to allow insert updates and delete statements

2083910
value	field
checked to see if the column has null is not enough because the insert statement can explicit set the field value to null and this is perfectly acceptable

2083914
nested	order
the existing answers here relate to releasing nested resources in reverse topological order

2083941
carbon	cocoa
this seems like it should be strait forwarding but a lot of the information i m finding it pre-snow leopard deals with cocoa and carbon or the xcode ide

callback	methods
in the context of ruby-on-rails i understand that before_filter is a callback that will fire login_required methods .when the report action is called

2084011
attributes	properties
you can verify that an identity-column will be updates on submitchanges by looking at the attributes for the mapped properties or elements if you are using an external xml mapping file

2084011
attributes	properties
there are two properties that will be set on the attributes and - the first attributes tells linq that the target column s value is created by the database such as for identity columns or timestamp rowversion columns and the latter tells linq to updates the model object with the value after a database insert

2084016
integrated	manual
there is also cas user manual which can be integrated with django-cas

2084051
callback	methods
this is a parameter to the before_filter methods and used as a callback using object#send

2084055
xsd	xml
one approach to making this legacy data standards compliant is to convert it to xml and publishing the xsd - making it available to all

2084062
display	width
if you re looking to limit the amount of items display you can do this with a fixed width on your list items and overflow hidden to clip additional items from being display

2084062
display	height
this applies a class to the list which removes the fixed height allowing all of the list items to be display

2084065

triggers	insert
if you had an after triggers you could test to see if the insert value is the default-value

2084117
triggers	insert
if the default is null eg nullable and no default then how can you distinguish if null is explicit insert in any triggers

associations	model
i would like to make another associations called completed_projects which uses completer_id as the foreign key for the user in the through model rather than user_id

2084185
cvs	git
it should be easy to add support for other vcs tools git cvs etc..

2084187
codedom	.net
the new expression-trees in .net 4 seem like a much better representation of what features the codedom should offer at a block level as in a block of statements that makes up a function body

2084190
associations	model
the meta-model describe the tables columns and associations in your model

2084215
switching	screens
i m comfortable that i can force the application to navigate down to the required level through code but i would like to hide the screens switching and animation that would occur while this is going on thus presenting the user with apparently a direct path to their last used screens rather than showing them the underlying navigation that s occurred

2084225
web-testing	selenium
sure you can use a web-testing framework like selenium but you probably won t be practicing true tdd

2084228
32-bit	64bit
the reason i could only get it working on x11 is because it seems the opengl libs on the os are for the 64bit architecture but eclipse will only compile code if we use 32-bit architecture

2084233
click	mouse
how can i make a selenium click work the same as a manual mouse click

i am developing an application in cocoa which show a view with two nstextfield and two nsbuttons.to enable tab keystroke the next key view is set to next control from nstextfield1 to nstextfield2 then from nstextfield2 to nsbutton 1 then from nsbutton1 to nsbutton 2 then nsbutton2 to nstextfield1 .but the problem is i am able to navigate from nstextfield1 to nstextfield2 using tab key the next tab navigates to nstextfield1 instead of navigating to nsbutton 1.i am not getting whats going wrong here

2084346
selected	button
what i need is .when a user selected a datagridviewrow and then click on a delete button the row should be deleted and next the database needs to be updates using table adaptor

2084359
required	checked
i think what judo tried to explain is - a new status in the db will required to put checked s for that new status in the conditional blocks

2084378
value	field
i need to checked all field have value onclientclick of button

2084378
required	checked
the button already has a cmd but i need to checked run through the page for required field

2084378
required	checked
if possible maybe something that continue checked on the form display text this is required before making button visibe

2084391
json	xml
i m also open to solutions based on some other xml or json libs but have tried the following and pretty much run into a similar problem

2084394
selected	cell
the desired behavior is akin to the mirrored text editing field provided in excel .when a given cell is selected allowing more spaces to view the contents of the cell

2084394
jtextfield	jtable
.so far i ve got the jtable tablemodel tablemodellistener jtextfield listselectionlistener and abstractaction working together to provide most of the functionality describe above

2084403
put	get
case in points while we re not allowed to code new functionality without funding we can as a lab-type environment put together a poc proof-of-concept on our own dime and then find that it s remarkably easy to get that to a production-quality solution

2084434
put	get
this error means you are trying to .post put delete to a path that only accepts get request

2084447
playlist	playing
the process of recieving and playing the playlist is invisible to the user.

2084469
value	field
probably the easiest thing to do would be just output a hidden form field with the time value there as well

2084473
mechanize	selenium
but it is sufficient to test that the words and numbers in the page data are correct using a programmatic browser surch as mechanize and a page scraper and have a few superficial functional tests with selenium or windmill if the page is critically dependent on javascript

2084512
spring	grails	wicket	spring	wicket	grails
about spring-roo i ve read previous answers like spring-roo vs wicket and spring and other things over the internet but i m still not convinced maybe i don t get it i m not sure of its maturity and more important i m really wondering what springsource is doing with grails and roo no grails vs roo - why springsource is pushing two very similar technologies

linux	unix
if you are on a linux unix systemd then printing the ansi escape sequences to clear the screens should do the job

2084573
pointers	stack
question 1 by automatically and very efficiently they mean that just by shifting a memory pointers around cutting the top off stack all memory used there is reclaimed

2084573
pointers	stack
question 2 stack is just a contiguous chunks of memory delimited by a start and an end pointers

2084573
pointers	stack
everything between the pointerss belongs to stack everything beyond the end pointers is considered free memory

2084573
pointers	stack
you allocate and deallocate memory by moving the end pointers the top of stack around

2084580
sql-server-express	sql-server
as a student i have access via dreamspark to sql-server 2008 developer edition and with the default vs 2008 install i have sql-server-express 2005 install already

put	get
using user-interface-automation i do not get references to the actual object instances of the user-interface elements hence i can not put an adorner on top of it

2084614
children	nodes
however contents only gets immediate children nodes not descendants

2084619
enterprise	licensing
for most purposes whatever you code on sql developer can also execute on sql express but you have to be careful not to use any of the enterprise features - licensing enterprise can be a pricey option

2084632
lan	vpn
by using point-to-point or vpn you can pretend as if you are hitting a computer over lan

2084634
python	c++
i used python but since i import ctypes module c++ explanation is okay

2084652
.net	wcf
i understand that the .net ria service are a good framework for this sort of thing authentication from a silverlight control to a wcf webservice

2084653
configuration	environment
generally this pre-instantiation is desirable because errors in the configuration or surrounding environment are discovered immediately as opposed to hours or even days later

2084662
administration	account
whether a server plugins can create an account with administration privileges is actually not determined by your choice of language c and c++ behave exactly the same but whether the server process itself is already running with administration right

2084662
administration	account
if the server process is running as a normals user it can t can create administration account and therefore none of its plugins can

2084678
attributes	properties
if your review is always composed of 8 attributes for example those would be distinct properties in the same table

2084679
32-bit	64bit
in c long is 32-bit wide but in c# and vb.net long is 64bit wide on both 32-bit and 64bit systemd

2084687
factors	primes
this forces the client to factors the numbers you can get code to do this in javascript and this will take time this is where profiling clients comes in and sending down appropriately-sized primes obviously this opens you to degradation-attacks but nevertheless

2084695
contains	any
a single circle that is the smallest possible circle to completely contains 2 or more circles of any size and location

2084717
arrays	loops
hint in loops put the result into an arrays of characters and .when you re finished start at the last index of the arrays and printing backwards.

2084727
value	field
if the .source is a relational-database you may want to use an orm but if not such classes need to be modeled .so that they correctly protect the invariants of each row if a field is non-nullable the class should guarantee this by throw an exception-handling if a null value is attempted

2084743
hide	show
flexibility in user-interface you can show the tabs or hide them

2084746
reflection	runtime
however remember that reflection can be a very slow process at runtime

2084760
32-bit	64bit
updates the problem here ended up being that i had install mysql multiple time first 32-bit then 64bit .when i realized i should be doing that and although i followed some instructions on how to uninstaller mysql the instructions are slightly different for snow leopard

2084773
actionscript	mxml
to do something in a different way because it saves a lot of work using mxml instead of actionscript

2084794
value	field	updating	updates
for the purpose of organizing streamlined database timer-based polling with every updating of database-table i need to updates a timestamp field in a sql-server 2008 database then poll read its value compare with the value in front-end and making decisions about reading the whole table

2084800
32-bit	64bit
fixed enable 32-bit apllications needs to be true .when creating application pool through installshield in a 64bit os

2084801
derived-class	base-class
i think this limitation of access in the derived-class is actually of no use because you can always access g and a from a pointers to the base-class

2084809
delphi	c++
if you know of a good way to do it with mfc that s cool delphi c++ builder is totally cool too

2084812
arrays	loops
i could for instances just append those value to the arrays and but that would throw the order out of whack and i kinda need it for subsequent foreach loops

2084816
comma	words
i m having some difficulty having this code generator a numbers of permutation orderings on a string separated by comma ...i can do just a regular string and have the permutation work on just letters but it is a bit more difficult .when doing it with words separated by the comma.

2084816
comma	words
...and by permutation i mean orderings of the words separated by the comma s

2084817
order	join
i have got a query which join only two tables and has four conditional in its where-clause with an order by

2084823
qapplication	qwidget
however .when i attempt to create a qwidget it complains that the qapplication needs to be created first

2084823
google-chrome	firefox
a netscape plugins for google-chrome or firefox

2084847
sql-server	oracle
see better concurrency in oracle than sql-server

2084849
communication	messages
it s better to use an inter-thread communication mechanism like semaphores or messages to communication to the thread that it should stop execution

2084862
uitableview	uiview
in that case make an empty uiview as the root view and put the uitableview as a subviews of it

2084875
emacs	vim
emacs is beautiful but even after 1.5 years of emacs i m still faster at getting work done in vim

2084885
windows-xp	windows
windows 7 sets windows-xp sp 3 compatibility mode for vs 2008 by default

python	perl
i don t know in shell or perl but in python would be

2084910
firefox	gecko
gecko and its derivative such as mozilla firefox

2084911
.net	wcf
also you can choose to hosts the wcf service in a way that suites your needs iis nt service or any other .net process you can come up with

2084911
.net	wcf
al.so wcf is easily setup and .net gives you all the tools you need for communication .so you don t have to do as little plumbing as possible

2084931
sql-server-express	sql-server
i want to migrate one of our databasis from sql-server-express to sql-server compact 3.5

2084934
32-bit	64bit
however .when the process itself is 32-bit and the os as 64bit process-explorer at least v10 the latest v11.33 cannot find the new variables

2084934
32-bit	64bit
if the program is native 64bit then everything works fine just as well as 32-bit process running on 32-bit os

2084950
value	field
the setting up of the field value assignment will be similar in both cases .so what you have to compare are the other as.sociated costs

2084973
required	checked
you can then use the luid_and_attributes that you ve located and checked to see if the attributes contains the required flag se_privilege_enabled in your case

2084974
wicket	jsf
there is also a good comparison wicket -- jsf in terms of performance

2084976
datagridview	databound
i need to get the currently selected object from da databound datagridview

2084976
selected	cell
i do not need the object of the current selected cell but the object on which the whole row is based in this case a businessobject whos properties make the columns of the grid

2084989
google-chrome	firefox
your code works correctly for me in firefox 3.5.5 and google-chrome 4.0.249.64

2084990
derived-class	base-class
the access of a member of a base-class can be changed in the derived-class by mentioning its qualified-id in

2084990
derived-class	base-class	protected	public
i would say that most often it s not good to change public members to private or protected members in the derived-class because this will violate the substitution principles you know a base-class has some functions and if you cast to a derived-class then you expect those functions to be callable too because the derived-class is-a base

2085012
arrays	loops
where additems is a function that loops through the arrays

2085026
contains	any
as explain in the qt documentation any gui application using qt needs a qapplication to be created into main thread since it is contains all signals engine and event-loop

2085038
32-bit	64bit
i m not sure how wow64 works but i m pretty 99 sure there are two pebs process environment blocks created - a 32-bit one and a 64bit one

2085075
contains	any
types 3 fonts can contains any postscript

2085076
triggers	insert
if you want a datetime field contains a date and time of the last modification you re best option would be to have a after insert after updates triggers on that table which sets the last updatess column to the current date time of the sql-server automatically without you having to do anything about it

2085082
udp	tcp
the way that you avoid losing data is to use tcp not udp

2085087
nsstring	uilabel
it is preferable to draw text in drawrect using nsstring s drawrect methods which will give the look of a transparency uilabel

2085097
highlight	selected
what i need is to alter the rendering html page in my webbrowser-control to highlight selected text

2085130
value	field
i d use the isnull function - it will return the value given if the field is null

2085135
attributes	properties
this way you don t technically need to use javascript the css is intelligent enough to interrogate the href attributes and apply the appropriate css properties

2085141
constructor	object
.so for an object the properties you think important such as required field in a webforms are passed as parameters into constructor

2085141
constructor	object
edit sorry about the way i asked question.yes we create an object with constructor and we assign value with setter but my question is about the comparison between default-constructor with setter and constructor with explicit parametrs

2085146
web-services	api
the web-services are typically accessed via an ajax api or equivalent but will obviously take longer for backup of large-files

2085152
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works all well and good in browsers such as safari google-chrome and firefox but come to internet-explorer 7 and it s a no-go

2085152
internet-explorer	safari
the above link is a rendering page within the site featuring the wall with the hover feature working in safari et al but not internet-explorer 7 untested in other versioning due to lack of resources

2085153
constructor	object
you have to call setter on an object and the constructor creates that object

2085153
constructor	object
without a constructor invocation you ll have no object to call upon

2085153
initializer	setter
in java and c# the parameters passed into the constructior can be used to initializer field once only and the field are immutable from that points on unlike .when you set these via setter

2085155
principles	srp
in my opinion this does not violate the srp principles

2085161
configuration	environment
for instances you might write the configuration file such that it checked some global systemd environment variables and then overrides selected settings if it s a dev-machine

2085161
any	set
you could also checked the hostname or simply any old environment variables which all developers agree to set on their development machines

2085164
constructor	object
you pass the parameters in a constructor that are required inorder to create an object that is in a valid state

2085164
value	field
for your example i would not pass required field in a webforms to the instances of the class that is filled up with those value

2085174
getter	setter
if you find you have a lot of parameters you may want to create a types representing all the related ones - that types may have a bunch of getter setter

2085182
configuration	environment
if possible try to extraction all the configuration sections that depend on the deployment environment connection strings paths etc into separate files

2085182
configuration	environment
then link to them from the main common configuration file .so that it will be just a matter of updating the reference .when you change your environment from development to production

2085183
literals	hardcode
cleaning up old c++ code that used hardcode int literals instead of enums it is tedious to find places where the function-declaration has been properly refactored but not the body

2085193
configuration	environment	build-process	ant	build-process	msbuild
regarding settings for staging production-environment what we do is to have seperate configuration files for each environment and then swap them out as part of our build-process using ant and msbuild

2085200
hide	show
all i m trying to do is add a speed to jquery s hide and show functions

2085200
hide	show
to hide an image change it and then show it again

2085203
javascript	dom
i am using javascript to create a dom elements

2085223
selected	button
set the momentary properties of the control to true - this was cause your button not to be selected

2085266
selected	button
i have 3 tags with a hyperlink or button against each which has to be used to clear the filepath if anything was previously selected

2085277
glassfish	weblogic
then in a appserver-specific deployment-descriptor for glassfish it s sun-ejb-jar.xml for jboss it s jboss.xml for weblogic it s weblogic-ejb-jar.xml etc declare a elements indicating the resource reference named and the global jndi binding via the elements

2085313
configure	libtool
note that you can easily configure libtool not to building any static libs with in your configure.ac by default

2085319
dialog	pop-up
i have tried windows.close methods but it doesnt work as the context is not the pop-up windows but the open save dialog box

2085333
authentication	login
i have an existing asp.net 1.1 application a which uses a 3rd party java application for login authentication

2085333
authentication	login
application a will than decrypt the url and perform session login for the authentication user

2085371
value	field
the field will still have a non-null value which could lead to subtle problems elsewhere

2085386
configuration	environment
i need to do the same thing with having dev stage production sites that load different configuration and plan to use environment settings and have it detection the hostname as a fallback if the env setting isn t set

2085396
combinations	permutation
take a look into this libs permutation combinations and variations using c# generics

2085403
getter	setter
if you re in the same object you could use a normals member variables if you re calling between object you could just provide getter and setter for that variables

2085411
jax-rs	cxf
cxf jax-rs provides support for a numbers of advanced http features by handling if-match if-modified-since and etags headers

2085443
textbox	button
i get results true or false on the base of user authentication now my goal is to show another screens on successful authentication with some new textbox and button i mean new layout how to achieve this

2085445
contains	elements
i want to implements a search-box with a attached list that containss only elements that contains the whole string entered in the search-box

2085478
printwriter	ioexception
a second note instances of printwriter never throw ioexception you should test for errors calling checkerror which also fflush the streaming

2085485
enumerate	next
next use these functions to read the variants types as your own enumerate types

2085487
any	set
note that reflector allows you to dinamically add any .net-assembly meaning that it will search for system.exception derived types in any custom set of assemblies you provide

2085495
tokenize	parsing
parsing html is difficult and you should try using a 3rd party framework that building a html dom preferably using some form of tokenize instead of using regular expression

2085516
versioning	upgrade
i may not be able to just updates upgrade the perl versioning easily due to policies in-place in my organization that s just the way it is i don t want a side discussion on this

2085516
linux	unix
even the same perl versioning on different linux unix distributions can be different

2085555
constructor	object
by definition an object is only construct once hence the constructor is only called once

2085561
constructor	object	.when	ready
an object should be 100 ready to go .when it s created .so you should be writing one constructor that initializer its entire state

2085572
value	field	getter	setter
in the withevents case will in fact call a properties setter and will fetch the value from a properties getter while in the second case there will be no properties created for the value but the code will access the field directly

2085580
hidden-field	checkbox
html.checkbox causes another hidden-field to be added with the same named id as of your original checkbox

2085588
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate entity-framework activerecord or linq2sql

2085613
initializer	getter
one idea was to use the model object in the view merge the passed in object with the current hibernate-session and access all getter to fully initializer the object

2085626
dlopen	dlsym
the closest would be through dynamic loading of libs dll such as with dlopen dlsym on linux

2085636
any	set
set labels s numbersofline properties to 2 or to 0 to have any numbers of line you need

2085641
dlopen	dlsym
libs binding or dynamic-linking as it s called is done via dlopen and dlsym on nix and loadlibs and getprocaddress on windows

2085646
environment	execution
late-binding is not really a function of the c language itself more something that your execution environment provides for you

2085646
dlopen	dlsym
many systemd will provide deferred binding as a feature of the linker loader and you can al.so use explicit call such as dlopen to open a shared libs and dlsym to get the address of a symbols within that libs .so you can access it or call it

2085672
buffering	streaming
it will be flushing the streaming buffering which is potentially very inefficient

2085676
matplotlib	networkx
i have install matplotlib and networkx package

2085689
contains	elements
this employs the trick of using xmlelements to remove the parent nodes of the collections which should mean that no elements is emitted and for each object contains in the outer arrays which will be of types a elements should be emitted

2085699
put	get
because it s a uiimageview i have to put layer after blocky otherwise i get the following error

2085699
put	get
my problem is .when i m .sorting it i don t know where to put the .layer .so i get the same problem because uiimageviews can t deal with key on there own

2085719
carbon	cocoa	32-bit	64bit
the default mac qt libs are carbon 32-bit whereas mac systemd python is 64bit and needs the cocoa libs

2085745
constructor	object
the fact that a constructor can run only once is an advantage as it allows you to write code that will be execute exactly once per object

2085766
value	field
ususally one would take each field one wants to include the in the hashcode convert it to an int and multiplying it by a fixed numbers such that the different object with different value for the field give different hashcode that are well spread across the int range

2085772
order	join
i ve tried a few variations on the same without the join and two sub-statements adding order by as advised by the documentation

2085783
low-level	hardware
you usually use kernel debuggingging .when you need to debugging low-level device drivers integration directly with the hardware

2085785
arrays	loops
currently i have to loops through the contents of the arrays to find elements with certain value

2085791
jquery	.post
reading the jquery documentation i have seen that the callback functions on both .post and getjson only fire if the result is valid json - which leads me to believe that something is wrong with the returned result-of getallusertasksforstage

2085798
rollback	commit
i could hg rollback but this rollback only the last commit

2085828
richfaces	tomahawk
one serious restrictions is that i can t use tomahawk or richfaces or anything else

similarly in the second.aspx third.aspx pages i am using the class current to highlight the selected tab.recently we have planned to move to master pages.so the master page should contains the ul li code for the tabs.but the problem is that i do not understand how to apply the class current to the selected tab in the case of the master page.could someone please help

2085914
attributes	properties
if i have an informational properties that provides an editor only in the properties inspector is there an attributes i can tag the properties with .so that it won t be saved to the .designer.cs file

2085932
attributes	properties
the properties needs to generator an elements and also have an attributes

2085932
attributes	properties
if the properties is a string i cant see how to add the attributes and if the comment is an object with named and value properties it generator

2085938
attributes	properties
you would need to expose those 2 properties on a types and use the attributes to indicate that it shouldn t generator an extra elements

2085942
silverlight	wpf
i created couple of custom-controls and their childresn correctly show the attached-properties in properties browser for wpf but in silverlight none of the attached-properties appear in properties brower

2085946
contains	set
find me pictures that contains a similar set of colours which might end up being useful to some extent

2085949
contains	any
for example in php the default extension is .php but you could configure the server to use .html that would mean any files with the .html extension could contains php code they would get parsing before the page is sent to the clients web browser

2085971
constructor	object
i try to summarize some points that help .when choosing which methods to use for filling object field constructor or setter methodss

2085971
value	field
state by state i mean the value of all field of an object in a snapshot of runtime

2085971
constructor	object
setting the state once and for all the lifetime of an object in the constructor and avoiding setter called immutable pattern makes programming especially concurrent-programming really easier

2085971
constructor	object
.so as a general hint use constructor and immutable pattern for object which are accessed in multiple threads and use setter for local object and field which are under more control

2085971
spring	guice
injection .when we are using a dependency-injection framework such as spring or guice the framework makes one methods more preferable than the other

2085971
constructor	object
spring construct the object beans mostly using default constructor and then inject the dependencies using setter methods

2085971
constructor	object
to new or to delegation whenever you are going to new an object whether using constructor or setter methods to fill the field it is a good practice to think if it may be needed someday that someone else pass inject create it here

2085987
pascal	delphi
i use my own very simple 5-lines delphi pascal

2085988
dependency-injection	singleton
using dependency-injection to avoid singleton

2085999
.when	ready
.when the data is identified as out of date the old data should be returned but the new data should be prepare on a separate thread and swapped in .when ready - .so as not to block the caller

2086028
persistent	transient
the only way to ensure your application s transient state never gets lost is to respond appropriately to the lifecycle events android offers or just store value persistent

2086028
getter	setter
i m not quite sure what getter and setter are in your code sample but i don t think that s relevant.

2086056
ref	out
.when in c# we have the out and ref parameter options in vb there is a only one byref

2086060
value	field
do i assume right that in case i use linq-to-sql and all results of queries from money field are held in c# decimal variables and .so calculation are done using decimal it doesn t matter what datatype to use in database money or decimal to represent money value

2086069
constructor	private
also if you use visual-studio team edition testing framework you can make constructor with parameter private and test the class through the accessor

2086105
temporary	copy
it appears that most of the time is spent waiting for mysql to make a temporary copy of the pictures table which since it is very large is taking a while to do

2086106
32-bit	64bit
it seems you re compiling a 32-bit libs on a 64bit machine however a 32-bit versioning of libstdc++ is not present

2086110

the sign does not have any special meaning in javascript unlike languages like perl or php where it s used to indicate that something is a variables

2086143
google-chrome	safari
this should be across the common browsers however i have not been able to test safari or google-chrome using it

use a tag with a in it - totally valid - then set it s width and height in css also apply display block

2086167
overlap	margins
i have done it reducing the margins top and bottom but there is a points where rows overlap

2086173
youtube	vimeo
i found very good tutorials for vim in youtube and vimeo

2086188
callback	methods
you either need to add a callback or the .load methods might be more appropriate since you just want to inject the results from that php call into the page

2086192
filtering	sorting
what is the best practice .when returning dynamic data for a table server side sorting filtering etc from a db

2086198
web-config	app-config
this means that the entity-framework connection-string isn t found in the web-config or app-config for your project

2086221
allocation	deep
it seems to me that .net required a lot of memory for because the lists are completely copy-paste into the arrayss at each level of directory - .so if your directory-structure is 10 levels deep you have 10 versioning of the arrays files at any given moment and an allocation deallocation of this arrays for every directory in the structure

2086231
show	next
as a result it will assume 100 width as divs do by default and .when it uses 100 of its containers s width it cannot fit next to the blue box but will show up immediately below it

2086234
worksheet	excel
i d like to query an excel worksheet in vba and specify conditional

2086236
increment	reset
i reset the auto increment every now and then while developing

2086244
triggers	insert
not the least disturbing aspects of this is that you will need to have instead if triggers which actually insert zero dates into the underlying table again using gary s function

2086244
default-value	default
i used the default clause to set a default-value to sysdate

2086246
ref	out
not exactly an answer to your question but out and ref byref are bad .so why use them in the first place

2086259
uniq	grep
is this possible with a simple cat paste grep sort uniq kind of batch-file cmd

similarity	distance
please any one tell me how we can implements the r-tree structure in matlab to speed the image retrieval systemd i would like to inform you that my database spaces a feature vector of color histogram multidimensional and also i i have a distance vector for similarity measure.

2086304
ref	out
different languages have different features facilities - if they didn t there d only be one programming language - in this case yes vb doesn t pretend that there are two types of ref parameters as c# does - .so far as the clr is concerned out doesn t exist

2086321
constructor	object
as many have mentioned the constructor doesn t actually construct but sets the initial value on the object

2086321
constructor	object
it is not always correct that object are completely finished .when the constructor is complete

2086321
constructor	object
thus it may not be possible to get the object into a safe enough state to pass to other object in the constructor

2086321
constructor	private
factory construction with private constructor if often a good alternative and has many benefits and is covered by bloch

2086345
value	field
_post grup will contains the value in the field .when posted

2086355
default	reset
now i want that whenever a button is click its background-color changes to some other color say orange to represent that it has been click and the background-color of all other 3 button reset to their default color in case any of them had orange background-color

sunos	aix
on sunos the latter path is on aix it is and on hp-ux it s

2086368
culture	french
culture parameter specifies the language of news like 0 english 1 french etc

2086372
stderr	stdout
there is no way to keep output on both stderr and stdout synchronized after it is buffering and redirected

2086373
click	mouse
this would involve tracking the sequences of events happening .when user has put their mouse into the banner area and then left the page inferring that they click on the ad

2086373
click	mouse
.when the mouse move out of the banner area it means they didn t click the ad .so show the div again and remove the event handler

2086376
getter	setter	initializer	setter	initializer	getter
give the csv class getter and setter for a cvs file parameter and a dao parameter and initializer it using spring di

2086376
getter-setter	initializer
the factory class should have a getter-setter for the dao object and be initializer using spring di

2086397
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
firefox doesn t currently bounce the downloadinging box in the dock .when a downloading is finished like safari google-chrome and camino do

2086411
toolchain	platform	toolchain	automake
the normals way to address this is to use something like the autoconf automake toolchain which create make files and configure scripting that run on a wide range of platform

2086443
versioning	upgrade
jquery is actually pretty quick especially since performance upgrade in versioning 1.4 release just days ago

2086451
required	checked
if your scenario required compile-time checked you cannot comply with this guideline

2086451
attributes	properties
use the presence or absence of the attributes or the attributes s properties to identify the target types

2086451
attributes	properties
the interesting thing is that asmx web-services which are subject to similar performance characteristics actually use the enablesession properties of the webmethods attributes for this purpose

2086472
exception-handling	try-catch
is there a free visual-studio add-on to automatically generator try-catch blocks from a methods that document exception-handling

2086476

if you don t want to do per-bean configuration you could use the jboss-seam functionality for this see seam reference .doc

2086477
fullscreen	minimize
3 seconds after the windows is deactivated it changes from minimize to normals minimizing the other fullscreen application

2086477
fullscreen	minimize
i want the user to choose to minimize the fullscreen .app .so i want to stop other programs from stealing the focus

2086514
localization	translation
i ve found that loading directly from database is not right way to solve localization - translation problem

2086539
contains	elements
contains the numbers of elements that are in the interface arrays that types.descriptor.interfacedescriptors points to

2086540
worksheet	excel
i need to create a user-interface that s similar to an excel worksheet

2086562

2086586
managed-code	unmanaged
what i m supposed to do is to get pointers to unmanaged functions in dll_1 in managed-code pack it into structure and send this structure as an arguments to unmanaged function in dll_2

2086598
assign	add
edit1 return true on strlen str 0 is because i want users to be able to add events without knowing .when will the event occur .so .someone else can qualify the scheduling and assign event to certain date later

2086601
contains	set
you then set that uiview to contains an imageview

2086632
managed-code	unmanaged
since you don t do anything in managed-code but the dlls live in the same process just use an intptr is automatically 32 or 64bit depending on the platform to pass the unmanaged pointers around

2086632
return-value	arguments
you can of course also insert the intptr into your struct and use it as arguments or return-value .when using an external call

2086653
unique	words
then unique new words are insert into table spb_word

2086659
perl	php
yes i know that we could do this server side with php perl et al but we are trying to limit our outgoing headers .so this seemed to be the best way of doing it

2086659
for-loop	arrays
my other thought was to wrap it in a for-loop on the arrays and create a new object each time

2086670
attr	rel
i tried to just add attr rel to the string but that didnt work

2086681
contains	set
means a set not contains these characters it is all characters but not the ones i list opposed to which means no characters but only the ones i list

google-chrome	firefox
i just checked it and it seems to work on google-chrome on mac but not on firefox on mac os x

2086695
entity-framework	ado.net
it even supports the ado.net entity-framework hence it should be quite easy to develop a migration application

2086713
profiling	trace
in sql profiling 2005 is it possible to capture a result set in a sql trace .so that i could see corresponding queries with result sets

2086721
logout	login
i ll do what digg does be consistent with the login and logout procedure by not automatically logging in and out .when someone logs on facebook

2086733
sql-server	oracle
consider that in the future we might not use a sql-server back end any more we might switching to oracle or even a nosql solution

2086736
.when	ready
signalss across thread boundaries places the signals call on the event-loop letting the slot s thread make the call to the slot .when ready

2086746
firefox	gecko
corresponding to the gecko used in firefox 2.0...

2086768
textbox	button	listbox	textbox
although the execution of a copy operation on a listbox will be coded differently to that of a textbox it would still be invoked from the same toolbar button

2086770
perl	php
it has pertinent to perl java .net and php depending on your language choice

2086817
exception-handling	try-catch
you can handle multiple types of exception-handling through single try-catch loops

2086823
versioning	migrate
if one of the libs being used comes out with an incompatible new versioning it is normals for any incompatibilities to be reported as bugs and for the project to migrate to compatibility with the newer versioning with a longer term goal of dropping compatibility with the older versioning altogether

2086823
versioning	upgrade
with a situation like osx where the libs are dependent on os versioning and you cannot expect your userbase to upgrade they way they will with a open source os you deal with it like you would any other cross platform code

2086837
any	set
in a class definition self is set to be the class object being defined .so any references within a class definition will refer to that class object in this case fish

2086837
instances	self
.when a methods is called on an instances of fish however self is set to be the receiver of the call the particular instances of fish

2086837
instances	self
inside a methods self is the instances of the receiver

2086846
temporary	copy
yes mysql does a temporary copy of the table

2086860
tiff	bmp
i work only on gray scale jpg bmp tiff images presently

2086913
.when	ready
.when you re ready to release the code you make a tag with the versioning numbers from the appropriate release branch

2086913
directory	folder
that said branches are most easily created with tortoisesvn by navigating the repo-browser to the directory you re copying from dev trunk in your case right-clicking that folder selected copy to and entering the path to the new branch release trunk in your case

2086940
temporary	copy
in most cases alter-table works by making a temporary copy of the original table

2086943
defined	declare
most if not all time the compiler complains about using an incomplete-type the problem resides in trying to use a forwarding declare class that has not been completely defined

2086966
.net	wcf
.net ria service is wrapper to wcf service only

2086975
javascript	dom
addeventlistener is a feature of the dom not javascript

2086977
javascript	dom
i think you ll find that in plain javascript it s only dom object that can have events

2086999
selected	listbox
the model-validation doesn t evaluates the attributes linked to listbox value if you don t selected at least one of them

2087004
default-value	arguments
what i did was to set -xmx jvm arguments in eclipse.ini to a value that is lower than the default-value specified -xmx512m

2087004
environment	building
jvm java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_10-b33

2087009

2087009
inline-assembly	assembly
the assembly examples given in the device s documentation are different from how i was taught to use inline-assembly code in c++

2087033
selected	textbox
i got this running and it appears to work fine - the modal pop-up appears i can selected a date using the calendar and it populate the textbox

2087042
getter	setter
also i get the impression that you have poor encapsulation by using getter and setter instead of meaningful operations

2087045
contains	set
to clarify this we ve set the vs project contains the unit tests to run nunit-x86.exe .when debugging

2087050
buildout	plone
the plone folks maintain an egg-ified pil that just worksâ with buildout

2087050
homebrew	fink
if however you ve install postgresql some other way -- fink ports homebrew -- then you ll need to be careful and make sure you ve got the development files install

2087050
libjpeg	libpng
at the very least you ll need to install libjpeg and libpng

2087050
libjpeg	libpng
if not the easiest thing is probably to downloading and install them from source libpng libjpeg

2087060
textbox	button
my program has options to click a button and text is insert into the textbox

2087062
connection-pooling	pool
ado.net has an effective data connection-pooling systemd already you shouldn t need to maintain your own pool

2087071
if-statement	arrays
this has to be done manually by extraction the elements from the jquery arrays as per the last line in the if-statement

2087072
executable	jar
what my question actually boils down to is whether there is a way to launchd a jar file as an executable with elevated permissions

2087074
getter	setter
i have a fully implements dao with entity beans contains only getter and setter methods

2087074
publish-subscribe	observer-pattern	implements	extends
i want to know how will i implements the publish-subscribe pattern also known as observer-pattern such that i don t have to extends my current dao architecture

2087087
contains	elements
my idea contains classes that represent the xml elements for example cartype within this class i have a dictionary with a pair

2087096
export	csv
if you want to export your mysql.data into solr use the csvrequesthandler note that csv here can really be any flat file-format like the one mysql would produce

2087121
compact-framework	.net
because of this the components needed to building solutions against the .net compact-framework won t be install on the building machine

2087121
compact-framework	.net
.net compact-framework project

2087130
exception-handling	try-catch
if an exception-handling in either ultimately amount to the same thing as far as your code is concerned and you don t care about having roll anything back or it s simple to rollback from either and you can easily do it in a single finally block - assuming the language supports this then there is no points in having two separate try-catch blocks

2087160
value	field
according to the professional asp.net-asp.net-mvc 1.0 book the asp.net-mvc ajax libs will insert a form field called x-requested-with with a value of xmlhttprequest

2087188
file-descriptor	stdin
.so how do i read using read from the file-descriptor 3 which is copy of stdin

2087198
jama	svd
i am using jama to calculate svd

2087203
getter	setter
private member variables are to be accessed via public setter and getter

2087203
defined	declare
don t declare it in the header file just defined it in the same file where your class functions are definedd

2087213
search-engine	seo
another reason is seo search-engine optimization

2087213
search-engine	seo
many search-engines like html pages and many guysï¼ˆi mean some seo specialists think the html can improve the rank of their content in search-engine

2087227
updating	updates
updates you could probably try using smtpnetworkelement and updating the passwd on this in the global-asax - i think as long as you do this before you use smtpclient it may work

2087233
click	mouse
to open the dll and the just click on the icons with the right mouse button and click save-as

2087241
runas	cmd
there is always the runas cmd

2087246
contains	any
after much googling the best suggestions seems to be to make sure that the url doesn t contains any such characters

2087264
comma-operator	operands
the comma-operator evaluates all operandss from left to right and the result is the value of the last operands

2087290
show	next
i tried putting the cursor over one and using to search for the next occurrence hoping that it might show up in my search history

2087307
search-engine	seo
more importantly it s useful from a seo search-engine optimisation points of view as search-engines will - it is said - rate a given url more highly if it contains the keyword someone is searching for

2087319
json	xml
you can also on most json encoders tell it to js-escape the and characters which means not having to worry about xhtml parsing if you decided to serve the page as xml in the future

2087322
put	get
if i have a user put that into their browser they get an access-denied error .when it is not working

2087327
listbox	textbox
i have successfully got my other user-controls binding and updating this code is almost an exact copy but the answers on them are listbox selection where-as this user-controls is binding to a textbox

2087332
boolean	int
you can use a boolean or an int for each period and store them in an arrays

2087332
arrays	loops
then you d need to find all gaps in the arrays areas with zero by using a simple loops which keeps tracking of the current zero-length

2087339
linked-list	nodes
however a better solution might be to retain your while-loop but move it out of the nodes to the destructor of a separate class representing the linked-list as a whole

2087347
libcurl	curb	hpricot	curb
ruby scripting using libcurl curb to fetch the request and hpricot to parsing the request

i have a transparency png that is used as a picture frame and i want to utilize the background-image declaration to place an image in the transparency centering of the frame

2087366
cucumber	webrat
webrat cucumber already do this for you .so you can just put that in a second project and run the tests that way all you ll have to do is overrides the hosts .so instead of localhosts you ll be using your domain

2087377
rollback	commit
die stops the transactional before i can commit or rollback

2087377
rollback	commit
is the transactional still open until i commit or rollback

2087401

2087408
versioning	migrate
do not delete old model versioninging as users with previous db using an old model versioning will not be able to migrate to your latest db model with out comparing old and latest schema

2087420
binaries	install
is the only solution to install the binaries from sun

2087427
instrumentation	profiling
a useful technique is to run the code under a good sampling profiling zoom under linux or instrumentationation with time profiling instrumentation under mac os x

2087464
decimal	octal
in addition to x you can use d o u and u for decimal octal up to four and up to eight hexadecimal characters

2087469
linux	unix
we cannot use unix linux s sort cmd

2087476
arrays	map
however this nice concise code uses a few ecmascript fifth edition methods that aren t available in all browsers yet map and indexof on arrays and trim on string

2087487
installation	upgrade
i d like to upgrade the hibernate installation that ships as part of jboss 5.1.x to hibernate 3.5.x

2087512
ubuntu	debian

uptime	reboot
a 30minute reboot per quarter fits well within 99.9 uptime sla s

2087556
tcp-ip	udp
the dnsserviceregister and udp part make me think the communication is happening over tcp-ip

2087573
.when	ready
this way your document could be loaded on a separate independent thread and be display later .when ready

2087581
while-loop	loops
what i was trying to get at is that loops variables shouldn t be some magic pointers into a collections but an object that gets created by string token just as if it was created in a for or while-loop

2087588
animation	rotation
the problem is that .when i use shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation everything works well but the animation of rotation the black background on the edges of the screens doesn t match visually to the rest of the application

2087593
put	get
but i get a error c2108 subscript is not of integral types .when i try to put something in it like

2087593
double	int
if i interpreter the error right then i have to replace my double with an int

2087596
malloc	free
returning an arrays al.so means the memory clean up has to be done with a function compatible with the function you used to allocate the block your implementation will likely use malloc and not new to allocate this block .so that the caller can later use free on the block

2087618
windows-server	windows-xp
afik in windows-xp and windows-server 2003 ip4 i believe you can t but for ip6 you can

2087618
windows-vista	windows
and for windows-vista and windows 2008 you can except for certain circumstances

2087629
contains	set
i d try contains multiple model but my recursive option was set to 0 and nothing would get pulled

2087688

we have an application consisting of an ms-access frontend 2007 mdb format a few .net libs and an sql-server 2008 backend

2087704
sql-server-express	ms-access
i am working on an install which automatically install the ms-access runtime our application our libs sql-server-express and configure everything

2087704
sql-server	ms-access
clearly the ms-access application and the libs running in a normals non-admin user context need access to the sql-server database

installation	environment
the .software a regular business application for managing stocks invoices etc. will be available to downloading for free .so it should run in a variety of environment domain non-domain different operating systemd etc. and it knowledge should not be required to install it -- apart from the usual click on setup.exe confirm uac prompt acknowledge the installation directory etc.

2087704
windows-vista	windows-xp
i expect the most common scenarios to be windows-xp local admin user and windows-vista 7 local admin user with uac enabled

2087718
turing-complete	turing-machines
they are turing-complete though .so everything that applies to turing-machines is true for petri nets too

2087721

2087747
seam	jsf
it can be triggers by jsf page i am not sure whether you must enable seam transactional management inorder to get this feature

2087754
put	get
but also put a #define class struct to get implicit private class data public too

2087765

you can use the xsd any elements together with the xml schema instances types attributes

2087767
constructor	object
i am trying to change over from the xml registration to the fluent registration api but am having one problem with registering object that required an arrays as a constructor parameter

2087771
duplicates	elements
if we take as given that you have no duplicates elements in your list the following should do

2087778
google-chrome	firefox
haven t tested it with firefox but assume google-chrome compatibiity

2087849
hash	md5
if you like algorithms like md5 or sha but the bit count is too high then just take the m least significant bits of a standards hash algorithm

2087852
windows-xp	windows	windows-server	windows	windows-server	windows-xp
in windows-xp windows-server 2003 and earlier versioning of the windows operating systemd all service run in the same session as the first user who logs on to the console

2087852
windows-vista	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-vista	windows-server	windows-xp
as a result the console switching has been eliminated - starting from windows-xp service pack 3 windows-vista service pack 1 and windows-server 2008

2087852
windows-server	windows-vista
however the admin option lets you connect to session 0 on a remote computer that doesnâ t have windows-vista sp1 windows-xp-sp3 or windows-server 2008 or later install

2087864
subclassing	nsobject
i have a nsobject subclassing appcontroller with an action linked to a button

2087870
inlining	inline
what i want to find out is how much time the inline functions are taking preferably without disabling optimization or inlining in my building options

2087881
base-class	inherited
stick this in a base-class and just inherited from that no muss no fuss

2087898
affinity	cpu
develop a few macros using the high performance timing mechanism of your cpu x86 -- the routines that don t rely on systemd call and bind a single thread running your core loops to a specific cpu set the affinity

2087927
subtyping	generics
as i have 4 subtyping it would be good to have a generics viewmodel used for all of these

2087929
udp	tcp
i want to write a libs c++ which would be able to monitor network traffic tcp and udp as well as limit bandwidth to a particular network area apply different traffic shaping rules to different network zones

2087941
background-color	transparency
the transparency of png images are handled correctly but as jpeg images doesn t have any transparency you would want a background-color to draw on

2087943
inlining	inline
btw inlining is of significant value only if the routines being inline are small and don t call functions themselves and if the line where they are being called are active enough of the time to be significant

2087955
selected	button
can i do that by selected all the button in the inspector windows of netbeans and perform some task

2087964
entity-framework	automapper
i recently use automapper with lightspeed orm which makes entity-framework look like a prototypea btw

2087966
font-size	height
i have variables length text that i would like to always be in the maximum font-size to fill a fixed height table cell without wrapping out of sight

2087984
value	field
it will list the recording with just the null value in the driveletter field and the companyname

2088003
downcasting	constructor
what you can do is create a class with a templates constructor that accepts an arbitrary pointers uses implicit downcasting to get the two interfaces you want and then implements the combined interface

2088004
contains	any	contains	elements
if you know the files are each well-formed you could concatenation them together after removing any prolog entry from them along with a header and footer contains the root elements start and end tags

2088020
javascript	dom
it is not ajax all you need is manipulating dom with pure javascript

2088063
updating	updates
while updating is there any possibility to display recording that have not been updates not matched

2088066
downgrade	upgrade	versioning	upgrade	versioning	downgrade
for anyone who have happened to meet with this similar issue as mine it s either you upgrade the latest jave 2 sdk and tomcat or downgrade your scripting to the old versioning compatible

2088086
contains	set
if we have a form that contains a listview and an imagelist with the two related by having the listview s largeimagelist properties set to the imagelist then here s how we put the contents of a folder into the listview with the icons coming from the associated exe file for each file

2088089
iequalitycomparer	ienumerable
multiple linq queries would be run against the ienumerable to filtering out the options we wanted including a .distinct iequalitycomparer and .sort x x rowname

2088089
google-chrome	firefox
now if you ll watch the following video you ll see that the code above works very well in both firefox and google-chrome and yet it blows in ms ie

2088092
void	main
void main string arguments

2088094
put	get
to get specific start with the following visualization imagine the triangle flat in the x-y plane and it s normals along the z-axis and put a sphere here that touches all corners of the triangle with everything centered at the origin

2088097
children	nodes
the entire path to a nodes can be determined in a single selected query or conversely all the children of a nodes

2088101
tuples	any
that tuples and dictionary are then parsing into specific positional arguments and ones that are namedd in the signature even though they were passed by named and the and if present only take the overflow from that parsing if any -- only at this points does your python code get control and by then the information you re requesting how were the various arguments passed is not around any more

2088114
contains	any
however if any such execution sequences contains an undefined operation

2088120
32-bit	64bit
how can i read value of 64bit registry from my 32-bit application

2088128
gwt-rpc	gwt
that doesn t .sound like what you actually want .so either you ll want to building a gwt-rpc service in php that responds to that url or remove the reference in the gwt code to rpc call to the greeting service

2088128
json	xml
with a php back-end you re probably not going to use gwt-rpc i m guessing that you re more likely to use json or xml and if that s the case then i d go with removing the rpc call altogether for now

2088135
preserve	copying
ie doesn t quite preserve the css text the way it should but the difference doesn t matter for simple inline styles copying

2088147
any	set
if you can checkout from any client via http or svn then youve set everythign up correctly

2088152
profiling	debugging
to debugging issues like this you can attach a profiling ie8 has one and see which function is taking a long time to execute

2088165
export	csv
you could also try to export data from the excel file to a csv comma separated value file

2088168
32-bit	64bit
usually .when your try to read 64bit registry hive in 32-bit code you must open hklm software using key_wow64_64key

2088169
value	field
sometimes i ve had to break field checked into blocks .when a null value is possible

2088172
png	gif
png gif or jpeg graphic as a different file-format for example

2088172
png	gif
.emf a png a gif or a jpeg graphic is insert into a words document

2088172
png	gif
graphics are saved in the applicable .emf png gif or jpeg

2088187
filtering	grouping	aggregate	grouping
my application collects business data from various sources aggregate it grouping and filtering and needs to display it

2088194
cos	sin
i have the following code doing sin cos function using a pre-calculated memory table

2088194
cos	sin
in the following example the table has 1024 128 items covering all the sin cos value from 0 to 2pi

2088194
cos	sin
i know i can use sin cos symmetry and hold only 1 4 of the value but them i will have more ifs .when computing the value

2088197
callback	methods
to use a static methods callback the callback needs to be an arrays

2088203
xcopy	cmd
as pointed out by dave_s the xcopy cmd s verification switching isn t the kind of verification you are looking for

2088213
vbscript	jscript
jscript has a special function in it for converting vbscript arrays to jscript arrays as they are stored differently which is the vbarray function in your code

2088225
cos	sin
.when you need both always compute the sin and cos of a value at the same time

2088244
updating	updates
i m assuming the reason you want this while updating is to avoid incorrect information due to concurrent updates

2088249
selected	textbox
the textbox es are bound to the selected item in the treeview like this

2088269
postgresql	mysql
it s completely annotations based and currently supports mysql postgresql derby and h2

2088272
version-control	git
git is the usual choice here for version-control

2088276
hide	show
you also need to use the right selector in your hide show call namely it needs to include the # before the div s id in the selector

2088277
worksheet	excel
excel worksheet behavior is exactly what you get from datagrid if you let it automatically generator the cell

2088290
value	field
to those who would impose that in this hypothetical world my inexistent partials methods should be void replace the return s with setting a value on some private field to that class

2088324
value	field
apparently delphi 2010 has some class initialization to initializer the monitor field that now didn t happen causing the rtl to try and free the syncobject upon form destructor because getfieldaddress returned a non-nil value

2088337
contains	any
any named which contains adjacent underscore.js is reserved to the c++ implementation

2088360
put	get
if i put a breakpoints at the showdialog line i get a fatalexecutionengineerror

2088367
contains	any
the text properties of a labels can contains any desired arbitrary html and of course you can pass any arbitrary amount of html as a string to the model if you re using asp.net-mvc

2088370
instance-variables	local-variables
scoping local-variables are visible only in the methods or block they are declare whereas instance-variables can been seen by all methodss in the class

2088370
instance-variables	local-variables
place where they are declare local-variables are declare inside a methods or a block whereas instance-variables inside a class but outside a methods

2088370
instance-variables	local-variables
existence time local-variables are created .when a methods is called and destroy .when the methods exit whereas instance-variables are created using new and destroy by the garbage collector .when there are no reference to them

2088370
instance-variables	local-variables
access you can t access local-variables whereas instance-variables can be accessed if they are declare as public

2088370
instance-variables	local-variables
where they are declare local-variables are declare in a methods or a block before they are called whereas instance-variables can be declare anywhere in the class level even after their use

2088371
callback	methods
if i used an ajax callback then i would have to handle the rest of the execution differently from the other validation methods

2088373
expression	evaluation
off the top of my head i can t think of too many other reasons to use the operators since you can get a similar effect by evaluation the expression in separate statements in most other situations though i m sure that someone will comment on a another use that i ve overlooked

2088391
any	set
is there any other way i can have it open a link in a new windows of a set size and actually have it work this time

2088393
xsd	xml
linq to xsd was supposed to enhance linq-to-xml as well as xml schema benefits the syntax is less ugly but this was open-sourced by microsoft onto codeplex some time ago and appears to have no community support

2088405
difference	zero	instance-variables	local-variables
main difference is instance-variables get default value like int value get zero char gets null but not the local-variables

2088427
rubymine	textmate
if you want need an ide that integrated with it jetbrains rubymine should support it and i believe there is also a git bundle for textmate

2088432
32-bit	64bit
the compiler may align struct members as appropriate for the target-platform which may mean 32-bit alignment 64bit alignment or anything else

2088432
32-bit	64bit
the size of the float might be 32-bit or 64bit

2088438
cos	sin
one thing you could try would be to use the fact that cos x sin x + pi 2

2088438
cosine	sine
and make the sine table one quarter larger .so you can reuse it as the cosine table starting one quarter in

2088439
protected	public
if you have an access-specifier public private or protected between members even the guarantee about order is lost

2088440
digits	base
base b where a digits is an int

2088446
32-bit	64bit
.so this should work for 32-bit proces.sor but my guess is that it would fail for 64bit ones

2088458
internet-explorer	firefox
on firefox and internet-explorer this happens correctly

2088458
google-chrome	safari
however on safari and google-chrome the updateprogress control remains visible after the postback completes

2088470
callback	methods
to a php function methods that s expecting a callback and the php function methods will know what to do with it

2088470
callback	methods
.so to use a static methods in-place of a callback string you d use

2088476
linux	unix
in general across multiple linux and unix systemd the answer here is that there is no answer here at link time

2088476
dlopen	dlsym
have it open the real implementation with dlopen and link with dlsym

2088481
32-bit	64bit
but imagine a 64bit architecture with 32-bit floats

2088482
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
.when you leave the page in firefox or safari but not google-chrome it keeps the old page still loaded just hidden

2088482
firefox	safari
unfortunately it seems safari al.so doesn t implements the onpagehide function firefox introduced to go with the bfcache .so you can t catch that

2088482
firefox	safari
firefox and safari take this as a signals that the page wants to be really unloaded on leaving

2088492
spaces	output
spaces or empty line that are output

2088494
ruby	php
regardless of asp php ruby etc you should be able to do something like

2088500
contains	elements
you can use an attributes filtering to selected all elements that contains the part that you do know that is chksubscriptiontype

2088511
parentheses	operators
adding parentheses around the individual map operators break the chaining

2088519
hash	md5
i need to create a hash key on my tables for uniqueness and someone mentioned to me about md5

2088527
response	timeout
bad - no response timeout error

2088528
protected	public
the generator javadoc cmd gives me an option to create javadoc for members with visibility private package protected public

2088528
deprecated	javadoc
is there a way to exclude them from the javadoc given they re marked deprecated

2088533
value	field
.so if a user types 5gb in input-field jquery takes the value onchange and updates the field value after calculating it which would be in this case

2088536
textbox	button
if they are entering the step instructions i would want for them to have to press a button that would add a row .so that they aren t just given 15 empty textbox to fill in

2088538
itemscontrol	grid
the key thing was to set the itemspaneltemplate of the itemscontrol to a grid

2088565
compatibility	legacy
this is necessary for compatibility with a legacy systemd

2088569
shell	bash
.when i run the following from a bash shell on my mac

2088569
shell	bash
why does arch from a bash shell return i386 which would seem to indicate i m not in 64bit mode .when i know based on my processor i m running a 64bit mac

2088585
dbd	dbi
it is interesting in the dbi func it is defined differently but dbd mysql has a convince methods to it for what is really an _admin_internal methods which is defined in mysql.xs and looks to have quite a few call to do_error which leads me to believe that you should checked the errors

2088603
jquery	.post
checkout the jquery manual on .post for more information on that function

2088666
httphandler	httpmodule
after thinking about what was going on and realizing that issue probably had something to do with nhibernate i refined some of my google searches and found a .post httpmodule and httphandler sections in iis 7 web-config files

2088669
arguments	default
however you might just as easily write a function wrapper in c or in c++ use a default arguments and this would be preferable in most cases

2088743
value	field
i have an existing jpa eclipselink project where the desired behavior is that if given a null value in a field for an entity that null value should not be persistent

2088743
value	field
those sources may give us a null value that does not mean nullify this field it means i don t have this value

2088760
macros	vba
i have recorded a macros for this and got the following vba code

2088768
jama	svd
be careful here jama supports svd primarily for full rank matrix and if you read the readme you ll notice that the behavior is not necessarily correct for rank deficient m n matrix

2088794
contains	elements
i would go with creating an html structure that contains placeholder for the elements you ll need to updates via ajax

2088805
defined	declare
you could make use of xmlseealso where you can declare other classes that should defined and visible to jaxbcontext

2088820
external	root
im using an external .app that i have no control over whatsoever and according to their api the .application reads and parsing the .in file .when it s placed in root directory on the mobile device

2088823
attributes	properties
would be great if there was some magic attributes that i could just add to the properties to auto-expression the properties and make linq-to-sql happy instead of wrapping it in expression ...

2088832
postgresql	oracle
you could have a look at the following page on the postgresqlql wiki for some more difference oracle to postgresql conversion

2088834
hide	show
i have an ibaction on this button and i would like to click on it to show hide the uitoolbar in photoviewcontroller

2088843
contains	elements
a nested ul elements should be contains within an li

2088849
double	int
if you pass in a nullable int and a non-nullable double expression bad things happen

2088853
session-storage	cookies
however if they are different applications you will need to do some additional work like using a sql-server based session-storage and hacking the stored-procedures to make sure all applications shared the same session data or with an httpmodule to intercept the application named since even with sharedd cookies and the same machine key 2 applications will still use 2 different stores for their session data

2088857
attributes	properties
consider using a properties if the member represents a logical attributes of the types

2088862
value	field
i was thinking of just wrapping value of field in my form .when user submit the form

2088862
value	field
.so if user typed homer in firstname field and click submit my javascript would change the value of the field to and then .post the data

2088868
margins	padding
you need to un set some margins and padding on the ul s to do what you want

2088872
attributes	properties
would be great if there was some magic attributes that i could just add to the properties to auto-expression the properties and make linq-to-sql happy instead of wrapping it in expression ...

2088887
buffering	streaming
if you re going to end up writing one line after another anyway you could avoid all this by just writing to the whole buffering to the output streaming and being done with it

2088897
json	xml
an example of this very thing can be found online at which utilizes the json to xml plugins

2088916
triggers	insert
both relationed for work with the triggers for insert

2088916
triggers	insert
.so my query needs to query both for create a robust query .so .when triggers get fired on first insert of master it passed normals in the next step the user will insert one or more details in table b .so the triggers will be fired any time the recording increment my problem is that i need to send for example

2088916
triggers	insert
how can i move one row per insert using triggers on table b

2088922
required	checked
al.so set a will apparently checked all strings to see if they are a variables .so i don t think the s are required around maxa and mina

2088926
put	get
the problem is that the regex is matching as early as possible - one .solution is to put a greedy quantifiers at the start .so that it gobbles up all the possible early matches and you get the last one

2088934
elementtree	xml.etree
i recommend you study on elementtree for parsing your xml file into memory parsing it all then emit it all to a sql db is probably easier but elementtree also allows incremental operation if your file is huge -- it s part of the standards python libs as module xml.etree

2088956
triggers	insert
it s easier to work with the data we ve just insert updates in a triggers no matter what action we do or how many rows we affect

2088956
error-handling	try-catch
now try-catch in triggers means correct predictable error-handling triggers on sql-server 2000 and earlier caused batch-file abort on error rollback which is not ideal to say the least

2088959
stderr	stdout
note also that you have to consume stdout and stderr concurrently otherwise your spawned process will block waiting for your process to consume the output or errors

2089014
attributes	properties
it seems that the only way is to access using reflection the attributes of the properties in this way

2089016
server-side-includes	ssi
server-side-includes ssi are execute before your code .so you can t do this way

2089021
constructor	private	constructor	object
my interpretation is that singleton wants to construct a foo object which by inherited depends on the construction of a singleton whose constructor is private

2089023
easymock	jmock
such frameworks exist for java - checkout jmock or easymock for example

2089037
hide	show
what i ve done in these situations is used the xaml hierarchy to determine which elements to show hide

2089037
order	add
i always turn stuff like this that i m going to reuse into a user-controls which i can add additional error-handling to and guarantee that the grid will only contains two items and the order of them will never change

2089041
put	get
or to put it another way what else could i add to my class library-project to get this feature working

2089106
for-loop	arrays
they re collectionss in natural language terms and you can use the enhanced for-loop over them - but if you want to use an arrays within the collections api you ll need something like arrayss.aslist which wrap an arrays with the interface

2089107
carbon	cocoa
with gui apps i mean not just a unix command-line application but the whole .app bundle and a full cocoa or carbon application

2089110
arguments	undefined
edit in the magic-method at window-resize the arguments are all undefined

2089137
msbuild	nant
msbuild is pretty handy but i ve found nant to be easier to use

2089141
carbon	cocoa
however cocoa is much easier to work with than the older c++ based carbon

2089141
carbon	cocoa
.when apple put out 10.6 a lot of the under-the-hood stuff was transitioning their codebase from carbon to cocoa like the finder etc

2089161
contains	set
both contains a fair amount of links to resources that can be very helpful cocoadev.com has also a set of tutorials you could follow

2089171
web-config	app-config
if you re trying to hosts that service into a web application you ll need to merge manually that individual app-config files one for each wcf project into your web-config file under section

2089174
swing	awt	swing	swt	swt	awt
.so unless you have a specific requirement to do work in awt i would recommend you to checkout the modern replacements swing or swt - much more comfortable flexible customizable and predictable in their behavior than awt

2089176
derived-class	base-class	protected	public
a derived-class can explicit call the base-class implementation if access permissions allow it by using a fully-scoped named by calling a f in your example - if a f were public or protected

2089200
subtract	time
it returns a hash value that somehow represents the time but cannot be subtract or added

2089221
any	set
one other thing to consider if you are planning on using unicode is that you should set the charvocabulary option to say that you want to allow any char in the unicode range of 0 through fffe

2089248
variables	boolean
if you dont like to move your db-about code in the top of the page in the cookies checked you can valorize an boolean variables and then just chet it.

2089256
value	field
well in my opinion you will need compositiontype.or and a custom validation that negates bool field value

2089265
mousedown	mouseup
i m trying to enable a double click event on a flex control without disabling the default mouseup mousedown behavior

2089266
value	field
in some cases it proves to be very hard to do this -- for example imagine a program which checked the value of certain private field via reflection from a string arrays

2089272
hide	show
you can use datatrigger in your datatemplate.triggers collections to show and hide elements depending on the content data

2089281
callback	methods
i breakpoints at the async callback methods and all the elements in the list are identical object

2089295
put	get
as you already have an ibooks g4 you could as well put xcode on it you can get the mac sdks - even for powerpc - for free from apple

2089297
perl	php
this book is another great example cgi programming with perl why not cgi programming with php jsp asp

2089297
perl	php
because perl is ancient older than php jsp and asp which all came to being .when cgi was already old perl existed .when cgi was new and became fairly famo.us for being a very good language to serve dynamic webpage via the cgi

2089297
environment	execution
it is inefficient for the previously stated reasons and there are more modern means of execution any program in a web environment

2089304
click	mouse
then i went to visual-studio and changed the server setting right mouse on the project properties tab web click use local iis webserver and click create virtual directory

2089305
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl
cgi essentially passes the request off to any interpreter that is configure with the webserver - this could be perl python php ruby c pretty much anything

2089305
python	ruby
ruby and python are also typically run as cgi

2089329
selected	listbox
from each of item a user selected from a listbox the application reads the directory and writes out a file that matches all the contents

2089340
return-type	arguments
at the very least a function-declaration is a return-type followed by the identifier and an arguments list

2089341
perl	php
then there came java servlets php and a bunch of others and took over large parts of perl s market shared

2089353
default-value	default
however i was really looking for a way to change the default-value .so bazaar would automatically run with a higher value btw it looks like my default setting was 2560

2089362
mac-address	ethernet
mac-address is a good candidate because it is unique for each ethernet card

2089363
contains	elements
csla.dataportalexception dataportal.delete failed system.invalidoperationexception sequences contains more than one elements at system.linq.enumerable.singleordefault tsource ienumerable 1 source

2089364
mstest	nunit	mstest	mbunit	mbunit	nunit
nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

2089377
any	set
is there any way to set an animated image like the apple spinning gear to an uibarbuttonitem

2089379
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
please don t use alert install firebug into your firefox or enable the javascript console in google-chrome or safari

2089384
iframe	popup
scrollable div iframe popup windows

2089397
decrement	increment
now .when i click the vote up-button it increment the value of strong and if i click vote down it decrement it

2089411
hash	md5
ideally i d make checker swf that would load .app swf and called its function that would return something from the database a naive service would count rows in table and hash it with md5 but security constrains won t let me call loaded swf s function

2089424
shell	bash
try ulimit -n 1024 or more before running bazaar if your shell supports it it s a bash built-in

2089438
verilog	vhdl
if you re looking for more examples of concurrent languages there is myhdl and the xmos xc which are other attempts away from the traditional verilog and vhdl

2089441
contains	any
as a suggestion if you are dealing with cell that do contains comma which are widespread an easy solution would be to export from excel in a tab-delimited format txt or yet alone any format that containss a character you would not normally encounter

2089448
temporary	copy
alternatively if you can manager the class loading copy the jar to a temporary file which is automatically done for http urls for instances or into memory

2089449
difference	zero	difference	count
the main difference is that a destructor typically has deterministic finalization say .when the reference count on the object becomes zero while a .net finalize is called at an undetermined time after the object is no longer referenced

2089450
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
in addition it works fairly well from a linux windows command-prompt or within perl php or python using execute

2089459
double	int
if we knew the declaration of arrayofnumbers we would further know its types an int or a double

2089459
contains	elements
then as you increment each elements contains the distance to the next farthest planet mercury venus etc

2089502
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i had a similar problem .when adding asp.net-mvc views to an existing webforms application

2089505
httpserver	webserver
cgi is an interface specifications between a webserver httpserver and an executable program of some types that is to handle a particular request

2089533
hash	md5
md5 and sha-1 account for the vast majority of hash you ll find in the wild

2089555
value	field
if you want better performance you can have a generics helpers types which caching a delegation mapping a value to the field s value for each field and then fetch that delegation once at the start of the methods

2089570
put	get
you can usually get away with fairly simple parsing most programmers use a similar styles - for example it s uncommon for someone to put blank line between the class fred and its open braces

2089585
associations	model
but you need to flesh out the model to defined the associations you re thinking of

2089599
defined	declare
the event must be declare as public in the class which defined it

2089607
postgresql	oracle
i am converting oracle syntax into postgresql

2089662
font-size	width
you can then use the fixed width of your table cell to find the proper font-size to fill the width of your cell without wrapping

2089664
32-bit	64bit
however i have read and experienced that inorder to make this work i must be writing a 32-bit application as there is no oledb odbc drivers for 64bit applications

2089668
command-line	cmd
to drop and recreate tables you could use the --clean command-line option for pg_dump to emit sql cmd to clean drop database object prior to the cmd for creating them

2089674
.net	wcf
if i use a .net web service or wcf service will there be any limitations or difference i should be aware of in regards to json as input output for the service

2089681
relocation	linker
where a typical linker produces an executable file ready for relocation and loading a locator produces an executable that s already set up to run at one exact address with all relocation already applied

2089704
dynamic-linking	static-linking
after i obtained a new versioning of the libs that was set to use static-linking the dynamic-linking disappeared

2089706
strftime	utc
.when you attach the correct tzinfo object to a datetime instances and then you strftime it it still comes out in utc seemingly ignoring the beautiful tzinfo object i attached to it

2089714
selected	button
selected xml editor or xml editor with encoding and click set as default button

2089727
defined	declare
i thought it would be enough to declare a url methods in appmodel but it seems that core methodss have the precedence with respect to user defined ones

2089729
synchronous	.when
i use synchronous call .when developing code- whatever you did while the request was commuting to and from the server can obscure the cause of an error

2089739
enumerator	any
enumerator in this case is any list while iterator is a reference to a function which is applied in turn on each elements of the list

2089740
unix	bsd
if you were using bsd unix you would link with the standalone libs

2089742
cosine	sine
there are some great notes on fast computation of sine and cosine here

2089743
constructor	object
.when i pass a object through the constructor it gives me the error messages

2089764
shell	bash
a shell sh bash ksh csh cmd.com etc tends to use constants

2089772
unique	words
simplified code has now nothing to do with parsing - it just generator pseudo-random but repeatable words and insert them after normalizing table spb_word holds unique words and ids they are referenced by id in final table spb_obj_word and table spb_word4obj works as input buffering

2089772
unique	words
adding or removing polish national letters from generator words by spb_getword only assures me that it is strange postgresql error - all unique duplicates considerations remain the same but allowing disallowing some letters from words leads to errors or eliminates them

2089775
nvidia	ati
another big plus to this approach is that nvidia ati can release a newer more efficient versioning of their drivers and you automatically benefit with no effort on your part

2089795
scala	java
i haven t worked with java lists in scala .so i m guessing you could do it with java.util.list like this

2089817
constructor	object
having your validation logic in the constructor will give you piece of mind later on in your code because the object is immutable

2089823
instances	private
in this case it often helps to add java wrapper around your jni call all native methods are private and your public methods in the class call them that do some basic sanity checkeded checked that all object are free and object are not used after freeing or synchronizedd just synchronized all methods from one dll to a single object instances

2089824
versioning	upgrade
has this problem and i cannot find a way to upgrade to a versioning of ftp7.5 that does not have this issue

2089829
implements	abstract
.when i saw that the changes in the positioning properties gets animated decided to implements a custom getter-setter abstract properties called tancenter to set the positioning without animation

2089832
alignment	wrap
sure but you need to wrap those blocks in separate tags and apply the alignment to those

2089852
dialog	pop-up
a simple .solution would be to pop-up a dialog asking the user to restart the program in the correct spaces but for the life of me i can t figure out how to tell which spaces my target is in either through nsworkspaces or the accessibility-api .so that i can compare it to the spaces that i m in

2089854
oracle	mysql
the databases i m using are oracle mysql and h2 for testing

2089872
right-align	floating
| left-aligned right-align | in one cell then you can use floating divs inside the td tag

2089877
buffering	streaming
perhaps there is there is a standards shell cmd that will buffering a whole streaming until eof is reached

2089883
value	field
a very nifty user-interface allows the administration to edit these customs field specify their named types possible range of value etc.

2089907
union-all	union
if you union them with union-all you ll get duplicates

2089928
macros	vba
for that you could use a vba macros that looks like this

2089960
subclassing	nsobject
i have an appview nstextview subclassing and an appcontroller nsobject subclassing

2089984
required	checked
to make your life easier i would suggest you to use sockets for communication because they don t required security checked which can be tricky .when you have communication between process with different integrity levels

2089990
32-bit	64bit
what you need to do is split your application into a 32-bit part and a 64bit part use com-interop to cross the 64 32-bit boundary

2089990
32-bit	64bit
for instances drop the code just a simple class-library compiled as 32-bit that retrieves the excel data into a com+ system.enterpriseservices as a server types application and call that server methods from your 64bit windows service

2090011
setcontentview	oncreate
as i mentioned in a comment your view hierarchy should be working after your call to setcontentview early in oncreate

2090019
silverlight	wpf
note i will use the term viewmodel for both the viewmodel in wpf silverlight and the strongly-typed viewdata in asp.net-mvc in the following text

2090019
silverlight	wpf
i would like to create both asp.net-mvc and wpf silverlight clients for the same project in other words against the same datamodel should i create a common viewmodel project or a separate viewmodel for each client technology

2090021
python	c++
2nd they would have to deal mostly with programming c++ and python using scientific libs numerics and mathematics but also with engineering and physics topics

2090032
contains	lookup
you specify that the lookup can contains multiple items

2090055
python	c++
as for knowledge you can always ask the person to implements a cyclic ring buffering in the most reusable way he knows without access to the internet both in python and c++

2090062
expression	evaluation
evaluation an el expression and invoking a getter methods is a very cheap operation .so you should generally not worry about this at all

2090066
binary	hex
i would suggest that to be absolutely sure that your encode binary is cookie-compatible then basic hex encoding is safest in java

2090106
credentials	account
if not it is common to create a domain account grant that account permissions to the source database and then modify the datasource properties on the report server using report manager to connect using credentials stored securely in the report server entering the domain account username and passwd and selected use as windows credentials .when connecting

2090106
authentication	login
if your datasource doesn t support windows-authentication you can achieve the same using a standards login sql-server authentication obviously you then do not selected use as windows credentials.. on the datasource properties

2090106
credentials	security
this way the credentials the report server needs to access the datasource are stored internally and are not required to call a report - security then needs to be managed through permissions in the front-end .app

2090107
notepad++	jedit
you should use notepad notepad++ jedit and whatever you want but if you want to be productive a serious ide is the best choice and adobe win by far

2090108
directory	folder
.when you install moss 2007 using the default install location the moss 2007 log files will not reside in the â œprogram files microsoft office servers 12.0 logsâ directory folder as expected

2090108
directory	folder
they will reside in the wss directory folder â œprogram files common files microsoft shared webserver extensions 12 logsâ

2090123
implements	extends
i ve implements a hibernate save-update listener by extends org.hibernate.event.def.defaultsaveorupdateeventlistener.defaultsaveorupdateeventlistener and overrides onsaveorupdate saveorupdateevent e

2090129
windows	ms-dos
this is why ms-dos and subsequently windows use crlf

2090133
fwrite	fopen
you can use fopen to open and fwrite to write to a file

2090134
subclassing	superclass
create a field for the superclass adjust methods to delegation to the superclass and remove the subclassing

2090148
multidatatrigger	datatrigger
and yes i considered using a datatemplateselector but now i need a datatrigger or better said a multidatatrigger

2090152
widget	button
because there can be several object the widget will just display the two or three most recently used object and expand to present all possible object .when an expansion button is click

2090161
grouping	sorting	key-value	key
creating string userattribute or key-value columns sounds appealing at first but it leads to the inner-platform effect where you end up having to re-implement foreign key data types constraints transactional validation sorting grouping calculations et al

2090163
attributes	properties
of course you could also building a more generics smart datetime properties class and let it set the timezone of interest from a keyword arguments in its __init__ for example if you need several different datetime attributes to use different timezones

2090164
value	field
field with sequences value as default

2090177
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller aviewcontroller added to a uinavigationcontroller which in turn is added to a uitabbarcontroller

2090185
margins	padding	centering	fixed
make the left and right columns fixed on the same width margins and padding .so the centering column has the right offset from the left and right

2090198
scipy	gsl
2 some sort of a scientific computing libs matlab scipy gsl

2090211
subclassing	nsobject
i have a nstextview subclassing appview and a nsobject subclassing appcontroller

2090225
constructor	object
the object called state is passed to the constructor of the new object as a parameter

2090234
put	get
i am not sure what to put with the get and end get

2090250
hide	show
.so rather than just reading logs directly consider using a log-viewing application that can show and hide details

2090262
value	field
this one will be able to take advantage of an index if your date_created is indexed because it doesn t apply any transformation function to the field value

2090270
keydown	keyup
a keybdinput can specify keyup and keydown events using virtual key or scan codes

2090270
keydown	keyup
.so you want to use sendinput twice send a keydown event at the beginning and a keyup event at the end

2090273
show	next
the biggest problem however is that it only show one notification at a time and has to wait a long time by default untill one of them goes away to show the next one

2090276
scheme	lisp
guy steele pointed out that its the same thing in lisp and scheme

2090288
value	field
my code call this methods quite a lot to be honest and it seems like this is slower than just assign my value directly to the ordinals field of my object

2090288
value	field
is there any way to make my program actually assign the value directly to my field through the use of any methods function

2090294
shell	bash
not only is it a cmd shell like bash or cmd.exe if on windows but you can also interactive write and execute elisp code

2090296
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am converting my website from asp.net webforms to asp.net-mvc

2090297
private-members	instances
don t mess around with private-members of other instances of the same class

2090321
instances	private
classes will often use private variables in other instances to implements efficient comparison and copy functions

2090338
height	frame
you could probably set the frame of the modal view to only be as high as the view undernearth minus the height of the uitabbarcontroller

2090349
punctuation	words
they re actually mostly concerned with punctuation characters and do not try to keep words unbroken at all

2090370
python	java	python	perl
you re better aodl or any of the other libs available python perl java etc and doing a binding to it

2090386
subclassing	inherited
i can think of a couple of hackish ways of doing this inherited from a resource subclassing that handles the logging logic but it just seems like this is something that should be built-in to the framework

2090391
textbox	button
now i have a textbox to enter named a button to filtering the recording that can match a named. like search page

2090409
order	add
to preserve sort order for highscores that have the same score use a timestamp and add it to the comparator

2090414
put	get
the solution is to put the alert in your callback which doesn t get execute until after the response has been received

2090424
python	ruby
is there something similar to python symbolic grouping named in ruby

2090426
setinterval	settimeout
regular javascript animation using settimeout setinterval don t work very well in mobile-safari

2090434
extjs	flex
i ve looked at flex laszlo and extjs

2090447
linked-list	tree
comparison methods in particular equals and object in a data structure say a tree or linked-list

2090447
linked-list	nodes	linked-list	tree
for a class of nodes that make up a linked-list graphing or tree being able to access a sibling s private data is exactly what is needed

2090454
lightbox	jquery
i try to implements the jquery lightbox plugins with dynamic grouping of images grouping in image pop-up but i can not find the clue for pop-up grouping images

2090459
exception-handling	error-handling
i just discovered this last month and it allowed me to really compress a lot of my error-handling code and also to ensure that exception-handling were being handled and being handled uniformly

2090460
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
they required variables to be aligned 8bit data on 1-byte boundaries 16-bit data on 2-byte boundaries and 32-bit data on 4-byte boundaries

2090460
temporary	copy
the safe way to extraction a 32-bit int from an arbitrary memory location is to declare a temporary 32-bit int and perform a copy to it treating the source memory as a raw character arrays

2090460
32-bit	64bit
is also dangerous if you re moving between 32-bit and 64bit architectures as michael pointed out

2090468
.war	jar
you don t use a manifest.mf to put a jar in the classpath of a .war file

2090498
division	modulo
modulo returns the remainder of a division

2090500
division	modulo
the modulo gives the remainder of the division .so numbers 6 is the amount left over .when dividing by 6

2090504
any	set
though it compiled fine it had not set any flags

2090530
python	c++
i dont know zodb but i will guess it is tightly matched to the dynamic nature of python object and .so having a general purpose equivalent for c++ wont work

2090541
javascript	dom
if that is the case you just need to add an onclientclick handler to the dom elements and call a javascript function that can locate the appropriate gmarker object and triggers it s click event

2090553
value	field
finally step through the data list for the current item lookup the year in the year list to get the index then stick the amount value in the amount field in the corresponding amounts slot

2090556
children	tree	children	nodes
also notice that at every branch of the tree the water carried by the pipe pair is split among all the children of the nodes radiators or other pipe pairs

2090569
dictionary	map	dictionary	arrays	arrays	map
use tuples or arrays instead of dictionary map - tupless and arrayss keep their sequences but do not allow using key dictionary do not keep their sequences but allow using key

2090636
getter	setter
this is most commonly done through setter and getter methods

2090647
solaris	aix
i have a scenarios where i have a java agent that runs on a couple of platform specifically windows solaris aix

2090647
difference	factors
i d like to factors out the difference in filesystems structure by using environment variables in the command-line i execute

2090647
configuration	environment	difference	factors
i specify the cmd in configuration file that describe a list of jobs to run and it has to be able to work cross platform hence my thought that an environment variables would be useful to factors out the filesystems difference home username scripting vs c foo scripting

2090654
directory	folder
i ask because looking around the internet i see wide variation for instances where the web-inf and meta-inf folder are..if there is a .war directory etc.

2090655
static-typing	typechecking
the main advantages of class based inherited are that it allows static-typing and thus typechecking and a faster table based lookup implementation

2090658
arrays	loops
the trick was to loops through the variables with the value s being references and if it was indeed an object but the key wasn t attributes as mentioned above then wrap it in an arrays d

2090666
selected	button
i have a set of recording in a mysql database and am trying to make selected next and previous button on a webpage

2090700
base-class	inherited
private-inheriteded is usually used for mixins---where people inherited to get functionality from the base-class rather than because of is-a inheriteded

2090756
32-bit	64bit
there s a 64bit libs but i ve read that the excel component still only works in 32-bit mode

2090758
triggers	insert
#1363 - there is no old row in on insert triggers

2090765
tripledes	aes
i ve found plenty of examples how to do encryption in c# and a couple for android but i m particularly looking for a way to handle encrypting using something like aes tripledes etc. from android and eventually wind up being decrypted in c#

2090767
hierarchicaldatatemplate	binding
basically your hierarchicaldatatemplate can stay as is except you would add a converter to the binding

2090777
firefox	safari
seems only in firefox 3.5.7 mac - works as expected in safari

2090785
python	java
i ran into these issues with java and python recently but got everything working in the end

2090828
directory	folder
you can either pull from the network location or copy the entire directory contains .git folder accross to the other computer

2090829
jquery	.post
now without jquery submission this form should get you could change it to .post if you like on the current page

2090839
click	mouse
if you want a displayobject which nearly all visual things subclassing in flex to be treated as transparency to the mouse it won t intercept click events set that object s mouseenabled properties to false

2090845
display	height	display	width
i ve go the code working except that my components that used to fill the entire spaces using width 100 and height 100 appear to display just using the default sizes

2090865
git-pull	git-svn
the difference to worry about are integration with upstream rather than git-pull as you would normalsly use to updates the changes you ll use git-svn git-rebase and git will try to replay your local commit onto the remote head stopping along the way and letting you know about the conflicts you need to resolve if any rather than merging them as is normals with pure git repositories

2090898
firefox	safari
everything is working great in firefox safari ie6 well-i am getting a horizontal scrollbar there in ie6 for some reason and ie8

2090910
authentication	login
i was just reading this .post the definitive guide to form-based website authentication on preventing rapid-fire login attempts

logout	login
my requirement is .when systemd is active for 3 hours then login automatically goes to logout ie is session expire .when systemd is in active for 3hr

2090963
any	set
it seems like you just want to set an image s src properties on-the-fly since i don t see you posting any data

2090964
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
note for precise control over horizontal positioning vertical spacing etc the itemcontainerstyle and itemtemplate properties can be set on the itemscontrol

2090965
png	gif
if you want to limit the updates to rows contains jpeg jpg gif and or png add

2090968
javascript-events	custom-events
live now supports all javascript-events including custom-events and the focusin and focusout events have been introduced as bubbling versioning of focus and blur

2090968
javascript-events	custom-events
as of jquery 1.4 the .live methods supports custom-events as well as all javascript-events

2090980
authentication	login
- internal users should be authentication using ntlm with the ad to ensure a kerberos encrypted login while forms would be usable for the adam instances

2090981
directory	folder
you should use the appdata directory for your appdata in delphi you can find this folder programatically using the shell api function shgetspecialfolderlocation

2090989
internet-explorer	safari
it works fine in safari don t know about internet-explorer

2090996
administration	account
since i m assuming you need the functionality of logging in as a user i would suggest creating a scripting that let s administration account you can identify that however you want login as any user

2091019
user-controls	ascx
i have no idea why this is the case but many solutions i have found suggest adding an id to the ascx user-controls however this doesn t work in my case

2091027
contains	set
coming from a java c++ background i found that i had to printing out and read the set of guides a couple of time to really appreciate the elegance simplicity as well as the wealth of information contains within them

2091028
margins	padding
what do the background refer to in the box model content padding border and margins

2091028
background-color	display
in other words which part of the box model will be set to display a background-color if i set it to green

2091028
margins	padding
do inline elements span text got padding border and margins too

2091032
margins	padding
inline elements do have padding and margins too but you can t always use them the same way since they re inline not block-level

2091034
margins	padding
you may need to set some css padding margins border styles to none to have it work in older versioning of safari but i ve never seen this problem before

2091042
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl	vhdl	hdl
as has been pointed out there are free hdl simulation tools like icarus verilog and ghdl a vhdl frontend for gcc

2091042
altera	xilinx
xilinx and altera have free web editions of such tools but they are definitely not open source

2091061
finite-state-machine	dfa
basically a regular expression is a dfa deterministic finite automaton or deterministic finite-state-machine

2091064
ubuntu	debian
stay in windows and use aptana or komodo with another git client or switching to debian ubuntu and use the tools there

2091073
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome use webkit

2091073
firefox	gecko
firefox uses gecko

2091088
sql-server	oracle
using oracle 9i+ sql-server 2005+

2091096
updating	updates
or let s say you display a list of twitter post which are constantly updating but you can t refresh them every single time because twitter imposes updates frequency restrictions

constructor	object
.some people will suggest the use of a simple constructor followed by an initializer methods where any real work is done to get the object in the right state but i cannot think of a single framework class that does this .so it s not an intuitive pattern for .net developers to follow and thus should not be done in .net irrespective of whether it is a rea.sonable conventions in other languages and platform

serialization	marshalling	serialization	unmarshalling
you still have to deal with serialization however you could implements your application more natively and don t have to bother with things like marshalling unmarshalling or low-level serialization

2093221
key-value	key
unless of cause if the gethashkey no returns a value matching a key to a different key-value pair in that case you get really weird behavior not an exception-handling

2093224

2093329
value	field
inorder to read value from non-static field of a types you ll need a reference to an instances of the types

2093329
exception-handling	try-catch
exception-handling has been omitted for brevity .so you ll need to add .some try-catch blocks i suggest wrapping the caught exception-handling in illegalstateexception s

2093336
gethashcode	equals
note that this relies on either referential equality of the grouping instances or a suitable equals gethashcode implementation on the grouping types

2093359
arrays	loops
right now i am first fetching all the topics from the topics table and to fetch the related tags of every topic i loops over the returned topics arrays for fetching tags

2093372
packets	lan
your other option is wake on lan and have a program on another machine send a magic packets to the machine you want to wake up

you have to include deprecated tag inside methods javadoc as well

2093413
deprecated	javadoc
i don t know if there s a way to tell javadoc to use deprecated anotation which curiously doesn t have a messages parameter to document why is deprecated and what else to use

2093413

seam	jsf	hide	show
instead of c foreach rather use seam s a4j repeat or facelets user-interface repeat and instead of c if make use of the rendering attributes of the jsf component which has to be toggle to show hide

2093436
dictionary	map
you may want to set up some sort of map or dictionary that makes the mapping from a currency code to a culture code for you as well - this would greatly reduce the numbers of lines-of-code here

2093453

2093466
callback	methods
the ajax callback can access the variables of the outer methods .so this technique works fine

2093476
python	c++
i am assuming that the numbers are separated by whitespace and that you already got the string in python from your c++ program you know how to use the subprocess module

2093480
put	get
if you are allowed to use a which matches any numbers of characters up to and including the entire document and you can have any numbers of stars this will put some limits on what is possible to get

2093495
json	xml
make sure you keep all logic related to that in one place and if and .when you need a more portable protocols it won t be too hard to serialization to xml or json instead of an objectoutputstream

2093517
altera	xilinx
it seems that altera s max+plus ii do not support and2 inv component if there are please feel free to correct me but xilinx foundation does

2093520

2093620
javascript	dom
you might consider using javascript to walk the dom tree for your replacements instead of regex

2093632

you should only be calling doquicksort on a list if it contains more than one elements

2093636
quicksort	in-place
you should look at in-place partition algorithms as mentioned on wikipedia s quicksort article

2093643
.when	ready
jquery has a function that execute .when the page is fully loaded .so you could set your main content div to have a css properties display none and then .when the dom is ready you could use jquery to show the content

google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie7 only and doesnt work in any other browsers including firefox ie8 and google-chrome etc

2093774
for-loop	loops	while-loop	loops	while-loop	for-loop
2 you ve got 2 loops a for-loop and a while-loop around the code which retrieves rows from the query - there should only be one

2093774
execution	exit
4 its good practice to establish early exit criterion within a loops - in addition to avoiding redundant execution this would also solve the 3rd bug describe above

2093797
tokenize	parsing
the csv file can be parsing using the tokenize function

2093825
xsd	xml
the easiest way i can think to do this is to create the classes serialization as xml and then run xsd on this xml

2093825
xsd	xml
however if i don t set the properties of a class no xml nodes is created and therefore the xsd doesn t pick it up

2093893
google-chrome	firefox
it works ok in firefox but in google-chrome i can t go to the second page as

2093894
value	field
if the value is strictly internal - that is never display to anyone - or is used only in my code where i can translation it as needed i would just put a constraint on the field and skip the foreign key table

2093897
javascript	dom
mdc - traversal an html table with javascript and dom interfaces

but if you didn t release iboutlet variables in - void dealloc methods - uitextview will still send call to release delegation your view controllers

2094016
textbox	button
i m using jquery facebox to show a textbox a dropdownlistfor and a button

2094016
textbox	button	selected	textbox	selected	button
the user can write a text in the textbox selected a value in the ddl abd hit the button

2094016
textbox	button	selected	textbox	selected	button
the textbox value is-empty and the ddl selecteded value is allways 1 even though i write in the textbox and selected another ddlitem before i hit the button

2094018

.when im trying to write the on page_load lbldeduction false the labels named is display error message..another way i trying to visible false and true in selectedindexed function on compiling time display the error like lbldeductioncode is having null value but textbox is working fine like visible false and true..only the problem is i cant able to do the labels named visible false and after selected combox item labels named visible true

2094022
any	set
my guess is that order isn t important as long as all he headers are set before any content outputted but i just want to be sure that s the case.

2094038
response	timeout
if there is no response the attempt will timeout this would be an indication that the ports is not open

2094041
value	field
then the field value are treated like they would appear in one list

2094041
value	field
multiple messages-header field with the same field-name may be present in a messages if and only if the entire field-value for that header field is defined as a comma-separated list # value

2094041
value	field
the order in which header field with the same field-name are received is therefore significant to the interpretation of the combined field value and thus a proxy must not change the order of these field value .when a messages is forwarded

2094050
selected	textbox
you need to have the code that fills the textbox and selected the drop down item inside of the if

2094060
configuration	environment
i ve created a new environment called stage and created a stage.rb file in the configuration environment folder and put the following line into my environment.rb

2094063

svg	vml
there s a few to choose from in this blog .post canvas svg vml drawing roundup

2094147
getter	setter
don t forget to add a release to your dealloc methods too. synthesize creates the getter and setter but you still have to handle allocation deallocation the object yourself

2094161
linux	unix
you can definitely use a crontab daemons on unix linux to scheduling the jobs if that is what you have available

2094161
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
easiest is some sort of database backend pick your poison based on your needs reqs budget - from berkleydb sqlite on simlistic end to mysql postgresql on free side to sybase oracle for real world stuff

2094180
google-chrome	firefox
all of those links work great in ie firefox google-chrome but only the first link works in my application where i m using an embedded instances of ie

2094212
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
whats the best way to reset and then rewrite the tableborder-color for the most common browsers let s say firefox opera safari and google-chrome .so that it will look the same as in ie

2094231
factory-pattern	singleton
a singleton pattern ensures that you always get back the same instances of whatever types you are retrieving whereas the factory-pattern generally gives you a different instances of each types

2094264
contains	any
tried to do this but to my understand a classpath in the manifest cannot contains variables of any kind

2094279
contains	elements
edit the why is easy to answer in the start it contains cnt numbers of elements .so the code will step on every image and the starts from the beginning of it

2094309
parsing	comma
they presumably succeed because .when treated as a thousands separator by the parsing is completely ignore - even though the comma sometimes doesn t make sense as a thousands separator

2094323
division	modulo
the percentage sign in javascript means it uses modulo division remainder operators

2094347
progress-bar	progress
the easiest way is to place a semi-transparent rectangle between the controls you want to dim and the progress-bar and then just make it visible while your operation is in progress

2094352
moss	wss
you need to indicate whether you are using wss or moss

2094356
attributes	properties
in the current case the attributes properties is the problem

2094368
comet	chat
i think for a chat application you can use other technologies such as amqp rabbitmq etc comet etc

2094378
listbox	textbox
.when i am using any control listbox panels textbox with scrollbar

2094408
proxy-pattern	singleton
there it was suggested that the proxy-pattern can be used instead of a singleton to caching db data

2094408
proxy-pattern	singleton
assume you have a database with a large set of data that never changes .so it can be regarded readonly why would the proxy-pattern be a better way of model this data caching than the singleton

2094410
value	field
i would make photo and video field a single field called types where photo and video would be value this way you can later on add more activity typess

2094424
opensolaris	linux
platform linux windows macos opensolaris

2094424
postgresql	mysql
database mysql sqlite or postgresql include versioning numbers

application-design	business-logic
a service component is a component that provides some function or implements a process that is required by the applications business-logic or in some cases by infrastructure requirements or even application-design requirements that can be encapsulated in a single class to be isolated from other pieces of application functionality

2094456
postback	ajax
you can t do this with a partials async postback with ajax

2094461
any	set
i wonder if there s any way to add this solidfying code as a partials class or as a proxy that would set between the class and the client that was calling it

2094484
proxy-pattern	lazy-loading
i can only imagine that the proxy-pattern is used to proxy between the caching data and loading the data aka lazy-loading

2094497
nunit	moq
this seems to be a common error .when installing using add-on nunit or moq but i have yet to find a link that has a solution

2094512
contains	any
what you posted literally means find any divs that are inside of section divs and are the first child of their parent. the sub contains one tag that matches that description

2094542
subtraction	addition
in the section that covers adders i only have 2 small examples covering addition and subtraction of binary numbers

2094559
hide	show
they d be flagged .some way such that an editor can optional show or hide them .so it doesn t get in the way of reading the real code

2094587
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i know i should not use nsstring or nsmutablestring in this case

2094596
authentication	login
the problem is that after that is validation i then make the actual login call to start the authentication process for the supplied username passwd which is wrapped in a try-catch block

2094598
communication	messages
.so i think the spring approach would be to hide any .sort of .socket communication behind a messagessender horrible named i know interface .so that the collaborator classes only have to deal with a messagessender and remain blind to the fact that any .sort of low-level .socket communication is going on to achieve the sending of that messages

2094600
selected	button
i d like to have all the rows on my table view use uitableviewcellaccessorynone no button on the right unless they are selected at which points i want to use uitableviewcellaccessorydetaildisclosurebutton

2094605
parser-generator	antlr
you can also use a parser-generator similar to antlr for php probably searching for a php parser-generator would turn up something

2094618
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this works as expected in firefox google-chrome safari opera and ie8

2094618
contains	elements
note i know that i can use just the same named for each input elements and retrieve them as an arrays but the above is just a basic example in real i really need to have the named attributes changed because it not only contains the index but also other information such as parentindex order etc

2094640
double	int
value-type such as int double etc

2094654
contains	elements
then the cell-array callerstack will contains the namedd of all the functions in the call stack with the current function named in the first elements and the top-most caller named in the last elements

2094660
python	php
as oded mentioned most server-side handler are capable of initiating socket connections on arbitrary ports and most of those even have dedicated port-scanning package libs php has one in the pear repository python socket module makes this types of tasks a breeze etc...

2094663
administration	account
to demonstrate this restrictions i created a clean install of windows logged in as the initial administration account restrict through uac and was unable to create a symlink in the home-directory

2094663
python	c++
an example in c or c++ or python is preferred though anything utilizing the windows api will be suitable

2094681
instance-variables	class-variables
this way username and passwd are instance-variables instead of class-variables in your example they are class-variables -- all instance-variables need to be defined in __init__ as properties of self

2094690
instance-variables	class-variables
those sure .sound like instance-variables though and not class-variables .so maybe do this

2094697
getter	setter
for the solution i suggest to work you will need to be able to access set get your variables via methods easily done using properties or writing your own setter and getter

2094738
profiling	trace
use firebug or ie 8 s profiling to trace down the problem

2094742
nsmutablearray	nsarray
expose your nsmutablearray as an nsarray

2094742
nsmutablearray	nsarray
you have an nsmutablearray cast as an nsarray and introspection will indicate that it s mutable introspection has no way to know otherwise

2094769
postgresql	oracle
you can achieve very decent performance even on very large dataset in postgresql but it required very tedious tuning work in terms of server configuration and indexing to reach it whereas oracle and ms-sql server tend to do a lot of that work automatically

2094770
progress-bar	progress
but i don t know how you want to set a progress-bar if you don t know the state of the progress

2094795
updating	updates
we re not updating the value in x itself we get a location from x and updates the value in that location

2094806
ifconfig	linux
you can find the correct broadcasting address with ifconfig on a linux command-line

2094806
multicast	packets
if your network equipment switches etc. block broadcasting packets for your network you may have luck with multicast

2094820
formatting	import
for eclipse i use this windows - preferences - java - editor - save action - checked the checkedbox for organize import there are a lot of other useful stuff there too like formatting making field final and .so on..

2094843
sql-server	oracle
we have an existing database link in an oracle that links to data in a sql-server database

2094843
sql-server	oracle
due to security setup the 2nd oracle cannot see the sql-server database but it can see the 1st oracle

2094843
sql-server	oracle
if we create a database link in the 2nd oracle that points to the 1st oracle will we be able to query data from the sql-server database in the 2nd oracle by going through 2 database links

2094850
firefox	safari
it of course works fine in safari and firefox

2094853
google-chrome	firefox
i have had a little scoot round the web and have found this ie solution which works on ie however it does not on google-chrome or firefox

2094854
right-join	union
the alternative is to use an inner-join a left join with right side is null and a right-join with left side is null and do a union - sometimes this approach is better because you can customize each individual join more obviously and add a derived column to indicate which side is found or whether it s found in both and which one is going to win

2094861
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you would need to create a new objectinputstream to match every objectoutputstream

2094861
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i don t know a way to transfer state from a complete objectinputstream to an objectoutputstream without a complete reimplementation which is a bit tricky in pure java anyway

2094883
google-chrome	safari
mac safari google-chrome

the adobe cookbook offers a solution for your problem datagrid headerrenderer checkbox to selected checkbox in the row

2094908
registration	login
and make sure to also publishing code against automated login for the inevitable situation where some coder with no ethics and lots of spare time will use the semantics linked open words database to generator registration request against your .app and every other

2094909
deployment	install
from a deployment side a single .app is developed which can be run inside a webpage always the default or install to the desktop although .applications that are designed for installation may be severely restrict or potentially non-functional until they are install

2094910
hosts-file	hosts
for future visitor once you ve got the ip-address figured out you can add an entry to the windows hosts-file which is located at c windows system32 drivers etc hosts to map the ip-address to a virtual-server named

2094931
margins	padding
for browser there are some default margins and padding and they may be another for each elements for example another for li and for input depending of browser

2094931
margins	padding
reseting this value will make you sure that in each browsers for all elements margins padding are 0

2094932
perl	php	python	java	python	php	python	perl
don t use java c# mono php perl python or anything with garbage-collection

2094936
protected	public
class designer should know that declaring a member function or variables though all variabless should be private really as protected is mostly the same as declaring it public as you showed it s easy to get access to protected stuff

2094936
protected	public
protected is just a more complicated way of declaring something public

2094958
hide	show	addclass	show	addclass	hide	removeclass	show	removeclass	hide	removeclass	addclass
i have also tried to use show hide methods or addclass removeclass with a class that include display none .

2094962
32-bit	64bit
i ve noticed that intellij-idea 9 runs as a 32-bit process in windows 2003 x64 and would like to configure it to run as a 64bit process

2094988
spaces	output
for output file types that is open parens spaces close parens

2094998
duplicates	elements
this is giving me all sorts of problems because i have duplicates id s on the page and the jquery behavior on these html elements becomes unpredictable

2094998
document-ready	.when
it s even worse .when i start doing 3 4 5 partials page refreshes because then i have 3 4 5 sets of dialog html with only one real dialog having been made on document-ready

2095017
revision	svn
what is the process for reverting files and folder to earlier revision in svn using the windows tortoisesvn client

2095017
revision	updates
i ve have tried right-clicking a file in the working copy and selected the updates to revision... cmd and then specifying the revision numbers i want but i can t commit that change back to the repository as it thinks nothing has changed in the working copy

2095043
revision	updates
updates to this revision merely makes your working copy show the revision you have selected it does not modify the current revision

2095043
revision	updates
if you updates to revision this switches your working copy

2095058
macros	vba
the macros are at least normally written in vba which probably isn t the greatest choice for big project but as you said for a situation like this you re mostly interested in short snippets

2095059
firefox	safari
.when viewing specific htmls that has several iframes firefox ie8 safari doesnt printing all content

2095062
export	csv
to implements export from iexportdata whatever that may be to a csv file you probably don t need any state at all

2095065
populate	row
the data that populate it is .sorted into grouping and i m using .some code in the listview item templates that essentially checked if the grouping field has changed in the data and if .so it printing a new row with the heading .so it looks a bit like this

2095076
margins	padding
the problem .some of the time is that different elements such as p h1 h2 etc are all affected by line-height font-size etc .so just doing padding 0 and margins 0 won t guarantee a full reset

reflection	runtime
inorder to call mymethod you would either have to include it as part of a non-generic interface or class or call it using reflection on the object you get back .so can get the types of t at runtime

2095121
fckeditor	wysiwyg
i don t know whether this helps you but wysiwyg editor fckeditor can protect content using a regular expression

2095121
fckeditor	wysiwyg
i have used fckeditor though and can recommend it as one of the very best wysiwyg editor available even if documentation and community support are a bit sparse-matrix it still being very new on the market

2095124
contains	set
i have two separate silverlight user-controls contains grid and i want these to shared a set of columndefinitions

2095133
silverlight	wpf
silverlight or wpf if you want some extra power

2095133
silverlight	wpf
both have a similar programming model with xaml and code-behind .so you might be able to start with silverlight and move up to wpf if you need

2095134
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is a subset of wpf .so using wpf you could potentially do more

2095143
margins	padding
i really don t notice any performance issues and nothing surprises me about the way elements display and i don t have to do stupid stuff like setting the margins padding of the body and html to 0 whenever i building a new site

2095169
put	get
i have the basic of a rest service done with standards list and get .post put delete verbs implements around my nouns

2095169
json	xml
it d be easy to write a page that takes a couple of json xml whatever arguments for the criterion and the objnew parts of the mongo updates function

2095175
tablerow	layout
i dynamically populate the table but with the relative layout colored silver it only spans about 3 4 of the tablerow

2095175
tablerow	layout
i need a relative layout in the tablerow because i need to something like this

2095175
tablerow	layout
any ideas on getting the relative layout to span the tablerow

2095176
configuration	installation
the configuration and installation worked painlessly but if i run cmake with qt references the compilation fails during the subsequent make process because of failed dependency resolution

2095183
defined	declare
declare in the same scoping in which they are defined or

2095210
constructor	object
if these are fundamental to the object it is usually a good idea to initializer them in the constructor and limit whether they can be changed set back to null

2095218
json	xml
optional uri params for content-type json xml txt etc

2095218
xsd	xml
.post collections creates a new item if via xml i use xsd to validation

2095227
hash	md5
the program takes the strings and output them to a time-datestamped text file but only if the passwd matches the set md5 hash

2095230
textbox	button
now my delegation control has a textbox and a button

2095250
scriptaculous	jquery
see jquery and scriptaculous

2095257
haskell	python
nothing to do with python but here it is in haskell

2095260
authentication	login
it also has an authentication module that handles passwd hashing and login for you

2095281
margins	padding
eric meyer s css-reset is not only to remove padding and margins but to make default styling consistent across browsers

2095281
contains	elements	default	reset
i don t know which elements are not include in his reset by default but i can say that the particular reset you posted does contains many revision to ensure maximal compatibility across browsers

2095283
any	set
in particular shared_buffers should be set correctly maintenance_work_mem should be increased during the restore full_page_writes should be off during the restore wal_buffers should be increased to 16mb during the restore checkpoint_segments should be increased to something like 16 during the restore you shouldn t have any unreasonable logging on like logging every statement execute auto_vacuum should be disabled during the restore

2095292
gethashcode	equals
note that if the city class doesn t implements equals and gethashcode correctly this will return duplicates

2095348
authentication	login
would also like to allow standards login pass authentication with an option to link it to your facebook account

2095362
constructor	object
this is especially true and obvious for the other operators with which you could evaluate expression and thus need to create temporary object just not .so much this one since you d think it s like the assignment-operator in other languages like in c++ which can be an instances member but it s actually much more than that - it s a constructor as well

2095362
delphi	c++
the same can be done in delphi and i suspect it would take precedence over the implicit operators however what c++ doesn t support but delphi does is to have down-conversion to primitive-types byte int etc. since the operatorss are overloaded using class operatorss

2095362
delphi	c++
would never be able to accept a call like showailmentname someailment in c++ but in delphi it can

2095363
cross-compiling	static-linking
1 i am aware the static-linking might be a pain during development longer compile time cross-compiling for both 32 and 64bit going down dependency chaining to include all libs etc but it s a lot easier during testing - just move the file and run

2095363
32-bit	64bit
2 on the other hand dynamic-linking seams easier during development phase - short compile time don t really know how to handle dynamic-linking to 64bit libs from my 32-bit dev environment no hustle with dependency chaining

2095368
precompiled-headers	header-files
c++ compilation doesn t read any information from binary files but reads methods types definitions only from header-files that need to be parsing in full exception-handling precompiled-headers

2095387
arguments	default
by default which you may have erased but it s pretty simple to fix cake will route request to pages to the pagescontroller display function passing it one arguments the action listed in the http-request

2095387
controllers	routes
.so to have the pages controllers map pages one to the .app views pages one.ctp elements simply make sure that the following default cake normally has this setup line is in the routes configuration and make sure that line above it do not match that pattern

2095406
spring	jsf
we wrote a quite complicated application using a jsf + spring + hibernate

2095420
dynamic-linking	static-linking
i would probably use dynamic-linking during most of development and then change over to static-linking for the final phases of development and all of deployment

2095440
binaries	install
note that if you do not have root privileges to install the libs in the systemd directory you can compile the program such that it will first look elsewhere for any needed dynamic libs this is accomplished by setting the runpath directive in elf binaries

2095450
google-chrome	opera
opera and google-chrome support are coming soon

2095453
ruby-on-rails	django
the advice that i have is to try django or ruby-on-rails and see how they do it then take the best of their ideas back to c

2095458
contains	elements
i have a unordered list with each list elements contains two spans say span a and span b

2095460
margins	padding
the problem is that there are some elements that need margins and or padding to display properly and people forget to set them back

2095460
contains	elements
if you blindly apply a reset the bullet for the list will appear outside of the contains elements which always bothers me

2095522
google-chrome	firefox	margins	padding
google-chrome seems to measure an elements width from the inside of the margins including padding but firefox and ie measure the boxes width where the border is not including padding but inside margins

2095522
google-chrome	firefox
measuring the elementss width from the border makes sense to me and is also helpful .when coding because turning on borders will let you see the width of the elements very easily but my question is what the css specifications says is the correct way to measure the width of an elements and if google-chrome is wrong or ie and firefox are

2095523
bufferedreader	streamreader
finally if you re looking for best speed which it sounds like you are you ll want to migrate the code above to use a streamreader or some other bufferedreader

2095571
margins	padding
the width properties of an elements is supposed to be the content area width and is not supposed to include margins padding or borders

2095572
any	set
in the .net isolated storage is a storage mechanism that enables partially trusted applications to save data on the local machine without violating any security policies set on the computer

2095583
superscript	subscript
how can i set some text as subscript superscript in formattedtext in wpf

2095603
unmanaged	c++-cli
i d guess at an unmanaged dependency for c++-cli assembly that cannot be located

2095617
multithreading	wait
since flash air are not multithreading should i even wait for the q8400s

2095625
javascript	dom
you could improve the javascript by dynamically append the dynamically to the dom for example

2095629
selected	cell	selected	checkbox
celleditending would work but is only fired if one selected another cell after un- checked a checkbox

2095644
stripes	spring
i work with stripes without spring and have created a manual filtering before that tends to work well

2095650
margins	padding	specifications	w3c
the w3c css 2.1 box model specifications says that the width of an elements does not include margins border or padding

2095650
margins	padding
in fact by specifying the css width or height properties you specify the spaces available to the content of a box that is called content area in the specifications which does not include padding margins or border

2095650
internet-explorer	quirks-mode
internet-explorer rendering webpage in standards mode or in quirks-mode

2095650
specifications	w3c
you can read the w3c box model specifications here

2095661
hash	md5
another obvious answer is to take the same concatenation string and take the md5 hash - quick and easy but runs the granted small risk of collision

2095668
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i ve gone through archive of .so and found that there are asp.net webforms which seems to be the part of official micro.soft .net and .something called asp.net-mvc which is not by micro.soft .some 3rd party libs but very popular one

2095668
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
.so now should i learn asp.net webforms first and then should i go to asp.net-mvc

2095668
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
after reading the response i understood that asp.net-mvc is more like wpf asp.net webforms is like .net winforms in desktop development

2095677
environment	building
currently our team web devs one designer and one copywriter all work on separate workstations but do our changes on the same dev environment we all mount the same shared drive it s a marketing site and not a web application .so no building or deployment we just push changes to the live site once they are done but i think it s important for us to keep versioning of files especially serverside code even if it only makes up a tiny percentage of our content mostly static pages

2095677
version-control	git
i d like to use version-control for our work setup but i m not sure if svn or git will play along with more than one person checked in out from the same dev environment

2095677
cvs	git	perforce	cvs	perforce	git
i ve got existing experience with svn cvs git perforce and pvcs but have always worked with individual dev environment

2095684
droppable	draggable
i think you should implements this on the droppable instead of the draggable

2095685
32-bit	16-bit
basically a delphi recording is a c struct - delphi even supports the syntax to do things like have a recording that can be accessed as either 4 16-bit int or a 2 32-bit int

2095685
pointers	stack
it also means that .when you declare a recording types variables in your code it is determined at compile-time how big it is - recording types-variabless used in a function will be allocated on stack not as a pointers on stack but as a 4 10 16 etc byte structure

2095691
droppable	draggable
i can do it from a draggable into a droppable area by using the following in a function for drop in droppable

2095704
postgresql	rdbms
checked r-tree already implements on some rdbms like sqlite and i think postgresql

2095727
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc is the newer framework and simply offers an alternative to webforms

2095727
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
the important thing to remember is that asp.net webforms and asp.net-mvc

2095728
value	field
if you see yourself doing this in a lot of places consider if there might be an earlier points at which to validation the field perhaps by providing validation in appropriate properties setter and then always manipulating the field value via the properties instead of directly

2095728
value	field
as a rules of thumb prevent field from ever contains invalid value

2095729
localization	translation
i know how to work with resources in asp.net but i do not want to make localization myself i am sure that microsoft has already translation all caption and error messages

2095731
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
just to be absolutely clear you cannot write to a file that was acquired using the openfiledialog only read you cannot read to a file that as acquired using savefiledialog only write

2095734
linqdatasource	gridview
i have a gridview that is populate from a linqdatasource

2095741
version-control	git
you can use the same pattern with git and other decentralized version-control systemd

2095746
getter	setter
one option would be to wrap the graphics object that you are passing around and add getter and setter for individual properties that are otherwise only available as parameters

2095747
any	set
true or false it still show and i need to make it only work .when the constants is set to true any ideas

2095753
variables	boolean
you re on the right line with your idea of a boolean variables

2095757
value	field
note the answer below assumes the form field contains the value that is to be queried for

2095759
constructor	object
an object of a struct class that has no constructor can be created using an initializer-list

2095768
derived-class	base-class
the derived-class only needs to use one of the base constructor - .so the constructor required in it may be completely different than the base-class

2095768
constructor	private
i actually avoid this in most situations and initializer in the constructor or in a private non-virtual initializer methods

2095769
player	movie
i have a swf movie player located in

2095775
javascript	dom
you could try using something like jquery to help you acess the html page s dom structure after the page is rendering via javascript

2095782
constructor	object
no an object with a constructor is no longer considered a pod plain old data

2095798
typedef	struct	defined	declare
for those of you like me who are looking to forwarding declare a c-style struct that was defined using typedef in some c++ code i have found a solution that goes as follows.

2095808
contains	any	contains	elements
.so if a given elements contains only floated elementss it will not have any height or by extension width -- unless it has an implicit width that is default on block elementss

2095825
backgroundworker	winforms
here is a good tutorial how to use the backgroundworker class in windows forms implements multithreading in winforms using the backgroundworker class

2095836
contains	elements
this is a quirk cause by the implementation of floating elementss and occurs .when you have a parent elements that contains nothing but floating child elementss

2095836
pseudo-class	clearfix
the other is known as the clearfix methods and involves the use of the after pseudo-class

2095841
python	java
as you say you would have to implements the server logic with python or java and you r iphone object are in objective-c

2095843
nunit	moq
i am using c# nunit and moq

2095844
value	field
you ll find this is an xml format easily parsing with the system.xml tools which contains the value of every http field in a variety of formats

2095856
private-key	rsa
private-key encryption namely rsa uses very very very large numbers to do encryption

2095856
private-key	rsa
also rsa is inherently insecure in a webpage because the private-key is transmitted alongside the data to be decrypted unless it was transfer earlier which enables anyone that receives the page to decrypt the data

2095871
asp.net-mvc	webforms
choosing between webforms and asp.net-mvc

2095871
asp.net-mvc	webforms
future of webforms and asp.net-mvc

2095872
firefox	safari
this all looks great in firefox safari chrome.

2095873
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
that s works great in firefox google-chrome safari but in ie 7 8 only the blah blah blah and the link are fade and not the entire statuscontainer

2095883
configuration	installation
of course you may find that paying nothing for such a provider leads to paying much in installation configuration and utilization headaches

2095892
asp.net-mvc	webforms
webforms php asp.net-mvc cakephp

2095898
uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
your question and comments seem to suggest that you are attaching a uitableview to your uinavigationcontroller in some way other than by pushing a uitableviewcontroller

2095901
spaces	output
pocket ie however is actually rendering the crlf in the code file into the output putting a giant spaces between the rendering a tags which i cannot control

2095913
fadeout	fadein
read more here jquery ie div opacity problem and here jquery ie fadein and fadeout opacity and here

2095947
arrays	loops
now whilst the ajax request are being made your code continue to run increasing the value of i each time loops iterates over the arrays

2095947
arrays	loops
by the time your first ajax call returns loops has already increased to the length of the addresses arrays 4 .so .when the your callback runs you re retrieving the in-scope variables i after it has been increased by loops

2095949
sequences	unique
imagine two transactional happening at the same time each of which uses the sequences for a unique id

2095949
rollback	commit
if the second transactional commit and the first transactional rollback then the second insert a row with 2 while the first rolls the sequences back to 1

2095949
sequences	unique
if that sequences is then used again the value of the sequences will become 2 which could lead to a unique problem

2095962
markup	xhtml
i m not convinced that such a framework is always necessary and they can also influence the way you structure your xhtml markup and contorting your markup to match a pre-existing css class hierarchy isn t always a great idea

2095962
firefox	gecko
firefox at least since versioning 3.0 is almost never a huge issue but there are ways of targeting firefox specifically and even differentiating between gecko 1.9 and 1.8 using only css

2095962
jquery	dojo	javascript-framework	dojo
as .someone who maintained a sizable javascript-framework for a corporate website in the days before ajax and javascript interfaces .so there s no limit to the amount of praise i can give for jquery prototype dojo

2095963
any	set
that setting by the way is a per-user setting not s document setting .so to get rid of it i d have to show all seven thousand users how to set to low meaning execute all macros on any document without question

2095966
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
works for ie firefox opera but doesn t work for google-chrome and safari

2095966
firefox	safari
document.all works for ie chrom safari but doesn t work for firefox

2095975
put	get
but i was going through the methods what i didn t get is where to put the .dwp file in 12 hive and also where i will give the location of this .dwp file

2095987
http	ssl
my site has http sections ssl and others are regular http not using ssl

2095987
http	ssl
some time that user will click on a link which will be ssl then click on another link that leaves http to http based urls

2095987
http	ssl
i understand that .when on a ssl page all images have to be also served using http

2095988
digits	base
transform all diacritics into their base character and then stripes anything that is not a letter or a digits using char.isletterordigits

2096019
sql-server	oracle
the purpose is to take the data from a table on sql-server then use a 3rd-party tool to upload it to an oracle

2096032
affinity	cpu
most operating systemd have a facility for changing a process cpu affinity thereby restricting it to a single physical or virtual core

2096037
e-commerce	product
i m about to launchd a forms auth membership site that will include forms that both international and american users can use to updates their .profile info and submit request for info on product but no actual e-commerce

2096039
decrement	increment
then the whole read is execute decrement the count but the other thread still had value 2 loaded which it increment and subsequently writes back to the variables

2096047
.when	ready
there s still a chance that this wont work if the model aren t yet ready .when you set it up but give it a try and let us know

2096059
revision	updates
formerly inorder to updates some production site i compared revision from production one to head using tortoisesvn exported changed added files into a temporary directory and after that upload them onto production server

2096073
simplemodal	jquery
i am trying to use the simplemodal plugins for jquery to load a pop-up div with a fckeditor in it but .when the modal box opens up the fckeditor is all disabled and won t let me types text into it

2096078
radio-button	textbox
.when the user click the radio-button a textbox would appear that allows the user to input a new value that you can save to your db and display in the drop down

2096078
radio-button	checkbox
you can use a checkbox instead of a radio-button .so that the enabled properties can be toggle

2096128
python	c++
i ve designed a thread for communication on the serial-port in python not c++ but it doesn t matter much as follows

2096138
constructor	object
have it take a functor object or function pointers in the constructor for the actual execution

2096141
constructor	object
i do not understand quite completely how to apply constructor on this object creation methods

2096154
json	xml
it also doesn t matter what server side language you are using it almost always ends up printing out xml json or html

2096158
constructor	object
to write your own constructor you use the this keyword within the constructor to refer to the newly-created object

2096158
constructor	object
the constructor initializer the object

2096177
contains	any	contains	elements
this problem occurs because floating an elements removes any height that it would normally contains

2096178
controllers	routes
and somehow in my routes prefix the named of all the admin related controllers with admin

2096183
return-value	arguments
here is one which takes no arguments and returns return-value

2096183
function-calls	void
you ll need macros for every arity of function-calls you make with a return-value and void returning versioning

2096185
google-chrome	safari
ruby-on-rails generator standards textarea tag but safari google-chrome webkit display all not only ruby-on-rails textarea as resizable

2096193
getter	setter
if we follow your logic through then getter and setter violate encapsulation too

2096221
linux	unix
that s a way that is quite often used on unix linux -- but note that functions will not be available on windows

2096222
tortoisegit	svn
the compare dialog of tortoisegit is more about file and with git you have to compare two master branches not just two commit of the same branches both points to the same svn central repo

2096244
device-driver	hardware
this isn t governed by a single instruction and indeed it s not like you can just write a device-driver that would automagically disable all of that hardware

2096259
input-field	selected
i have a standards selected multiple html input-field for example

2096261
populate	row
on detail edit view i populate the detail panels with selected detail through ajax call using jquery and append that penal just below the click row

2096262
value	field
i am trying to bypass the confirmbuttonextender depending on the value of another field in the page

2096287
binary-tree	nodes
bbthmnn h balanced binary-tree have minimum numbers of nodes

2096295
void	main
void main

2096296
value	field
after that the content-types already exists on the dest .lib and sp itself copies the field value for that types from source to destination

2096311
input-field	selected
you re right in wanting to change the default behavior of selected multiple input-field

2096318
variables	boolean
if a special boolean variables is set to true or

2096318
variables	boolean
set the special boolean flag variables to true

2096345
contains	any
i figured it out and the issue is actually that if a grouping contains any file that cannot be include header-files for example the info dialog is not smart enough to only deal with those files and just locks you out

2096345
filtering	grouping
if you have a huge project i would suggest making a smart grouping as opposed to xcode s normals dumb grouping which will let you filtering only .m files

2096347
data-structures	tree
these often show up in homework as they were the first tree data-structures

2096356
json	xml
after that it s a simple matter of parsing the xml or json and creating the appropriate core data object

2096359
value	field	coalesce	isnull
you can use coalesce or isnull on your payment.statuscode field this will allow you to do a substitution for null with a specific value

2096382
inlining	inline
it can be aggressive in inlining and the hotspot jvm actually can inline non-final methods

2096385
great-circle	haversine
now i m a little confused since i always though that the great-circle distance formula and haversine formula were synonymous but apparently i was wrong

2096387
hide	show
during user flow if user needs to be logged in we hide current div and show a login div

2096436
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
true coverflow effect and performant on webkit safari and google-chrome and opera ok on firefox

put	get
i have a problem where i get an int as input at the wrong time in my c++ program .so i need to put it back on cin later

2096455
environment	execution
execution environment similar to the

2096475
rollback	commit
i just tried a breakpoints in a then wait then continue and the timeout causes b to rollback but a still commit

2096493
beautifulsoup	lxml
you need to use urllib2 together with a html parsing such as lxml or beautifulsoup inorder to extraction the links from the retrieved pages inorder to crawl the site

2096501
shutdown	exit
what happens if the application exit is triggers by a windows shutdown or a user logoff

2096520
httpd.conf	hosts
for some debugging you can add following line to your httpd.conf or virtual hosts conf

2096522
default	reset
a lot of people have recommended a reset stylesheet however i d recommend you actually create your own reset-stylesheet and seed it explicit with the default from ie

2096533
user-permissions	account
rather than give each user-permissions to use this dll is there a way to run that dll as the normals iusr account rather than the logged in user

2096570
self-extracting	dotnetzip
dotnetzip is a free .net libs that allows you to create a self-extracting exe

2096573
combinations	permutation
i have some code to count permutation and combinations and i m trying to make it work better for large numbers

2096573
combinations	permutation
i ve found a better algorithm for permutation that avoids large intermediate results but i still think i can do better for combinations

2096578
arrays	loops
i have gotten it .so .when i press the start button the arrays updates every 10 seconds in a while true loops

2096600
contains	any
is there any way to restore the original full path of the file that contains spaces in my application

2096603
web-config	app-config
this arguably doesn t make sense unless you re picking the setting from an app-config or web-config

2096628
hosts-file	hosts
there is no single entry in my hosts-file systemroot system32 drivers etc hosts with localhost in it

2096635
callback	methods
try to set the callback methods of the last effect animate in your case to your ajax function

hide	show	hide	next	show	next
i want to be able to hide the first x elements and show the next x and they fall in positioning on their own

2096647
uialertview	nstimer
this all works fine except in the case where the delegation i m calling back to wants to show a uialertview start an nstimer or do something else that secondary threads either aren t supposed to do or required extra effort to do

2096660
default-value	default
you can use the default keyword to get the default-value of any data types

2096679
contains	elements
i have a nokogiri elements that contains a list elements and i would like to remove some characters from the text while preserving the html

2096692
restructuredtext	textile
if you dont necessarily need restructuredtext but markdown or textile is just as fine then checkout jekyll

2096705
order	add
to add an order to a repository i usually see people initializer the order without the id and then have the repository complete the object

2096705
order	add
i could defined an orderrequest to be an instances of order and add that to the repository but that feels like deriving an apple from an orange and then adding it to a list of oranges

2096705
order	add
what smells here is the fact that you never actually add an instances of an order to the repository

2096711
radio-button	textbox
this should put the textbox on the left and the radio-button on the right like you ask

2096716
build-system	cmake
it can then be called by whatever build-system visual-studio cmake etc. you use

2096718
linked-list	nodes
mostly they re useful for doing things like implements your own containers classes -- for example if you want to allocate a nodes in a linked-list you have pointerss between the nodess and if you want to modify a pointers that s been passed to your function you need either a reference or a pointers to that pointers

2096746
directory	folder
would it not be more appropriate to install the files to c program files myapp create a virtual directory and then points that virtual directory to that folder making sure that the proper permissions have been assign to the folder as it will not inherited any permissions from c inetpub wwwroot

2096764
dto	dao
.so i have a dao dto and bo

2096764
dto	dao
the userrepository call the dao and at the end of getbyid uses automapper to map from the dao to dto

2096767
modifiers	final
i like to know why final and abstract modifiers used for local inner class in java...

2096777
mathml	xhtml
see the work on xhtml modularization and the â œdtd xhtml 1.1 plus mathml 2.0 plus svg 1.1â doctype for some examples of how this can work

2096785
silverlight	wpf
does anybody know any sample of graphing vertices connect with edges 3d visualization written on wpf or silverlight

png	gif
is it possible to load an image jpg png gif from another domain and manipulate the pixels

2096828
value	field
i have a single form field and i need to be able to detection .when the field changes and execute some additional code using the new value of the field

2096828
value	field
onkeypress is fired before the field s value is updates .so .when i grab the value i m getting the previous value

2096828
value	field
i would use keyup exclusively if i knew a way to test whether the key changed the value or not but some characters like the arrow key have no effect on the field s value

2096834
decrement	increment
there are methods like increment and decrement for activerecord that can help with this sort of thing but the best results are achieved by simply tabulating as required

2096843
contains	elements
the problem i am having is .when my containsers s child elements contains a selected object where the options of the selected physically extends outside the bounds of the containsers

2096848
ubuntu	linux
i want to ports my .net application on linux ubuntu which call native libs .so i have dllmaps to make my code work

2096853
attributes	properties
it s kind of a hack but you can put the previous value in a properties of the textbox called expando attributes

2096861
double	int
the types scala.numeric provides the ability to write code that abstracts over the numeric systemd -- it could be called with double int or even your own exotic numeric systemd such as complex-numbers

2096883
value	field
however i need to use value from a field instead of 1 2 3

2096883
value	field
to clarify i only need to parsing the value from a single row of a single field

2096899
mod-rewrite	mod-alias
after your realize the difference it is easy to understand exactly why mod-rewrite process takes precedence before mod-alias - filesystems mapping is just about the end of the road in the long chaining of apache finding what to do with an url and since the latter maps an url to a file it has to follow not precede the rewriting of an url by the former

2096899
mod-rewrite	mod-alias
evidently though mod-alias can be somewhat faster than mod-rewrite all other things being equals of course

2096913
variables	boolean
where formwatcher would have a boolean variables called clean or something

2096930
jface	swt
just my 2 pennies worth but vanilla swt jface can be less of a learning curve

2096930
swt	rcp
i like the fact they re just simple guis you don t need to learn the platform as in the rcp way just get to grips with the swt components and building you re gui

2096933
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
then .when the user click next it hide the first and show the second and .so on

2096934
display	width
i believe this will make ie properly scale the parent as it will have an elements within it that is the proper width as well as in the document flow floated object are removed from the flow. you may required display inline on the clear as well

2096951
firefox	safari
this works for me in safari and firefox

2096951
mouseleave	mouseout
edit 2 actually safari doesn t fire mouseleave or mouseout at all .when the windows is open

2096971
one-to-many	entity
if the join is for a unidirectional one-to-many mapping using a foreign key mapping strategy the foreign key is in the table of the target entity

2096979
boolean	int
.when i have a bunch of boolean flags i like to store them all in an int

2096994
required	checked
of course #1 required that you checked against the known list on generator and to generator a new random numbers if a collision occurs and #2 isn t much of anything in terms of security or validation but an interesting prospect never-the-less

2097008
malloc	strdup	malloc	free	strdup	free
.when you call strdup it uses regular malloc but then .when free is called it is using dlmalloc

2097010
order	add
along with the comment i d add that you could create a wrapper or helpers for the class that accepts input in the order you like it

2097030
combinations	permutation
if your problem does not required knowing the exact numbers of permutation or combinations then you could use stirling s approximation for the factorial

2097062
selection	highlight
older guis used to rely on this for selection highlight and other overlay inorder to eliminate the need for costly redraw

2097074
boolean	int
boolean hasoption int option would use the operators to test for the option within options

2097090
any	set
.so the problem is to find any set of three orthonormal vectors and arrange them as

2097099
checkbox	button
the problem i m trying to resolve is maintaining the checkbox state on a page-refresh or .when a user hits to he back button on their browser

2097099
selected	checkbox
.when my form post i get the value if i selected the standards checkbox if i selected the helpers i get only true

2097123
autogrow	textarea
how can i access the scrollheight using mootools or .some other properties that contains the height .so i can resize it to make an autogrow textarea

2097127
modifiers	final
you can use only either of abstract or final modifiers with all of them but not both

2097127
modifiers	final
.when you use final modifiers for class it means

2097127
modifiers	final
modifiers final is totally opposite

2097127
modifiers	final
class final and abstract modifiers

2097152
png	gif
i am having some trouble creating a bitmapimage from a memorystream from png and gif bytes obtained from a web request

2097152
png	gif
the problem only occurs .when the downloading image is of types png or gif works fine for jpeg

2097164
background-color	outline
.when it is checked a blue outline surrounds the button but there is no background-color

2097178
spaces	output
you need extra spaces to compensate for the speed difference between the input device and the output device

2097181
lightbox	jquery
this is my favorite jquery lightbox plugins

2097197
multibyte	chr
for fixed-size multibyte encoding careful use of struct.pack in-place of chr should work

2097228
entity-framework	ado.net
on top of that sits my dal which is bascily the ado.net entity-framework

2097228
show	next
next there is an interface which show the status of these different tasks

2097228
repository	entity
most notably you would say that it will become a properties of the task entity but because the task entity is used a business object it should not have the knowledge of either the underlying datasource in this case the ef model or the repository layer on top of it

2097253
any	set
.when button_showuser-controls1 is click user-controls1 is visible and user-controls2 or any other user-controls must be set to collapse

2097266
revision	svn
svn will automatically keep tracking of which revision all the files came from .so you won t have to embed anything in the files themselves

2097275
hide	show
the simplest way to accomplish this is to forget about fading and use sliding to hide and show everything

2097284
callback	methods
2 create each thread with a callback to a user-interface updates ... methods to be called .when new data becomes available

2097297
contains	any
any ideas how to rewrite the above line .so that it will al.so match line that contains chars

2097310
google-chrome	firefox
i m currently using firefox 3.5 on ubuntu 9.10 but the same happens on the latest beta of google-chrome

2097321
puts	gets
i d then like to run a batch-file that gets several files including that one from the repository puts them into a local temp folder runs them then deletes them

2097333
environment	building
however .when i building and deploy the application to another environment i always get the value in the default resource file

2097360
data-cleansing	fuzzy
fuzzy lookup and grouping provide powerful data-cleansing capabilities

2097367
setinterval	settimeout
this cannot be done using settimeout or setinterval since these functions execute the code thats given to them asynchronously

2097369
stderr	stdout
i do believe that my problem is arising because i am using pthreads and the threads shared the same stdin stdout stderr

2097375
groovy	java
gdk methods groovy adds to java classes

2097376
constructor	object
basically i first create a dummy object chapter in this case with the correct parent relationship and then pass that as the instances arguments to the form s constructor

2097399
subtract	time
if you re measuring elapsed time by subtract two timestamps you should use system.nanotime to get those timestamps

2097407
contains	elements
in your case the regex will match the whole string .so the return-value is an arrays with 1 elements that contains the match

2097413
while-loop	infinite
the way you normally halt execution should hardly ever be an infinite while-loop

2097421
decrement	increment
i ve achieved this in the past by having a static-class that stores the numbers of async call currently being made - the problem with this approch is that i would have to remember to manualy increment and decrement the count .whenever i called the async methods on the proxy and decrement it .when it was completed - and of course i d forget to do this rather often

2097421
decrement	increment
the other approach i tried which was slightly better was to wrap the proxy in my own wrapper class .so instead of calling methods on the proxy i d call methods on the wrapper and the wrapper would increment decrement the count - this was a bit better but it proved to be a bit of a pain .when the operation contracts named parameters of my service kept changing esp

2097441
display	height
i need to display these images small about 15px but they rendering always at the same height of toolbar

2097445
.when	ready
you can t grab the content of fckeditor .so easily for example with jquery and cause the fckeditor is not ready .when your code fires

2097445
.when	ready
.so you need to bind .some functions on events .when the instances of the editor is ready

2097466
udp	tcp
they have udp and tcp ports open and using a packets sniffer i can see there is not much udp communication but mostly it is the tcp communication going on

2097466
udp	tcp
thats why yahoo have mentioned in their documentation that yahoo-messenger switching to tcp if udp communication is not possible

2097466
udp	tcp
if udp is not possible then those chat applications use tcp streaming for voice

2097466
udp	tcp
.so far i think that if client send data as udp packets to server and server distribute the packets to clients over tcp streaming is this a proper .solution

2097469
subtract	time
get the date time of the next appointment in the database subtract from that datetime.now inorder to get a timespan and then use that timespan to fire the timer once similar to this

2097496
revision	svn
...where 12345 is the svn revision numbers where the module was last changed

2097496
revision	svn
svn propset svn keyword revision my module.pm

2097508
value	field
i think what you are seeing is just the correct output if you haven t written a special encoder of some sort that will take care of obtaining accessing the proper value for the deferred field

2097522
base-class	inherited
use a base-class that inherited from what looks like a movieclip set the constructor to do the common init and use variables for the dynamic parts such as what looks like the tween duration

2097530
strawberry-perl	activeperl
first if you don t want to mess with activeperl strawberry-perl is terrific and worked perfectly for this

2097530
libcurl	openssl
al.so building 0.9.8l l of openssl was a nightmare .so i eventually gave up and reverted to 0.9.8k which built and linked statically with libcurl 1.9 without issue

2097534
udp	tcp
sip is a voice media standards that supports udp and tcp

2097534
udp	tcp
the skype protocols prefers udp where possible and fallback to tcp

2097549
filtering	grouping
now i want to filtering out anything that doesn t start with recording and grouping it by the named column ja.son devon sherrie and then cross-join it by named .so it looks like this

2097553
linqdatasource	gridview
it should not be needed but it seems that a gridview with linqdatasource can t function without it

2097568
export	csv
i ve discounted export the file from outlook as a csv file as it does include the time stamp field in the output which is a crucial factors for me

2097596
selected	cell
they are pushed only for cell belonging to selected row

2097616
versioning	upgrade
if the module was already install and is being upgrade from 04.09.04 it would skip the previous versioning scriptinging assuming they have already been execute and just run the newer 05.01.00 scripting which should bring everything up to-date

2097628
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i tested in firefox 3.5 ie7 ie8 google-chrome and safari 4

2097628
margins	padding
here is the relevant css and html i added .some margins padding and background colors .so you can more easily see the effect

2097630
parentheses	let
the reason it doesn t let you defined the methods is probably due to the fact that parentheses are optional in methods call

2097632
value	field
populating this field with the user s named even if they re not anonymous may help with this though it does mean these value need to be updates .when a usernamed changes presuming that s even possible

2097655
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i ve already tried this on multiple computers and on ie 7-8 google-chrome safari and firefox 3.5

2097666
value	field
at best you can count the numbers of non-null value of a certain field in a grouping result set under some where-clause

2097667
silverlight	wpf	silverlight	xbap
wpf is meant for regular desktop applications and cannot be embedded in a webpage xbap isn t the same and asp.net has nothing to do with silverlight

2097669
annotations	mapping
jpa annotations can be nice in that they allow you to place your object-relational mapping orm metadata in the same files as your entity classes but you are absolutely right that there is a mixing of concerns .when you combine jpa metadata with pure pojos

2097676
silverlight	wpf
because no matter how you empower asp.net or wpf you won t get the richness of silverlight flash .

2097685
click	mouse
no mouse activity no scrolling click or movement

2097685
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
once you determine what it means to be inactive you can clear your timer .when the opposing events occur mouse is move click scrolled windows is focused keyboard event is a received etc

2097698
silverlight	wpf
a better question might be - why are wpf and silverlight 2 separate things

2097709
subclassing	base-class
in general any subclassing should be able to be used in any context that a base-class would be

2097713
silverlight	wpf
probably starting from scratch you wouldn t have both silverlight and wpf

2097717
plugins	add-on
surely there is an add-on or a plugins to the vs2008 resource editor to make it work correctly with high color bitmaps

2097750
gethashcode	equals
my interpretation of the nhibernate documentation lead me to believe that once you overrides the equals and gethashcode methods nhibernate can load entities into the same reference

2097756
show	next
next you can show that the smallest enclosing circle for n circles is tangential to at least 3 of the n circles

2097795
any	set
it ignore the filename parameter of the content-disposition header if you have set any yourself

2097816

2097828
shutdown	restart
it doesnt shutdown cassini .when you stop debugging but it does restart cassini .when you start debugging

2097837
radio-button	selected
will get you the value of the selected radio-button

2097840
put	get
i am trying to get it .so that .when a certain value is put into a textbox the focus will stay on the textbox and an alert will be show in production

2097853
checkbox	button
i ve got a list with checkbox one per row and i d like to have a link button not a common button or submit .so .when i click it i call an action from a controllers

2097853
value	field
how do i get the checkbox value which of them are checked and field value .so i can know to whom apply the action

2097866
cassini	iis
if you are using the vs in built dev iis server cassini then it should trying to connect as the current logged on user from memory

2097872
http	ssl
the ssl protocols layer stays below the http protocols layer and encapsulates http

2097872
http	ssl
.when an ssl connection http is established apache mod_ssl has to negotiate the ssl protocols parameters with the client

2097885
while-loop	cursor
also you can use a while-loop but if you plan on having a ton of columns in the temp table i would use a cursor read the msdn article for more information

2097889
shutdown	restart
it doesnt shutdown cassini .when you stop debugging but it does restart cassini .when you start debugging

2097906
continuous-integration	teamcity
as far as continuous-integration teamcity + git plugins is great

2097919
testdriven.net	coderush
does running via testdriven.net coderush or resharper help

2097933
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade to newer versioning of c++builder have a look at tms advsmoothimagelistbox from tms software

2097942
exception-handling	try-catch
if you just want to skip the row you could put it into a try-catch but make sure you only catch the specific exception-handling

2097948
annotations	mapping
however my solution was based on the fact that mapping are done using hibernate annotations and not xml-configuration if this is your case you could achieve the same with 1 or 2 working days just read the annotations

2097955
cryptography	security
bruce schneier s book practical cryptography is also hugely valuable to anyone implements cryptography security

2097957
jquery	.post
if you use the jquery ajax methods you can .post specific information to your methods

2097959
boolean	int
it has one string key one boolean key one function key one non-integral key one table key and five int key

2097964
jquery	dojo	javascript-framework	dojo
in the articles which javascript-framework jquery vs dojo vs â

2097969
json	xml
however given that this looks like a rest controllers it s likely that spring will be marshalling the return value directly to their representation xml or json using marshallingview

2098008
http	ssl
the basic problem is that the ssl connection is established before the http connection can send the hosts header

2098009
constructor	object
first you need to use class.getconstructor to find the constructor object you want to invoke

2098009
constructor	object
returns a constructor object that

2098015
32-bit	64bit
i m running the 32-bit versioning of windows 7 on 64bit hardware corporate image

2098027
callback	methods
and i ve wrapped each return call with a static postprocesscall methods that decrement the outstanding call counter and marshals the callback onto the ui-thread

2098040
profiling	trace
a nice profiling i use on linux is pycallgraph - however as your program gets bigger it starts to create much larger images which are harder to trace

2098041
where-clause	sql
this is taken from this question sql filtering criterion in join criterion or where-clause which is more efficient

2098077
postdata	request
ps this is not such a big issue for get request but consider form-based upload postdata should not be sent twice to the server

2098104
where-clause	sql
i would contend that the sql query is awkwardly written and that the date-comparison should be in a where-clause but i suppose that s subjective

2098114
selected	cell
this works orange osheet.range osheet.cells a1 u281 selected but u281 will not always be the last cell in the range

2098135
font-size	height
i d like to increase the height of an nspathcontrol as well as make the font-size larger

2098146

2098153
python	java	python	php	python	c++
a couple of examples may be useful in c# arr.sort mycompare in java collections.sort arr mycompare in python arr.sort mycompare in php in c++ sort vec.begin vec.end mycompare

2098154
directory	folder
think of it like of tmp directory in unix or temp folded in windows the directory folder itself is permanent but the data stored within it are temporary

2098158
getter	setter
dot notation is intended for setter methodss named setsomething that take a single parameter and getter and can also be used for any methods that takes no parameters though it s very poor styles to use it for an action like myobject.dosomething

2098158
getter	setter
properties are designed to declare getter and setter more easily and even generator the code for you

2098158
getter	setter
.so the two concepts are related but it s entirely possible and not always poor styles to use dot notation with your very own getter and setter that you wrote by hand

2098158
getter	setter
to use properties even with getter and setter generator for you with normals brackets syntax and not dot notation

2098160
memcached	apc
in php if i create a singleton methods for like 5 different caching classes memcached apc session file cookies

the c and c++ programming languages for example defined byte as addressable unit of data large enough to hold any member of the basic character set of the execution environment clause 3.6 of the c standards

2098173
keydown	keyup
i have the same code for keyup and keydown events is there any way that i can pass the elements to the function .so i can call it like elements.addevent keyup function event elements

2098188
contains	any
how is the resource returned with the contains query any different

2098231
arrays	loops
each time through loops you re re-initializing your arrays

2098231
arrays	loops
move the arrays declaration out of loops before it to fix this

2098245
pascal	delphi
the following is taken from the delphi encryption compendium by hagen reddmann an thus in pascal but i guess this can be translation easily

2098248
callback	methods
if you re creating your own threads non backgroundworker or threadpool threads you can pass a callback methods from your main thread that s called from the worker thread

2098250
repository	entity
.so if a user selected one bit of information to make .some operation with it which is defined in the domain model you need to extraction the identifier from the informational value and pull out the entity value object aggregate from a repository

2098251
arguments	default
you can usually tell the difference because options generally have sensible default while arguments don t

2098253
order	add
this works .when if multiple employees have the same department-minimal salary you want just a random-ish one of them you can add criterion to the order by if you want one picked by some specific criterion

2098275
arguments	default
you should set the action attributes in the add_option methods to store this tells the optparse object to store the arguments immediately following the option flag though this is the default behavior

2098284
circular-buffer	blockingqueue
designate a thread as the io thread and sent the messages to be display to that thread through a blockingqueue or circular-buffer

2098291
required	checked
i checked the classpath in my scripting and its set properly for all dependencies required for log4j

r kspace decided to do a few updates to the box updating the dependent libs in question and it caused the issues .

2098307
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements	abstract-class	subclassing
the headerformatter and checkrowformatter abstract-class would defined a common interface for those types of report elements and the individual concrete subclassing for the various report would contains logic for removing duplicates rows for example or whatever a particular vendor required

2098308
firefox	safari
please look at the home page in firefox or safari first then look at it in ie8 and you ll see what i mean

2098311
classnotfoundexception	classpath
this means that the in the messages mentioned class is missing in the classpath during runtime while it was available during compile-time of the calling class in question that s the difference with classnotfoundexception

2098393
data-access	ado.net
can anyone provide some good pros cons with regards to these two approaches to developing data-access classes with ado.net providers no orm in an asp.net application in particular

2098400
any	set
this link show that a static-class can be used as a convenient containers for sets of methods that just operate on input parameters and do not have to get or set any internal instances field

2098421
filtering	grouping
did you tried to add the filtering to a ports grouping instead and have all the other properties in the specific portss

2098426
value	field
if b is bigger than a then storing it in a location of types a will truncated the value - any field that b added in its definition over and above those of a will be lost

2098426
value	field
the only problem is that simply making a value of types a a field of types b does most of what you d want out of implementation inherited

2098428
maya	mel
it s q a for visual effects .so i d expect a numbers of the watchers to be quite familiar with maya mel and python

2098429
triggers	insert
possibly with a triggers to reject insert and updates that would result 0 or 2 of them being null

2098439
contains	elements
the span elements contains a numbers of words in parentheses

2098454
updating	updates
the presenter would be the intermediary between the model and the view and would updates the model based on any input from the view and would also be responsible for updating the view based on any changes in the model

2098459
any	set
the c specifications says that a char object is large enough to store any member of the execution character set

2098459
minimum	max
limits.h lists a minimum size of 8 bits but the definition leaves the max size of a char open

2098459
unsigned	short
if you use for instances a uint16_t then you can be sure that this value is an unsigned 16-bit value on whatever architecture whether that 16-bit value corresponds to a char short int or something else

2098459
low-level	hardware
if you need to know the exact size of a char because you are doing some low-level hardware manipulation that required it i typically use a data types that is large enough to hold a char on all supported platform usually 16-bit is enough and run the value through a convert_to_machine_char routine .when i need the exact machine representation

2098476
kerberos	ldap
it stores everyone s usernames and passwd and implements ldap and kerberos

2098489
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
-cmatch is always case-sensitive while -imatch is always case-insensitive

2098497
contains	any
this would return false for any uppercase letters while allowing the string to contains other items as long as all letters are lowercase

2098503
dbd	dbi
therefore you need to install dbi dbd first before dbd mysql

2098503
dbd	dbi
this will issue a warning that dbi 1.03 is missing if someone attempts to install your dbd without dbi 1.03

2098503
dbd	dbi
by putting the required dbi dbd in this section we can attempt to load dbi dbd but if it is missing we exit with success

2098503
dbd	dbi
as we exit successfully without creating a makefile .when dbi dbd is missing cpan testers will not report a failure

2098503
dbd	dbi
sudo -h cpan dbi dbd dbd mysql

2098504
implements	abstract
constructor are not like regular methods you can t declare an abstract constructor that a child has to implements

environment	building
its easier to building or reuse an enterprise framework than to find create a distribute component set to work with a changing environment ldap different dbs different backup synchronized

2098510
kerberos	ssl	kerberos	ldap
true kerberos i mean now you could use the ldap libs in .net to communication between the servers in a kerberos fashion but the connection between user client and asp.net server would still be an ssl plain text connection

2098510
kerberos	ldap
if the asp.net server had a trust relationship with the apple open directory server with an ldap connection made between the two it might be possible to enable the ntlm authentication at the iis level and that would in theory extends the kerberos connect to the aod through the trust

2098510
kerberos	ldap
i have successfully used directoryservices to connect to other active directory through the ldap protocols but i still have not found a way to embed the kerberos connect between client and authentication server without ntlm

entity-framework	ado.net
.when i replace the entity-framework code with classic ado.net code i get an error

2098518
contains	elements
i ll assume that the is id of the html elements that contains the loading messages

2098518
hide	show
if you have a lot of ajax communication and need the loading often it might be better to hide it .so you can just show it later instead of creating the html again

2098518
hide	show
statement1 would be uset to create the loading elements statement2 with hide instead of remove to hide it and statement3 with show instead of hide to show it again

2098528
for-loop	loops
the for-loop present in c doesn t technically count as a for-loop because you don t necessarily know how many time loops will iterate before execution it

2098528
for-loop	loops
the class of problems you can solve with while loops is strictly more powerful than those you could have solved with the strict for-loop found in pascal

2098528
while-loop	for-loop
you can find out more about while-loop computability and for-loop computability in these cs lecture notes csjvt jvtteaching tpl.html

2098719
deployment	install
i ve seen companies where .when they were done with the deployment the last machine install was already two versioning ahead the first one

2098719
environment	execution
with a browser on the client side a cross-platform execution environment and centralized deployment you just wipe out these problems

2098719
filtering	grouping	rich-internet-application	ria
some people do not want a page flow paradigms some people do need advanced widget a grid component with advanced filtering grouping excel like features like basic formula etc or low latency or real time etc things that a rich-internet-application - or ria - is not really made for and is thus not the right tool to choose

2098726

2098760
background-image	transparency
however yes setting the background-image to a transparency gif fixed the problem for me

2098763
hide	show
gwt doesn t provide similar features to show hide a loading frame on-the-fly

i now have the following but i am unsure as to the numbers of backslashes and also how to complete the final substitution which makes use of my grouping 1 and replace it with at its start and at its end

2098808
c++	lua
probably because a c or c++ implementation would be faster and easier to write and then you could hand the data off to lua to be used if you want

2098808
c++	lua
or you could just use the google c++ one and then hand your data off to lua from there

2098817
while-loop	cursor
is is possible to use cursor to delete says one hundred recording per transactional in a while-loop

2098818
constructor	object
i would suggest a facade that would represent the object as a whole the customer data and a factory which creates that object by retrieving from each datasource and passing those to the facade in the constructor or as a builder depending on how many there are

2098827
memcached	apc
the bottom line is that you could create a plesk 8 centos 5 apache 2 php 5.2.6 mysql 5.0.45 memcached apc ami and run as many of them as you want

2098832
variables	boolean	boolean	int
if i have a function that performs some procedure and then needs to return the truth value of something is there a compelling reason to use either a boolean variables or an int variables as the return-type

2098846
rollback	commit
if you batch-file and commit you re safer rollback log files won t grow like crazy and locks are manageable

2098865

to get smooth resizing i presume i should put some change to the labels s properties in an animation block

2098910
malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
free is used to deallocate memory that was allocated with malloc calloc like .so

2098936

the application object is another way though and it is sometimes easier .when dealing with the same state across multiple activities as opposed to having to get put it everywhere or object more complex than primitive and strings

2098936
any	set
you can extends application and then set get whatever you want there and access it from any activity in the same application with getapplication

2098938
fckeditor	wysiwyg	tinymce	yui
imce wysiwyg bridge only works with the tinymce and fckeditor thus the yui editor with the wysiwyg module does no allow image import with yui

2099148
constructor	object
a practical rea.son for this restrictions is that the constructor creates the object and the function you re calling could al.so have a return-value .so that you would end up with two value produced by the same statement

javascript	dom
now subsequent queries will be execute against a much faster javascript arrays than against the dom tree

2099921
keyboard	mouse
while you can execute a software program without an operating systemd your program will need to implements all the code that is used to talk to various pieces of hardware in a computer to various degrees - outputting data to a display interpreting input from a keyboard mouse network card etc
