1000759
cvs	git
pattern0	
otherwise you can have git commit older than the cvs ones which isn t that useful.

1001196
activerecord	datamapper
pattern7	
both use the activerecord pattern .so you ll actually get your database tables back in object without fancy domain logic but datamapper is way easier to work with and is thread-safe

1001855
vb.net	vba	vbscript	vb.net	vbscript	vba
pattern0	
i believe that the report are using something more along the line of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that

1002662
derived-class	inherited
pattern10	
with non-virutal inherited this is less tricky than you might think - at the points where the cast is compiled the compiler knows the exact layout of the derived-class after all the compiler did the layout

1004850
sql-server	postgresql
pattern4	
.so while i prefer postgresql sql-server db2 etc. i find access to be of use from time to time .when i need to move data around from one .source to another

1006393
json	xml
pattern7	pattern0	
json has a smaller payload than equivalent xml

1006393
json	xml
pattern7	
json is easier to deal with in javascript compare eval ing a json object to walking an xml fragment

1007672
cakephp	symfony
pattern8	
i can t speak for symfony but i believe it s more heavyweight than cakephp

1007881
xsd	xml
pattern7	
the actual xml file is much larger as well as the xsd but it fails at the very beginning .so i have reduced the problem to almost nothing

1009410
updating	updates
pattern0	
.so you may need to do a loops that takes only part of the batch-file at a time but pretty much any numbers greater than one row at time will be faster than one row at a time this is slower than updating or insert or deleting the whole batch-file but faster than row-by row operations and may be needed in a production-environment with many users and little available downtime .when users are not trying to see and updates other recording in the same table

1011950
bazaar	git
pattern10	
bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not .so true with git

1011950
bazaar	git
pattern7	pattern7	
bazaar is easier to extends in an api way git is easier to extends in a unix way pipe

1013996
inline-code	code-behind
pattern7	
in general inline-code can do anything code-behind code can do the code-behind code is just cleaner and sepearates files

1014688
richfaces	icefaces
pattern0	
that said i found icefaces to be a useful product and much better than richfaces especially in terms of the quality of the documentation

1016011
scala	java	python	ruby	python	java
pattern7	
scala allows people who love programming in python and ruby to use java s jvm without the cost with a lot of syntactic elegance scala is somewhat more intuitive to my python-centric mind than clojure

1016512
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
honestly though postgresql scale much better than mysql

1016714
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
pattern8	
from a purely technical points of view all of the major rdbms vendors oracle sybase db2 sql-server et al. are significantly more capable than mysql is currently or can reasonably be expected to be in the foreseeable future

1018142
emacs	vim
pattern8	
i m just looking for something a little more polished than vim or emacs but not quite as heavyweight as netbeans or eclipse

1018715
gedit	emacs
pattern4	
now on linux i still prefer gedit to the other options i ve tried with apologies to vi and emacs fans

1019594
getter	setter
pattern8	
properties specially automatic properties in .net 3.5 are more concise than setter getter and less lines-of-code less code to maintain less bugs

1019808
multiplication	exponent
pattern7	
as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication

1020038
emacs	vim
pattern7	pattern0	
it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa

1021486
export	csv
pattern8	
it s more complex than csv i9mport export but also a bit more robust

1022814
firebird	mysql
pattern8	
and firebird could be embedded in you application and the licensing model is less restrictive than mysql one

1023383
python	java
pattern10	
python is much more strictly oo than java and c#

1023586
virtualization	vmware
pattern10	
vmware is much more for usable virtualization rather than down-and-dirty

1024263
value	field
pattern7	
the article you link to points this out as a solution to the seq scan problem if you add range constraints to the date field of each partition this query can be optimized into a loops where you query the â œlatestâ partition first and work backwards until you find a single value that is higher than the range of all the remaining partitions. --but doesn t show the improved plan you d see after that change

1024827
pointers	stack
pattern7	
usually recordinging the state on a stack takes less spaces that the call stack as you re selected only the essential local state to recording and are not recordinging return addresses or any caller-save registers if you used a functor rather than a function pointers then it s more likely that the compiler might be able to inline routine and .so not save the caller save registers in the simple recursive case .so reducing the amount of stack required for each recursion

1024985
fireworks	photoshop
pattern4	
i don t know either of them but i have always worked with fireworks for things as web design as seemingly opposed to a lot of people who prefer photoshop

1026507
digits	zero
pattern0	
time that are less than 4 digits long need to be prefixed with a zero 0 to make them the same length as the ones with 4 digits

1026788
pointers	stack
pattern4	
i think you just need to watch your heap and stack usage you can grab pointers to local-variables to get an idea of where stack is at the moment and if it s too high reduce it

1026810
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
pattern7	
an argumentnullexception would be misleading .so argumentexception is a better fit

1027557
python	c++
pattern8	
i realise python is .so much more dynamic than c++ it s taken me a while to see how little code you actually need to write

1027808
multiplication	division
pattern7	pattern0	
t is not very important as long as alpha is small otherwise you will run into some rather weird nyquist issues alias etc. and if you are working on a processor where multiplication is cheaper than division or fixed-point issues are important precalculate omega

1027850
pylons	django
pattern0	
i m trying to play devil s advocate since everybody else s recommending django but for a beginner django may in fact be better than pylons still spending a day or .so lightly researching each main alternative before you commit to one is a good investment of your time

1028273
contains	elements
pattern0	
note that i ve also added a root elements in case your dictionary contains more than one elements and i m guessing that none of the dictionary key value is root

1028931
lgpl	gpl
pattern4	pattern2	
since i want to call the libs from within another open-source software with a bsd-ish license i would prefer lgpl over gpl

1031562
destroy	self
pattern4	
destroy self

1031629
redgate	sqlcmd
pattern0	
rather than gushing any more simpletalk by redgate did an awesome wrap up of sqlcmd - the sqlcmd workbench

1032354
virtualbox	vmware	virtualization	virtualbox	virtualization	vmware
pattern4	
everyone seems to be suggesting virtualbox but in my opinion you can t beat vmware at the virtualization game

1034652
shark	gprof
pattern3	
regardless i d strongly recommend using shark instead of gprof - it s very easy to use and superior in pretty much every way to gprof - and doesn t required you to recompile your program

1034902
ruby	php
pattern4	
you can still use other ruby-based frameworks if you just like ruby but ruby-on-rails would not be the right choice - and i d probably recommend php since it does well at simple scripting

1035179
cross-compiling	scons
pattern7	
scons is better but cross-compiling is not its strong points

1035179
autotools	automake	build-system	automake	build-system	autotools
pattern10	
in the case of autotools it is slightly more complicated because not everybody who compiles the software would need automake and autoconf install only those that need to change the build-system adding new files count as changing the build-system

1035179
toolchain	cmake
pattern0	
cmake s approach is a little more heavywieght with the toolchain file but it means you don t have to specify all of you tools and libs cc cxx ranlib --with-ibfoo etc as they are figured out from a standards conventions

1035492
subproject	libs
pattern0	
depending on the size of the libs you may want to set it up as a distinct target in your project or for even more flexibility as a subproject of your main project

1035642
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern0	
basically he was saying that asp.net-asp.net-mvc is not for large-scale enterprise .applications that it is not as flexible as webforms and that an asp.net-mvc .app will be slower than a webforms .app

1035660
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern7	
i think asp.net-mvc is a lighter framework and more performant because it doesn t do a lot of the things that the webforms framework does out of the box like viewstate for example

1035660
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern0	
i don t think it would be fair to say that asp.net-mvc is not for larger scale applications as it probably scale better than webforms would in terms of performance

1035854
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern7	
performance - since both asp.net-mvc and webforms use the same asp.net as the core framework and asp.net-mvc is lighter and http compliant it gives you better performance

1036526
virtual-keyboard	focus
pattern4	
i want to develop a systemd virtual-keyboard with swt technology on the platform of powerpc under ubuntu and what the problem i meet is that how to make the shell lose focus .when initializing the shell windows

1036699
arrays	loops
pattern7	
the variant with 0-sized arrays is better because your caller doesn t need to checked for null and can process the arrays in a consistent way - say in a loops which would be empty in this case

1037076
conditional	operators
pattern0	
i avoid nesting ternary operators or checked more than one conditional with them as that makes the code obscure really fast

1037080
swing	swt
pattern2	
what criterion should i use to choose between swt and swing

1037130
swing	swt
pattern7	
it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing

1037514
swing	swt
pattern2	
my criterion to choose between swt and swing

1037514
swing	swt	eclipse-rcp	swt
pattern4	
briefly after my swt eclipse-rcp experience - on next project i would choose swing

1037514
swing	swt	look-and-feel	swt
pattern0	
it api seems for me easier than swt you haven t got to manage disposing components by hand to prevent memory-leaks you adding component to panels instead of constructing components with parent panels information former is closer to my previous experience...etc. native look-and-feel you can get in swing too overall performance is enough good swt should be faster because it s using native components of backed os - but is the performance gain really big pro

1037788
oracle	mysql	coalesce	nvl	coalesce	isnull	isnull	nvl
pattern10	pattern8	
coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

1039218
python	perl
pattern0	
for something that involves parsing multiple log files formatting the output to a summary status file and sending you an email notification if it notices certain types of events you might be better off with perl or python

1039840
32-bit	64bit
pattern3	
i would not recommend putting 32-bit programs in the 64bit installation directory but this is simply for conventions

1041874
bubble-sort	quicksort
pattern0	
specific ones bubble-sort can be much faster than quicksort depending on input characteristics

1042989
innodb	myisam
pattern7	
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

1043400
png	gif
pattern7	
for non-animated gif images a conversion to png8 should be painless and beneficial as png compresses much better

1044884
pylons	django
pattern4	pattern0	
i actually prefer pylons because it is much leaner than django but considering you specify enterprise ready i think you might want to hedge toward the larger framework and carry the kitchen sink around with you

1046980
python	php
pattern0	
edit allow me to clarify my goal as i have been told python does a lot more than php

1047997
toupper	tolower
pattern10	
as a side note using toupper is more efficient than using tolower .so toupper would be the way to go

1049679
getter	setter
pattern10	
is this even possible for starters because this is about adding protocols to setter and a getter is much more easy like

1050080
bmp	png
pattern4	
textures use apple s own texture2d class from the samples bmp will work but i recommend png because of the platform optimizations

1050501
redmine	trac
pattern0	
we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use

1051919
instances	destroy
pattern4	
the management of service instancess and instances contexts is controlled by the iinstancesprovider that creates and destroy service object the iinstancescontextprovider that creates and destroy instances contexts and the iinstancescontextinitializer that sets up newly acquired instances contexts

1052188
dictionary	map
pattern3	
first regarding the dictionary class that class is considered obselete the documentation recommends using map instead

1052884
dependency-injection	service-locator
pattern3	
instead of service-locator i d recommend using dependency-injection di

1053267
vb.net	vb6
pattern3	
however if your moving from vb6 then i d recommend learning vb.net or preferably c#

1053821
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
pattern2	
each set contains 10 numberss and i need to remove all sets that have 5 or more numbers unordered matches with any other set

1055775
.when	ready
pattern3	
you can but they must be called within the scoping of the ready methods otherwise they lose scoping .when the ready methods exit

1056044
contains	set
pattern0	
whenever there are more than one set associated with the same hash value this means that most likely they contains a common subset of at least five int

1056048
common-lisp	scheme
pattern4	pattern8	
in that regard i d recommend scheme which is in my opinion more elegant than common-lisp

1056774
python	java
pattern4	
before you tell me that i want to do it in python or the like i just want to reiterate why i would choose java

1059847
telnet	ftp
pattern0	
it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and numbers of downloading http is very light-weight you can communication to an httpserver using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each

1062599
lookup	any
pattern10	
i have never seen any performance statistics suggesting that a regex based lookup is faster or more performant than string indexing

1063633
any	set
pattern4	
if you don t want to edit an existing column and lose any valuable data for instances you could just create a new column temporary go back into the datasheet view and set a value in that column for all events

1063920
getter	setter
pattern10	
but then your setter is less restrict than your getter which is odd.

1066014
ubuntu	linux
pattern4	
if you are new to linux then i defiantly recommend ubuntu

1066849
json	xml
pattern7	pattern0	
the json format is much lighter than xml and you serialization and de-serialization with a libs such as json.net

1068152
freebsd	linux	linux	unix
pattern10	
migrate to enterprise linux or freebsd postgresql works much better on unix type-systems mdash

1069300
xsd	xml
pattern7	
without going into too much detail we are looking to use xml as meta-data to describe constraints on properties this is a cutdown example and xsd did not support our proposed complex model there are two options being considered which of the following xml strucutures makes better sense

1070079
json	xml
pattern0	
json will produce a light-weight file much smaller than xml and should be a bit faster .when process

1071726
arrays	loops
pattern10	
the reason that your arrays iterator is faster is that the the numbers of iterator is constants and compiler is able to unroll loops

1071833
json	xml
pattern0	
json takes a lot less spaces than xml although xml compress very well

1071887
richfaces	icefaces
pattern4	
you should be able to mix and match icefaces and richfaces just fine

1072917
ubuntu	linux
pattern4	
if you choose linux then i suggest going with ubuntu as that has one of the best automatic hardware configuration i have seen

1072922
linux	unix
pattern10	
to be called unix you have to pass a certification that it conforms to the specifications .so linux is more precisely called a unix-like operating systemd

1074017
arrays	loops
pattern0	
if you already have the arrays of int there is not quick way to convert you re better off with loops

1074018
checkbox	button
pattern10	
for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined

1075055
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
pattern3	
i would recommend using argumentexception or argumentnullexception for parameters passed to routines rather then local-variables

1075277
bmp	png
pattern4	
also note that without compression also image-size is just 30kb for rgb image and if you reduce size to 60x60 pixels image-size would be only 10kb without any compression i.e you can use bmp images and if you want lesses sizer but lossless-compression you can choose png

1077047
post-increment	pre-increment
pattern10	pattern8	
as gotw #2 put it pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment because for post-increment the object must increment itself and then return a temporary contains its old value

1077242
perl	awk
pattern0	
perl probably would have been a better choice than awk but here goes first we sort the two city named and put the id at the end of the string which i did in the first section

1077436
boost-python	ctypes
pattern0	
in my experience it is much better than boost-python swig or ctypes

1077976
compact-framework	.net
pattern7	pattern0	
if normaly write code in .net 2.0 .net 2.0 compact-framework but if your you dont care about having to install .net 3 then it should be better .net 2 is wider spread out then .net 3

1078123
python	ruby	haskell	python
pattern8	
you might be able to get a shorter more brilliant program with haskell but i would imagine ruby or python would probably be actually understandable

1078269
value	field
pattern7	pattern7	
if i understand correctly you have a single column which has numeric value and you want to find sum of this field for all thw rows where the field value is less than 30 and same conditional with the variation of field value greater than 30

1079716
gettext	icu
pattern3	
i would highly recommend using icu instead of gettext and the locale stuff offered by the standard-library if you are developing a commercial application

1079983
python	java
pattern7	pattern0	
i know that python is older than java but i can t figure out where does this come from

1080535
msbuild	nant
pattern4	
if you prefer nant msbuild or powershell you can use those too.

1080696
multiplication	mod
pattern0	
instead of using to do your powers i would do a for-loop using multiplication and then taking the mod of the numbers as you go along by using a conditional to checked if the numbers calculated is greater than the mod

1080868
version-control	git
pattern7	
if you would like to see how git compares to other version-control systemd there is no better suited site than this one why git is better than x coincidentally that site s source is on github

1081218
carbon	cocoa
pattern7	
is there something built into cocoa carbon that s easier than the options above

1081937
entity-framework	ado.net	stored-procedures	ado.net
pattern3	
i d recommend creating stored-procedures for those cases which you can call with plain ado.net or you can you can add them to your model in entity-framework and call them through there

1082128
cassini	iis
pattern0	
for my webapp the integrated visual-studio server cassini ist much slower than iis

1082145
oracle	mysql
pattern4	
i recommend mysql or oracle

1083732
webrequest	webclient
pattern8	pattern2	
or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest

1084126
png	gif
pattern0	
png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

1084958
python	c++
pattern10	
being an expert in both c++ and python my mantra has long been python where i can c++ where i must python is faster in term of programmer productivity and development cycle and easier c++ can give that extra bit of power .when i have to get close to the hardware or be extremely careful about every byte or machine cycle i spend

1086259
python	java
pattern10	
don t underestimate python selling points however the python language is much more productive in terms of lines-of-code - the general agreement is that python required a third of the code of an equivalent java program while remaining as or more readable

1086873
web-services	security
pattern10	
the use of web-services tends to be safer although security is often more a people issue than software issue

1087352
convenience-methods	initializer
pattern0	
setup and teardown are convenience-methods - they shouldn t attempt to do much more than initializer a class using its default-constructor etc

1087549
erlang	ada
pattern0	
would erlang compiled using ada be noticably better or worse than the erlang made with c

1087782
conditional	operators
pattern4	
a ++ operators is not atomicity in c# and i doubt it is guaranteed to be atomicity in c++ .so yes your count is subject to race conditional

1087878
python	java
pattern4	pattern4	
vice versa if you loathe javascript but must execute some code in the user s browser java s gwt generator the javascript for you from your java-level coding is far richer and more advanced than python-side alternatives in practice if you choose python you ll be writing some javascript yourself for this purpose while if you choose java gwt is a usable alternative if you loathe writing javascript

1087878
python	java
pattern0	
in terms of libs it s pretty much a wash -- the jvm is restrict enough no threads no custom classloader no jni no relational db to hamper the simple reuse of existing java libs as much or more than existing python libs are similarly hampered by the similar restrictions on the python runtime

1088074
string.format	stringbuilder
pattern3	
however in this situation i highly recommend using string.format or a stringbuilder depending on the numbers types of operations to construct the result string from mixed types

1089158
key-value	key
pattern7	
for clustered key this is far worse because the clustered key-value is used as the lookup value on all other non-clustered indexes .so it increases the size of all indexes

1089656
.net	wcf
pattern0	
see peer-to-peer programming with wcf and .net 3.5 peer named by amit bahree and chris peiris

1090158
swing	awt
pattern8	
as far as .when awt may be more useful than swing -

1090673
jquery-plugins	jquery
pattern4	
i prefer jquery-plugins because i use jquery to all other plugins and components in my .app

1091474
any	set
pattern0	
longer than any writer the set of

1091816
python	java
pattern10	
python is much more expressive that java and if you restrict yourself to one class per file which python does not prevent you from doing you will end up with lots of very small files - more to keep tracking of with very little benefit

1091837
attributes	properties
pattern0	
i hope there is an easy way to do it - preferably without decorating the properties with an attributes but if the setup is easier with the attributes i guess that s cool

1092587
build-process	ant
pattern3	
if you re just export from eclipse directly - i d recommend using ant or maven to get a repeatable build-process not tied to the ide

1093097
click	mouse	mousedown	mouseup
pattern3	
value for right mouse button is 2 although also note that it recommends using mousedown or mouseup events rather than click

1093160
python	java
pattern10	
performance java is potentially faster then python

1093160
python	java
pattern8	
memcached api java sdk have more interesting abilities than python sdk

1093307
client-server	webserver
pattern2	
you may compare this with client-server computing as paradigms and browser webserver or db-client stored procedure as two of various other architectural realizations of this paradigms

1093647
order	join
pattern4	
xml formatting aside it looks like what you want is to query the line item table and join the purchase order and customer tables on that

1093986
websphere	ibm
pattern4	
buy ibm websphere mq mqseries

1094196
multiple-inheritance	polymorphism
pattern7	
as soon as you have dynamic polymorphism you need multiple-inheritance to implements more than one interface at the same time

1094632
pc-lint	misra
pattern4	
then buy pc-lint or another static analysis tool to checked your code for misra and other rules

1095291
keyboard	mouse
pattern4	
the entire taskpane loses keyboard focus to words s main windows but retains mouse capture

1096703
internet-explorer	firefox
pattern7	pattern0	
because firefox is better than internet-explorer

1098302
revision	updates
pattern4	
right-click on desired folder choose updates item to revision

1099454
python	ruby
pattern0	
.so i think we can conclude that ruby are not better and likely neither worse than python in this respect

1099669
swing	awt
pattern7	
imho the main reason that they didn t catch on is that they required tended to required too much skill and used awt swing which produces worse uis than what a designer with little programming skills could achieve with flash

1099695
udp	tcp
pattern0	
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

1100868
udp	tcp
pattern0	
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

1101357
sql-server	oracle
pattern7	
a sql-server database corresponds more to an oracle user schema

1101923
vb.net	vb6
pattern10	
however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time .so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008

1102082
arrays	loops
pattern7	
if arrays is lower on stack than i this code will loops infinite because it mistakenly accesses and zero arrays 10 which is i

1104242
double-quotes	single-quotes
pattern8	
double-quotes are more common than single-quotes in general but i ll use single-quotes if i have a double quote in my string

1105494
functional-programming	imperative-programming
pattern7	
functional-programming is harder to get your head around than imperative-programming

1105534
webserver	nginx
pattern10	
also a good frontend webserver like nginx is way faster than any webapp layer you d have to write to read the blob from the db

1105831
gnome	xfce
pattern7	pattern0	
xfce runs much smaller than gnome and is full featured

scons	cmake
pattern4	pattern2	
here is an article about the decision made by kde developers to choose cmake over scons

1107743
derived-class	base-class
pattern7	pattern0	
a derived-class concrete_with_knobs is 400k larger than its base-class concrete

1108726
cross-join	inner-join
pattern0	
however the precedence of the comma-operator is less than of inner-join cross-join left join and .so on

1109076
selection	cell
pattern0	
do note that selection could be more than one cell .so your checked for a marked cell needs to checked the whole range in .some way

1109951
boolean	int
pattern4	
we can mix and match boolean and int value in our designs obtaining an if then else that required evaluation both branches simd styles by evaluation cond then + 1 - cond else using 1 as true and 0 as false in cond .so you can get away with using the built-in arithmetic of your ring to make your circuit more shallow

1109977
value	field
pattern4	
where in this case _list is an arraycollection object whose filtering function depends on the showall field to choose value

1110478
selection	cell
pattern0	
just remember that the selection can be more than one cell .so you ll need to allow for that in your code

1111015
malloc	free
pattern0	
now if you free some value on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

1111400
python	php
pattern0	
on the other hand php is a poorly designed language and is usually slower than python in benchmarking

1112578
boolean-expression	operators
pattern0	
the map needs to be able to tell whether one key s value is less than another key s value by default this means that key1 key2 must be a valid boolean-expression that the key types should implements the less than operators

1114965
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern7	pattern0	
in any case writing stuff in asp.net-mvc is much faster than in webforms even if done from scratch

1115364
authentication	impersonation
pattern7	
claims based authentication makes life easier if you want to flow identity through multiple systemd such as a middle tier and onto a compatible back end without having to mess with impersonation and delegation.it s also partially for federation - allowing other people s systemd to perform the authentication and for you to then authentication access to your application based on the identity information sent by those systemd

1116695
entity-framework	nhibernate	entity-framework	data-access	data-access	nhibernate
pattern7	
with .net which data-access methods is better to use linq-to-sql entity-framework or nhibernate

1116841
json	xml
pattern0	
json has the added advantage of being less bloated than xml and can easily be translation to javascript .when on the client

1116884
json	xml
pattern10	pattern8	
xml is much more complex than json though

1116966
groovy	java	python	java
pattern10	
personally i prefer jython because it s based on python in fact it is python but a little bit outdated but i must admit that groovy is more tightly coupled with the jre it s more syntactically similar to java and thus might be a better option

1117074
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
pattern7	
i am writing an .app based on uitabbarcontroller which has more than 10 viewcontrollers with corresponding uinavigationcontroller

1117116
entity-framework	ado.net
pattern10	pattern10	
ado.net entity-framework is more flexible

1117241
webserver	nginx
pattern4	
if you want to run it on mac os x you can simply setup your webserver i recommend nginx with phusion s passenger and your database server to start on boot that way whenever your computer has to restart it will have your site running

1117426
exception-handling	error-handling
pattern10	
part of the reason is that exception-handling is always more costly and complex than more conventional error-handling

1117426
nsexception	nserror
pattern10	
aside from obejctive-c conventions and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want to

1117688
multiplication	division
pattern10	pattern8	
the cpu operation for float division is much more complicated than multiplication

1117702
addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	addition
pattern0	pattern0	
if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication

1117736
pyflakes	pylint
pattern8	
pydev is pretty well integrated with pylint see here -- and pylint is a much more powerful checker than pyflakes beyond the minor issue of misspelled variables it will catch styles violations etc etc -- it s highly customizable for whatever your specific purposes are

1118709
contains	any
pattern4	
your regexp matches any string that contains both numbers and letters but not only one of them

1119713
distance	polygons
pattern7	
then i would simply checked the edges of all blue polygonss whose lower-bound of distance is lower than the upper bound of minimal distance against all the edges of the red polygons

1120009
distance	polygons
pattern7	
calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the .sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found .so far

1120597
remote-desktop	rdp
pattern0	
this feature allows the taskbar to span across both monitor allows games to be played in fullscreens across both monitor and allow remote-desktop connection to span both monitor without the span feature i have four monitor .so my total screens width is more than rdp s limit of 4096 pixels making span very annoying

1121403
autotools	cmake
pattern4	
on the other hand if you develop on windows and for visual-studio then you can t use autotools and you need to choose cmake that provides such tools

1122616
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
pattern10	
however the transitions from the initial touchesbegan event to the first touchesmoved is less obvious sometimes the device wait a while

1123333
linked-list	queue	linked-list	arrays
pattern7	
also in a linked-list there is no unused memory in a circular arrays approach if the size of the queue is less than the maximum capacity of the arrays there will be empty slots

1123338
linked-list	queue
pattern7	
for the linked-list it is easier to remove and add elements from the middle although that should not be needed at all for a queue

1123342
linked-list	arrays
pattern7	
the linked-list implementation uses more memory per elements but the arrays implementation required more contiguous memory

1124848
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb.net	vbscript	vb6
pattern10	
vbscript is much more convenient than creating an activex on vb6 or c# vb.net

1126099
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	
personally i prefer webforms but am learning asp.net-mvc within ruby-on-rails just to broaden my experience and to gain the benefits of better testing

1126353
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	pattern2	
i prefer asp.net-mvc over webforms for the following reasons

1126681
zend-framework	codeigniter	zend-framework	cakephp	codeigniter	cakephp
pattern4	
i would recommend codeigniter cakephp or zend-framework

1126998
json	xml
pattern0	
if those extra field are incidental and don t care to do searches on them i usually go for option 2 but like json better than xml

1128221
memcmp	strcmp
pattern10	
if you always keep tracking of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp

1130948
python	ruby
pattern0	
i am more familiar with python than ruby

1132496
base-class	inherited
pattern0	
probably not in ways that you care about though the compiler can use the empty base-class optimization if you happen to inherited from more than one base-class with

1133261
constructor	object
pattern4	
one the lead object has several dozen properties and writing this constructor is a pita

1133330
python	java
pattern10	
where python abounds with high-level framework-- things like web.py java seems much more low-level

1133337
copy-constructor	constructor
pattern4	
if your lead class had a copy-constructor lead lead otherlead leadwithimportcheckbox would inherited that and you could just call the base lead constructor in the leadwithimportcheckbox constructor - hence no need for leadwithimportcheckbox to be aware of the details of lead

1135069
value	field
pattern7	pattern0	
also if your seek is on an order field you can optimize your navigation by checked whether the sought value is greater or lesser than the value of the current recording and choosing .findprevious or .findnext accordingly because the dao recordingset find operations work sequentially through the index

1135308
bazaar	git
pattern4	pattern2	
i choose bazaar over git mercurial coz bazaar is notifications are very well integrated in ubuntu

1135547
wxwidgets	mfc
pattern10	
wxwidgets is better for c++ developers who has knowledge about mfc and windows

1135698
multiplication	division
pattern7	pattern0	
int multiplication is much faster than division

1137516
stax	sax
pattern3	
given your situation i would recommend using stax rather than sax

1139555
typedef	struct
pattern4	
for instances here is a regex which will match typedef of struct which points to a single named and may or may not have a pointsers

1140056
gethashcode	equals
pattern2	
if you have written a class which implements its own equalsity that is different from reference equalsity then you are required to overrides gethashcode such that two object that compare as equals have equals hashcode

1140732
version-control	git
pattern4	pattern10	
as for version-control - i would recommend git it is faster and has more features

1140923
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql

1140955
json	xml
pattern0	
these aren t the only two options you can also use json or yaml which are much lighter weight than xml

1141062
csv	xml
pattern4	pattern2	
among the reasons you may prefer xml over csv depends on the task at hand of course

1143451
contains	elements
pattern0	
the arrays will never contains more than 5-10 elements

1143578
png	gif
pattern10	
this properly means if the file is an image of gif or jpeg or png and is less than that size

1143725
any	set
pattern8	
as for their pricing it s entirely up to them to set the price at 750 or 75k or 7 and none of those numbers is more right than any other

1143910
while-loop	cursor
pattern0	
also performance is somewhat of a concern would a fastforward readonly cursor be a better option than a while-loop

1144153
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	pattern2	
.so .when would you actually choose asp.net-mvc over asp.net webforms or asp.net webforms over asp.net-mvc

1144174
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	
you do choose asp.net-mvc or asp.net webforms and there are lots of good reasons to do that

1144249
constructor	object
pattern4	pattern4	
compares object without digging into prototype then compares properties projection recursively and also compares constructor

1144717
value	field
pattern4	
in that server side methods i try to grab value of that current row but they are all the old cell value before i modified the field data using jquery javascript

1144979
postgresql	mysql	overlapping	scale
pattern0	
fyi postgresql scale better than mysql on multiprocess overlapping request from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

1147960
subtract	add
pattern0	
this garentees that while a can be issued to the pipeline every cycle it will have a higher latency than an add subtract circuit

1148222
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
you have to make sure your local sql instances is exactly at the same building versioning versioning like the hostsing provider otherwise your local sql may upgrade the database structure and you ll be unable to restore it back on the hostsing provider or you ll be unable to restore in on your local server if your versioning is earlier than the hosts s

1148291
json	xml
pattern10	
generally json is a more efficient way to retrieve data via ajax as the same data in xml is a lot larger

1149288
postgresql	mysql
pattern3	
if you want to go open source i would recommend using postgresql instead of mysql

1149335
constructor	object
pattern7	
in your particular example the object factory-pattern is a better solution than using reflection to invoke constructor

1149595
python	ruby
pattern10	
i believe python is better for this than ruby but i could be wrong

1149723
python	ruby
pattern7	
the core of python is somewhat cleaner than the core of ruby and if you learn the basic core of scripting with python first you will more or less as a bonus learn ruby

1149723
python	ruby
pattern4	
disclaimer i prefer ruby in a production commercial setup over python

1149723
python	ruby
pattern4	pattern2	
i prefer ruby over python on windows

1149723
python	ruby
pattern4	pattern2	
i prefer ruby over python on the things i do at home

1150927
yaml	ini
pattern0	
it uses very simple yaml files which are far easier to edit than xml and have hierarchy which is better than ini files

1152264
windows-applications	wpf
pattern7	
i think it depends on the skillset of your team but having said that from my experience wpf is much easier to develop windows-applications with

1152886
panels	grid
pattern0	
instead the rendering div for the panels has no height and witdh settings and is therefore somehow smaller than the grid

1153096
python	ruby
pattern4	pattern2	
i personally prefer ruby over python largely because of blocks but i envy the clarity-first attitude in the python community

1153191
ruby-on-rails	django
pattern8	
django may have less magic than ruby-on-rails but there is still some there

1156677
c-preprocessor	macros
pattern0	
this code is nothing more than standards c-preprocessor macros

1157651
contains	any
pattern4	
by the way this regex contains a lookbehind that can match any numbers of characters

1157736
python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django
pattern10	
as the current python is faster than the current ruby 1.8 that makes django itself way faster than ruby-on-rails there s alot of benchmarking about this on the web

1159792
linked-list	dictionary	binary-tree	linked-list
pattern0	
obviously being a binary-tree it s very fast to query though again probably no faster than a dictionary from a json object however it has no linked-list styles hierachy object graphing to worry about

1160639
data-access	ado.net
pattern7	
i m looking for answers or reasons why ado.net is better than ado with regards to data-access .when it comes to windows forms applications

1161747
arrays	loops
pattern0	
i found that built-in functions are much faster than loops .when process large arrays

1161907
pascal	delphi
pattern0	
you probably don t want to go back to anything earlier than delphi 3 but some pascal programming books can be helpful

1162395
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	pattern0	
postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain points it is actually faster .when you have a ridiculously large database

1163358
png	gif
pattern4	pattern2	
and unless you required animation i d always recommend png over gif

1163376
sublimetext	webstorm
pattern10	
webstorm i use for the bigger project where the sublimetext is more for the files to open or a small project because it is very fast

1163514
endpoint	uri
pattern0	
.when you specify more than one endpoint uri any types that shared a common schema will be generator once and reused amongst all service contracts

1164837
python	java
pattern3	
i recommend creating java interfaces to represent the operations that you plan to use along with separately-packaged implementation classes that wrap the python code

1165046
updating	updates
pattern4	
i would recommend updating slightly differently as your tblmailinglist user will not be valid to be updates in your repository

1165085
python	java
pattern8	
these benchmarking also report the source code-size and python was significantly more concise than java and c#

1165594
for-loop	loops	while-loop	loops	while-loop	for-loop
pattern0	
even if the hypothesis of the while-loop being faster than the for-loop were true and it s not the loops you d had to change optimize wouldn t be the outer ones but the inner ones because those are execute more time

1166013
factors	digits
pattern7	
the most important factors is that double being implements as a binary fractions cannot accurately represent many decimal fractionss like 0.1 at all and its overall numbers of digits is smaller since it is 64bit wide vs

1167997
arrays	map
pattern0	
also if your enum has a huge numbers of value jon skeet s map alternative is likely to perform better than any arrays iterator

1168395
python	java
pattern0	
i would argue python simpler than java on this basis because it s object-model whilst complex is simple in terms of reduction into a simpler form

1168451
multiplication	division
pattern0	
shifting bits left and right is apparently faster than multiplication and division operations on most maybe even all cpus if you happen to be using a power of 2

1168616
multiplication	division
pattern0	
this can be a major clock-cycle saver since multiplication is often much faster than a division operation

1169717
hash	md5
pattern4	
for a programming exercise i designed for myself and for use in a pretty non-secure systemd later on i m trying to compare md5 hash

1171155
virtual-functions	base-class	function-pointers	virtual-functions
pattern10	pattern8	
impossible to overrides functions properly .so calling them on the base-class invokes the one in the containers of the base without using function-pointers which is possibly more overhead than virtual-functions

1172381
filtering	sorting
pattern7	pattern0	
if your author field is selective and sorting is cheaper than filtering

1172984
windows-server	windows
pattern4	
i d recommend windows-server 2003 2008 or windows 7

1174754
display	height	display	width
pattern0	
if the player is moving towards one of the edges of the screens and bounds.x y + 30 is less than the height of the current map width it move the origin .so that the player is still centered and display on the map

1175483
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	opera
pattern4	
a 50-line form could kill internet-explorer and at the same time be very usable with opera or firefox

1175515
zipfile	archive
pattern4	
choose archive and selected your zipfile

1176623
itemscontrol	grid
pattern7	
several other questions on .so have come to the same conclusion i have -- using an itemscontrol with a datatemplate for each item construct to positioning items such that they resemble a grid is much simpler especially to format than using a listview

1177422
stateless	stateful
pattern10	pattern8	
do you have any situation where stateful is more appropriate than stateless

1177553
python	java
pattern0	
.so the standards c python is not necessarily slower than java or c#

1177721
contains	any	contains	elements
pattern4	
this line grabs any li elements contains a li with an active link

1177930
cassini	iis
pattern7	
cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation

1179563
fdt	swc
pattern4	
we building the majority of our flash project in this manner or sort of in reverse where we building the assets in flash professional output a swc of the graphics and use that swc in a better development-environment we prefer fdt

1179888
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
i have found that 64bit jvms have been slower than 32-bit versioning

1180186
value	field
pattern4	
add a conditional compare listname field you can compare value in the field in your case your approve column

1180441
groovy	java
pattern7	
groovy has slower runtime performance to java in most areas since it is a dynamic-languages

1180732
gridview	datalist
pattern7	
from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option

1181067
jquery	dojo	dojo	gwt
pattern7	
if i misunderstood you and you d rather stick with java gwt seems pretty cool -- it s the only real way to avoid explicit writing javascript if you do want to learn and use .some javascript i per.sonally am in love with dojo but jquery is substantially more popular those are two good popular frameworks you should consider though there are others of course like for all languages i mentioned .so far

1181468
python	c++
pattern10	pattern7	pattern0	
it s likely the c++ code is faster smaller than equivalent python

1184209
json	xml
pattern7	
xml is simply a poor fit for its most common application representing object hierarchies and json is a better fit

1184363
json	xml	xsd	xml	contains	elements
pattern7	
xml has better tooling in the form of xslt xsd integration into many languages vb.net s native xml say and linq-to-xml and it s more naturally open - it s easier to extends xml with a new elements without disrupting the old schema whereas a list in json contains unnamed items making functional collision more likely

1185123
haskell	sml
pattern4	pattern2	
i would probably recommend sml over haskell if you feel like trying on a functional language for the first time

1186109
dictionary	arrays
pattern7	pattern0	
updates i understand that programmatically one could put more than one item in the pasteboard using additems as kevin ballard points out or by setting the items properties to an arrays contains more than one dictionary

1186146
rollback	commit
pattern10	
if your connection stays open after your transactional you might want to issue a rollback or a commit but generally a rollback is less costly inorder for your next transactional to execute in a clean state

1186937
json	xml
pattern10	pattern0	
json is much more faster than xml

1188910
bugzilla	mantis
pattern8	
since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla .when it comes to features you could defined separate issues with custom field for your tasks

1190656
setinterval	settimeout
pattern7	
this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function .when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right

1191410
directory	folder
pattern0	
if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder

1191953
ethernet	lan
pattern0	
another interesting variation what if you have 64bit numbers 8 terabytes worth of data overall say on a bigtable or clone thereof and as many machines as you want each with about 4gb of ram on a pretty fast lan say one that s substantially better than gb ethernet -- how do you shard the problem under those conditional

1192000
subclassing	superclass
pattern7	
say all instances-variables are 32-bit int for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclassing adds 2 more then each instances of the subclassing will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for its own instances-variables plus 12 for the instances-variables of the superclass

1192983
javascript	dom
pattern10	
generally javascript is faster .when you search or alter the dom as little as possible

1194708
any	set
pattern4	
what you could also do is first see if the file is there and then if it is delete it of course this destroy any special file-permissions you had set on it

1194866
python	perl	opensolaris	freebsd
pattern0	
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64bit out of the box and part of default installation

1194937
maya	3ds
pattern8	
i m less familiar with maya but take a look at the 3ds max sdk id 7481355 to see what you can do

1197021
json	xml
pattern3	pattern0	
if you re storing the points in just an external javascript file then i would recommend using json format over xml as the xml parsing that google-maps uses is much slower than json

1197324
perl	tcl
pattern0	
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn

1197548
perl	ruby
pattern0	
yes i m hedging on the fact that i know perl way better than ruby but the approach would be the same

1197869
lwjgl	jogl
pattern7	
you are mixing libs and levels of libs jogl and lwjgl are both pretty thin wrapper around opengl iirc lwjgl has more wrapper for openal audio

1198433
metaphone	soundex
pattern2	
if you implements it yourself you should look into the metaphone or double metaphone algorithms i d recommend them over soundex which is not nearly as good at this types of task to store phoenetic representations of all your words

1199916
value	field
pattern0	
one problem is general is that field sometimes use delta if there are more than one value for the same field

1200232
png	gif
pattern7	pattern0	pattern10	
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time

1201136
functional-programming	imperative-programming
pattern10	
functional-programming is not more intuitive or easier to learn than imperative-programming

1201337
memmove	memcpy
pattern0	
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions

1204503
look-and-feel	swt
pattern10	
of particular interest is swt which has a more platform-native look-and-feel

1205435
executable	jar
pattern7	
there are programs around to create executable wrapper around this but a jar file is a simpler solution in terms of packaging - it s worth trying that to start with

1207519
maven-plugin	cobertura	cobertura	emma
pattern7	pattern7	
i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checked just that cobertura has a better maven-plugin and emma has a better eclipse-plugin in my opinion

1207958
32-bit	16-bit
pattern0	
assuming the 16-bit architecture could address sufficient amounts of memory to hold the runtime either in flash-memory or ram. 32-bit value could still be calculated albeit slower than 16-bit and requiring more operations using libs code

1208107
javascript	dom
pattern7	
this could potentially be a viable option - i still think the dom is the better way but this looks far superior to the standards javascript implementation of regex

1208256
emacs	vim
pattern3	
for someone just starting to program would you recommend using vim emacs or should you use some ide

1208808
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
pattern0	
even other ðž nâ² sorting algorithms such as insertion-sort tend to have better performance than bubble-sort

1210398
latex	tex
pattern0	
i find context approach to tex cleaner than latex but that might just be me

1212460
any	set
pattern7	pattern0	
having something which can switching modes at any time is considerably worse as your application now has to deal with more than one set of behavior too

1214032
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning

1216039
punctuation	words
pattern4	
for matching and # tags i d suggest using the w metapattern matches words characters - .so it ll match digits and letters but not whitespace punctuation

1216658
jquery	dojo
pattern7	
dojo has a steeper learning curve than jquery though

1217184
linux	bsd	emacs	vim
pattern10	
available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platform too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be install separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systemd

1217263
dfa	nfa
pattern0	
in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that

python	tcl
pattern4	
personally i d recommend tcl since it does regex very well and it s handling of unicode is for all intents and purposes completely transparency -- much better unicode support than python for example

1217990
tcl	lua
pattern2	
lua is also easy to integrated from what i ve heard though i personally don t see a compelling reason to choose it over tcl from a technical standpoint

1218116
any	set
pattern7	
in perl if you want to remove occurrences of any pattern of your above set that has less than 9 # d# s you can use the following

1218185
subtraction	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction
pattern7	
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base types and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid

1219364
.net	csla	.net	wcf	csla	wcf
pattern8	
if i want to use entity-framework or linq-to-sql over the .net i have to put something like wcf in between and that multiplies the work and complexity enormously to the points where i think it is much more verbose than csla

1219884
local-variables	class-members
pattern4	
another thing that may help is to prefer local-variables over globals or class-members

1223015
aquamacs	emacs
pattern4	
if you have a mac i would recommend aquamacs which is a beginner-friendly versioning of gnu-emacs and therefore has all the power of emacs while still offering standards copy-paste save and other features including normals file dialog and windows

1223031
beautifulsoup	lxml
pattern0	pattern0	
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it

1224826
plugins	add-on
pattern4	
i d compare plugins add-on

1224984
json	xml
pattern3	
i also use simplejson quite often because i prefer using json rather than xml

1228657
export	report
pattern4	
have you tried file- export- export report then choose report definition from the drop down and hit export button this will produce a text file listing all the elements in the report which you can load up in your favorite text-editor and search for whatever you want

1229412
height	frame
pattern0	
the contentsize height seems to be always equals or greater than the height of the scrollview frame but never smaller

1230116
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern10	
basically webforms give you less control more overhead and rapid development time while asp.net-mvc gives you more control less overhead and takes more time to develop

1230732
any	set	contains	elements	contains	any	contains	set
pattern0	
you can be more confident of the accuracy of the answer from this algorithm than of that from any single time servers because the intersection of several sets will likely contains fewer elements than any individual set

1230787
sql-server	mysql
pattern10	
or maybe the use of udf s on sql-server is more prevalent and the mysql engine s optimizer simply hasn t evolved as far yet

1231384
web-applications	gwt	desktop-application	web-applications
pattern7	
gwt makes it easier for gmail-type applications eg web-applications which mimic desktop-application functionality

1232044
profiling	trace
pattern10	
as you say the answer depends on what are your needs but if you need to use only one or two features only there is not points paying for all.for example if you are going to use only profiling it is less expensive to buy a tool that like redgate s dot trace

1232439
postback	ajax
pattern7	
the page postback methods or via ajax updatepanel has bigger overhead at the http-post especially the viewstate information which carries a lot more data that are not required

1233467
revision	svn
pattern0	
if you have it already setup and you are a primarily ms based network sharepoint makes a lot of sense and can handle revision control for the ms based documentation much better than svn

1233693
internet-explorer	firefox
pattern0	
internet-explorer doesn t use the mozilla engine .so it is considerably slower than firefox

1233693
google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	pattern0	
firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified versioning of webkit

1234863
core-animation	uikit
pattern0	
does opengl-es have a better performance than core-animation and uikit .when it comes to highly animated user interfaces

1235385
python	ruby
pattern0	
python - good language strategically a better choice than ruby although there are other aspects of ruby that can be argued to be superior

1236458
click	mouse
pattern10	pattern10	
maybe the hoverintent plugins can be made to work but i think just using the mouse click is a more elegant solution

1236714
callable-statement	jdbc
pattern3	
updates if you do decide to go forwarding with calling stored procedure via jdbc i would strongly recommend using callable-statement to invoke it

1236826
multiplying	subtract
pattern0	
if the parameter is greater than 0.5 multiplying lambda by two and subtract one this maps onto and return the interpolation color between color b and color c

1238849
google-chrome	firefox
pattern0	pattern10	
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is .so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie

1240253
any	set
pattern0	
you set a z-index that is higher than any other div in that spot

1240875
spaces	output
pattern7	
however if you restrict the search spaces to for example common passwd with length under n you might no longer have the irreversibility properties because the numbers of md5 output is much greater than the numbers of strings in the domain of interest

1241597
callback	methods
pattern0	
if you want to keep the returned string around longer than the methods that call your c# callback consider copying it into another location before freeing the returned memory

1242684
entity-framework	nhibernate
pattern8	
is the entity-framework more efficient than nhibernate .when used with visual-studio

1243200
derived-class	base-class
pattern10	
it seems to me that implements the interface on the base-class makes it less obvious that the derived-class implements the interface but then again required the interface to be specified for each derived-class

1245368
beautifulsoup	lxml
pattern4	pattern2	
ian bicking agrees and prefers lxml over beautifulsoup

1247476
average	median
pattern4	
i want to compare median to average for each grouping city

1247563
operators	keyword
pattern0	
the reason for this is that without the templates keyword the compiler assumes that bar is a value and you wish to invoke the less than operators on it

1247801
innodb	myisam
pattern7	
innodb supports better locking semantics .so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data-integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets

1247937
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern7	pattern0	
i can t feel that how asp.net-mvc is better than webforms

1248100
compatibility	platform	keydown	keyup
pattern0	
i finally figured out that keypress has a better compatibility than keydown or keyup on linux platform

1248671
value	field
pattern0	
.when you store more than one value in a field it s almost always some problems accessing the data

1250008
common-lisp	scheme	purely-functional	scheme
pattern10	
while common-lisp supports a functional-programming styles that is not its general focus scheme while not purely-functional is much closer

1250795
python	c++	python	java
pattern0	
c++ is as slow as python and 6 time slower than java

1250795
python	c++	python	java
pattern0	
.so for double c++ is actually half the speed of python and 20 time slower than the java .solution

1250937
ruby-on-rails	django	web2py	django
pattern10	pattern8	
and web2py is more lightweight than django ruby-on-rails whatever on pretty much all count

1251846
display	width
pattern0	
one column holds an image whose width makes the total width of the page wider than the display and the horizontal scrollbar show

1252126
seam	jsf
pattern10	
jsf is a web user-interface framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrated not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistent preferably ejb3

1253013
haskell	scala
pattern10	
i think the reason scala required the types annotations on the parameters of a newly defined function comes from the fact that scala uses a more local types-inference analysis than that used in haskell

1253366
seam	jsf
pattern7	
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above

1253883
lcov	gcov
pattern4	
i m unable to make any suggestions on this for windows but for linux project i highly recommend gcov and lcov

1254117
value	field
pattern7	
will selected all field from tablex where somevariables x and the weekdifference variables value is greater than or equals to the recurrencetemp variables value

1254482
vb.net	vba
pattern0	
personally i find c# vb.net much better languages than vba

1254650
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
why would 32-bit be faster than the 64bit for a development box and vice versa for servers

1254667
32-bit	64bit
pattern4	
however if you are using your main os to hosts viewmodels then you can probably benefit from a ton of memory for your various virtuals - and then you can choose 32-bit and 64bit viewmodels to suit your needs it is harder to have a 64bit guest viewmodel in a 32-bit hosts

1254692
32-bit	64bit
pattern4	
the only reason i can think of to choose 32-bit os is that you know that what you develop will work on 32-bit and 64bit machines

1254726
bash	zsh
pattern0	
how can you get similar highlightings to zsh s less than bash s less in ubuntu

1255104
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern7	
there are .some things that asp.net-mvc does better and .some things that webforms do better but if you don t know both technologies you can t choose the best one for the current project you are doing .so please don t do yourself a disservice - go and learn asp.net-mvc

1256757
contains	elements
pattern0	
i keep getting the error sequences contains more than one elements

1257020
json	xml
pattern2	
i prefer amf over xml or json

1257952
dictionary	map
pattern10	
though if you are going to eventually fill a substantial portion of the map the dictionary methods is much less efficient

1258708
strncpy	strcpy
pattern7	pattern0	
strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one types of bugs with another

1258971
strncpy	strcpy
pattern8	
my personal opinion is that it is vastly more useful than strncpy and strcpy

1260512
sorted	lookup
pattern10	
a balanced binary-tree also has o log n lookup performance however it is much faster to updates also around o log n while a sorted list is more like o n for updatess o log n to find the positioning for insert or the elements to delete but then up to n elementss must be move within the list and this is o n

1261275
required	checked
pattern0	
mac os x comes with one out of the box which required nothing more than checked a box in systemd preferences. setting up such a server for development would let you view the site at and might resolve this relative links problem

1261355
derived-class	base-class
pattern10	
the behavior of a derived-class is more specific than that of a base-class and covariance expresses one aspects of the difference

1262378
derived-class	base-class
pattern0	
still not pretty but might appeal to you a little more than putting derived-class named in the base-class

1263668
version-control	git
pattern4	
as others have mentioned a version-control systemd i prefer git but subversion will also work and some form of communication

1265217
960.gs	fluid
pattern4	
i prefer fluid versioning of 960.gs fluid 960 grid-system

1266067
perl	php
pattern4	
however what you could do is learn ajax - if you don t know it yet - and create a scripting php asp perl ssi etc. that count the files in the directory and printing the numbers - i recommend perl -

1267852
webrick	thin
pattern7	pattern0	
from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin

1269365
digits	zero
pattern4	
note that the regular expression d will match zero or more digits - this include the empty string since this is exactly zero digits

1269795
python	c++
pattern0	
surprisingly the c++ versioning runs significantly slower than the python versioning

1270393
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for login last i checked mysql didn t have these

1270393
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

1272572
cakephp	yii	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii
pattern4	
for php i would recommend yii cakephp or codeigniter .

1272691
ruby-on-rails	grails
pattern2	
in terms of development speed i would say that there is not much to choose between ruby-on-rails and grails as both allow similarly rapid development

1273705
tapestry	wicket
pattern10	
wicket s goal is to support static-typing to the fullest extent whereas tapestry is more about saving lines-of-code

1274226
development-environment	continuous-integration
pattern0	
continuous-integration is extremely helpful .when you have to integrated changes into a codebase from more than one development-environment and it s pretty tough to automate building .when you re tied to a gui

1274226
myeclipse	maven
pattern7	
from my initial research it looks like maven myeclipse integration is even worse

1274732
silverlight	wpf
pattern7	pattern0	
doing mvvm in silverlight is harder than in wpf but we ve done it

1275337
redmine	trac
pattern0	
we ve recently switched from trac to redmine where i work and i think i like it a little more than trac and use the wiki functionality almost everyday

1276413
fogbugz	trac
pattern4	
if you have the ability to spend money i d recommend fogbugz otherwise go with trac or the others recommended here

1276783
ruby-on-rails	django
pattern7	
ruby-on-rails fast flash-to-bang django s more than just crud is include wicket s designer-friendly templating.... listed on to see if they match what you want

1277646
redmine	trac
pattern0	
redmine was written to be a better trac than trac

1277773
oracle	mysql
pattern10	
third oracle s versioning of sql is much differnt from mysql and the administration of oracle databases is much more complex

1278273
firefox	opera
pattern0	
for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox

1278516
entity-framework	ado.net
pattern0	
the learning curve for linq-to-sql may be slightly less steep than for ado.net entity-framework

1279818
python	ruby
pattern10	
he also points out that python is faster than ruby

1279846
scala	java
pattern0	
scala uses jvm as a backend and thus is not going to be any faster than java - and if you use higher-level abstractions it will most likely be slower somewhat but probably in the same ballpark

1279909
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
pattern4	
for fulltext search compare sql-server vs lucene.net vs clucene vs mysql vs postgresql

1281097
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
pattern10	
running your application through an obfuscation makes reverse-engineering more difficult and costly

1283195
xdebug	xhprof
pattern0	
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generator callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server

1283886
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
the drawback is that a 64bit cpu with everything equals would consume more power than a 32-bit cpu just due to roughly twice the amount of circuitry needed

1285323
sql-server	mysql
pattern0	
you will likely get a lot more assistance with sql-server and access in the newsgroups and such than you would with mysql

1287034
richtextbox	textblock
pattern0	
good advice but in the end i decided a bindable textblock was more useful and simpler than a richtextbox

1287964
lighting	shading
pattern8	
this is just an overview of the most simple way to do this there are many more details that will make this look much better such as shading with a lighting source to get the bump appearance

1289760
postgresql	mysql	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
pattern4	
avoid the trouble now and pick sql-server there are free versioning - if you qualify for bizspark you can get powerful free versioning mysql or postgresql

1289978
python	c++
pattern4	
regarding the language if given the choice between c++ and python i would pick python 100 of the time

1289978
python	c++
pattern7	
even ignoring the obvious difference in abstraction between those languages python simply has more useful libs than c++

1291831
hashtable	set
pattern0	
words existence could be done with a trie or more simply with a set a hashtable

1293433
mta	sta
pattern0	
the single-threaded application model required that no single object live in more than one sta thread at a time verses the mta thread model

1293440
delphi	c++
pattern10	
doesn t mean that delphi or c++ is more powerful than .net since .net is gaining quickly on the gui application level

1293769
hash	md5
pattern7	pattern7	
the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid .so it doesn t help with storage

1293893
delphi	basic
pattern8	
i also made it clear that visual basic would be less powerful than delphi since delphi had much better database-aware components

1293916
stripes	jsf
pattern4	
but if you do decide on using a framework from my experience of having used stripes struts1 and jsf myfaces recommend stripes without hesitation

1295425
keyboard	mouse
pattern10	
i prefer the command-line because i have a shell window.open in the source anyway to run building and tests and along with file named completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me

1295977
celementtree	lxml
pattern2	
i have no recent experience as to how pyrxp today compares with lxml or celementtree

1296408
contains	any
pattern4	
to be clear it does not match any string that contains or

1298464
swing	swt
pattern0	
is swt faster than swing

1300518
ruby	php
pattern4	
i happen to know all three php java and ruby and have written many applications in all of them plus others but i drastically prefer ruby

1300633
python	ruby
pattern2	
i think you should choose between python or ruby

1301089
display	height
pattern0	
this will force the browser to display a scrollbar .when the contents of the inner table are larger than the height of the surrounding

1301132
credentials	account
pattern7	
the built-in network service user account has fewer access privileges on the systemd than the localsystemd user account but the network service user account is still able to interact throughout the network with the credentials of the computer account

1301328
textmate	nano	textwrangler	textmate	textwrangler	nano
pattern4	
open a good text-editor i d recommend textmate but the free textwrangler or vi or nano will do too and open

1302530
updating	updates
pattern4	
if you plan on doing massive updates i might hesitate to recommend updating all columns since it may cause fk lookup etc

1302592
phpmyadmin	heidisql
pattern4	pattern2	
since you re on windows i can highly recommend heidisql over phpmyadmin for working with mysql

1302906
value	field
pattern10	
storing the value in a field is the faster option

1303244
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
what all this means is that a 64bit computer can store and retrieve much more information than a 32-bit computer

1303517
any	set
pattern4	
in fact strictly speaking the statement pick any positive int is meaningless as it cannot be done although you as a person may believe you can do it you are actually picking from a bounded set - you are merely unconscious of the bounds

1303827
python	lua
pattern0	
python is a nice language but much bigger than lua and in the throes of a major revision transitions from 2.5 to 3.x

1303827
python	ruby	python	lua
pattern10	pattern8	pattern0	
ruby is less complex than python but more complex than lua

1303899
post-increment	pre-increment
pattern10	pattern8	
my workmate claims that for object types pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment

1304309
stax	sax
pattern0	
if .so you just need a streaming api such as stax or sax - stax will probably make this significantly easier than sax but it isn t built into java 1.4 .so you d need an extra dependency

1306118
execution	jobs
pattern0	
my problem is that using the thread pool and 4 threads is much slower than doing the jobs sequentially having one loops execute by a separate thread is much slower than execution it directly in the main thread sequentially

1306525
firefox	gecko
pattern0	
the gecko engine is used in more project than just firefox and since it s open source you could easily get the source code and try to throw it in an application

1307699
silverlight	wpf
pattern0	
from users perspective to view wpf browser application user will need total dot .net framework to be install that is considerably higher than silverlight runtime

1308259
digits	zero
pattern7	
using which sql operators can i checked that residue of division in decimal digits is greater then zero

1308725
digits	zero
pattern7	
digits is greater then zero

1309206
silverlight	wpf
pattern0	
winforms and wpf are easier than silverlight .when you have to access a database because you can do it directly

1309235
contains	elements
pattern0	
the first sequences contains more than one elements

1309433
glassfish	weblogic
pattern4	
if money was not part of the equation and i had an employer that insisted on spending money that wasn t mine i d still choose weblogic over websphere or jboss or glassfish or anything else on the market

1310098
sql-server-express	sql-server
pattern7	
checkout report service in sql-server-express with advanced service for key difference and editions and components of sql-server 2008 has more info

1310736
svn2git	git-svn
pattern3	
a simple git-svn will reproduce the svn branches actually simple directory with copies in it .so i would recommend using svn2git and git2svn

1311516
tcp-ip	udp
pattern4	
network cards and router have a tendency to prefer tcp-ip package above udp

1311580
elementtree	lxml
pattern10	
elementtree is include in the standard-library but lxml is faster

1311603
packets	lan
pattern4	
you ve already said the network is private lan which eliminates one of my suggestions the other is to make sure the network is switched - a hub could easily lose packets

1311750
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

1311789
python	php
pattern0	
edit i guess to help clear up some of the confusion in the comments below i get the intuition that php would be better than python at organizing the front-end presentation part of a website while python would excel at the back-end part the actual programming...

1311828
python	php
pattern7	pattern0	
that said python is much easier than php

1311828
python	php
pattern10	
if you want php nothing is more php than php itself and python takes different approaches .so maybe you re going to be frustrated because things are not like you re used to

1311980
python	php
pattern4	
you can t easily compare php and python

1312826
for-loop	loops
pattern7	
getimagedata has a for-loop i realised that each index in loops is called more than once

1314971
scala	java
pattern2	
scala can compete directly with java and give it a run for its money on almost all aspects

1315014
windows-server	windows-xp
pattern0	
these above restrictions do not apply to windows-server 2008 windows-server 2003 or to versioning of the operating systemd earlier than windows-xp with sp2

1315942
conditional	operators
pattern4	
if a race conditional occurs calling ++i then internal operations of the ++ operators will look something like -

1316464
postgresql	mysql
pattern3	
otherwise i recommend using postgresql over mysql since it is more standards compliant and has a nicer license

1316538
any	set
pattern0	
these two step together are likely to take less work than any solution that relies on the nested set representation

1316580
ubuntu	debian
pattern0	
ubuntu heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than debian

1318279
contains	any
pattern4	
i want to match any string that does not contains the string dontmatchthis

1318324
innodb	myisam
pattern0	
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb

1318982
scala	java
pattern4	
php will probably win as apache and php seems to be lower on memory usage than java but i can t really compare scala and php

1320978
erlang	ocaml
pattern2	
ocaml is a great language -- one of my favorites -- but if your interest is distribute systemd than i d recommend going with erlang which is head and shoulders ahead of the other fp languages with regards to distribute systemd although there s an offshoot of ocaml called jocaml which has some interesting aspects

1322391
python	c++	python	java
pattern3	
since you re familiar with c++ java and python i would recommend using c++ java or python

1322771
momentjs	datejs
pattern7	
nowadays datejs is outdated and not maintained .so use momentjs which is much better as pointed out by t.j

1324674
hash	md5
pattern0	
if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for int primary key

1324720
firefox	safari	.when	ready
pattern7	
moving the stylesheet below all javascript indeed show that the javascript including the ready function runs much earlier but even then the jquery-applied class --which is yet unknown .when the javascript runs-- is used correctly in my quick tests in safari and firefox

1324815
declarative-services	eclipse-rcp	declarative-services	spring-dm
pattern4	
i m assuming you re doing eclipse-rcp because otherwise i d recommend spring-dm or ipojo guice with peaberry or declarative-services ...

1325364
updating	updates
pattern8	
i wouldn t be worried about the perf overhead of keeping a separate recording of this - it only has to be updates .when users are printing and printing will definitely be more expensive than updating a file

1325420
unsigned	short
pattern0	
if you really want all 8 bytes in a single numbers then you need to read more than the unsigned short

1325446
ruby-on-rails	django
pattern7	
compared to django and ruby-on-rails it s way easier to learn and get going

1329529
sniffing	traffic
pattern7	
crackers will crack by sniffing the traffic between your .app and the dongle and either disabling any code that tests for dongle presence or writing code to emulate the dongle by replaying recorded traffic whichever looks easier

arrays	map
pattern10	
the php arrays types is actually more akin to an an order map than a traditional c arrays

1330951
json	xml
pattern7	pattern0	
also json has a smaller footprint than xml and is also usually better human parseable

1331150
base-class	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	base-class
pattern10	
since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherited a base-class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept

1331920
python	tcl
pattern4	
for the latter approach i suggest using expect if you are proficient with tcl or pyexpect if you prefer python

1331946
postgresql	firebird
pattern2	
i am trying to choose between postgresql and firebird databasses

1332466
dijkstra	a-star
pattern2	
my question is how does a-star compare with dijkstra

1335774
postgresql	firebird
pattern10	pattern8	
but in stored-procedures firebird is much more powerful than postgresql

1335774
postgresql	firebird
pattern0	pattern0	pattern0	
postgresql do not say that is worse than firebird firebird is not that much better than postgresql

1338597
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

1338980
ruby	php
pattern3	
for starters i usually recommend trying ruby or php

1339607
postgresql	firebird
pattern8	
a friend runs an entire shipping company with millions of transactional on postgresql with linux servers java and he is very happy.but the maintenance is more heavy than firebird

1340207
mstest	nunit
pattern0	
if you have a full versioning of visual-studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrated the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruisecontrol.net also supports mstest

1340757
alignment	layout
pattern0	pattern0	
there s something better than alignment layout

1341537
postgresql	firebird
pattern7	pattern0	
firebird is smaller and easer than postgresql but it s also very good in performance stability and low mantenaince

1344869
pylons	django
pattern0	
pylons is not that much simpler than django and it doesn t seem to have the same community

1345134
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
64bit apps will not always run faster than 32-bit

1345810
scala	java
pattern7	
scala code can easily call directly into java code but sometimes calling scala code from java code is trickier since the translation from scala into bytecode is not quite as straightforward as for java

1346820
emacs	vim
pattern4	
a numbers of people at the company i currently intern at prefer emacs or vim

1347625
perforce	cvs
pattern4	
it s probably easier to learn from scratch than cvs but i don t have experience that way. if someone needed a centralized source-control systemd i would recommend perforce as long as they had the resources to license it

1348077
addition	division	addition	modulo	division	modulo
pattern0	
performing addition on this slightly larger types will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the types itself

1348077
32-bit	64bit	addition	division	addition	modulo	division	modulo
pattern10	pattern10	
for example on most 32-bit systemd 64bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

1348958
double	int
pattern7	
the range of double is much wider than the range of int or long

1349295
any	set
pattern4	
my goal is to accept a set of these and generator a query that returns any rows that match any single inclusion filtering without matching any single exclusion filtering

1350591
json	xml
pattern10	
in this regard json is far more lightweight then xml

1352052
xlsx	xls
pattern10	
spreadsheetgear for .net reads and writes csv xls xlsx and does more

1352070
xlsx	xls
pattern10	
spreadsheetgear for .net reads and writes csv xls xlsx and does more

1352527
perl	php
pattern10	
write it in perl it is faster and uses less resources than php

1352556
contains	any	concat	where
pattern4	
in any case where the value you re trying to match contains both single and double-quotes you can construct an expression that uses concat to produce the text that it s going to match

1354946
hide	show
pattern0	
.when scrolltop is less than 300 show the div otherwise hide it

1355229
any	set
pattern4	
is a negative set that matches any character that is not in the set

1355686
python	ruby	python	java
pattern0	
there s a feeling of i could spend time and plot all this out in uml...or i could just write some python that actually implements the design and expresses it in a language i like to read and lots of people can read. java programs tend to feel heavier than their ruby or python counterparts â it s part of the design of the language

1355937
output	mode
pattern0	
there is as well ack-grep mode for emacs which use the ack-grep tool which is specifically designed for grepping programming languages and imho looks nicer than the output of m-x grep

1359270
innodb	myisam
pattern0	
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam

1360095
linux	osx
pattern0	
note that while mac osx uses a different methods for it s prng and therefore does not block my personal benchmarking done in college have show it to be every-so-slightly less random than the linux kernel

1360336
32-bit	64bit
pattern4	
suppose i ask the user do you want to run in 32-bit mode or 64bit mode and they pick 32-bit

1360435
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
pattern8	
ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox .when it comes to javascript - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with javascript turned on

1361961
rollback	commit
pattern10	
an explicit rollback is probably more appropriate .when you encounter a conditional that is not causing an exception-handling but you still don t want to commit

1362851
llvm	gcc
pattern4	
i recommend llvm and gcc with binutils neither produce great code but they are multi platform and multi target and both have optimizers

1362890
contains	elements
pattern4	
basically i don t want to compare elements but elements that thy contains

1363067
execute	prepare
pattern10	
any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsing optimized compiled and then execute

1363597
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern3	
if you are familiar with php i d recommend using asp.net-mvc over webforms but from the sound of what you are saying you ve already started down the road of webforms

1365849
textmate	gedit
pattern0	
i tried a few ides on ubuntu and it just didn t seem right - gedit is lightweight and i actually enjoy using it more than textmate on os x

1366541
carbon	cocoa
pattern7	
a cocoa .app is much easier than writing and reading a carbon .app

1366668
constructor	object
pattern0	
if there is more than one constructor then you d have to checked some external state of the returned object

1367364
firebird	mysql
pattern0	
i agree that firebird can be better than sqlite and m sql express or even is better than mysql scale better with the numbers of cpus and is more mature triggers and transactional are implements for many many lighting years ago

1367509
perl	awk
pattern4	
awk is the tool of choice for column-based data some prefer perl but not me

1368849
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
i haven t chosen a db yet .so if mysql or postgresql is better in .some way over the other please provide your preferences and perhaps why if you have time

1368882
glib	gtk
pattern10	
python binding to gobject and glib provide an application framework not bound to guser-interface or anything-- however if it should be bound to a user-interface gtk comes closer

1369547
oracle	mysql
pattern7	pattern0	
oracle also incorporates more features than mysql

1370993
perl	c++
pattern4	
this article compares perl and lisp macros but the points is still the same text level macros perl c++ cause massive problems compared to source level macros lisp

1371224
digits	zero
pattern0	
this will validation that it is any numbers of digits with at least one 1-9 .so greater than zero

1371569
sql-server	postgresql
pattern0	
sql-server will perform better than postgresql for most actions and about the same as db2

1371569
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
pattern0	pattern0	
other databases where it was about the same for a transactional database as oracle sql-server where were better than mysql postgresql etc

1371975
processor	cpu
pattern7	
the cpu is indeed slower on sparc 1.2ghz and as answered by one of the sun s engineers t2 is usualy 3 time slower for single-threaded application than modern intel processor

1372564
bazaar	git
pattern0	
a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial

1373091
forms-authentication	session-timeout
pattern0	
the problem is that even if the session-timeout is set to be longer than the forms-authentication timeout i ve noticed that sometimes the current session is reset ie session null

1373566
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	pattern10	
some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.

1373625
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb

1373656
entity-framework	nhibernate
pattern4	
community has been a big reason that i ve liked using out of house project - either the microsoft ecosystem if you choose entity-framework or the very vibrant open source community around project like nhibernate

1373976
display	width
pattern7	
but in both cases even if i put controls in a table and set the width of the table and columns to 600px if i put say 1000 characters in the textarea on page one on page 2 the display control is far wider than the 600 pixels i want to limit it to

1374448
httplistener	http.sys
pattern8	
and also don t forget - http.sys much more customizable than httplistener

1374694
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
and postgresql has fewer experienced administration than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

1376790
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
pattern4	
none of these are quite as short as the perl solution already posted but they certainly seem to beat python and ruby

1378028
entity-framework	nhibernate
pattern2	
if .net 4.0 choose between nhibernate or entity-framework

1378686
gethashcode	equals
pattern2	
if two object compare as equals the gethashcode methods for each object must return the same value

1378686
gethashcode	equals
pattern2	
however if two object do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different value

1378796
gethashcode	equals
pattern2	
if two object compare as equals the gethashcode methods for each object must return the same value

1379436
instrumentation	profiling
pattern8	
personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time .when it matters

1380783
sql-server	mysql
pattern10	
i usually work in mysql and i understand ms sql-server is better at grouping queries

1382636
mips	x86	any	set
pattern0	
do any of the other common architectures like arm mips sparc etc have an easier than x86 instruction set

1382869
height	frame
pattern0	
consider setting split-height-threshold to a larger value than the frame height

1383835
printf	strcat
pattern10	
.so here strcat is faster by far your milage may vary depending on compiler and options despite the inherent inefficiency of the cstring conventions and supports my original suggestion that printf carries a lot of baggage not required for this purpose

1384623
jfreechart	swing
pattern0	
a sample code for swing is available here if you don t need anything fancy or special it may be easier than jfreechart because of the direct available documentation

1384736
python	c++	python	java
pattern0	
with explicit carefully crafted architecture python is surely no worse than java c# or c++ at handling such scenarios in my working experience at least

1385956
expression	evaluation
pattern0	
if you really wanted to rename the variables and parameter named you would probably want to try and building a process that just parsing the code files to do a text replacement with regular expression or basic string manipulation depending on what you know bearing in mind it would be a once only change this would probably be quicker than evaluation code refactoring tools

1386038
first-class-functions	lambda
pattern4	
first-class-functions functional match lambda libs

1386739
json	xml
pattern7	
json is actually faster to load and write than standards xml

1390035
subprocess	pexpect
pattern3	
to avoid the many problems that can always arise with buffering for tasks such as getting the subprocess s output to the main process in real time i always recommend using pexpect for all non-windows platform wexpect on windows instead of subprocess .when such tasks are desired

1390404
associations	model
pattern7	
with this in your soldier model i m assuming there is an associations that contains more email addresses you want to use

1390522
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern10	
now that asp.net-mvc exists i d say webforms is more about letting non-web devs do web

1392877
post-increment	pre-increment
pattern7	
al.so semantics using pre-increment is usually clearer in showing the intention of a test .when the return-value is used .so its better to use it habitually than post-increment to avoid accidentally testing the old value

1393220
reflection	runtime
pattern10	
reflection is much more general and enables you to inspect types information at runtime and manipulate object without knowing their types at compile-time

1393693
perl	awk
pattern0	
i do think you might be better off with perl and its unpack feature but awk can handle it too albeit verbosely

1397081
subtraction	addition
pattern10	
re-order your scripting .so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again

1397304
background-image	transparency
pattern0	
yes that s possible by adding the top circle with a transparency edges in a div that has the bigger circle as background-image if needed also transparency

1398301
union-all	union
pattern0	
a union-all will normally perform better than a union as a union is a set operation and will remove duplicates by default as will minus and intersect

1400465
double	int
pattern10	
i am guessing this is because modifying a double is a more complex operation than modifying an int

1400615
python	perl	python	java
pattern0	
an even easier option although not as efficient is to use pig streaming to pass your data through a scripting i find whipping up a quick perl or python scripting to be faster than implements java classes for one-off jobs

1401029
show	next
pattern10	
now the problem that i am facing is that the process of the data which is to be show is taking more than 3 seconds .so what i have done is that before the .app starts to process data for the next updates the refresh qtimer is stopped and after the data is process i again restart the qtimer.the .app should work in such a way that after an updates refresh during this refresh the .app goes unresponsive the user should get ample time to continue to work on the .app apart from seeing the data being updatesd.i am able to get acceptable pauses for the user to work-- in one scenario

1401833
radio-button	checkbox
pattern0	
you need to have more than one radio-button for it to be meaningful otherwise it would just be a checkbox

1402160
revision	svn
pattern4	
the easiest way i have been able to restore files and not lose revision history is using svn copy the merge example above to me seems like a more complex way to achieve the same thing

1402495
web-config	app-config
pattern4	
why do people recommend app-config or web-config

1402517
sql-server	oracle
pattern4	pattern2	
i prefer sql-server over oracle but i have one legacy oracle systemd to manage and i am finding myself climbing an uphill battle against the numerous errors oracle throw at you on a minute by minute basis

1402558
double-quotes	single-quotes
pattern10	
the answer is simple if you want to printing for example html code in which naturally there are a lot of double-quotes wrapping the string in single-quotes is much more readable

1404365
zero	nan
pattern0	
here the lower confidence interval for between run cv is less than zero .so reported as nan

1404403
python	java
pattern4	
you would pick mono and perhaps c# for cross platform development for the same reason that someone would pick java or python

1404965
vba	vb6
pattern0	
all the .net methods i tried were slower than vba and vb6 but the best ones were able to use the xll interface which gave better results than the automation interface

1405867
callback	methods
pattern4	
using the built-in sort methods with its compare callback takes nearly forever like many minutes

1408183
dfa	nfa
pattern0	
if it can be practically determinized this give you a dfa that can be exponentially larger than the nfa then by all means do that

1408916
graphviz	doxygen
pattern0	
it s almost certainly overkill but you can do this for c++ php java c# and more with doxygen if you have graphviz dot install

1410343
carbon	cocoa
pattern7	pattern0	
besides i tell you from experience that cocoa is much easier than carbon

1411229
deep-copy	object
pattern0	
problem is pickle+unpickle can be faster in the c implementation because it s less general than deep-copy many object can be deepcopied but not pickled

1411363
native-code	porting
pattern7	
if the native-code is just pure numeric code porting it is probably easier than testing it under an android-emulator

1412419
url-encoding	url
pattern2	
note that this required that you url encode the characters but i prefer that over url-encoding the + and characters from the standards base64 alphabet

1413234
python	php
pattern4	
i know you said you prefer php and python but you also said you are willing to explore other solutions

1413550
python	c++
pattern10	
programming in python is far more fun than c++

1413738
margins	padding
pattern10	
with inherited the background-image would be copy-paste to each elements and displaced by margins padding etc has a more obvious effect with background-images

1414531
upgrade	migrate
pattern4	
vss sucks migrate to a real scm microsoft will probably help you seamlessly upgrade to tfs which doesn t have this problem

1415173
bubble-sort	quicksort
pattern0	
at the moment i use quicksort but the funny thing is that this is almost no faster than bubble-sort

1415178
insertion-sort	quicksort
pattern4	
for a very small set insertion-sort can usually beat quicksort because it has very low overhead

1416548
textmate	komodo	radrails	textmate
pattern8	
you might want to try komodo edit which is more inline with textmate than say a full blown ide like aptana radrails

1416700
text-editor	editor
pattern10	
you can open the file in a hex editor which is a text-editor that is more sensitive to binary-data

1418229
quicksort	mergesort
pattern4	
be aware of the real-world impact of the so-called hidden constants too - for instances the classic quicksort algorithm is o n 2 in the worst case and o n log n on average whereas mergesort is o n log n in the worst case but quicksort will outperform mergesort in practice

1418301
python	c++
pattern2	
i m not terribly picky about language but i would prefer something with c++ or python

1418642
shell	bash
pattern10	
they changed this a couple of release ago for performance reasons - most people don t need full bash functionality for shell scripting and this limited shell is much faster at startup

1419062
python	java
pattern8	
in this respect it is no more dangerous than java python or any other language

1420026
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
pattern7	pattern8	pattern7	pattern8	
mysql is obviously cheaper and you can go far on mysql but there is no question that oracle which i m more familiar with than sql-server has a better optimizer is more capable and is more robust than mysql

1422299
textmate	macvim
pattern4	
i would recommend textmate as above and also macvim if possible

1422559
contains	any
pattern4	
the second grouping is split into the first part or the url assumed to contains any character other than then match any numbers of groupinging of followed by a non-digit followed by anything other than

1424374
python	perl
pattern7	
in theory i can wrap it with either perl or python whichever is easier to get this behavior but then i d need to shell out anyway to map the drive

1426259
javafx	swing
pattern4	pattern2	
you should compare javafx with swing

1427158
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
pattern0	
sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey

1428092
assignment-operator	comma-operator
pattern0	pattern7	
the parentheses on the other hand are important since the assignment-operator bind stronger than the comma-operator it has higher precedence and would get evaluated before the comma-operator without the parentheses

1428977
input-field	textbox
pattern7	
you could always populate a disabled textbox to hold the named of the picture - it won t populate the browse input-field but is better than nothing

1429624
radio	click
pattern0	
my older versioning with radio button only works fine as you could test here click

1430939
emacs	vim
pattern7	pattern0	
cut and paste in vim takes more step than in emacs iirc

1431444
hashtable	set	hashtable	sorted	hash-collision	key
pattern0	
hashtable do have an even larger advantage over sorted tree .when the key comparison is expensive as with strings because for large sets fewer items will have a hash-collision than a search tree is deep and because it s possible to caching the hashcode for key already in the set skipping the expensive comparison for probably all but the matching result

1432334
python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
pattern10	pattern10	
there probably aren t as many jobs in python and ruby c++ is harder for a beginner but it s stuff you need to know eventually c# java hide you from that hard stuff to begin with but like i said you ll need to learn it eventually

1433315
emacs	vim
pattern4	
even though i use emacs all day every day and love it unless you intend to spend a lot of time in the program you choose i would pick vim

1434214
conditional	operators
pattern2	
also any intermediate value generator using the assignment-operators have a .post conditional that they compare equals with operators and-operators is transitive for iterator

1436154
udp	mtu
pattern0	
they are easily generator for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu

1436197
udp	mtu
pattern0	
if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmentation

1438870
digits	zero
pattern0	
if more than four digits leading zero are prohibited and 0000 is prohibited

1439284
googletest	gmock
pattern4	
i personally recommend googletest and gmock

1440679
er-diagram	diagram
pattern0	
er-diagram are simpler than uml diagram

1441389
erlang	scala
pattern0	
now getting back to erlang scala scala has actors and message-passing as well and is based on the jvm .so it might be a better alternative than erlang given your constraints

1442201
web2py	django	turbogears	django	turbogears	web2py
pattern0	
web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears

1442901
udp	tcp
pattern10	pattern8	
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance .so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

1443062
http	ssl
pattern0	
if i try to add more than 1 ssl binding i get the error at least one other site is using the same http binding and the binding is configure with a different certificate ...

1444213
dom4j	jdom
pattern4	
i prefer dom4j personally but i don t mind other apis such as jdom or even xpp3 which has xpath support

1444549
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
pattern10	
as others have said illegalargumentexception is an option but i think nullpointerexception is more communicative

1444691
reflection	runtime
pattern0	pattern0	
this is a better oo approach leads to less coupling and will certainly perform better than runtime reflection

1445294
double	int
pattern4	
i guess the question is then why does the compiler choose int instead of double in the first example

1447805
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
running pear -v gives me versioning 1.7.2 .when i run pear upgrade pear it says my versioning is newer than the current noe which is 1.9.0 if ran pear upgrade -f pear to force an upgrade it downloading the files and install successfully but i still have versioning 1.7.2 and cannot install phpunit

1447864
decimal	hex
pattern10	
even with i conversion as the hex 0x is a longer sequences than the decimal 0 .

1448859
rapidxml	pugixml
pattern0	
quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parsing i know of he had tested against versioning 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently versioning 0.42

1449115
entity-framework	ado.net	stored-procedures	ado.net
pattern0	
it may perform slower than raw ado.net call but you will greatly minimize coding and you can use stored-procedures in l2s and entity-framework and they both can work well under stress

1450141
perl	awk	python	perl
pattern7	
as mjv surmised - awk or perl or python is a better choice

1451062
firefox	opera
pattern7	
the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on firefox and works even worse on opera

1451203
json	xml
pattern0	
the binary-serialization protocols is much stricter than any xml json or other text format meaning it is easier and faster to parsing

1453066
scala	java
pattern10	
the only difference is that scala is more productive it produces more bytecode per line of code than java does

1454113
groovy	java
pattern7	
i have a co-worker that started grails withouth groovy knowledge and learnt his way into the language but he still wrote far less efficient and bloated grails code just by falling back to java since learning groovy is more than learning syntax

1454199
value	field
pattern10	
long time back in past i had read somewhere that if we want to enter data in image typesd field of table whose value is more then 8kb then we must explicit specify parameter types to sqlimage

1456421
contains	any	enumerator	any
pattern4	
alternatively you could write an implementation to compare any two nodes and return whether or not they re the same - and then pass that into the call to the appropriate overload of the contains extension methods defined in enumerator assuming you re using .net 3.5

1456719
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl	python	java
pattern8	
in terms of productivity there is a level .when terseness can help python and ruby are considered more productive than java c# because they are more terse and then there is a level where terseness makes the code very hard to read apl is famo.us for that as well as short perl scripting

1458417
digits	zero	digits	base	base	zero
pattern0	pattern0	
that this can validly be done and that it always works is probably due to the fact that the digits base 100 in this case aren t real digits and can legitimately assume value both greater than their base over 100 and even less than zero

1458479
.net	wcf
pattern0	
adding soap headers is one of those things that got more convoluted with wcf compared to the previous add web service reference in visual-studio .net 2003 2005 and creating a soap extension

1458750
jvisualvm	jstat
pattern10	
the tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliable

1459923
salt	md5
pattern8	
decode the passwd yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5

1460620
solaris	linux
pattern7	
if its linux solaris and has more than 2gb memory and more than 2 processor

1461316
one-to-many	entity
pattern0	
if you properties are really properties that is they have the lifecycle of owner entity and can t belong to more than one entity at once consider splitting them into two tables one for images and one for collections and using one-to-many associations

1461509
display	width
pattern0	
is there a similar properties with which we could specify whether horizontal scrollbar should be provided .when the width of an elements is greater than the width of a viewport ie display area

1462196
loading	png
pattern4	
compare loading a standards png and then compression it to the time it takes to load a dds file

1462502
pixels	line
pattern0	
perhaps finding the connected-components then removing components with less than x pixels empirically determined followed by dilation along horizontal vertical line to reconnect the gaps within the rectangle

1464230
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
perhaps 128bit distributed-systemd internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a systemd call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit

1464476
malloc	free
pattern7	
most likely malloc allocates more memory and puts so-called guard value that happen to contains null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by free later and this metadata happens to contains a null byte right at that positioning

1465066
richfaces	icefaces
pattern7	
richfaces looks more good option to work than icefaces bcoz it has inbuilt support its easy to learn its long time support guarantee for seam+richfaces combinations

1466039
contains	elements
pattern0	
there could be more than one elements contains directly withing a single e.g

1467029
filtering	sorting
pattern8	
this may be optimal indeed if the table access to retrieve the value missing in the index is more expensive than filtering and sorting

1467079
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	pattern0	
if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql

1467948
expression	evaluation
pattern7	pattern7	
the basic principles is that expression evaluation is easier for a computer using a stack and reverse polish notation .so the algorithm converts a in-fix notation expression with as.sociated order of precedence and parentheses to rpn and then evaluates it by popping operands performing operations and pushing results until there are no operations left and one value left on stack

1468092
eventlet	twisted
pattern7	
admittedly eventlet is slightly magic but i find it has a much easier learning curve than twisted and results in more straightforward code because you don t have to turn your logic inside out to fit the framework

1468754
show	next
pattern10	
timing tests show this runs 5-20x faster than the original scripting and the time is more predictable from one run to the next

1468941
xunit.net	fsunit
pattern0	
i d rather use fsunit or fstest to write tests in f# it feels more natural than oo xunit.net styles tests

1468983
cxxtest	cppunit
pattern4	
i prefer cxxtest as i find it easier not to have to register my test cases explicit as you have to do with cppunit

1469525
python	c++
pattern0	
line-of-code-based measurements are a little fuzzy but it s not clearly longer than the python versioning or the c or c++ versioninging and it is clearly faster.

1469813
lighttpd	apache
pattern4	
i don t have thorough benchmarking but i m personally convinced that just like lighttpd can outperform apache on simpler tasks mod_wsgi gives apache the laurel .when it comes to serving python web apps

1470836
firefox	safari
pattern4	
unfortunately unless you re happy with supporting only specific browsers ie7 win safari firefox 3.5 there s no pure css solution to your problem

1471102
ruby	php
pattern4	
another blog here compares ruby and php

1471556
contains	any
pattern4	
your statement matches any string that contains a letter or digits anywhere even if it contains other non-alphanumeric characters

1473284
scala	java
pattern8	
i don t think it is quite as functional as scala clojure but it s certainly a lot more functional than java

1473677
scala	java
pattern10	
scala s tying to java feels more limiting than clojure s integration between scala s and java s static type-systems

1474413
shell	bash
pattern4	
i wouldn t worry too much about the shell since operating as root isn t usual behavior for most administration - .so you can pick bash or ksh

1474826
sftp	ftp
pattern4	
i prefer sftp to ftp

1475458
endpoint	uri
pattern0	
to my knowledge and i have been doing extensive work with wcf in the last month you can not shared the same exact uri for more than one endpoint

1477008
pascal	delphi
pattern10	
while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and .so the underscore.js look a bit strange as you don t expect them there

1477152
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern8	pattern0	
about writing more maintainable software with webforms from my experience implements a presentation pattern like mvp in webforms to respect srp increase maintainability enable unit-testing etc is a lot more work than using asp.net-mvc out of the box and you get the same results

1477733
python	c++
pattern7	
python is much easier to use than c++ for something like this

1477841
web2py	django
pattern10	
to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py

1478081
python	perl
pattern0	pattern0	
easier with perl python or powershell

1478368
perl	awk
pattern7	pattern0	
i m going to argue perl is a better choice than awk here

1478540
webserver	upload
pattern7	
at this points you have other things to care about that are well beyond the scoping of a progress-bar such as dealing with large file upload in-process of your webserver out-of-process is much less detrimental to your server.

1478633
folder	dir
pattern4	
iterate over every file in the client javascript folder that match dir cmd and for f are totally unneeded here though and only complicate things especially .when file named contains spaces comma and the like

1479411
python	perl
pattern2	
i would recommend going with python or perl if you swing that way

1479968
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
i closed out that .post saying that a 64bit computer can store and retrieve much more information than a 32-bit computer

1479986
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
64bit allows you to use more memory than a 32-bit .app

1480214
declarative	imperative
pattern7	
while neither the declarative nor imperative approach is really better than the other both have their merits

1480570
contains	any
pattern4	
in java s regular expression i want to match any sequences that containss the words mary and the words are in that order but does not contains bob in between mary and are

1480653
average	median
pattern10	
if there may be significant systematic difference between different the dataset then taking their average is probably better as taking the median reduces the effect of outliers

1481132
scheme	prolog
pattern10	
in scheme or prolog it s often less than a page of code

1481174
double	int
pattern2	
because 1.0 has types double and compiler really doesn t know what types to choose between int and float .so it asks you to give it a hint

1481835
contains	any
pattern4	
that will match any two letter sequences in parentheses that my contains more two letter sequencess separeted by hypens

1482207
touchesmoved	gestures
pattern10	
.when a gestures is faster however the x y touchesmoved events will be farther apart and you ll lose the gestures .when one x y points is far enough away from the last one that it is outside of the tile already

1482294
python	java
pattern10	pattern8	
java is less dynamic than python and more effort has been put into its viewmodel making it a faster language

1482440
python	java
pattern0	
with python you ll probably develop faster and with java will definitely run faster

1482440
python	java
pattern0	
in reply to comment how can java be faster than python

1482440
python	java
pattern0	pattern4	
.so the speeds range from python being 2x slower than java to 174x slower python generally beats java in code-size and memory usage though

1482440
python	java
pattern0	
another interesting points here--tests that allocated a lot of memory java actually performed significantly better than python in memory size as well

1485049
linux	osx
pattern0	
however i don t find windows development on mono .so much better than linux and or osx

1485783
debugging	trace
pattern7	
.when debugging it s often easier if you get the exception-handling as early as possible instead of trying to trace back where a faulty value comes from

1486780
entity-framework	ado.net
pattern10	pattern8	
i don t know why you think ado.net is more consistent than entity-framework

1487060
any	set
pattern8	
in the long run that will be the cheapest because paying someone to learn a new set of tools will be much more expensive than any other costs that might be associated wit ha particular set of software

1487773
mstest	nunit
pattern4	
mstest comparisons and the developer community seems to pretty much overwhelmingly choose nunit

1489101
any	set
pattern4	
just be careful of the settings you use and how you set up your data because it is very easy to lose any benefits of parallelization by the intermediate loads and saves the package makes

1490225
getter	setter
pattern3	
do you recommend using getter and setter or accessing the member variables directly

1491004
python	perl
pattern0	
the percentage of people using perl who do quick and dirty hacks with bad styles and worse code quality is probably higher than say python

1497705
getter	setter
pattern8	
what you ll need to do than is to complete the javadoc comments for the classes and methods that are more sophisticated than getter setter or default constructor

1498176
python	c++
pattern0	
for .some operations you may see that it is 1000 time slower than c++ .so yes you should investigate into this and do necessary benchmarking before you make time-critical algorithms in python

1499365
python	php	python	java
pattern4	
i d prefer python don t know java or php use macosx and firefox

1500250
perl	php
pattern0	
i am a perl newbie but i like it better than php

1500999
credentials	security
pattern0	
as a note for all readers informed or otherwise i just bought an 800 page 2008 copyright book on the subject from a major - in the preface the author does a hey wait a minute .. in which it is noted in detail that more than one security professional with heavy credentials and field experience had been ahem rendering moot .

1506844
scala	java
pattern10	pattern10	
regarding interop w java scala is closer to java but i m sure both languages interoperate well

1506844
scala	java
pattern10	
scala is more likely to be the next java while it s hard to imagine that lisp will finally take off after not doing .so for over 50 years

1507042
configuration	logging
pattern0	
this gives you or someone coming later finer control over logging levels etc via the logging configuration

1507175
python	php
pattern0	
typical performance of python scripting are about 5 time faster than php

1507704
json	xml
pattern0	
xml which can be done simply with xmlserializer or datacontractserializer but that offers much less control over the xml or json json.net etc

1510186
sieve-of-eratosthenes	time-complexity
pattern7	
note that the sieve-of-eratosthenes has much better run time-complexity than trial division should run much faster for bigger num value .when properly implements

1510226
communication	messages
pattern10	
some kind of http communication is more likely to work out and if you have structured or complex data to send over xml would make sense as a messages format

1510284
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
much longer than 32-bit or 64bit can hold

1511146
post-increment	pre-increment
pattern0	
additionally the post-increment expression i++ would be evaluated first because it has a higher precedence than the pre-increment ++i operators

1511920
32-bit	64bit
pattern7	pattern0	
the non-parallel versioning speeds up a tiny bit because i m running in 64bit mode and it likes 64bit registers slightly better than 32-bit registers

1512376
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera	display	height
pattern7	
if you browse this page with google-chrome opera or firefox and the browser s windows height is smaller than 800px some menus will overflow the windows and the user must scroll down the page to display the options hidden

1514244
udp	tcp
pattern0	pattern4	
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

1514785
cherrypy	django
pattern10	pattern8	
i would use django because of its large user base and existing modules including the built-in admin interface but i would imaging that cherrypy is more flexible than django

1514982
multiplication	bit-shift
pattern10	
long answer it won t because it can t know if a bit-shift is faster than a multiplication on the platform the code eventually will be running

1516255
derived-class	base-class
pattern7	pattern0	
in other words if you use a pointers to the base-class to iterate over an arrays of the derived-class you ll get wrong results if the derived-class has a bigger size than the base-class because it will iterate in step of sizeof base-class bytes

1516459
bison	yacc
pattern0	pattern0	
this is sometimes easier than yacc bison and usually more intuitive

1516876
ref	out
pattern10	
since ref is more general why do you ever want to use out

1516885
ref	out
pattern10	
out is more constraint versioning of ref

1517564
json	xml
pattern10	pattern8	
xml is arguably more flexible than json to represent your data

1518826
python	php
pattern0	
more providers will allow you to run php and you can generally find php hosters a bit more cheaper than python hosters

1518826
python	php
pattern0	
generally it s easier to code with python in many regards but this is something that can be overcome simply by using more time with php

1520565
zend-amf	amfphp
pattern7	
zend-amf and amfphp both by the same guy zend-amf is newer but a little more complex to set up are both great

1520645
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
pattern4	
the clients prefer php but shell scripting perl python and plpgsql are all used on the system.in one form or another

1521013
constructor	object
pattern4	
generally i prefer constructor which guarantee the object is in a good state or if that cannot be done perhaps because .some of the arguments to the constructor were invalid throw an exception-handling .so there is never an instances of your class which is in a bad state

1521319
subtract	add	callback	methods
pattern4	
you may try the after create after save and before destroy callback methods to add or subtract the amount from the parent total profit

1523688
contains	any
pattern0	
i suspect in most cases it would be perfectly acceptable not significantly worse than any other of the multitude of inefficiencies these systemd contains

1523860
jquery	dojo
pattern4	
for ajax call you can use a variety of libs i personally recommend jquery and dojo

1524834
linq-expressions	lambda
pattern4	pattern2	
favor linq-expressions over lambda .when you have join

1525321
multiplication	addition
pattern7	pattern0	
just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition

1526004
return-value	lvalue
pattern0	
note that this returns a relative difference meaning that if rvalue is greater than lvalue then the return-value will be negative

1526793
stateless	stateful
pattern10	
i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires

1526793
stateless	stateful
pattern4	
anyhow gwt and many other modern toolkits silverlight talking to wcf seems to prefer stateful client stateless server due to scalability issues

1527161
quicksort	mergesort
pattern0	
why is quicksort better than mergesort

1527533
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
installing a real database server is fairly easy .so i d recommend sql-server-express as others have or even mysql or postgresql whatever is easier to set up

1529187
combinations	permutation
pattern0	
itertools does much more than just combinations and permutation .so while it would surely be nice to have all of itertools .when coding java

1529588
abstract-class	subclassing
pattern0	
but unless you re using such excellent testing practices and patterns i d be suspicious of abstractions that have a single concrete example -- interfaces with just one implementation no less than abstract-class with just one concrete subclassing

1530218
telnet	ssh
pattern3	
i can recommend using ssh rather than telnet for security reasons

1531069
csv	xml	export	csv
pattern4	
another idea is that you can export file in xml instead of csv or text i always prefer export into xml .when i have to process in my code

1531519
display	width
pattern0	
in my iphone application uitable having .so many cell with text.the text size is more than the width of the device..so how can i wrap the text in cell and display the text in the different line or devide it in the line

1532246
json	xml
pattern7	pattern0	
json is typically lighter weight than xml but there are some data-structures that don t lend themselves to json serialization

1532513
xlsx	xls	xlsx	xlsm	xlsm	xls
pattern0	
using the xlsx open xml file-format will be safer than using xls or xlsm since xlsx workbooks cannot contains macros

1533116
variables	boolean
pattern10	
also the reason for making the boolean volatile as opposed to the object is that access of a volatile variables is more expensive due to the memory-model constraints - thus the boolean allows you to enforce the memory-model then the object access can be done much faster within the thread

1533209
json	xml
pattern0	
hessian is much better communication-protocol than xml and or json

1534459
any	set
pattern4	
it doesn t loops through any strings the expectations that is set up will simply match any string that it is given .when sendemail is called returning a true result

1534656
linux	unix
pattern4	
you have to change your code for different platform win unix etc... eg socket programming differs on windows and linux

1535156
forward-compatibility	compatibility
pattern4	
.when there is no special reason for backward compatibility i prefer forward-compatibility

1535381
rhino-mocks	moq
pattern7	
rhino-mocks has been the top dog for a while now but moq has an easier learning curve from online docs although it may not always handle edges scenarios.

1535713
aquamacs	emacs
pattern7	
you may also want to look at aquamacs which currently has a beta for the latest emacs and offers somewhat better os x integration than the default building

1537007
32-bit	64bit
pattern7	
the short answer is that 64bit application consumes more memory if you have an arrays of 64bit pointers it will be larger than arrays of the same size with 32-bit pointers

1539974
swing	gwt
pattern0	
gwt from google is based on the swing model while rap from eclipse is based on eclipse s rcp model which is much richer than swing

1541739
subtraction	addition	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction
pattern0	
the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

1545598
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
mysql has some advantages like easy replication but postgresql is generally nicer to work with

1545751
digits	zero
pattern4	
after matches zero or more digits

1546161
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern7	pattern0	
if you are interested in good seo and a faster website asp.net-mvc is much cleaner html and faster than webforms

1546562
order	add
pattern7	
otoh the foreign key suggests frequent querying by campaign in which case having the clustering done by that column could make sense and would also probably do a better job of scattering the insert key in the indexes - both the surrogate key and the timestamp would add recording in sequential order which is .net more work over time for insert because the nodes sectors are filled less randomly

1546912
postgresql	mysql
pattern8	
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s

1546912
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
note i m not saying mysql s license won t work for you but postgresql is definitely simpler

1548121
any	set
pattern0	
remember - rest is nothing more than a set of architectural constraints for distribute computing independent of any underlying transport protocols

1550588
symfony	yii	codeigniter	symfony	codeigniter	yii
pattern4	
i don t recommend codeigniter as great and powerful framework but it s simple for beginners and they can learn a lot from it personally i m in favor of symfony and yii

1552285
python	c++
pattern7	
python overloading is safer in general than c++ s -- for example the assignment-operator can t be overloaded and has a sensible default implementation

1552911
simulation	sampling
pattern0	
by decoupling simulation from renderinging you can rendering at a higher frequency than your simulation does for sampling

1553176
callback	methods
pattern7	
the delete_all methods is simpler but not advised because it means that none of your other callback will happen on the user recording

1556645
contains	elements
pattern0	
i receive the following error sequences contains more than one elements .when trying to populate my promotion table object

1559056
python	java
pattern0	
depending on your background the learning curve may be steeper than using java or python but the pay-off is that you get access to a very powerful toolkit

1559336
masstransit	nservicebus
pattern0	
there are frameworks for .net that can make this much easier such as masstransit or nservicebus

1559428
perl	awk
pattern4	
i d recommend perl to solve this but awk or another scripting-language will also do

1559933
json	xml
pattern0	
further should the nature quantity security level of data change in future you will be better off with a json xml response than allowing total access

1560687
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	
quicksort is a partition sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partition sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n

1563301
elementtree	lxml
pattern0	
lxml -- 100x better than elementtree

1564440
attributes	properties
pattern4	
you can have it as attributes instead or skip it altogether if column named matches properties named

1565892
jquery	dojo
pattern4	pattern2	
all in all i would highly recommend jquery over dojo in any project

1566016
decimal-point	digits
pattern0	
if you want to exclude numbers like 123a street addresses for example or 123.123 numbers with more than 2 digits after the decimal-point try

1566337
primitive	int
pattern0	pattern0	
there are no particular pitfalls with using bigint except that they are significantly slower than primitive int types .

1566716
python	ruby
pattern0	
i don t stick to it completely but that is my basic pattern especially since python tends to encourage more-but-simpler lines-of-code than ruby

1567102
while-loop	for-loop
pattern10	
don t use a for-loop .when a while-loop is more appropriate

1567753
while-loop	for-loop
pattern7	
i guess you can just manually checked the conditional within your for-loop continue if it s not met but a while-loop makes more sense imo

1567840
unique	words
pattern4	
in other words match unique characters do not match characters that are repeated

1568685
versioning	migrate
pattern10	
as 64bit support is not expected in the next versioning it is no longer an option to wait for the possibility to migrate our existing codebase to unicode and 64bit in one go

1569560
expression	evaluation
pattern8	
i m not sure what makes you think that assign the result-of the expression to a variables first would be more efficient than evaluation the expression itself but it s never going to matter .so choose the option that enhances the reliability of your code

1570729
64bit	x86
pattern7	pattern7	
longer answer 64bit x86 has more general purpose registers which gives the compiler more of an opportunity to optimize local-variables into registers for faster access

1570797
local-variables	function-call
pattern7	
if a function-call allocates more than 4096 bytes of local-variables it is possible that the first stack access from it will actually stretch beyond the guard page

1570805
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
a 64bit versioning might be slightly slower or slightly faster than the 32-bit versioning

1573183
concatenation	comma
pattern2	
essentially we are concatenation the serials that match with comma to a variables within a user defined function and then retuning the result

1573718
python	c++
pattern8	
it is much easier to start with than symbian s c++ sdk and in case you ever need more low-level functionality than python gives you you can write small modules in c++ and use them in your python program

1573879
python	ruby	python	c++
pattern7	pattern0	
python has much better integration with c++ via things like boost-python sip and py++ than ruby where the options seem to be either write directly against the ruby interpreter api which you can do with python as well of course but in both cases doing .so is low-level tedious and error prone or use swig which while it works and definitely is great if you want to support many languages isn t nearly as nice as boost-python or sip if you are specifically looking to bind c++

1573879
python	ruby
pattern7	pattern10	
i can easily imagine arguments that the python situation is better and that the ruby situation is better

1573922
key-value	key
pattern0	
assuming that both the key and value are serialization what could be simpler than representing key-value pairs in xml

1575386
mongodb	couchdb
pattern4	
i prefer mongodb because i don t know java and found couchdb easier to get up and running

1575946
python	php	python	c++
pattern10	pattern7	
php is more similar in syntax to c++ than python but python is easier to learn and more modern

1576812
contains	any
pattern4	
the means a character-class which means match any character contains in the character-class

1577097
boost	stl
pattern10	
while boost is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge it is difficult to use correctly

1578142
json	xml
pattern0	
the problem is that using properties-file will only works better than xml or json ... on the most trivial classes

1579283
contains	any
pattern4	
i ve created a regular expression that matches any numeric value with leading or trailing spaces that contains ascii or arabic characters

1579370
jquery-cycle	slider
pattern7	pattern0	
i am currently using jquery-cycle and the techniques being used in versioning 1.3.2 do not work .when telling it to slider it seems to work only in 1.3.1 there is also a issue of the size slider 3 is much longer than slider 1 and the height it generator is too tall with dead spaces

1579393
msbuild	nant
pattern4	pattern2	
now i mostly tend to prefer msbuild over nant because it s simpler

1581034
tcp-ip	udp
pattern0	pattern0	
at my company we have found memory-mapped-files to be much faster than loopback tcp-ip for communication on the same box .so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too

1581624
silverlight	xbap	silverlight	wpf	partial-trust	xbap
pattern0	
you get all the benefits of the full wpf platform greater feature-set than silverlight and do not need to conform to the partial-trust restrictions of xbap although you will need to configure the clickonce server to allow for trusted application deployment

1581820
ienumerator	ienumerable
pattern7	
even though this is supported by c# via ienumerator ienumerable there is a better idiom foreach

1583034
attributes	properties
pattern4	
along the same line and closer to what you were thinking you could right click tests in the test view windows choose properties and populate the description properties or as you suggested by decorating tests with the description attributes

1585115
getter	setter
pattern0	
on the other hand you may very well have legitimate reasons to have a bunch of properties that are no more than getter and setter

1585305
hash	md5
pattern0	
yes sha1 is a better hash than md5

1589743
python	java
pattern4	
i prefer python though java would be acceptable

1590201
constructor	object
pattern7	
this is the same as the constructor issue is it better to raise an exception-handling during the construction or initializer a void object and then call an init method.

1591603
python	php
pattern0	
python is a fine language and won t perform worse than php

1591664
overlapping	z-index
pattern7	
the overlapping div has a higher z-index

1594320
scala	java
pattern4	pattern7	pattern0	
that s not to say that you couldn t match scala s performance at doing the same thing - just that it may become an ugly workaround in one language to match the natural idioms in another note i m not saying i believe scala is actually faster than java at anything specifically - i have no data on that - other than that scala is designed with scalability in mind - hence the named

1595450
autotools	gnu
pattern0	pattern0	
i want to building a shared libs using waf as it looks much easier and less cluttered than gnu autotools

1595500
python	java
pattern10	
and any modifications that you need to do will be in python which is less effort than java however you still have the object-oriented capabilities that you are familiar with from java

1595704
subtraction	addition
pattern0	
i can t use anything more than basic addition and subtraction and string-parsing functions

1597547
groovy	scala
pattern0	
i d be inclined to avoid ioke on account of it s immaturity and for the purpose of a dsl i think a dynamically typed language like groovy or javascript is a better choice than scala

1597983
positioning	embed
pattern0	
your best chance would probably be having your own embed iframe elements and have it be a sibling of the embed elements and give it a higher stack order with a positioning and index you could al.so try making it a direct child of the body elements .so it has a higher z-index than the embed elements s parent elements

1602152
contains	elements
pattern0	
with the first catch block you know that single throw an invalidoperationexception because the sequences contains more than one elements or is-empty

1603119
firefox	safari
pattern4	
this actually works fine on mac win firefox safari but on ie6 and ie8 only the first elements grabbed by the selector display the desired behavior

1603399
insertion-sort	quicksort
pattern7	pattern0	
insertion-sort is better than quicksort on short lists

1603590
value	field
pattern4	
that is outside of the 2 byte difference in storage per field .when you compare value that are of two different types sql will be forced to convert one of them

1603644
haskell	sml	purely-functional	sml
pattern0	
i haven t read the paper on edison but if it s nothing more than the haskell implementation of purely-functional data-structures doesn t it make more sense to ports the sml code that s in the book thesis

1603752
contains	elements
pattern7	
the rehash means your arrays of m slots should be resize to contains more elements a primes greater than the current size or 2x greater is ideal and that your elements must be distribute in the new larger arrays

1604916
sql-server	mysql
pattern7	
the sql engine should give an error because of that though some such as mysql just pick a random-ish value out of the several i believe sql-server is better than that

1605680
value	field
pattern4	
this will also allow you to choose value of the field for your current records.

1606283
log4net	nlog
pattern7	
have a look at logger.isdebugenabled in nlog versus log4net from our tests nlog has less overhead and that s what we are after low-latency stuff

1606566
decompiling	native-code
pattern10	
decompiling native-code c++ is much more difficult

1609485
jax-ws	cxf
pattern7	
however cxf has vastly better documentation and much more flexibility and additional functionality if you re willing to go beyond the jax-ws specifications

1610138
ref	out
pattern7	
as most other answers have pointed out if you want to pass in an initializer object ref is the stronger choice

1610556
interpreter	runtime
pattern0	
to put for the obvious and broad points compiled languages tend to have higher performance than interpreter ones since compiling precludes the need for a runtime interpreter

1611208
destroy	self
pattern4	
the -dealloc destroy self and thus foo is no longer valid

1614595
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
pattern10	
while this is no problem for me to do .when the search is case-sensitive it s more problematic to do it case-insensitive

1615681
radio-button	selected
pattern0	
otherwise if you don t do anything you ll be able to selected more than one radio-button simultaneously

1616895
loading	gif
pattern7	
i wrote my own loader using some opensource gif libs and without any optimization entire decoding loading of the gif frame takes less than 100ms

1617106
contains	any
pattern4	
it would register a match any words that contains the same letters

1617227
network-drive	intranet
pattern7	
i m not sure if this is your problem but browsing working with and copying files from mapped where you have assign a drive letter to a network-drive is much quicker than using the unc intranet notation

1617461
windows-server	windows
pattern0	
i ve personally switched to windows-server 2008 r2 standards as a development machine and i find it much faster than windows 7 ultimate x64

1618019
emacs	vim
pattern3	
i don t know about emacs but i would recommend learning vim for a beginner in a heartbeat

1618687
nsdata	nsurl
pattern10	
1 it seems loading the sound file through nsdata rather than nsurl works faster later in playing

1618906
quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	
one can implements a versioning of quicksort for a single-linked list but normally this is only interesting as a puzzle since mergesort is much easier to implements and works equally well or better for sorting linked lists

1620766
json	xml
pattern4	
json definitely beats xml for performance reasons

1621289
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
pattern3	
i would strongly recommend learning python ruby or perl

1621510
aptana	pydev
pattern4	
regarding front end stuff i recommend aptana here aptana has recently acquired pydev by the way

1622163
compatibility	legacy
pattern0	
stick to html5 which has much better compatibility with legacy uas

1624757
json	xml
pattern8	
json is fine for this use and will be more compact than xml

1624772
json	xml
pattern0	
i find json less verbose than xml and there is a very nice database in development called couchdb which lets you store search json document directly

1624796
json	xml
pattern7	pattern0	
of course in fact json is much better than xml for the following reasons

1625141
compiled-query	objectcontext
pattern0	
there is a certain amount of compiled-query caching which the entity-framework does but it does not live any longer than the objectcontext

1625236
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern8	
the control market around webforms is quite a bit more mature than asp.net-mvc .so tools from companies like telerik devexpress infragistics will have a more mature implementation and broader base of support

1627232
haskell	lua
pattern0	
doing a job search for c# gives a lot more hits than for lua or haskell for example

1627608
zend-framework	symfony
pattern0	
it uses doctrine which is inspired partly by hibernate too but it is integrated deeper with symfony than zend-framework

1627936
display	width
pattern0	
the obvious cure is to tell it to sample the function at smaller intervals -- specifically small enough .so the transitions from +1 to -1 or vice versa happens in less than the width of a pixels as you ll end up display it

1628025
data-structures	tree	required	checked
pattern8	
should you required data-structures that are more complex than tree you should checked a topological sort algorithm

1630520
static-class	nested-class
pattern7	pattern0	
as far as i can recall a static-class is nothing more than a nested-class

1630987
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql

1632015
c-preprocessor	macros
pattern7	
this will generator a part of makefile just like c-preprocessor does or more correctly lisp macros

1632417
any	set
pattern4	
you can downloading dos ports of most unix cmd for example here - pick any set of cmd you like that include tail

1633312
json	xml
pattern4	
i prefer json to xml as it seems to be easier to manipulate with php

1633582
contains	elements
pattern0	
i m assuming that you want the contains elements to be smaller than or contains entirely within the

1633894
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	pattern2	
if i had to support a huge numbers users on a reasonably simple application and had the team to building a heavily partition and replicated database with eventual-consistency i d pick mysql over postgresql for the low-level data storage buildinging block

1637711
fortran	cython
pattern0	
i m liking fortran more at the moment because by the time you add all the required types annotations in cython i think it ends up looking less clear than the fortran

1638630
any	set
pattern4	
see if the user enters a named that does not match any of his friend idnamed gets set to an empty string instead of a userid numbers and named gets set to the entered text

1638698
msbuild	nant
pattern3	
i would recommend using nant or msbuild for that purpose but powershell or a simple batch-file will also do

1638861
bazaar	git	darcs	svn
pattern4	
i personally prefer git but some people find svn simpler to use and some people like mercuiral bazaar or darcs

1640244
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
pattern0	
i like the monodevelop ide even better than sharpdevelop but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language-features

1640806
python	java
pattern4	
is there any reason to favor python or java over the other for developing on android phones other than the usual python v

1641091
malloc	free
pattern4	
you also have to ensure that you do not destroy free the old block if the malloc fails - you just return 0

1642048
contains	any
pattern4	
the regex should match any strings which contains the comma

1642080
file-access	filesystems
pattern10	
rebuilding the index then repacks the index in a contiguous section of storage spaces a bit akin to the way defragmentation of the filesystems makes file-access faster.

1643009
multiplication	division
pattern7	pattern0	
the tostring should be slower than parsing since division is generally slower than multiplication

1643224
revision	svn
pattern0	
.so next you use the -r flag or -r do svn help ann to make sure to specify the revision one less than the revision you found in the previous step

1644071
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
pattern4	
i ve used this in ff2 ff3 ff3.5 safari 4 win opera 9+ google-chrome 2 google-chrome 3 and they all work

1644585
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
if the your versioning is equals or higher the backup can be restored and and upgrade with a limit not all past versioninging are supported

1645112
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
pattern3	
your core-graphics surface should be cleared to all zero before you rendering to it .so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc

1645112
loading	png
pattern4	
if you d like to avoid core-graphics for decoding png images i recommend loading in a pvr file instead

1646143
centering	fixed
pattern0	
a few html things have also been fixed is a self-closing tag and there are better ways than to centering tables

1646965
silverlight	wpf
pattern10	
yes we will see that wpf and silverlight becomes more and more alike if the acutely will be merge

1647078
innodb	myisam
pattern10	
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

1647114
innodb	myisam
pattern10	
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

1648539
beautifulsoup	lxml
pattern10	
beautifulsoup is more suitable for html-parsing than lxml

1648619
artifactory	nexus
pattern2	
i can clearly state that while nexus is very simple and operative though i sometimes have problems with the installation process on ubuntu its free versioning cannot compete with artifactory s community free edition

1648630
objective-c	swift
pattern0	
swift is now perhaps less weird than objective-c seems to a programmer coming from some other language

1649576
configuration	installation
pattern10	
the easier and faster installation and configuration is the better.

1649716
any	set
pattern7	
really if you want an order sequences outside of a key-value setup std set is just easier to use than any other

1650002
cursor	row
pattern7	
while the using the into variables construct is on the right tracking the code-snippets show with only this change will fail since the cursor has more row columns declare than variabless referenced in the into clause

1650091
double	int
pattern4	
.so the question what s the best way to compare double and int

1651199
z-index	overlay
pattern0	
i don t know how asp hyperlink works but have you tried giving it a z-index larger than the overlay

1651490
string-length	zero
pattern7	pattern0	
this question sounds outrageous but vs is giving me an error .when i checked that a string-length is greater than zero

1651953
annotations	mapping
pattern4	
i consider jibx the best of the bunch jaxb castor xmlbeans etc. particularly because i favor mapping files over annotations

1651953
annotations	mapping
pattern4	
side comment i prefer mapping files over annotations because annotations

1653455
solaris	linux
pattern8	
but i m far more familiar with linux strace or even solaris truss .

1654684
deployment	install
pattern10	
your deployment process becomes more complicated since you required the .net to be install on your customer s machines and you need to register your .net libs as a com component .so that your vb6 application can access it

1654844
any	set
pattern4	
it s a set of regular expression to match any numbers followed by h or m or d to represent hours minutes and days

1655426
children	nodes	any	set
pattern4	
if you just set the child nodes to null you ll lose any information about the childs children

1656859
expression	brackets
pattern4	
for example how would one write expression which matches brackets balanced string like foo bar bar foo foo1 bar1

1657538
websphere	ibm
pattern4	
.so to me the choices are actually sun s jvm unless i ve to run .some websphere stuff in which case i d choose ibm j9

1657748
sigaction	signals
pattern4	pattern2	
personally i would recommend sigaction over signals

1657908
json	xml
pattern7	
the iphone has minimal support for xml and json is far easier imho using one of the json libs such as those here

1658665
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	pattern2	
i would recommend postgresql over mysql

1659733
scala	java
pattern10	
now the jvm is becoming less language dependent with clojure and scala running off of it .so java has become more interesting now for designing applications

1660613
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	pattern0	
as i mentioned in a comment to the answer of brianegge there are not much usecases for hash with more than 32-bit and most likely not a single one for hash with more than 64bit

1661217
parentheses	operators
pattern4	
if i have a match operators how do i save the parts of the strings capture in the parentheses in variables instead of using and .so on

1663230
boolean	int
pattern0	
obviously a string can hold far more information than an int or boolean

1663627
scheme	elisp
pattern7	
the original goal was for guile to be backwards compatible with elisp but it seems like developing scheme is the better choice

1664063
typename	typedef
pattern0	
they describe intent better than built-in typename do typedef int errcode

1664525
contains	any
pattern4	
note that this will match any messages that contains the substring target_word

1667148
interlocked	atomicity
pattern0	
but consider this it s literally impossible to do any better than interlocked operations for cross-process communication with atomicity updates and no locks are held

1667154
any	set
pattern0	
how can i set things up .so that .when i set an elements to have a greater z-index than any other elements on the page it will appear on top regardless

1668060
font-size	height
pattern0	
alternatively you can try altering the line-height variables to 0 in the div then back to 100 in the p but that seemed to change the div s height by a few more pixels than the font-size methods .when i tried it

1668899
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
i finally realised this might be due to using 32-bit int types instead of the native types and indeed .when i replace with int 8 the 64bit performance is only 25 worse than the 32-bit one

1668899
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
is it always the case that 64bit will be slower than 32-bit for this types of code i was surprised at this - or is there a chance i could get the 64bit compiled versioning running the same speed or faster

1668986
32-bit	64bit
pattern7	pattern0	
like you i m surprised that the 64bit versioning is slower than the 32-bit versioning

1669936
bazaar	git	perforce	bazaar	perforce	git
pattern7	
you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce

1669963
updating	updates
pattern0	
if updating a fact in the database such as a street-address required more than one updates

1670410
python	ruby
pattern4	
if that s all you re looking for i d recommend python or ruby

1670609
qmake	cmake
pattern10	pattern8	
cmake is more generalised than qmake which is specialised for qt project

1670651
ironpython	ironruby
pattern10	pattern0	
however as things stand right now ironpython is much more mature and has much better performance than ironruby .so you may prefer to use that

1670683
vxworks	qnx
pattern4	
get a real-time linux-distro or grab vxworks or qnx - something purpose-built for io intensive requirements

1671489
packets	ping	traffic	packets	traffic	wan
pattern0	
one thing to keep in mind .when using icmp based ping is that networking equipment will often give icmp traffic lower priority than normals packets especially .when the packets cross network boundaries such as wan links

1671677
eclipse-plugin	aptana
pattern4	
on the aptana s downloading page simply choose eclipse-plugin

1673035
attributes	properties
pattern10	
as implied in 1 properties is a better alternative to get set call .so instead of getx setx user uses less verbose self.x and self.x 1 though per.sonally i never make a properties just for getting or setting a attributes if need arises it can be done later on as show in #1

1673729
python	java
pattern4	
i prefer java or python however any solution would be welcome -

1674236
unicode	ucs
pattern7	pattern7	
according to wikipedia the bmp of the ucs has 65536 characters the latest versioning of unicode contains more than 107000 characters and the ucs has more than one million code points

1675965
decimal	hex
pattern10	
is the unicode character at code points 1634 decimal or 0662 hex which is the more standards notation

1678686
contains	elements	contains	set
pattern0	
i think of lists the same way i think of sets a set can be empty contains only one elements or contains more than one elements

1679723
digits	zero
pattern0	
if the year has fewer than two digits the numbers is padded with leading zero to achieve two digits

1682849
any	set
pattern2	
since the compares against any nodes in a nodes set and returns true if all nodess match only whereas the operators compares against the first nodes of a nodes-set only

1684524
python	c++
pattern7	
unless c++ develops better generics mechanisms like reflection it will be ill suited for generics and higher level languages like python will be a better fit for those use cases

1685783
any	set
pattern4	
if the above pattern matched then checked if the text capture by the second set of brackets matches any of the words separated by pipe

1686192
python	c++	python	java
pattern10	
.so i was just wondering if python is faster than java or c# and how that compares to c++ which i figure it ll be slower than

1686249
python	c++	python	java
pattern7	pattern0	
in terms of raw performance python is definitely slower than java c# and c++

1686834
testng	junit
pattern10	pattern7	
junit is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java testng has more features but maybe is more complex

1687700
triggers	insert
pattern7	
that key would be generator by a triggers after insert which is much simpler than trying to ensure atomicity of the operation and

1688299
implements	extends
pattern0	
if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces

1688310
perl	awk
pattern7	
perl is a better choice i was starting to play with it but the solution with awk beats me

1690043
value	field
pattern7	pattern0	
but if a field is holding more than one value through the use of delimiters then that field needs to be parsing each time you need the answer to any of these basic functions

1691978
jrules	ilog
pattern4	
i would surely recommend ilog jrules for your needs

1693005
instances	destroy

1693198
python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django	pylons	django
pattern4	
if you d like to go with another scripting-language say ruby python then choose ruby-on-rails or django or pylons the list could go on here

1693725
lightbox	thickbox
pattern3	
since many browsers block popup by default and popup are really ugly i recommend using lightbox or thickbox they are prettier and are not popup they are extra html markup that are append to your document s body with the appropriate css

1696013
any	set
pattern4	
the problem is that you are sending a redirect to the user .when the action fails instead of just doing a rendering that means you lose any variables you set up to use within the request

1696406
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
ps 4g is the maximum theoretical heap limit for the 32-bit jvm running on a 64bit operating systemd see why can t i get a larger heap with the 32-bit jvm

1696724
double	int
pattern0	
int can hold a smaller range than double

1697108
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
this is what you want - the size of a buffering can t possibly be any larger than a 32-bit size_t on a 32-bit systemd but it can be far larger on a 64bit systemd

1698025
javascript	dom
pattern7	
using innerhtml for large changes in the dom is way quicker than manipulating the dom with javascript

1698601
data-structures	tree
pattern7	
more complicated data-structures like binary tree which need 3 members per nodes two to hold the left and right nodess and a third to hold the nodes value or tree contains more than two branches per nodes can be construct using a list to implements each nodes

1700143
enterprise-architect	visio
pattern0	
i like enterprise-architect better than visio

1702745
joomla	drupal
pattern10	pattern8	
in my experience drupal is far more flexible than joomla

1703155
lookup	any
pattern7	
at any time the numbers of dcache lookup is much more than dcache updates .so

1703415
instances	private
pattern0	
you shouldn t have any accessibility higher than private exposed as direct instances field

1703680
nested	order
pattern7	
if the ##temp has only few rows then the nested loops is better and order makes no difference

1703754
any	set
pattern4	
the cycles found are construct in such a way that you can choose any path and still get a minimal cycle set no cycle can be get doing the union of two others but there is several possible such sets

1703967
ruby	php
pattern7	
here s why i think ruby is nicer to work with than php

1704021
python	java
pattern0	
java might be the most ported it s on a whole bunch of mobile platform but that s way on the outer edges of interpreter i have heard that python is ported to more platform than java but i can t verify that

1704512
contains	elements
pattern0	
but every row contains 52 elements .so those add up to more than thousand elements

1704686
substitution	replace
pattern0	
for more than one substitution you could use cascading replace statements

1704713
contains	elements
pattern10	pattern10	
your css makes perfect sense given the sample of html you ve show but sometimes putting the styles on the link elements itself rather than it s contains elements is less problematic and what i ended up doing earlier today with my problem

1705367
testng	junit
pattern3	
third i d recommend using junit 4.4 or better yet the testng idiom - annotations

1705750
contains	any
pattern4	
.so far i can match any empty html tag that does not contains jstl with the following

1705953
contains	elements
pattern0	
.single always fails if the collections it is called upon is-empty or contains more than one elements

1706108
firefox	safari
pattern0	
ie on vista and safari on the mac have both exhibited stronger syntax-checking than safari or firefox on vista which will blow by certain errors and rendering a defective graphic

1706281
strncpy	strcpy
pattern4	
usually .when people use strncpy they forget to do this which is why i recommend strcpy

1708087
display	width
pattern7	
since ul and li elements are display block by default â give them auto margins and a width that is smaller than their containers

1708310
digits	zero
pattern0	
the arrays is set up to take 5 digits but i need to prepend leading zero to the numbers .when it is less than 5 digits

1710652
codeigniter	kohana
pattern8	
but if codeigniter has a bit too much bloat for you maybe you can try kohana which is a bit less bloated than codeigniter started as a fork

1710949
global-assembly-cache	gac
pattern7	
if an assembly is install in the global-assembly-cache it s easier to go to c windows assembly and find it in the list of gac assemblies

1711772
hashmap	arrays
pattern0	
this class should use less memory than an hashmap since it uses a primitive arrays no boxing needed it needs only for double s or for float s

1712946
binary	hex
pattern7	pattern0	
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text-editor etc

1713237
dictionary	arrays
pattern7	
you can do it with arrays but as you can see from the code dictionary is the easier way

1714098
version-control	git
pattern7	
i came across this great site why git is better than x i thought i d add it to this answer for other people thinking of switching to git for version-control

1716751
arp	tcp
pattern7	pattern0	
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp messages is shorter than the arp refresh time

1716927
any	set
pattern4	
we can grab any points on this line to do the math we need and we usually pick the easiest one that way we don t have to do any multiplication just set

1717152
postgresql	mysql
pattern8	
postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql

1717363
deep-copy	object	copy-constructor	deep-copy
pattern10	
implements clone to perform a shallow object copy deep-copy is more involved is trivial compared to implements a copy-constructor or a factory-method to perform the same operation

1718292
digits	zero
pattern4	
any numbers of time then an equals then a spaces then there is a capture the brackets that grabs zero or more digits

1718459
contains	elements
pattern10	
sequences contains no matching elements is more a first predicates or single predicates thing.

1719752
floor	ceil
pattern0	
the floor time the ceil are greater than the floor xy...that s very much possible

1722180
innodb	myisam
pattern3	
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases

1723304
aggregate	grouping
pattern0	
.when you grouping in linq-to-sql if you ask for the child object more than aggregate linq-to-sql will re-query each grouping using the key to get those child object

1725175
python	php
pattern8	
i m more comfortable with php mysql don t know a lick of python yet except for the teeny tiny bit i picked up using the django admin recently...therefore please excuse this very stupid question that i m embarrassed to ask

1725999
versioning	upgrade
pattern4	
strongly recommend upgrade your versioning of memcached

1726749
webrequest	webclient
pattern10	
updates i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of webclient but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying webrequest

1727859
direct2d	gdi
pattern4	
i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net spaces

1729502
simpletest	phpunit
pattern4	
i would recommend phpunit for your testing as it seems to be the most complete package for php imho many are fans of simpletest as well .

1729806
innodb	myisam
pattern10	
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and insert than myisam

1729806
innodb	myisam
pattern10	
we know that myisam is faster than innodb .when we don t have many concurrent updates insert

1730317
innodb	myisam
pattern10	
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb

1730317
innodb	myisam
pattern2	
if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right

1730317
innodb	myisam
pattern7	
if you find that innodb is much slower for insert updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully

1731087
ruby-enterprise-edition	passenger
pattern3	
to get some instant performance boast with passenger i recommend using ruby-enterprise-edition

1731404
contains	elements
pattern4	
in fact my compare function compares elements of types op_char and i retrieve the operators def from a map which contains elements of types op_def which have a field priority

1732942
dynamic-programming	memoization
pattern7	
i am surprised nobody mentioned this yet because dynamic-programming seems a better approach rather than recursion + memoization

1734521
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern7	
it is hard but not impossible to achieve full separation-of-concerns with asp.net webforms it is lot easier to do it with asp.net-mvc because of cleaner generator html...anyway you have few options here.

1734609
cairo	gtk
pattern10	
with gtk it s more common to use cairo already mentioned by jeff foster

1734992
fseek	ftell
pattern7	pattern7	
unless there is specific reason to do it fopen fseek ftell is a better idea portable staying within the c-standard-library

1735042
drawimage	draw
pattern0	
how can i draw a bitmap with an additional transparency without it taking significantly longer than drawimage

1735122
multiplication	division
pattern10	pattern8	
multiplication is less expensive than division .so

1735408
perl	awk
pattern0	pattern0	
note that gawk is vastly faster than awk on this machine but still slower than perl

1735739
arrays	map
pattern0	
also isalpha could be key for simpler count with fixed arrays 256 this might be even the best solution as for performance vs std map usage checked std map documentation anyway

1736188
exception-handling	error-handling
pattern0	
exception-handling make sense in code were it s okay to drop the current task on the floor and where common case code has more importance than error-handling

1736656
json	xml
pattern4	
i normally don t work with json i prefer xml but since the twitter_oauth gem relies on it i m forced to learn it unless i change the gem s source code or overwrite it - not of my preferences

1737864
turbogears	pylons
pattern4	
others prefer turbogears and or pylons maybe bfg maybe grok maybe zope maybe plone

1738477
nsapplication	appkit
pattern7	
the documentation for deactivate methods for nsapplication says that i shouldn t call this methods directly since appkit knows better how to deactivate stuff

1739928
configuration	installation	32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
with a typical 32-bit python installation of course the total memory you can use in your application is limited to .something like 2 or 3 gb depending on os and configuration .so the longest strings you can use will be much smaller than in 64bit installation with ridiculously high amounts of ram

1741448
telnet	ftp
pattern10	
ftp protocols is more complex than http or telnet form example

1742665
dictionary	arrays
pattern10	
my boss asked why are you using a dictionary you can just use an arrays it s more efficient

1743555
json	xml
pattern7	pattern0	pattern0	
however xml is syntactically bigger than json and that makes it heavier than json

1743691
json	xml
pattern7	pattern0	
easily parsing by javascript and it is lightweight a document in json is smaller than a xml document that contains the same data.

1743725
json	xml
pattern7	pattern0	
then you see json start to fall down but if you just need a serialization format for your data json is smaller lighterweight more human-readable and generally faster than xml

1744013
json	xml
pattern10	
xml may have its merits but for basic data interchange json is much more compact and direct

1744961
google-maps	bing-maps
pattern10	
anyways bing-maps seems more cumbersome to develop for compared to google-maps

1746907
python	java
pattern10	pattern7	
as a language python is faster to learn but java comes with richer tools such as eclipse that may partly compensate

1748574
radio-button	selected
pattern4	
then it works fine pick selected radio-button value

1749841
onkeydown	onchange
pattern10	
onkeydown although it wouldn t work for paste data where onchange is probably better

1750167
drupal	django
pattern0	
it also seems that your break down of the site and what s required fits the django way of thinking a lot more than the drupal way

1751343
scala	java
pattern0	
just for interest if you want really pedantic and rigorous types handling in a language somewhat similar to java you can hardly do better than scala

1751849
minimum	max
pattern0	pattern0	
.so i use the formula you have in your second query to first calculate the bounds -- the four latitude-longitude value at the extremes of the allowed radius then take those bounds and do a simple query to find the matches within them less than the max latitude-longitude more than the minimum latitude-longitude

1752142
google-docs	spreadsheet
pattern4	
i recommend google-docs and spreadsheet

1752257
methodology	waterfall
pattern10	
in traditional waterfall methodology it s more acceptable for a developer to go dark for weeks on end-- and with a bad team this is the worst possible thing that can happen

1752711
nsinteger	int
pattern7	
nsinteger is nothing more than a 32 64bit int

1753024
any	set	object-reference	instances
pattern8	
but in any case the server should return a more informative messages than object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1754080
sorteddictionary	sorted
pattern10	
as you can see on sorted data the sorted list is faster than the sorteddictionary

1755022
contains	any
pattern4	pattern4	
matches any string and is only for like but if you want to apply it .so that it will match any series of letters contains within your character-class you need to do

1756784
silverlight	wpf
pattern7	
in my new wpf silverlight .app is it better to directly connect to my remote sql-server i m using linq-to-sql or is it better to call a wcf service and have the service connect to the database

1757885
sql-server	mysql
pattern0	
sql-server s sql-language support is richer than mysql s including some very cool features in sql 2008 especially like row_number grouping_sets optimize for computed columns etc

1758135
enterprise-architect	visual-paradigm
pattern4	
i personally prefer enterprise-architect or visual-paradigm for uml for my diagram

1758300
silverlight	wpf
pattern4	pattern2	
however starting today there has been a lot of buzz out there about silverlight 4 being announced at pdc09 and people stating that there aren t many arguments left to choose wpf over silverlight 4

1758645
richfaces	gwt
pattern7	
richfaces and jsf unlike gwt allows for more document-style webpage rather than application-style

1759594
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern3	
i think the tool is good but if you are just starting the building of the application i would recommend using asp.net-mvc instead of asp.net webforms

1760594
data-members	private
pattern7	
if i m creating an abstract-base-class and the classes derived from it are going to have some of the same data-members is it better practice to make those members private in the abstract-base-class and give protected access to them

1760867
protected	public
pattern3	
personally i prefer putting public methods first followed by protected methods following by private methods

1763733
silverlight	wpf
pattern7	
i also think even if silverlight 4 makes better use of the gpu it still won t be to the level that wpf utilizes it

1764259
silverlight	wpf
pattern7	
silverlight has a pretty good subset of wpf display features and even manually construct silverlight content is easier to manage than trying to get .net windows + activex hosting + wpf working

1766033
type-safety	generics
pattern4	
or you could use a generics object stack but then you d lose type-safety

1767979
boost	stl
pattern0	
maybe this would have all been better with boost but i m still learning stl and didn t go that way

1768222
push	pull
pattern10	
i have found that pull is more scalability than push

1769414
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

1771126
silverlight	xbap
pattern0	
they ll probably restrict the use of unsafe code and pinvoke in silverlight 4 to a greater degree than in xbap

1773041
ruby	php
pattern4	
choose php over java ruby ..

1773183
value	field
pattern0	
and lastly it can be modified to associate more than two field together for example a named description and a numeric value

1773405
controllers	routes
pattern4	
the default routes in the global-asax are set up to match controllers action id

1774025
constructor	private
pattern10	
a parameterless constructor is generally more descriptive than passing null you can make it private if you only use it from within the class

1774186
python	c++	python	java
pattern8	
we are using gae to hosts our web-services as far as i know gae only support java and python at the moment however most of our engineers here are more comfortable with c++ .so i was wondering if there is a way to integrated g.soap with gae at all

1774364
haskell	ocaml
pattern7	
haskell has more momentum these days but there are plenty of good parsing libs for ocaml as well including the peg parser-generator aurochs menhir and the glr parser-generator dypgen

1774377
innodb	myisam
pattern0	
myisam insert are going to be faster than innodb .so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win

1774388
version-control	git
pattern10	
git is more flexible and powerful and might be a better option than using both types of version-control systemd in parallels

1775439
arrays	loops
pattern7	
since the numbers of congruent arrayss is four if you take the naive approach of doing one arrays per thread below not only will you suffer from having poor memory-access but also the h w will need to checked on each iterator which threads in the warp need to execute loops - those that don t will be disabled which can be inefficient especially if one arrays is much longer than the others for example

1776375
wamp	php
pattern4	
on windows machines you can get a apache php setup quite easily just grab wamp

1776455
haskell	ocaml
pattern7	
haskell has higher level binding to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type-safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libs to use 1700 package on making it easier to glue together components

1778834
matplotlib	networkx
pattern4	
i recommend networkx www.networkx.lanl.gov to building your graphing structure and which you can then use to call the relevant matplotlib methods to plot

1779317
lighttpd	apache
pattern3	
long-polling that s the way i ll choose using lighttpd under apache to load static files images css javascript etc.. and just for this types of long-polling

1779580
short	zero
pattern0	
this only works if the first operands is larger than zero but at least it s short and confusing

1780262
decrement	increment	required	checked
pattern4	
execution an instruction required first iterator over the denominator checked if the indexed state elements is at least the specified value then if it matches decrement state elementss specified in the denominator and increment those specified in the numerator

1782852
value	field
pattern2	
the syntax you show looks kind of like a field value syntax though .so perhaps you want a regex like a-z + + which should match out field and value in pairs

1785073
increment	average
pattern0	
the new getct function should call the previous getct function to see how many items prior to this one are greater than the average and then increment that total if this item was also greater

1786428
hash	md5
pattern0	
it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5

1786648
deployment	install	ruby-on-rails-plugins	gem	jruby	mri
pattern7	
on the other hand ruby-on-rails apps deployment is easier both ruby mri or jruby but the application s size is naturally larger given you have to install other gem and ruby-on-rails-plugins

1786996
emacs	vim
pattern10	
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is

1787309
tuples	any
pattern4	
but stop and consider it looks like it s possible to not match any dog and cat elements which would leave you returning null for one or both of the tuples components

1787617
webforms	asp.net
pattern8	
since it is more bare-metal than asp.net webforms you do have more opportunity to shoot yourself in the foot if you are not careful

1789026
arguments	default
pattern10	
in general python support for defining functions taking default arguments variables numbers of arguments and keyword arguments is more flexible than any other scripting-language i ve ever seen

1790008
put	get
pattern4	
just to get closer to the solution write a javahelp.bat or .cmd if you prefer put it on the path and call that from ruby

1790180
gzip	zip
pattern7	
pack200 and gzip produces much smaller files than jars effectively zip files

1790277
mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern7	
i suggest using hover this instead of binding to mouseenter and mouseleave looks cleaner to me

1790465
json	xml
pattern0	
both cxf and jaxb are xml oriented more than json oriented

1790470
jdom	xom	dom4j	xom	dom4j	jdom
pattern4	
there are at least 3 different ways to implements the xml-wrapping part sax xslt and xml libs like jdom dom4j and xom--i prefer xom but any of them will work

1793320
parentheses	braces
pattern4	
you can use the cmd to match braces brackets parentheses in vim

1793871
python	c++
pattern7	
a well-written c++ codebase is easier to maintain debugging than a python codebase written with the same level of competency

1794163
instance-variables	local-variables
pattern8	
instance-variables are more costly than local-variables

1794205
python	ruby
pattern7	pattern0	
this is something that ruby is much better at than python

1794893
exception-handling	try-catch
pattern4	
i much prefer try-catch using a procedure templates like the one describe here exception-handling and nested transactional

1795117
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	pattern0	pattern7	
now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and .so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i ab.solutely love about it

1798503
google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	
in ie6 7 8 and in google-chrome text has proper size but in firefox it s bigger

1800320
python	perl
pattern0	
as suggested by ikkebr python is probably as good as or better than perl

1800374
wordpress	blogs
pattern0	
wordpress can be used for more than just blogs having recently won an award for best cms proves that

1800653
python	ruby	python	c++
pattern0	
as myyn suggested .something like beautiful.soup or hpricot really excels at this .sort of thing .so if you aren t ab.solutely convinced that it has to be in c++ you really should look into those the basic of both python and ruby can be picked up pretty quickly and are certainly much simpler than c++

1802010
pascal	delphi
pattern10	
there is the mono project that aims to allow .net code to run on mac and linux but between the two delphi being pascal is somewhat more portable

1803139
memcached	apc
pattern4	
you want to compare apc key-value store vs memcached right

1803139
memcached	apc
pattern7	
memcached has more functionality but is intended for distribute environment while apc works on single servers only

1803191
autoscroll	panels
pattern0	
the picturebox is in a panels with autoscroll true .so that scrollbar appear .when the picture is larger than the panels

1804853
union-all	union
pattern0	
keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but it will perform slower than using union-all which will not remove duplicates

1805201
python	java
pattern7	pattern0	
the python compiler is much faster than the java compiler

1805339
autotools	cmake
pattern10	pattern8	
ps cmake is much more powerful than autotools too

1806827
cross-validation	naivebayes
pattern4	
i load this .arff file use 10-fold cross-validation no test file and choose naivebayes then i classify the data and it gives me 5 incorrectly labeled 100 correctly labeled

1807094
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	pattern2	
this is the one feature of asp.net-mvc that will make me choose asp.net-mvc over webforms every day of the week

1807094
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	
in terms of long-term maintainability asp.net-mvc will simply blow webforms out of the water

1807116
asp.net-mvc	wcf
pattern0	
i suppose the wcf serialization could possibly be faster than the asp.net-mvc one but the bottleneck is always going to be getting this data across the wire

1807441
any	set
pattern4	
if you want to set a cookies -- including the cookies that s used to hold a sid -- with all subdomains you would need to set the domain properties to .domain.com -- note the leading dot which allows the browser to match any domain that ends-with domain.com

1808814
memcached	apc
pattern0	
memcached around 4-5 time slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touch everywhere in my environment

1809443
javadoc	doxygen
pattern10	
some people suggested doxygen some ccdoc which should be more similar to javadoc but is less supported

1809614
value	field
pattern0	
i have a list of phones that i have to see if they exist in the table phones the problem is that there is more than one field that each value can be in the table

1809627
value	field
pattern0	
this will only display one answer and if value can be in more than one field it will only display the first field it finds the value in not all of them.

1810501
strtol	atoi
pattern4	
al.so atoi doesn t provide any way to detection errors .so prefer strtol and similar functions

1811607
instrumentation	profiling
pattern3	
i recommend using instrumentation performance profiling tool that is bundled with xcode and the developer-tools

1812152
realloc	free
pattern7	
i know that memory blocks and reallocation are implementation .so specific but .when there are contiguous free blocks of memory realloc works better than a new buffering allocation and memory copy

1812304
contains	elements
pattern0	
.so if the cookies arrays contains more than 10 elements i want the elements to be replace one by one

1815820
python	c++
pattern4	
i do recognise that c++ can be hard memory-management .so i think it s good to have a add-on language where performance is not essential and reliability maintainability scores high i recommend python for this

1815928
contains	any
pattern4	
this would erase any id3 and other header information contains in the file and probably destroy any exploit attempts gd would probably choke on such a file and return an error

1816284
haskell	scala
pattern10	
types-inference in haskell is more complete than in scala having full inference even for partially applied polymorphism types constructor

1816569
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
while today 32-bit are considered a standards in 10 years doing things in less than 64bit may possibly seem distasteful

1819246
hide	show
pattern4	
right-click the cell with the comment and choose show hide comment might do the trick

1819483
simpletest	phpunit
pattern0	
is there any easy php testing framework and may be simpler than simpletest and not command-line based like phpunit

1819794
perl	php
pattern0	
running a perl scripting from the command-line was far quicker than php which needed all possible libs loaded - perl permitted me to choose what extra functionality i wanted at runtime keeping simple scriptinging light-weight

1819969
python	php	python	java
pattern7	
as far as i know java is much faster than it was in the past what about python php etc

1820134
csv	xml
pattern10	pattern8	
xml is arguably more readable than csv

1820147
csv	xml
pattern10	pattern0	
csv is more lightweight if you want to move things about since its normally 2 more time smaller than xml

1820997
contains	elements
pattern0	
if probs contains fewer than 100 elements you ll get that exception-handling for trying to read past the end

1822114
arrays	map
pattern0	
are there other publicly-available open-source frameworks with an associate arrays class that uses an underlying data structure that would perform better than stl map

1822866
perl	c++
pattern0	
then sun developed jdbc and servlets for java and then other j2ee pieces and java became a higher performance alternative to perl and easier than c++

1822901
value	field
pattern0	
since these less than and more than value typically only apply at the ends of the range such a conventions allows handling all filtering and order with a single field value in a standards fashion

1823057
testng	junit
pattern10	
if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get it done in junit

1823851
nsinteger	int
pattern4	
there s a similar question here on so.com in cocoa do you prefer nsinteger or int and why

1823851
nsinteger	int
pattern3	
i prefer using nsinteger because it s future-proof apple now uses it over int and it s the recommended way of doing things

1825359
ruby-on-rails	django
pattern0	pattern0	
are they faster than django ruby-on-rails

1825371
udp	tcp
pattern4	
udp makes sense if you want to make your streaming multicast otherwise i would prefer tcp because it is more reliable

1825484
memcached	apc
pattern0	
a quick googling says that apc is 5 time faster than memcached

1825484
memcached	apc
pattern0	
apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs

1825520
perl	php
pattern4	
you just can t beat perl .when it comes to maintenance scripting and with the small familiarity s it shared with php php was heavily inspired by perl in its infancy shouldn t be awkward to learn

1825857
python	java
pattern7	pattern0	
i m just wondering if python is a better option than java or c# for scientific apps

1826194
subtraction	addition
pattern8	
for the sake of completeness i would like to mention another less powerful algorithm with addition subtraction

1827397
simplemodal	colorbox
pattern4	
simplemodal has a similar function but i much prefer colorbox s implementation and documentation otherwise i d use the latter

1827621
32-bit	64bit
pattern10	
i don t know about your other issues but the reason the 32-bit versioning is the more visible one by default is that most plugins still don t have 64bit versioninging eg

1828700
python	c++
pattern10	
i m guessing c++ is faster than python and can probably handle larger files more intense algos

1829744
required	checked
pattern2	
the longer way plus it is much slower is to use reflection to iterate over members of a class namespace and compare by checked if the reflected member .tostring is the same as the string input this required having the assembly loaded beforehand

1830649
value	field
pattern7	
sscanf returns the numbers of matches that succeeded .so if the int value returned is less than the numbers of field you expected to match you know the string doesn t match your input format

1831212
python	c++
pattern0	
.when i used long longs the c++ was about 100x faster than the python but .when i used gmp binding in c++ it was only 10x faster than the python for the same cases that fit in long longs

1833706
windows-mobile	symbian
pattern10	
compared to platform like symbian brew and j2me windows-mobile is much more advantageous for new developers

1833866
derived-class	base-class
pattern7	
the first is that the author of the derived-class has much more information than the author of the base-class

1834347
python	java
pattern7	
i don t think there are many things comparably easy for c# or java - at least that .so seemlessly handle passing numerical arrays of different types although i guess proponents would argue since they don t have the performance penalty of python there is less need to

1835023
genshi	mako	jinja2	mako	jinja2	genshi
pattern2	
or you can choose between mako genshi jinja2 or whatever you like for your templates

1836050
jquery	dojo
pattern4	
i recommend dojo but others use jquery yui etc.

1836838
double-quotes	single-quotes
pattern7	
i used to suggest you use double-quotes everywhere makes it easier to actually add that later on but i now use single-quotes unless i need interpolation n etc.

1837946
contains	elements	contains	any
pattern4	
the idea is that if the person selecteded a particular value of a selected box an onchange event handler will make a particular div contains those form elements disappear.when they choose any other option the div will reappear

1838134
children	nodes
pattern7	
the heap properties each nodes is greater than or equals to each of its children

1838358
linux	unix
pattern0	
and surely all operating systemd rely on high performance tcp-ip .so much that it cannot be significantly slower than unix .sockets - linux does all .sort of zero-copy tricks even for network traffic .so it surely must be fast for loopback

1839854
tftp	udp
pattern7	
tftp is used because it uses udp which is simpler and had a smaller footprint than a full tcp-based ftp-server

1840568
multiplication	division
pattern7	pattern0	
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loops and it s clear that a does not change between two iterator for instances because it s a const variables then the original versioning can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler move the computation of 1 .

1840723
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
pattern8	
it s sql is much more ansi-compliant than mysql - .so later using oracle sql-server sqlite etc should be very straight-forward

1840999
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
pattern4	
the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntax and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely

1841772
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

1841996
png	gif
pattern7	
a 8bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixels gif and everything will still work as planned

1842236
python	php
pattern10	
python is better suited for practically anything that doesn t fall within php s specialty domain which is building website

1843790
python	php
pattern7	
it s not that php can t do it but python just does it better and less buggy

1845956
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
pattern8	
if we could go back to the initial design then we could ditch php altogether and use something more modern such as ruby or python rather than help perpetuate this cobol of the web development world

1847205
switching	screens
pattern4	
the advantage of this dual-natured solution is that the tabbed approach will work the way you want it to work for the majority of cases but for users with say two screens or who prefer switching between browser tabs they will still have the flexibility to work in multi-window mode

1847325
digits	base
pattern7	
if your numberss are int then you can verify -- using integer-arithmetic -- that one power of the base is less than or equals to your numbers and the next is above it the first power is the numbers of digits

1847687
python	php
pattern4	pattern2	
if you re doing any multithreading development pick python over php

1849303
pascal	delphi
pattern4	
i prefer delphi pascal but i can read other languages if the example isn t overly complex

1849455
cassini	iis
pattern0	
while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual-studio

1850640
python	ruby
pattern7	pattern0	
.so this thread is definitely not a thread for why python is better than ruby or the inverse

1850640
ruby-on-rails	django
pattern4	
again don t compare ruby-on-rails vs django

1850743
python	ruby
pattern10	
imho python is more mature - there are more libs for it although ruby may be catching up and the include libs i think are better designed

1851332
joomla	drupal
pattern2	
drupal is another great free php cms but if you want ease-of-use then joomla wins over drupal

1851623
uniform	points
pattern0	
it should result in nice well-distributed points that should be better than uniform pseudorandom samples for most scenes though could result in horrifying artifacts in some circumstances

1851773
json	xml
pattern0	
i tend to use json .when working in web-applications because it is a lot smaller than xml because it doesnt required the bloat that the nodes create

1851773
json	xml
pattern0	
with the native support for json being added to browsers more and more people are starting to use it more than xml

1852818
silverlight	wpf
pattern7	pattern0	
.so for future project development this may drive demand for sl4 over wpf particularly if there is a perception that silverlight development is cheaper than wpf if the learning curve is less for a subset technology although i don t agree with that sentiment myself

1853219
quicksort	heapsort
pattern0	
however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is

1854681
decimal-point	digits
pattern0	
d+ is 1 or more digits and then . d+ is 1 or more digits after a decimal-point

1856019
beautifulsoup	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	html5lib	lxml
pattern4	
out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup

1856165
arrays	loops
pattern10	
it s a question of whether or not repeat the if test inside loops is less efficient that another traversal of the arrays

1857451
contains	elements
pattern0	
however because the server has sent several messages the byte streaming will contains the xml for more than one elements and .when it is deserialized a multiple root exception-handling is throw

1858671
contains	elements
pattern0	
i m noticing a very strange problem with linq 2 sql throw exception-handling mainly specified cast invalid or sequences contains more than one elements .when under a certain amount of load

1860693
arrays	loops
pattern0	
if you want more than two arrays or variables numbers of arrays then you might be able to use a nested loops though i think you d need to have and as the individual arrays

1861272
any	set
pattern4	
simply put each bank organization is given access to a certain set of prefixes numberss at the start and depending on the level of detail you want you can match any card numbers to an organization using the prefix

1861532
python	java
pattern0	
python itself is not really good with concurrency and is slower than java anyway

1862867
priority-queue	heap
pattern7	
from what i ve gathered the algorithm with the best big-o running time for such problems is dijkstra with a fibonacci heap as the priority-queue although practically speaking a binary heap is easier to implements and works pretty well too

1864891
python	ruby
pattern0	
there s no way the ruby devs would have a hash-function that s an order of magnitude worse than python

1867552
decimal-point	digits
pattern0	
if you have a dot or comma followed by no more than two digits it s the decimal-point

1869151
python	java
pattern10	
i love python and despite what everyone says my python is better because i know java

1869474
environment	building
pattern10	pattern10	
the second option - switching to a fully unix-like building environment is more involved and extends far beyond what editor you will be using

1869622
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern10	
i know this is probably a case where asp.net-mvc is better but i need to use webforms

1870484
scala	java
pattern2	
playframework is totally asp.net-mvc with a fantastic template-engine and allows you to choose freely between java scala

1870710
fireworks	photoshop
pattern8	
i have fireworks 8 as well as photoshop cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with fireworks

1871301
jqtransform	jquery
pattern3	
yes i would also recommend using jquery a very nice plugins is the jqtransform plugins

1872424
google-chrome	firefox
pattern3	
we recommend using google-chrome downloading here or mozilla firefox downloading here

1872552
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	
these location will convert .when they go to windows 7 perhaps or because the application they use internally is upgrade and needs the newer browser versioning

1873035
python	java
pattern4	
if you re looking into a new desktop-development-language then i d recommend java or python both of which you d ease into with your c# and vb.net experience

1873199
stored-procedures	ado.net
pattern0	
â in my opinion debugging linq2sql is much easier than both stored-procedures and ado.net

1873544
silverlight	wpf
pattern3	
some people recommend learning silverlight before full wpf because it is actually a subset of wpf

1874031
lighttpd	apache
pattern4	
i prefer apache 2.2 however lighttpd can also be deployed if it offers a feature for the implementation

1874197
ruby	php
pattern7	
i am creating a web application which required threading and i am trying to figure out which langauge between php and ruby has better threading functionality and better performance

1875111
arguments	default
pattern4	
by default nmock uses equals to match arguments passed to expectations in your case to see whether loadprojects sets mockview.projects to expectedsetprojectsrequest or not

1876549
python	ruby
pattern0	
i find this scary and ruby runs slower than python .so i m not actually urging you to switching to ruby

1877381
python	java
pattern8	
python does that and is also rather more productive than java since there is a lot less lines-of-code required to explain your algorithms

1877589
haskell	ocaml	haskell	lisp	ocaml	lisp
pattern4	
i have better reasons to recommend lisp over f# and even ocaml and haskell

1878972
contains	any
pattern4	
your regular expression matches any string contains the following

1879340
gridview	listview
pattern10	
regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview

1879523
mochiweb	yaws
pattern10	pattern7	
the major difference is that mochiweb is faster and nimbler while yaws handles more concurrent connections

1880342
png	gif
pattern4	pattern2	
i would recommend gif over png because there are some issues with color profiling in webbrowsers and pngs

1880726
constructor	object
pattern8	
instances of is an inaccurate term but is close enough and more concise than object that has been created by calling x as a constructor

1883996
selected	button
pattern4	
i defined the button selected by default and selected my image for the selected state use dropdownlistfor in inspector windows to choose selected state configuration before selected the image

1884473
functional-programming	imperative-programming
pattern0	
my conclusion clean functional-programming need not be slower than imperative-programming and may sometimes find unexpected avenues of optimization or parallelization

1884878
firefox	safari
pattern4	
overflow-x and overflow-y are supported by ie5+ win firefox 1.5+ mozilla 1.8+ and safari 3+

1885806
scala	java
pattern0	
scala runs on the jviewmodel .so concurrency support at the viewmodel level cannot be better than java

1885854
having	union
pattern4	
however i prefer having an anonymous union

1885863
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
.when the 32-bit dll is dynamically loaded and begins process the memory footprint of the 64bit .application will be about 60 mb larger 250mb as 64bit vs 190mb as 32-bit than if the .application is built as a 32-bit .app

1887931
xts	zoo
pattern10	
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting points

1889065
linked-list	arrays	any	set
pattern7	
to be exact i need to produce a data structure that maps any object o to the set of object no more dissimilar to o than d for some dissimilarity value d such that listing the object in the set takes no more time than if they were in an arrays or linked-list and perhaps they actually are

1889564
georss	kml
pattern4	
the amount of data will vary depending on whether you choose kml or json or georss but if you end up with 20 bytes per line segment that would take 50 seconds to fetch on a 1 megabit broadband connection

1890003
attributes	properties
pattern0	
i managed to get the propertiesgroup named to printing but i can t seem to retrieve more than one attributes from the properties elements without doing two linq queries

1891122
carbon	cocoa
pattern4	
i d prefer cocoa but will be willing to go carbon if i must

1891239
revision	svn
pattern0	
for instances on my per.sonnal svn server for a web-project my blog which is not that big the svn repository has a size of 181 mb -- and there are no more than 150 revision or .so i ve stopped using svn for that project

1891571
python	c++
pattern10	
mit for example uses python for some programming 101 courses -- and yet most definitely that doesn t turn students off harder languages such as c or even c++ which is harder yet

1891900
python	ruby
pattern7	
not to exclude ruby or python it s just more of a household named imho

1892177
arcgis-server	arcgis
pattern0	
if you are doing arcgis-server then you can escape arcobjects as their silvelight wpf api is written in c# and seems to have a cleaner api than arcgis engine

1892208
any	set	subclassing	inherited
pattern0	
this example is a bit looser than the inherited model provided by languages such as java -- an animal instances can have any behavior at all rather than one of a specific set of behavior depending on its subclassing

1895641
json	xml
pattern7	
the reason i am bringing this stuff up is because it seems that many people are switching from xml as a datasource to json which makes more sense as a datasource

1896550
entity-framework	ado.net	entity-framework	data-access	data-access	ado.net
pattern7	
ado.net is better than ado for data-access and more options such as the entity-framework data repository blocks linq-to-sql

1896889
setinterval	settimeout
pattern7	
you may want to consider using jquery timers instead which abstracts away many of the ugly details of settimeout setinterval and makes them easier to use in your code for things like what you are describing

1897818
solaris	aix	solaris	linux	solaris	unix	linux	aix	linux	unix	unix	aix
pattern4	
if you really mean unix and not linux i would recommend solaris eclipse does run on solaris and it s much easier to understand than aix

1897910
quadtree	r-tree
pattern2	
your r-tree approach is the best approach i know of that s the approach i would choose over quadtree b+ tree or bsp tree as r-tree seem convenient to built-in your case

1898944
udp	tcp
pattern8	
what i have thought of .so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability

1899561
value	field
pattern0	
case classes naturally supports more field than a value based enumerator which supports a named and id

1899904
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern0	
there is way more than webforms in asp.net-mvc

1901957
pyqt	gtk
pattern10	
pyqt seems more consistent across different flavors of linux where gtk is constantly changing and breaking on older distributions

1902991
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
pattern0	pattern0	
it is much faster than ruby python or perl

1904249
json	xml
pattern10	
json is an alternative markup to xml that s more compact

1905090
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
pattern7	pattern0	
boxlayout is far easier than gridbaglayout because you don t have to learn how to specify constraints

1905417
linked-list	arrays
pattern0	
accessing an item is slower than an arrays since it is a call to operators and a linked-list

1905417
linked-list	arrays
pattern0	
accessing an item is slower than an arrays since it is a linked-list linear traversal

1906226
udp	tcp
pattern2	
then you have to choose between udp and tcp

1906327
bubble-sort	quicksort
pattern7	pattern0	
no because quicksort is demonstrably better than a bubble-sort in all but a very few set of circumstances involving extremely small dataset

1906327
insertion-sort	selection-sort	insertion-sort	bubble-sort	selection-sort	bubble-sort
pattern4	
or compare bubble-sort to a selection-sort or insertion-sort both o n 2

1906334
bubble-sort	quicksort
pattern4	
bubble-sort even may not beat quicksort on small cases

1906668
webserver	security
pattern10	
about the security it is more or less as secure as the whole server is but you should make sure your private-key is hidden outside the document-root of the webserver

1907934
multiplication	addition
pattern10	pattern8	
since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible .so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loops than you would in the multiplication loops

1907942
xquery	xslt
pattern10	pattern10	
as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries

1908276
lookup	any
pattern7	pattern0	
i edited this to account for .when the lookup value is smaller than any of the value in the list

1908733
xquery	xslt
pattern10	
the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language .when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml

1908876
xquery	xslt
pattern10	
unless you are using the static-typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

1910036
show	next
pattern7	
studies have show that the probability of a nodes going offline within the next hour gets lower the longer it has already been online

1910089
vbscript	jscript
pattern0	pattern0	
asp with jscript is 100 time better cleaner simpler nicer than vbscript and makes my job a joy rather than a vbscript head ache

1910699
perl	php
pattern4	
even if perl would be faster than php the most would choose php because of the simplicity of php

1910916
cross-domain	easyxdm
pattern4	
for the cross-domain part i would recommend easyxdm

1914085
contains	elements
pattern4	
i need to match elements that contains neither pcdata nor child elements

1914257
cryptography	security
pattern7	
cryptography is difficult better buy the security solution from experts than doing it yourself

1914369
swt	rcp
pattern0	
an rcp application has to use much more than just swt

1915379
silverlight	wpf
pattern0	
obviously wpf has a much richer toolkit than silverlight .so it may well be that silverlight just isn t an option

1915470
silverlight	wpf
pattern7	
wpf has a richer control tree whereas silverlight is a reduced set for compact size

1917713
multiplication	division
pattern7	
multiplication is far easier and faster for a cpu to do than division

1917758
python	perl
pattern7	
footnote inline python is better code than pyperl and i would suggest using that instead but it only supports having python callback to perl .when python is invoked from perl in the first place -- the ability to embed perl into python is listed as a possible future feature but it s been .so since 2001 .so don t hold your breath

1918332
any	set
pattern0	
but i can t see that any one set of levels is better than any other

1919754
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern10	
asp.net-mvc is faster than webforms

1920070
children	nodes
pattern7	
heap a nodes is bigger than or smaller than all of its children

1920516
malloc	free
pattern7	
here is a solution which encapsulates the call to malloc allocates a bigger buffering for alignment purpose and stores the original allocated address just before the aligned buffering for a later call to free

1922064
beautifulsoup	lxml
pattern10	
for starters beautifulsoup is no longer actively maintained and the author even recommends alternatives such as lxml

1922486
python	php
pattern8	
php language may appear less complicated than python but you ll do more work to create the site

1922486
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing

1922497
value	field
pattern0	
if the user enters value in more than one field then i need to search on all of those field

1926110
python	java
pattern7	
compared to java python solves same problem in less code and less ways in longer development and viewmodel time where java has more ways solve same problem in more code and faster viewmodel and faster development time

1926274
groovy	scala
pattern0	
while i have no personal experiences with it i ve heard that scala is an even better choice than groovy in many cases

1926591
ruby	php
pattern0	
its crazy fast because it s compiled and is quite a bit low-level has a much smaller api than either php or ruby ruby-on-rails

1926885
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql .so use it - there are gist gin indexes

1928623
difference	factors
pattern0	
this can realistically differ by a factors of 4 way more than the difference in clock frequency you re likely to encounter

1930483
udp	tcp
pattern10	
tcp windows is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

1931826
show	next
pattern0	
if you find traditional for loops simpler than next any and all let us know and we ll show how to recode these uses of the higher abstraction forms into those lower-layer concepts

1932229
binary	hex
pattern4	
i ve used both otool and otx to disassembly various binaries and i ve found the easiest way to edit them is to figure out what the assembly of the new code i want is using nasm or similar then just use a hex editor i prefer hex fiend on the binary file

1932632
erlang	python
pattern0	
i m not sure whether this is better than python wsgi like django-middleware and there is already ewgi for erlang

1933827
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	in-place	in-place	heapsort
pattern0	
heapsort can sort in-place and doesn t have the worst case quadratic behavior but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases

1934512
python	java
pattern4	
do you want the python details spelled out or do you prefer java

1934735
jquery	dojo	javascript-framework	dojo
pattern7	pattern0	pattern0	
once you do fully understand how ajax works by the way you may probably want to move to a javascript-framework that makes it easier such as jquery dojo or google s closure

1935264
memcached	apc
pattern7	
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function-call for apc xcache shared-objects

1935560
arguments	default	instances	self	instances	destroy	destroy	self
pattern4	
if you need data from the destroy instances use the func default arguments approach just be sure never to reference self inside the lambda otherwise it won t work

1935994
simpletest	phpunit
pattern4	
if you prefer phpunit i think you can fairly easily use simpletest s browser from within phpunit

1936043
redmine	trac
pattern7	
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugins

1936076
.net	wcf
pattern7	
wcf is a bit more evolved than the original web-services offered in .net and has better ws-security support although asmx can be extended via ws-security3

1936148
python	php
pattern10	
furthermore php may be able to produce applications outside of webserver and clis but is definitely aimed at those two environment while python is more all purpose

1936659
business-objects	crystal-reports
pattern4	
if you are willing to pay for a commercial bi solution i would recommend crystal-reports and business-objects

1936677
version-control	sync	version-control	git
pattern0	
git and svn and mercurial etc is great for version-control but keeping systemd in sync often required more than version-control

1936919
python	c++
pattern0	
perhaps something like c++ would actually be a better example than python for that reason

1936968
bubble-sort	quicksort
pattern10	pattern8	
i vote for quicksort which is more elegant than bubble-sort and easier to understand too

1937329
linux	unix
pattern0	
but having a winelib ports allows you to better integrated with the unix env which may be what you want for a true linux .app

1937370
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
in my experiance with the two postgresql has show to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads

1937847
key-value	key
pattern7	
i want to loops through this sorted dictionary and change the key to key+1 if the key-value is greater than a certain amount

1938530
void	main
pattern7	pattern0	
int main is better written as int main void

1938783
python	perl
pattern4	
i prefer python to perl

1940753
radio-button	selected
pattern4	
closest way is selected several resources in navigator or package explorer view then press ctrl+h and choose selected resources radio-button

1941649
haskell	prolog
pattern7	pattern0	
the conclusion that the author come to is that expressing at least some of these typess of problems in haskell is easier than in prolog primarily because the haskell types systemd makes it easier to come up with nice representations of search states and move from state to state

1941864
single-table-inheritance	activerecord
pattern10	
activerecord provides much more functionalities such as translation scoping in queries or support for single-table-inheritance

1942016
internet-explorer	firefox
pattern0	
i m not sure if they re still as pervasive now as they were in years past but they re one of the rea.sons why internet-explorer is .so much less secure than firefox and other browsers

1942390
callback	methods
pattern4	
rebind callback to my destroy methods

1945433
linked-list	nodes
pattern7	
each nodes can points to the previous and next nodes it is easier to add nodess to the end of a linked-list

1946810
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	
.so if you re going to develop a web .app that relies heavily on ajax then webforms may just beat asp.net-mvc

1946932
udp	tcp
pattern10	pattern8	
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

1947694
any	set
pattern0	
if cs has the no pad characteristic then the pad character is an implementation-dependent character different from any character in the character set of x and y that collates less than any string under cs

1948765
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
pattern4	
i find most users prefer keyboard data entry as opposed to mouse click data entry - it is a lot faster

1948986
haskell	python
pattern10	pattern8	
as a purely-functional language haskell basically mandates that one program in a declarative functional styles .so hands-down haskell is more functional than python

1949368
strncpy	strcpy
pattern4	pattern2	
not related to the leak but if you know the length prefer strncpy over strcpy

1949511
division	modulo	bitwise-and	modulo
pattern7	
in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implements by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower

1950834
sql-server	mysql
pattern8	
i don t know which versioning of mysql you re running and i m more familiar with sql-server than mysql

1951120
spring	grails
pattern7	
i personally don t believe learning spring and hibernate is worth it unless you have a good job related reason to grails is much easier to use

1951271
decrement	increment
pattern4	
having to go to memory more often than needed is much more expensive than compares increment or decrement

1952096
value	field
pattern4	
i m having one textfield normally .when touch the textfield keyboard will appear is it any possibilities where .when textfield is touch one dropdownlistfor will appear to recommend value to be enter and value is selected it will appear in texr field

1952762
display	width
pattern0	
can anyone pls provide some reasons as to why my iframe that display a report within it show a horizontal scrollbar even though the width of the report within it seems to be smaller than the width of the iframe

1955109
callback	methods
pattern0	
may be slower than functor methods for callback that can be statically computed at compile-time

1955452
expression-blend	designer
pattern4	
i am not able to purchase expression-blend and am looking for a stand-alone xaml designer that i can use to help me .when designing wpf-controls

1955623
communication	messages
pattern4	
i will be using a message-passing architecture to communication between my java components and i d like to efficiently match messages to actions

1957626
mathml	latex
pattern8	
i am developing an application for undergrads and i was looking for something less complex than latex and easier to write than mathml

1957876
diagram	erd
pattern4	
personally i prefer erd diagram for databaser data model

1958901
redmine	trac
pattern4	
grab redmine or trac and take on the challenge of getting everyone to standardize

1959216
linked-list	arrays
pattern7	pattern0	
for most data types optimal sorting algorhitm is o n log n but keep in mind that some structures are still slower for instances sorting linked-list is slower than arrays athough both have n log n complexity

1959795
innodb	myisam
pattern10	
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

1959842
switching	screens
pattern7	
.when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to lookup the function directly

1960286
oracle	mysql
pattern0	
but i don t want to use oracle and want better performance than mysql

1961483
groovy	java
pattern8	
for this particular use is there any reason why java would be more cumbersome than groovy or beanshell

1961714
vsts	tfs
pattern10	
unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro versioning of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions

1962548
32-bit	64bit
pattern10	
from the way that the .application h.appens to be loaded into memory it may be that the 32-bit .app on 32-bit windows and the 64bit .app on 64bit windows get lucky no important memory location are overwrite whereas the 32-bit .app on 64bit windows is less lucky and crash

1962727
firefox	safari
pattern7	
using proprietary extensions from firefox is almost as myopic -- you ll have a hard time convincing all visitor to switching to firefox for your site from ie safari or whatever else they prefer and although the range of devices on which you can install firefox is broader than those on which you can install ie you re still cutting ofirefox devices such as iphones and android a segment of the market that s growing much faster than traditional pcs

1962928
nvidia	ati
pattern8	
4 is nvidia cuda technology is easier more flexible than ati brook+ language

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
pattern4	
personally i d choose bitronix or atomikos

1965541
multiplication	division
pattern0	
i haven t benchmarking any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using int division by 2 is shorter than multiplication by 2

1965744
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern0	
if you find yourself fighting the unit test model with webforms you will find things easier with asp.net-mvc

1966087
dropbox	github
pattern0	
i think this can cause minor problems if there are more than a few people working on the same project but for personal project i find dropbox to be even better than github if only for the fact that pushing pulling is faster

1969021
revision	svn
pattern7	
also for the great simplicity of handling local revision mercurial is much simpler to setup use than svn as simple as hg init hg add hg commit

1969120
multiplication	addition
pattern7	pattern0	
of course it is 10 because the addition operators has a lower precedence than the multiplication operators and .so 4 + 3 2 always means 4 + 3 2

1970160
innodb	myisam
pattern7	pattern0	
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

1970176
innodb	myisam
pattern4	pattern2	
imho you should always prefer innodb over myisam because of the transactional support which is at the heart of every relational-database systemd

1970258
innodb	myisam
pattern4	
i do this all the time because i prefer innodb for the fks but i sometimes need myisam for the full-text search

1972630
ironpython	ironruby
pattern7	
ironpython has had more time to focus on performance improvements but ironruby has made significant performance improvements as of late

1974098
pixels	line
pattern0	
the quickest and easiest methods and possibly the only realistic and cost effective solution for your case which will work with virtually any drawing libs would be to supersample it - draw to an offscreen bitmap at much higher resolution 4 time wider and higher with line of 4 pixels width

1978345
shark	gprof
pattern4	
personally i prefer shark for mac os x and gprof for linux

1978612
any	set
pattern7	
leaving the target set to any cpu is the better choice your binary will run on either platform

1978813
python	java	python	php	python	c++
pattern4	
to compare python java c++ php and other languages

1980079
configuration	environment
pattern2	
although i would prefer yaml as configuration language since it is not .so verbose as xml and have nice means of composing hierarchical configuration files which are usually needed .when you have multiple development environment like dev test live

1980627
groovy	scala
pattern0	
groovy being less performing than scala

1981429
python	ruby
pattern8	
but regardless of which approach one prefers aesthetically it does show one respect in which ruby lambda are more powerful construct than python

1982083
ref	out
pattern10	pattern8	
most use cases for passing a reference variables by reference involve initialization and out is more appropriate than ref

1983563
windows-vista	windows
pattern7	
this problem explained why my normals php on windows installation was crawling and may explain why windows-vista and windows 7 seems slower at time

1984871
python	perl
pattern0	
is this a problem with my installation or is python really that much slower than perl

1984901
python	perl
pattern0	
python is not particularly fast at numeric computations and i m sure it s slower than perl .when it comes to text process

1984919
python	perl
pattern7	
python is slower then perl

1987471
any	set
pattern0	
another person with this problem who unfortunately can t do any better than set the projection like i did

1987806
haskell	c++
pattern3	
if you are willing to try another language besides c++ i would recommend using haskell because it has very good facilities for creating new numeric types and you can use quickcheck to test your numeric types automatically which is a tremendous time-saver and bug-finder

1988545
multiplication	division
pattern0	
.so division is always a bit worse than multiplication

1988594
python	c++
pattern7	pattern0	
while it s generally true that python is slower than c++ it s also true that picking the right algorithm and data structure can have dramatic improvements on performance

1988829
bug-tracking	trac
pattern4	
as a project-management tool that integrated version-control bug-tracking tickets a wiki and more i wholeheartedly recommend trac

1989080
postgresql	oracle
pattern10	
postgresql is more like oracle and in my opinion a bit more mature

1989437
freeglut	glut
pattern3	
but i wouldn t recommend using glut or freeglut for windows management in the first place

1989494
swing	swt
pattern2	
i m writing an application that has an swt gui currently but would like the end-users to be able to choose between swt and swing

1989900
mstest	nunit
pattern0	
various people told me to go with nunit since it s better than mstest apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using

1990172
fclose	fopen	fclose	fread	fopen	fread
pattern10	
here is a more elegant way of writing brianreavis solution also use file_get_contents instead of fopen fread and fclose it s faster and less verbose

1991217
digits	base
pattern0	
each operation will have to iterate over digits of its operands and combine them being careful to carry correctly .so that your digits are never larger than the base

1991503
scala	java	python	java
pattern4	
i d prefer java or scala or maybe python which is a fine language for teaching

1992204
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
64bit is the latest and greatest and must be better than 32-bit

1992249
gitignore	git-add
pattern4	
would fail if there are untracked files that match gitignore use git-add --all instead

1992796
lgpl	gpl
pattern7	
but it seems like lgpl as a variant on gpl imposes a larger insurmountable problem for iphone .app development in that the development tools needed to create and distribute any iphone .app are only available under terms from .apple that are incompatible with gpl

1992920
child-process	spawn
pattern0	
also the server actually listener process should go back to listening for more connections after spawn the child-process

1993390
dynamic-linking	static-linking
pattern4	pattern2	
are there any compelling performance reasons to choose static-linking over dynamic-linking or vice versa in certain situations

1994373
python	java	python	c++
pattern8	
if you want to do something smarter than re matching or want to have a lot of logic you may be more comfortable with python or even with java c++ etc

1994467
json	xml
pattern0	
you might want to look at json it s a very popular format and is far simpler than xml

1995982
scala	java
pattern0	
i heard about scala some months ago and was pretty excited to see a better java than java for the jvm

1996484
google-chrome	firefox
pattern0	
i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox

1997740
distinct-values	duplicates
pattern0	
the reason that i suggest count distinct is that if the columns messageid topicid don t have a unique you could get duplicates which would result in a count of 3 in the grouping even with fewer than three distinct-values

2000028
python	ruby
pattern4	
if you do not know any of the ones proposed i would recommend python or ruby but once again it a matter of taste

2000205
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	pattern0	
also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql

2001760
android-listview	simpleadapter
pattern7	
i have an android-listview created with a simpleadapter that has more items in it than fit in the screens

2001768
constructor	private
pattern0	
unless you need to do validation or manipulation of more than one private member just go ahead and make those public and create a constructor to initializer colour apprpriately

2001803
positioning	slider
pattern7	pattern7	
.when it sees that the new slider positioning is greater than 3 you can reset the slider to 3

2003818
hash	md5
pattern4	
however to answer your original question there is really is no way to compare md5 or any hash against any types of encryption

2004718
emacs	vim
pattern10	
in many cases emacs or vim is more productive than a huge ide that makes coffee

2004885
.net	wcf
pattern7	
.net also offers some higher level ipc like .net-remoting and wcf which use the previous mentioned techniques

2005442
perl	php	perl	c++	python	java	python	php	python	c++	python	perl
pattern0	pattern0	
according to this page it seems that perl php python is 50 time slower than c++ java

2005628
hashmap	arrays
pattern0	
if object have an id that can be mapped 1-to-1 to an arrays than that will be o 1 access as well and in practice will be slightly faster than a hashmap lookup you don t have to compute the hash

2006468
selected	cell
pattern0	
.when i selected more than one cell from excel i obviously lose the delimiter and all is paste into one cell of the web form

2006698
swing	swt	user-interface	drawing
pattern2	
if your only goal is to let users choose between swt or swing drawing their user-interface then swtswing would have been an option

2006809
bugzilla	trac
pattern0	pattern0	
in my experience this is a much simpler sell than trac bugzilla and all the rest

2008289
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern7	
i dare say that asp.net-mvc is easier to work with than webforms

2010512
silverlight	wpf
pattern10	pattern8	
silverlight is far less capable than wpf even in versioning 4

2010531
silverlight	wpf
pattern10	
wpf also has more sophisticated 3d capabilities than silverlight - though not by much

2010569
any	set
pattern4	
i am trying to match any or all from a set of phrases in a given string

2010884
csv	xml
pattern4	
comma-separated value aka csv for tabular data beats xml any day

2012010
waveout	wasapi
pattern0	
in addition to the options mentioned by john knoeller there is wasapi which allows for much lower latencies than waveout but unfortunately is only available from windows-vista onwards

2012986
python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django
pattern2	
if you plan to quickly building web-applications you can choose between django python or ruby-on-rails ruby they have similar functionality with django being stricter but it mostly depends on your language preferences

2012986
ruby-on-rails	django
pattern8	
but talking from experience if you would need to support that web application later then django is a preferred choice - it has much less magic than ruby-on-rails going on and it is much easier to figure out and fix bugs in after some time has passed - or if you are not the original developer

2013142
any	set
pattern4	
the square brackets are a set matching operators it s essentially match any character in this set of characters the at the start makes it an inverse match .so match anything not in this set

2015142
decimal-point	digits
pattern0	
edit - actually i m not sure if 2 will suffice because i don t know how it behaves with more digits after the decimal-point

2015312
dependency-injection	inject
pattern3	
i would probably recommend using dependency-injection to inject your datacontext into your repositories

2016280
selenium	qtp
pattern7	
with selenium 2 now in alpha there is going to be better support for more native actions like key strokes which qtp is slightly better but once it has fully release then i feel selenium 2 will be the best web test automation framework out there

2018722
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern2	
i d recommend with asp.net-mvc if your head is not already filled with asp.net webforms model however understand the tradeoff

2019939
web2py	django
pattern4	
i think i prefer web2py because it does more for me that i don t have to do but from the pov of say java frameworks django and web2py may as well be the same thing

2020091
fwrite	fread
pattern7	pattern7	
i am writing some binary-data into a binary file through fwrite and once i am through with writing i am reading back the same data thorugh fread.while doing this i found that fwrite is taking less time to write whole data where as fread is taking more time to read all data

2020091
fwrite	fread
pattern7	pattern0	
.so i just want to know is it fwrite always takes less time than fread or there is .some issue with my reading portion

2020210
post-increment	pre-increment
pattern10	
if the types increment is a complex types an iterator and not a simple types the pre-increment is faster than the post-increment

2021396
reportlab	xhtml2pdf	weasyprint	xhtml2pdf	weasyprint	reportlab
pattern0	pattern0	
or go a little higher level than reportlab xhtml2pdf - now weasyprint built on top of reportlab

2021483
document-management	nuxeo
pattern7	
for me nuxeo is more of a platform on top of which you can develop interesting features that a document-management systemd

2021501
any	set
pattern0	
sometimes yes but sometimes this syntax is also necessary or better than any alternative you might have to achieve the same result set

2021716
protected	public
pattern4	
.so i d prefer public or package protected

2023431
protected	public
pattern4	
do prefer protected accessibility over public accessibility for virtual members

2024136
adobe-reader	acrobat
pattern0	
problem might be in used viewer in linux i use document viewer or epdfviewer and output is much worse than in adobe-reader or acrobat which i use in windows.

2025417
android-emulator	ddms
pattern10	
i ve noticed that the android-emulator starts much faster if there s no dalvik debugging monitor server ddms connect

2025883
ubuntu	linux
pattern4	
hard to beat ubuntu though i personally use mostly macs that s because mac os x still offers a superior laptop experience and my personal machines are mostly laptops by now -- my workstation at work does run ubuntu -- though i m pretty sure other modern linux distros would be shoulder and shoulder with it

2027256
linked-list	arrays
pattern0	
if you need sorting then a linked-list is not the best structure to use - you may be better of with an arrays

2029320
coffeescript	javascript
pattern10	
also if you wanna save yourself some typing you might have a look at coffeescript which is more or less a sweetened versioning of javascript

2030198
python	tcl	scheme	tcl
pattern4	
i d personally recommend python since scheme guile is a little esoteric and tcl seems to be losing ground generally

2030408
post-increment	pre-increment
pattern4	
prefer pre-increment to post-increment

2030577
msbuild	nant
pattern10	
the reason for switching from nant to msbuild is because msbuild is more current

2031328
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern10	
it s very difficult to say if asp.net-mvc is more appropriate for you application than webforms without knowing more about the application

2034023
versioning	upgrade
pattern7	pattern0	
application expects grails versioning 1.1.1 but grails_home is versioning 1.2.0 - use the correct grails versioning or run grails upgrade if this grails versioning is newer than the versioning your application expects

2035098
groovy	java
pattern7	
because java has more boilerplate and formalism in it you can do this kind of program more quickly and hence more efficiently in groovy

2035098
python	perl
pattern7	
python is a fresher cleaner scripting language than perl and is these days preferred by many as a scriptinging-language

2035098
scala	java
pattern0	
it dispenses with a lot of java s boilerplate .so scala programs are typically about 30 shorter than similar java programs

2036284
binary-tree	linked-list
pattern7	
if the tail of a linked-list is stored then insert into a linked-list is decidedly faster than insert into a binary-tree

2037401
sortedlist	sorted	sorteddictionary	sortedlist	sorteddictionary	sorted
pattern7	
ignoring the cost of providing sorted input the oh of sortedlist is smaller than the oh of sorteddictionary

2039151
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern7	pattern0	pattern10	
you can also try using f# with the asp.net-mvc which is somewhat simpler than standards asp.net webforms but is less component-oriented

2040472
oscommerce	zen-cart
pattern0	
it seems to be younger than zen-cart and oscommerce

2042800
ruby-on-rails	django
pattern8	
an issue arises here that in my country java and c# .net developers are easiest to find while later languages frameworks are harder such as django or ruby-on-rails

2042940
.net	wcf
pattern3	
depending on the versioning of the .net you are using and the types of application i d recommend using wcf

2043025
linked-list	nodes	linked-list	tree	children	tree	children	nodes
pattern10	
unlike a linked-list a tree is a more general form it can have multiple nodess that follow a given nodes that are called its children

2043996
youtube	vimeo
pattern7	
while vimeo is more of a professional site youtube offers html5 h.264 video playback support for all videos .so they ll play on iphone

2044215
numeric	zero
pattern0	
it should include a numeric value which is greater than zero

2044215
numeric	zero
pattern0	
it should include a numeric value which is greater than zero

2044311
swing	awt
pattern7	
well swing is richer in terms of out-of-the-box components than awt

2044311
swing	awt
pattern4	pattern2	
i have used both and i prefer swing over awt

2045457
parser-generator	antlr
pattern4	
i would recommend antlr as a parser-generator

2045608
equals	getter
pattern0	
in the comparator methods you can then write the code which will call the getter for the year month and .so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than equals to or greater than the object o being passed into the comparator methods

2047256
python	java
pattern0	
one might consider python a higher language than java because it natively provides all of these higher order abstract data types intrinsically

2047619
frame	width	height	frame
pattern7	
the frame gets smaller and smaller in width height measurements as you zoom into the scrollview because i want the image to stay the same size on the screens

2048076
oprofile	gprof
pattern0	
i found oprofile to be a lot better option than gprof for profiling in this situation

2048663
json	xml
pattern7	
even a json true or an empty xml document is better than nothing at all

2051680
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	
i prefer asp.net-mvc like the other folks here but i think for a simple .app webforms is fine

2052095
interpolation	splines
pattern10	pattern10	
splines interpolation is probably more useful for you than polynomials interpolation if you fit a polynomials it must inevitably head off to + - infinite outside your data range

2054454
lookup	any
pattern7	
i think this has the fewest operations of any lookup-table-free .solution .so far -- no actually nils pipenbrinck s clever in-place lookup table has even fewer

2054724
enumerator	any
pattern10	pattern10	
also the any enumerator is probably more than you really need - in this case you only need allowdecimalpoint and allowexponent

2054997
web-services	api
pattern7	
a simple web search with api usability and web-services gives much more material from which to choose

2055496
eclipse-rcp	jface	eclipse-rcp	swt	jface	swt
pattern7	
also keep in mind that eclipse-rcp is no more the only game in town .when making a decision of gui frameworks in swt jface land

2058013
exception-handling	try-catch
pattern7	
try-catch is definitely slower since a throw exception-handling causes stack information to be gathered

2059201
shell	bash
pattern4	
you can have multiple shell but many people prefer bash and you ll have the best luck learning it first

2059539
getter	setter
pattern0	
you can do it using rhino 1.6r6 or higher with javascript getter and setter

2060221
.net	wcf
pattern7	
.when using a .net environment 3.5 using traditional web-services no wcf which is better and why

2062112
any	set
pattern4	
mimetypes can be set to to match any mime types

2062787
python	perl
pattern4	
if you prefer perl or python to vb you could even write .py .pl scripting to run the queries and generator .vbs scripting

2064683
phpmyadmin	heidisql
pattern2	
i m using heidisql to manage my databases at work i prefer this over phpmyadmin

2064685
spring	jsf
pattern7	
as a note i feel that jsf has a steeper learning curve than either spring or struts

2066036
komodo	gedit
pattern0	
.when i m in a hurry i use gedit purely because it is quicker than komodo edit

2066318
early-binding	late-binding
pattern0	
back in the days .when com and corba where the hot binary interface technologies i seem to remember that early-binding via the vtable gave better performance than late-binding via idispatch

2067125
boolean	int
pattern0	
relatively speaking the string concatenation in your code is probably going to be slower than the int and boolean comparison operations you have here

2067392
nsthread	cocoa
pattern10	
in cocoa is nsthread faster than pthreads

2069920
contains	elements
pattern0	
error sequences contains more than one elements

2070165
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern0	
i think you ll find asp.net-mvc fits requirements a and c much better than webforms too and both satisfy b

2070344
groovy	java
pattern10	
groovy has a more natural syntax for an average java programmer .so it is al.so a good choice.

2070755
pixels	line
pattern0	
should remove line that are less than two pixels wide

2071212
debugging	trace
pattern7	pattern0	
debugging becomes more problematic as stack trace become rather longer

2071329
csv	xml	export	csv
pattern3	pattern8	
i would recommend using csv for this as it may be more efficient than xml plus you have the advantage that the any decent database server has export capabilities for that .so that you don t need to program include anything new in java

2072005
postdata	request
pattern3	
alternatively if you would prefer sending postdata set the request body like this

2075060
interpolation	splines
pattern3	
if you are doing more than three points however i would strongly recommend using interpolation as using guassian elimination scale incredibly poorly o n 3 and splines or another interpolation technique are less likely to fail

2076025
calloc	malloc
pattern7	pattern0	
calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

2077157
tapestry	wicket
pattern8	
click is tapestry-like but much more easy than tapestry and wicket

2077947
python	c++	python	ruby
pattern10	
similarly in c++ it is much more apparent that primitive are just the compiler treating the same sets of bits in different ways as opposed to a language like python or ruby where everything is an object with its own distinct properties

2078317
cygwin	gnu
pattern0	
i tend to use the native versioning of emacs on windows in conjunction with the also native ports of gnu utils which are much faster though less complete than the cygwin ones

2078448
subscription	in-app
pattern4	
in-app purchase subscription do not auto-renew

2078613
gw-basic	basic
pattern0	
i think in my school gw-basic is still taught at 6-7 years of 10 and the reason of it is that little girls and boys can t understand anything harder than basic

2081767
scala	java
pattern4	
let s compare java and scala

2081967
arrays	loops
pattern7	
without a break statement and not being able to use the control variables after loops terminate is more of a restrictions than not being able to modify the control variables inside loops as it prevents some string and arrays process algorithms from being written in the obvious way

2083205
haskell	c++
pattern0	
i recommend spending .some quality time with haskell and fp in general before jumping in to develop a fully-fledged application .so you can get more familiarized with haskell since it s quite different from c++

2083832
g++	gcc
pattern4	
compare gcc -v file.cpp gcc can work with c++ files and g++ -v file.cpp to see the difference in linker cmd that often causes the first to fail for example

2087004
default-value	arguments
pattern0	
what i did was to set -xmx jvm arguments in eclipse.ini to a value that is lower than the default-value specified -xmx512m

2089141
carbon	cocoa
pattern7	
however cocoa is much easier to work with than the older c++ based carbon

2089297
perl	php
pattern7	pattern0	
because perl is ancient older than php jsp and asp which all came to being .when cgi was already old perl existed .when cgi was new and became fairly famo.us for being a very good language to serve dynamic webpage via the cgi

2089363
contains	elements
pattern0	
csla.dataportalexception dataportal.delete failed system.invalidoperationexception sequences contains more than one elements at system.linq.enumerable.singleordefault tsource ienumerable 1 source

2089364
mstest	nunit	mstest	mbunit	mbunit	nunit
pattern10	pattern7	
nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

2092445
contains	any
pattern10	
the contains problem is even harder as a points can legitimately lie within the blob but not within any of the individual curve

2092833
python	java	python	php
pattern10	
java and python are excellent web programming tools but php is more wide-used and is gaining more and more grounds in java s domain

2093636
contains	elements
pattern0	
you should only be calling doquicksort on a list if it contains more than one elements

2093976
one-to-many	entity
pattern3	
that thread recommends replacing one-to-many relationships with join tables because otherwise the one-to-many approach populate the many side table with columns that don t belong to that entity are there only for linking porpuses sic

2095668
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern10	
after reading the response i understood that asp.net-mvc is more like wpf asp.net webforms is like .net winforms in desktop development

2095727
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern7	
asp.net-mvc is the newer framework and simply offers an alternative to webforms

2096222
tortoisegit	svn
pattern10	
the compare dialog of tortoisegit is more about file and with git you have to compare two master branches not just two commit of the same branches both points to the same svn central repo

2096899
mod-rewrite	mod-alias
pattern0	
evidently though mod-alias can be somewhat faster than mod-rewrite all other things being equals of course

2097534
udp	tcp
pattern4	
the skype protocols prefers udp where possible and fallback to tcp

2098041
where-clause	sql
pattern10	
this is taken from this question sql filtering criterion in join criterion or where-clause which is more efficient

2098528
for-loop	loops
pattern10	
the class of problems you can solve with while loops is strictly more powerful than those you could have solved with the strict for-loop found in pascal

2101045
python	lua
pattern7	
writing c extensions in lua is easier than other languages say python

2102413
contains	elements
pattern4	
you could also write to only match elements that contains a in their text

2103122
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	linux	netbsd	linux
pattern10	
tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally

2103240
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
pattern8	
ruby - also a good choice look at hpricot a lot less mature than perl or python in terms of modules available

2104724
wicket	lift
pattern4	pattern2	
why did would you prefer wicket over lift

2105917
wicket	lift
pattern4	
even dave pollak once suggested this combinations if you prefer wicket to lift or have an existing wicket application you want to retrofit scala with

2106014
python	java
pattern7	pattern0	
even python is a better option than java imho

2106092
value	field
pattern0	
my alternative is to specify the additional parameters directly in the url.action call but that would required a lot more complexity with value coming in and out of jquery ajax through various hidden field which would be a huge mess.

2108646
pascal	delphi
pattern10	
pascal and also delphi is more centered on reliability than the c syntax languages which are more centered on character power as much information per character as possible

2108778
linked-list	heap
pattern0	
i ve certainly used them more than heap or explicit linked-list structures implicit linked-lists with next s are often useful though

2109891
python	java
pattern0	
python was the language google appengine was originally designed for and it has been supported for longer than java which only got include comparatively recently

2109891
python	java
pattern7	
but that doesn t mean java is a bad choice because it is not i just think python is a better choice in this instances

2109972
groovy	scala
pattern4	pattern2	
have to say that i would choose scala over groovy by a mile if mixing with wicket

2111393
autotools	cmake
pattern4	
i m not that good with autotools i prefer cmake but you seem quite against that

2114537
innodb	myisam
pattern0	
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

2115070
scheme	lisp
pattern8	
i ve also found scheme ides much more user-friendly than lisp s plt scheme is a good one

2115099
common-lisp	scheme
pattern7	
i suggest that you start with scheme and then move on to common-lisp as scheme is simpler

2115956
numeric	zero
pattern0	
if you re suffering numeric problems some of the eigenvalue will probably be barely smaller than zero

2116707
parsing	comma
pattern8	
a text file where a line is a key-value pair is more adequat with comma separator also the parsing will be easier

2118529
arrays	loops
pattern4	
another way to break this out without falling into the god methods trap would be to have a methods that runs a single loops and returns an arrays of matches and another that runs the search for each elements in the match arrays

2118719
postgresql	firebird	debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
pattern7	
firebird it s easier to administrate than postgresql and it does have various linux ports ubuntu fedora debian if you need n secure os selinux

2120749
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
pattern8	
i prefer to write general scripting in ruby because i find the language more intuitive than python perl or bash

2120947
python	ruby
pattern4	
i prefer ruby to python for general scripting and calculations

2120947
python	ruby
pattern0	
the other bad thing about ruby is that at the moment it is slower than python

2120947
python	ruby
pattern10	pattern0	
python is also more generally accepted for commercial at least more than ruby

2121177
defined	declare
pattern10	
a user defined types is even faster than a class but you can run into gotchas trying to pass around udts in classes they have to be declare in a non-class public module and even then they can give problems

2121301
32-bit	64bit
pattern7	
got the answer the mgtwitterengine wants a unsigned long but the iphone is 32-bit and .so the the 64bit numbers gets smaller and mgtwitterengine gets the wrong numbers

2121444
contains	elements
pattern0	
singleordefault will throw an error if your sequences contains more than one elements firstordefault does not

2121943
sql-server	oracle
pattern7	pattern4	
i have experience with various versioning of sql-server and oracle and my general sense is that deserving or not oracle probably has a better reputation for being the preferred database although i sense ms has been closing ground for some time and sometimes even claiming that it outperforms oracle in situations x y and whatever a close cousin to z

2121988
contains	any
pattern4	
i don t think you can match any whitespace since contains can t do regex

2121999
any	set
pattern0	
if you re coding while blend has severe ux shortcomings it has a pretty .solid feature set -- far more than any alternatives i ve seen .so far

2123261
python	ruby
pattern4	pattern2	
if you prefer python over ruby use django

2124096
32-bit	x86
pattern4	
.so i think you should choose any cpu if your dependencies can run in either environment but choose x86 if you have 32-bit dependencies

2124553
contains	any
pattern4	
i need to defined a java regex that will match any string that does not contains any of these

2124641
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
even if the machine s native words size is 64bit that only means that 64bit cpu operations won t be any slower than 32-bit operations

2126034
buildpath	libs
pattern4	
i believe it s right click on project choose buildpath libs per balus-c and then modify classpath

2126052
msbuild	nant
pattern0	
while i ve certainly spend quite a lot more time with msbuild vs nant .so i can t be a truly expert opinion from my experience if you are using visual-studio it is probably a better tracking to go down by staying with msbuild for building your project since it s most likely already in tune with your development-process

2126303
groovy	java
pattern0	
personally the demo didn t make me change my preferred toolkit grails but that s because i can achieve faster results with groovy parsing xml for example is much more painful in java than in groovy

2126392
python	ruby
pattern0	
the bigger problem with python and ruby is that they execute the code extremely slowly

2126531
appfuse	spring	wicket	spring
pattern4	
.so while you can compare spring web flow + spring and wicket + spring the later combo doesn t offer anything comparable to roo out of the box maybe appfuse or appfuse lighting but you didn t mention them and they are third-party project

2128135
font-size	height
pattern0	
the actual height of individual letters can be greater or less than the font-size though typically they will be less

2128783
beautifulsoup	lxml
pattern4	
since beautifulsoup is no longer being actively developed i would recommend lxml since it does all the things that beautifulsoup can do and a lot more

2128928
jquery	.post
pattern3	
i would recommend using jquery s .post function and serialization function together

2130687
python	ruby
pattern7	pattern7	
and yes i think ruby python produces better code but in the end any code can be made to look horrible and run slowly

2132060
chipmunk	box2d
pattern10	
box2d is more powerful but i think a little harder to use than chipmunk

2132732
children	tree
pattern7	
if we consider the problem of count the levels of a tree the answer is that the height of the tree is 1 more than the height of the tallest deepest of the children and the height of a leaf is 1

2132990
associations	model
pattern7	
the associations of particular formats with portions of your text model is much less intensive

2133018
inline-code	code-behind
pattern4	pattern2	
this makes me think that performance and maintainability is not always the main reason why you choose inline-code over code-behind

2134098
installation	building
pattern4	
for most universe pick installation the programmers usually building some standardized shorthand ways to make ad hoc access to data via recall retrieve english list easier

2135743
silverlight	wpf
pattern0	
wpf xbaps can provide more features than silverlight because xbaps can make use of full .net

2136380
python	ruby
pattern7	
i m assuming it s possible because anything possible in python seems even easier in ruby now but can t find documentation of it

2137156
eof	eol
pattern7	
is there something like a eof thats more like a eol

2137586
simpletest	phpunit
pattern4	
i would recommend phpunit but there is also simpletest which i know some people prefer

2138392
multiplication	bit-shift	bit-shift	bit-masks
pattern0	
bit-shift are useful because they convey semantics better .when working with bit-masks and they are on x86 at least faster than multiplication

2139470
solaris	linux
pattern4	
runs on win linux and solaris

2139921
jquery	.post
pattern3	
i would recommend using jquery s .post function or a similar ajax function

2140552
groovy	java
pattern7	pattern0	
although java is considerable faster than groovy this doesn t necessarily mean your .app will be faster if written in java as the bottleneck could likely be the database rather than code execution

2140739
oracle	mysql
pattern10	
mysql will gracefully write the broken character into the table - maybe oracle is more strict

2140949
jquery	dojo
pattern3	
although form the way you describe your app-id have to recommend using dojo instead as much as i adore jquery

2141113
digits	zero
pattern10	
in your first example we count 6 zero from the backend .so we could safely divide by 10 6+4 to get not more than 4 fractions digits which is more than we actually need

2141715
contains	any
pattern8	
if you want your comparison object to contains mutable state then the problem is more complex as any copies of your comparison object need to shared the mutable state

2141762
prism	mef
pattern7	
i personally think combining prism with mef makes this types of situation easier though since mef allows for easier dynamic extensibility for roles

2142261
windows-xp	windows
pattern0	
windows 7 file search seems worse than windows-xp file search

2142823
e-commerce	product
pattern4	
as such if one tends to use everywhere i can do anything via get that i could via .post which means setting up tags on my malicious site that cause users logged into your e-commerce module to purchase product silently or i can cause them to click on links that will result in dangerous actions or the revelation of sensitive information probably to me

2143798
markup	xhtml
pattern3	
some people recommend serving xhtml with a variables content-type dependent on the browser s accept request header but i wouldn t as it means you have two sets of very slightly different markup styling and scripting rules to adhere to and it makes caching less effective

2145291
value	field
pattern0	
all said if you don t plan doing any serious sutff at least milion of recording in mytable or more than 50 value in one multival field you can keep doing what you ve been doing for now

2146255
python	ruby
pattern4	
do you prefer python or ruby

2148132
getter	setter
pattern10	
i think children class should have the way to handle directly this protected attributes but it may not be a good practice if getter or setter contains more code.

2149193
concurrent-programming	java.util.concurrent
pattern4	
if you need guidance and a reference for the bookshelf i recommend concurrent-programming in java by doug lea who was responsible for util.concurrent and the jsr that brought us java.util.concurrent

2149820
constructor	object
pattern7	
by passing object instances to your constructor it makes it easier to perform unit tests

2151504
json	xml
pattern10	
sending textual data xml json etc. is more intuitive and easier to develop in many circumstances if performance is not critical

2152063
dictionary	arrays	linked-list	arrays	linked-list	dictionary	linked-list	tree
pattern10	
if a tree is implements as linked-list rather than an arrays the tree is usually more spaces efficient than a dictionary

2152421
httpwebrequest	webclient
pattern7	pattern0	
you can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but inorder to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and overrides the protected getwebrequest methods

2153892
emacs	vim
pattern0	
i ve used vim for 10+ years but never really into vim scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where vim was weaker than emacs

2154572
subtraction	addition
pattern0	pattern0	
source unary + - bind tighter than addition subtraction + - and associate right

2155555
contains	elements
pattern0	
it is useful in situations .when the specifications string contains more than one elements eg.

2155881
scala	java
pattern10	
it s not really a fault of scala as it s simple manifestation that java is a less expressive language

2156298
key-value	key
pattern0	
an arrays can t have more than one key-value pair with the same key

2156525
any	set
pattern4	
match any single character within the specified range for example a-f or set for example abcdef

2156525
any	set
pattern4	
match any single character not within the specified range for example a - f or set for example abcdef

2157980
mouseenter	mouseover
pattern0	
the mouseenter event is usually a better choice than mouseover

2158771
scala	java
pattern4	
scala beautiful mix of oo and fp could possibly overtake java as premier language on the jvm in a decade or 2

2159041
.net	wcf
pattern4	
i would recommend wcf as the first thing to consider for all communication on windows if using .net as its built for this kind of thing and its relatively easy to use

2159181
cursor	row
pattern7	
it would be best if at all possible to join to the table but if you must do something with each row individually a fast-forward readonly cursor is actually faster than looping yourself

2159506
binary-tree	nodes	binary-tree	tree
pattern7	
that means that each nodes holds more than one item technically they hold n items and n+1 pointers a binary-tree being a special case of a 1-way multi-way tree with 1 item and 2 pointers

2160308
buffering	streaming
pattern7	pattern0	
some care is needed in case a line in the streaming is longer than your buffering the leftover will remain in the streaming which might not be what you want

2161617
xsd	xml
pattern10	
xml and xsd is more flexible regarding evolution of the schema than types and serialization in object-oriented languages

2161869
cherrypy	django
pattern10	
although django provides heap more functionality out of the box default admin interface widget on your webpage using cherrypy seems like just another import that has very good often surprising you with extra functionality

2162447
json	xml
pattern10	pattern10	
oh wait json xml is less bytes than html

2163475
malloc	free
pattern0	
garbage-collection may be slower than malloc and free for programs that allocate at once all the memory they need and work with that

2163910
contains	any
pattern4	
you have 123 you are saying i want all strings which begin with anything then have 123 and then end with anything. this will match any string which contains 123 at any points

2164943
entity-framework	nhibernate
pattern2	
for .net 4.0 choose between nhibernate and entity-framework

2165425
fadeout	fadein
pattern0	
more detail set the amount of time the animation will take for fadeout and use a delay for the fadein animation that is longer than the fadeout animation time

2166141
windows-mobile	windows-ce
pattern10	
as far as i know windows-mobile 6.1 is a more specialized versioning of windows-ce to target mobile-devices

2166171
margins	padding
pattern0	
i think this solution is prettier than setting margins padding

2166477
restful-url	rest
pattern7	
this artificial notion of a restful-url has done more to prevent people from learning rest than soap ever did

2169104
perl	php	python	java	python	php	python	perl
pattern0	
i know that i like python better than both perl and php and java for that matter

2169404
python	php
pattern8	
i move to django because python is truly a more compelling language than php

2170138
perl	php
pattern10	
as far as database scripting languages that postgresql offers pl perl is far more developed than pl php and pl perlu brings cpan to postgresql

2170138
perl	php
pattern0	
perl historically has done database access and use much better than php

2170649
atomicity	deadlock
pattern4	
mostly data races deadlock and atomicity violations kill your multithreading program

2171388
png	gif
pattern7	
choose the correct types of image extension sometimes gif or png delivers better results then jpg s

2171785
python	c++
pattern7	
you can easily program scripting with python which is way easier than mel or c++

2173356
emacs	vim
pattern10	
i ve been using emacs for few weeks and it s been great .so far - coming from vim was easier than i expected actually - emacs keyboard shortcuts feel more.

2173609
getter	setter
pattern0	
properties declarations are nothing more than compiler-generated getter and setter methods

2173619
declarative	imperative
pattern4	
imperative runtime code trumps declarative settings

2176622
scala	java
pattern8	
scala is statically typed but more concise than java

2177745
.when	ready
pattern4	
object need to be destroy .when you are ready with them using .free which call the destructor .destroy or freeandnil

2179197
spaces	output
pattern10	
in fact simple information theory tells us that in some cases any compression algorithm will produce output that takes up more spaces than you started with

2179475
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	
for public facing website i would personally choose asp.net-mvc because i find the development cycle shorter more productive more flexible and more maintainable than an asp.net webforms application

2180078
binary-tree	tree
pattern10	
this o 1 performance gets a bit eroded .when considering the extra time to dealing with collision and such but on the whole the hashtable is very fast for storing and retrieving items as opposed to a systemd based solely on the original key-value which would then typically be o log n with for example a binary-tree although such tree is more efficient space-wise

2180143
groovy	java
pattern10	pattern8	
i m trying to take advantage of the fact that groovy is more dynamic than java

2180178
rollback	commit
pattern0	
there s only one level of rollback available .so if you did the remove with more than one commit this won t completely undo your change

2181296
installation	environment
pattern10	
installation is faster startup more than acceptable and the environment are no longer .so polluted by micro.soft s deliberately bad viewmodel

2182102
comet	chat
pattern0	
comet would typically result in lower bandwidth usage assuming less than 1 chat messages per second per chat on average owing to the fact that it will only query the server once per messages sent

2182823
json	xml
pattern10	
xml and json is much more compact

2182823
json	xml
pattern4	pattern2	
does anybody know if there are reasons not to choose json over xml

2183293
debugging	trace
pattern0	
i think you ll have to subclassing the logger class and add a methods called trace which basically call logger.log with a level lower than debugging

2183918
websphere	ibm
pattern0	
other solution is to upgrade websphere with newer libs as per ibm websphere upgrade service instructions

2185807
z-index	tooltip
pattern10	
i don t think this is a great solution living with the tooltip is better but if you set an absolutely positioning div with a solid background set to very low opacity 1 and a higher z-index then your image you should not get a tooltip

2186368
environment	building
pattern7	
re creating a building environment only becomes easier if you do not need a codeigniter tool as an additional component

2186835
webforms	asp.net
pattern3	
i really would not recommend using asp.net s webforms built-in support for javascript datepicker but that s just me

2188918
katex	latex
pattern4	
as of 5-feb-2015 i d switching to recommend katex - most performant javascript latex libs from khan academy

2189086
value	field
pattern7	pattern7	
.when you receive the updates for an edit checked whether the requested_at form field value is less than the stored object s updatesd_at value

2192772
.net	wcf
pattern7	
i understand that add service reference wcf is newer are there any disadvantages to using it over system.web.service or is it now the preferred way of consuming soap service in .net

2193943
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	pattern0	
mysql is easier than postgresql but it doesn t really matter either way

2194982
difference	zero
pattern7	pattern0	
then you would have to perform a paired test to checked if the median of the difference high - rest is less or equals to zero h0 against the alternative hypothesis that the median of difference is greater than zero h1

2198143
multiplication	multiplying
pattern7	
multiplication is slightly harder just multiplying two scale numbers and then divide by your scale factors

2200965
json	xml
pattern4	
i would personally recommend json instead of xml for encoding the payload -- see here for an xml-rpc-like json-based rpc server and client for example -- but i guess that using the xml-rpc server and client that come with python standard-library is even simpler thus probably closer to what you re looking for

2203415
python	java
pattern10	
java s bytecode is at a fairly low-level while python is much more high level

2203949
any	set	default-value	default
pattern2	
for doing that you should set the default-value of the exposed filtering in some combinations that doesn t return anything in this way .when the user visits the page they will not see any result and those filtering will have the value that you choose by default

2206181
unsigned	zero
pattern0	
unsigned means you only want to store numbers greater than zero

2207296
alfresco	nuxeo
pattern2	
at the moment i am in doubth to choose between alfresco and nuxeo

2208046
jax-ws	cxf
pattern4	
one more reason to stay away from axis2 imho and to prefer jax-ws ri or cxf

2208325
contains	any	contains	elements
pattern7	pattern0	
i suspect the fact that any looks faster than contains .when the elements is seen very early is that the benchmarking can t reflect it easily since they are very close

2208348
contains	any
pattern7	
any is slower because contains is tailored to the specific containers you re using arraylist etc .so it doesn t have the overhead of firing up an ienumerable calling movenext all the time etc

2208680
contains	any
pattern10	pattern10	
the reason that any is faster with small collectionss and in your case with a null value at the start of the collections has to do with the cast to icollections that the enumerable.contains does .when you do the cast to icollections yourself you ll see that the call to contains is faster than any

2210577
display	width
pattern0	
notice that the width is fixed and it can scroll to the right in case the user types a title that is longer than can display in the viewable area

2211122
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
pattern4	pattern4	
we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

2212005
tuples	sorted	sorted	lookup
pattern0	
consider using shelve instead -- that will use little memory since the data reside on disk and still offer pretty spiffy lookup performance not as fast as an in-memory dictionary of course but for a large amount of data it will be much faster than lookup on a list of tuples even a sorted one can ever be

2212354
constructor	object	function-call	inline
pattern10	
the object is more simple but i wonder if there s a way to do the struct member initialization right inline with the function-call without giving the struct a constructor

2212804
any	set
pattern4	
antiwords is a free cross-platform windows and linux words reader that extraction plain text from words document this will destroy any formatting i have worked with it it s fiddly to set up for non-english character sets but works o.k

2213902
security	owasp
pattern4	
if you re particularly interested in web security i heavily recommend owasp the open web application security project

2213961
google-chrome	firefox
pattern0	
i inspected the range object in both google-chrome and firefox and then noticed that firefox s range object is far richer than google-chrome s

2214345
hash-collision	key
pattern4	
also as sellibitze says an operators is needed to compare key in case of hash-collision

2215299
controllers	routes
pattern3	
and i lied i wouldn t go with this because i prefer specifying controllers specific routes using attributes directly on actions omitted that because it seems more advanced

2217080
ruby-on-rails	django
pattern7	
this is something that required slightly more work in django and considering i m putting mostly emphasis on the api portion of the .app ruby-on-rails makes more sense this time around

2218026
post-increment	pre-increment
pattern0	
whatâ s the points of post-increment ++ operators having higher precedence than pre-increment ++ operators

2218248
python	ruby
pattern4	
on balance i prefer ruby myself but there are a lot of things i admire about python and i write a lot of python on account of google-app-engine

2218641
python	java
pattern0	
python was invented at the beginning of the 1990 s making it even older than java

2219546
contains	elements
pattern4	
the long bio will obviously display the whole bio but the short bio would grab elements in the list and make them bold and contract the div to now only contains those list elements

2219642
python	lua
pattern4	
i have written elsewhere about why i prefer lua to python

2220227
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes	average	max
pattern7	pattern0	
more or less in plain english -- it will be more efficient to use the linked-list because rather than having a bunch of empty nodess ie empty indexes in the arrays if your average is lower than the max taking up memory you only alloc spaces for a nodes in a linked-list .when you re actually filling in a value

2221406
mongodb	mysql	mongodb	couchdb	key-value-store	redis
pattern0	
if you grow big enough to make database size a performance issue after many million recording and lots of queries a second consider table partition or maybe replacing the biggest table with a key-value-store couchdb mongodb redis tokyo-cabinet etc 6 which can be a little faster than mysql but a lot easier to distribute for performance

2221787
postgresql	mysql
pattern8	
the question is is mysql somehow more resistant than postgresql to sql-injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case

2221796
z-index	overlay
pattern0	
to achieve the desired effect wrap div2 in another div with the highest z-index give div2 a lower z-index than your overlay

2222911
contains	any
pattern4	
i want to create a pointcut that matches any methods in my web controllers that contains a modelmap

2223412
if-statement	loops
pattern7	
it is o n like an if-statement it doesn t really work because you could have overlapping conditional is unpredictable because you do not know what order you will do loops and is much less clear than the equivalent if-statement

2224831
jruby	mri
pattern0	
the jruby runtime alone is already pretty heavy much heavier than mri

2225196
getter	setter
pattern3	
i think most people will recommend using setter getter

2225274
version-control	bazaar
pattern10	
bazaar is a more flexible version-control systemd than subversion and might suit your needs better

2225598
zen-cart	magento
pattern7	pattern0	
alternatively zen-cart looks simpler than magento but without some of the flexibility

2226130
communication	messages
pattern7	
if the communication takes more than 60 seconds it timeout with this messages

2226273
ruby-on-rails	django
pattern4	
if you hit the page 10 000 time with a load generator at varying concurrency levels you will probably find that hphp will outperform django or ruby-on-rails - that is to say it can serve rendering more pages per second and keep up with your traffic a bit better

2230682
groovy	scala
pattern4	pattern4	
for example if you choose groovy you re implicit also choosing the grails web framework if you choose scala you re choosing lift etc

2231730
python	ruby
pattern0	
it tends to be in the area of 10x faster than python and 100x faster than ruby

2233576
any	set
pattern4	
i have a set in scala i can choose any implementation as i am creating the set

2234226
kdevelop	cdt
pattern7	
eclipse cdt has better code-completion than visual-studio netbeans kdevelop or xcode in my experience

2235053
playlist	playing
pattern8	
if you use the .application music player it stops the currently playing song and .when you quit it stops playing but the .app music player does give you more control over playlist

2235295
constructor	object	derived-class	base-class
pattern4	
.when you destroy derived-class object using base-class pointers then it will lead to partials destructor of the object only base-class constructor is invoked if base-class ctor is not virtual

2236186
arguments	undefined
pattern0	
.when you call a function with fewer arguments than the arguments list in the function statement lists the unpassed arguments are set to undefined

2236307
sql-server	mysql
pattern8	
right now im leaning more to mysql mainly because scaling the sql-server might get pricey and because the people within my company are more familiar with mysql including me

2236539
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	
more complex applications are bound to be using asp.net-mvc today smaller ones will most likely prefer webforms but remember that smaller applications represent the majority of the job market

2236756
tuples	any
pattern4	
i learned through f# a lot of things about lazy-evaluation evalution lists and sequences all of which you could pick any language for with good support for lists tuples and .so on like any functional language i guess but if you pick f# all of this will be very useful in c# too

2237849
derived-class	base-class
pattern7	
the interface required three slots the base-class provides more and the new methods of the derived-class provide two more

2237879
haskell	scheme
pattern2	
haskell and f# are statically typed which is a big advantage for real-life project but imho they have a little too much syntax and are not as easy to pick up as scheme

2238063
strtol	atoi
pattern7	
the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi

2239021
stress-testing	loadrunner
pattern7	
microsoft s free application for stress-testing wcat is underpowered and buggy but the full blown test edition goes up against product like loadrunner but is easier to use better-integrated with vs asp.net and for much less money per virtual user

2239745
compression	streaming
pattern7	
this should result in better total compression even though the intermediate streaming is 12 larger

2240853
c++	lua
pattern4	
i recommend lua as its fast and integrated with c++ easier than any other scripting-language

2241092
json	xml
pattern7	pattern0	
json takes less spaces than an xml or plist feed but needs a little more thinking ahead of time to get the structure right

2242618
double	int
pattern7	
using and at the same time to checked equality on a int results in slower code because it takes two comparisons instead of one taking the double amount of time

2245273
beautifulsoup	feedparser
pattern7	
you could use beautifulsoup - but feedparser is much better geared towards rss handing

2246210
sql-server	oracle
pattern0	
sql-server takes care of automagically updating the view .when there is a data change which in its opinion would change the contents of the view .so in this respect it s less flexible than oracle materialize

2248328
put	get
pattern4	
if generator by the matches for this regex was not the whole capture - then a single-call replace would not be possible - and your question would probably be asking why doesn t the whole match get put into instead of the other way round

2250534
http-unit	selenium
pattern3	
i would prefer using selenium rather than http-unit or htmlunit because you can test it as if you are testing from a browser

2251277
value	field
pattern7	
use query that queries items where modified field has value greater than follow link for important info to query correctly what you want

2252740
value	field
pattern4	
i was thinking there might be a way to grab field value and put them in attributes .so .something like this

2252951
set	bag
pattern7	
a set or bag is easier to map in hibernate and required fewer database columns

2253171
groovy	java
pattern4	
what kinds of things would you not do in groovy but prefer java instead

2253314
groovy	java
pattern4	
what kinds of things would you not do in groovy but prefer java instead

2253314
groovy	java
pattern8	
i write everything in groovy because i m much more productive with groovy than java and i enjoy groovy programming a lot more

2253532
dictionary	arrays
pattern0	
i don t specify this .so i wonder what would happen if there were more than one dictionary or maybe a dictionary and a mutable arrays

2254734
javassist	cglib
pattern2	
another similar example is hibernate that lets you choose between cglib and javassist in hibernate-core in the same way

2254966
glfw	glut
pattern7	
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts .so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle

2254966
glut	fltk
pattern0	
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implements than glut itself

2255263
haskell	lisp	haskell	scheme	common-lisp	lisp	common-lisp	haskell	common-lisp	scheme	scheme	lisp
pattern8	
and again clojure is much more pragmatic than both other functional languages like haskell and other lisp like scheme and much simpler and more modern than common-lisp .so it is a natural fit for rubyists

2255716
oracle	mysql
pattern4	
mysql can certainly match or beat oracle in speed

2256282
calloc	malloc
pattern4	pattern2	
if you belong to the second camp which apparently you do then you prefer malloc over calloc

2256479
uppercase	tolower
pattern10	
further uppercase comparison is more optimized than tolower if that tiny degree of performance matters

2257110
sql-server-express	sql-server
pattern0	
but unless your query would exceed any of those limits i don t see any reason why sql-server-express would be any slower than sql-server enterprise edition

2258346
cargo	maven
pattern0	
section 4.13 of better building with maven describe using cargo to deploy a .war specified using maven coordinates but that s serious overkill given that we re using jetty

2259111
perl	php	perl	c++	perl	ruby	ruby	php
pattern0	
as c++ you may have easier time with perl since it is fairly easy for c++ person to pick up but i m not familiar enough with php ruby to know their up downsides

2259414
cargo	maven
pattern0	
section 4.13 of better building with maven describe using cargo to deploy a .war specified using maven coordinates

2259852
gnome	kde
pattern4	
in general you can choose gnome or kde with any distro and you can even install both

2261289
cos	sin
pattern0	pattern0	
no for-loops or math.pow which is amazingly slow way slower than sin cos etc

2261806
selected	cell
pattern7	
i just noticed that if i go to format cell and selected custom format and put say 0000 to the format any numbers that i put in the cell it is is less than 4 digitss it still maintain the 4 digits length with the leading 0 like 0001 0099 0120 9999

2262152
division	modulo
pattern0	
if .so this should work and it should al.so be a lot quicker than using modulo and division

2263519
user-permissions	administration
pattern2	
the error messages you are seeing is often due to a user-permissions problem you need to run sql-server surface area configuration tool with admin permissions choose run as administration .when launchd the tool

2263908
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	
.so much of what .net offers is going to be irrelevant if you pick webforms or asp.net-mvc mainly due to the fact that they shared .so much of the same code and features

2264679
perl	awk	python	perl
pattern0	
i do not think that perl or awk will be faster than python if you are just recoding your current algorithm into a different language

2266276
spring	guice	wicket	spring
pattern4	pattern2	
if you like the do-it-all-in-java philosophy that wicket follows then you might prefer guice over spring

2266320
pixels	line
pattern0	
it s slow but at high resolution it may still be faster than count pixels because the cost of count pixels grows quadratically with resolution but the numbers of line segments on the perimeter grows linearly.

2268738
expression	evaluation
pattern7	
conversion as if by assignment to the types of the function is required if the return expression has a different types than the function but not if the return expression has a wider value only because of wide evaluation

2268807
asp.net-mvc	wcf
pattern4	
normally i would say wcf for any kind of hosted serice but in the specific case for restful service using json as a serialization mechanism i prefer asp.net-mvc which i will refer to as asp.net for the remainder of this answer

2268957
windows-server	windows	compatibility	platform
pattern0	
you haven t mentioned what your windows platform limitations are but if you don t need compatibility with older versioning than windows-server 2003 or vista on the client side you can use the interlockedexchange64 function to exchange a 64bit value

2269289
value	field
pattern10	
i need to conditional highlight the rows of the datalist depending on an arbitrary value in the data such as if a date field is less then somedate

2269313
haskell	ocaml
pattern10	pattern0	
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libs are avaliable via hackage .so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factors

2269993
haskell	ocaml
pattern8	
you will also likely find the performance characteristics of your ocaml code more intuitive than haskell because of haskell s lazy-evaluation

2270366
gnome	kde
pattern4	
perhaps using compile-time switches for each platform...win kde gnome mac or use the one that is already pre-defined

2272341
bazaar	git
pattern3	
i would recommend using git bazaar or another vcs which doesn t required you to tell it .when you move sources around

2275396
credentials	security
pattern4	
worst case i could just frame in the report with some code and pass a universal set of credentials to the report server but i lose security granularity...i could pass the current set of credentials the same way but then i have to keep the two db s synched

2277052
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	pattern0	
postgresql is older than mysql .so it might have influenced them

2277383
rad-controls	telerik
pattern0	
i don t know how strong the support of rad-controls over here is but it can t be worse than telerik there i m lucky to get a response in 2-3 days .so i m going to try here first

2277387
explode	implode
pattern4	
i have an ugly solution that works explode the search string into an arrays of wordss lookup each words in the arrays of stop-wordss unset them if there is a match implode the remaining wordss and finally run a regex to add the boolean mode formatting

2277474
any	set	daemons	systemd
pattern0	
use daemons mode and then simply touching the wsgi scripting file .when an atomicity set of changes have been completed isn t that hard and certainly safer than a systemd which restart arbitrarily .when it detection any single change

2277518
children	nodes
pattern7	
order prperty the elements at any nodes is bigger or smaller if smallest has highest priority than its two children nodess

2277518
children	nodes
pattern7	pattern0	
since the only guarantee about order that is made that a nodes has a higher priority than its children the nodess in each level will be in no particular order

2278301
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
i ve used both db systemd before and while postgresql is great for it s licensing terms and standards compliance mysql is definitely easier to get up and running quickly

2278301
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	pattern7	pattern0	pattern0	
i don t want this to be a mysql postgresql is better than postgresql mysql debate

2278522
pointers	stack
pattern7	
datamap.initdatacollections shouldn t store pointers to the collections instances because the lifetime of the collections instances created on a stack is less than the lifetime of the datamap instances

2278625
display	width
pattern0	
though putting the imageview holding the image in a linearlayout scale the image to the width of the dialog the problem is that i need to display the image in a dialog but the image is very high resolution and hence is far bigger than the width of the dialog.

2278833
matplotlib	chaco	interactive	chaco
pattern10	
chaco is designed to be very interactive and is significantly more .so than matplotlib

2279388
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	pattern2	
as a developer i prefer postgresql over mysql as the latter behaves different from versioning to versioning they re still playing catchup to the sql standards and probably always will

2279388
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	pattern2	
if you actually prefer mysql over postgresql i d lay out a migration plan just to be ready if need arises as a kind of lazy-evaluation proactiveness .

2280675
udp	tcp
pattern7	pattern0	
al.so see this other .so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp

2281068
swing	swt
pattern10	
swt has a more platform-specific look about it but java ships with swing built-in there s no messing about with external libs as with swt although the use of eclipse may make that much easier i still develop quite a bit of my stuff from the command-line unfortunately

2281159
pixels	line
pattern10	
for testing i simply stepped through the pixelss and if the current pixels is brighter than the one before the brightest points of that line will be set to the current pixels

2282043
constructor	object
pattern4	
in this methods we initializer a win object and as a consequence the constructor of the class will be execute

2282646
difference	zero
pattern0	
.when there is a difference of greater than zero prefix advance both pointers along by that many positioning copying characters as you go

2283347
python	c++	vb.net	vba	ironpython	ironruby
pattern4	
if you have experience with c++ then c# would be natural to you but if you re comfortable with vba you can try vb.net but if you prefer python then there is ironpython or can give a try to ironruby but the best of all is you can mix them all as they apply to different parts of your project

2284148
google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	pattern0	
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image-comparison pays off yay

2284494
ruby	php
pattern0	pattern0	
what makes java better than php ruby python..etc for banks or enterprises

2285314
tcpdf	fpdf
pattern0	
if anyone has .some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf .so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf

2285452
eclipse-rcp	swt
pattern4	
the main reason to choose swt is if you want to building your application on the eclipse-rcp framework where you get a dockable views editor plugins mechanism automatic updates user-roles

2285658
gearman	worker
pattern7	
of course they are both really the same thing but the way it works out for me is that if you are trying to fan out work to be done and the worker can work independently gearman is the better way to do it

2287556
punctuation	comma
pattern4	
edit thinking about it that won t match punctuation comma apostrophes

2287642
coalesce	isnull
pattern0	
i understand the difference between these functions but my question is .when checked for a single null value would isnull be any quicker than using coalesce

2287656
coalesce	isnull
pattern0	
isnull will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than coalesce

2287673
coalesce	isnull
pattern4	pattern2	pattern8	
to prefer isnull over coalesce .when given the choice is that isnull tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than coalesce

2288413
openrasta	wcf
pattern7	pattern0	pattern0	
building restful service with openrasta is much simpler than with wcf in my experience

2288879
udp	tcp
pattern10	
see this reply what happens .when tcp udp server is publishing faster than client is consuming

2288921
executable	jar
pattern10	pattern10	
making a jar that depends on other jar executable is more tricky

2289576
arrays	loops
pattern7	
i have an arrays that gets deeper every loops

2290354
haskell	ocaml
pattern10	pattern10	
keith pointed out that haskell has a more powerful types systemd but it can also be said that ocaml has a more powerful module systemd than haskell

2290354
haskell	ocaml
pattern0	
as others have pointed out ocaml s learning curve will be lower than haskell s

2290873
udp	tcp
pattern0	
tcp is reliable but slower than udp while udp is not safe and i have to implements my own fault-handling codes

2290931
icmp	udp
pattern0	
an icmp packets has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than udp

2291387
lookup	any
pattern0	
lookup fft on wikipedia if you don t understand the relationship between the sampling frequency and the resultant frequency bins or if you don t understand the detriment of having too low a sampling frequency. this will probably meet your needs because the fundamental component usually has greater energy than any other component

2292967
gentoo	linux	firefox	opera
pattern0	
updates under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd

2294832
google-chrome	opera
pattern0	
also nice to know is the fact that the latest versioning of google-chrome and also opera don t know since .when but longer than google-chrome supports userscripts out of the box no need to install any add-on

2295973
python	php
pattern7	
you won t find many built-in python equivalent for built-in php html functions since python is more of a general-purpose scripting-language than a web development language

2297317
ecdsa	rsa
pattern7	pattern0	
from the central authority points of view ecdsa also allows better performance on my pc using a single core openssl crunches out more than 6500 ecdsa signature per second in the p-192 nist curve and only 1145 rsa signature per second with a 1024-bit key

2297458
overlap	margins
pattern7	
in your case because #preamble s margins-bottom and #container s margins-top overlap they get collapse .so the effective margins is the bigger one in this case 100px

2299570
logout	login
pattern7	
make a logical setting like if the difference between two login is more than the daily working hours then the application can understand that the user forgot to logout

2299988
sql-server	oracle
pattern4	
we want for our report to look-and-feel as though they are a part of our application and we will not required sql-server the customer can choose oracle

2300976
entity-framework	ado.net
pattern4	
why will we prefer ado.net entity-framework

2301691
contains	set	value	field
pattern0	
if i use set as the datatype of this field then it can contains more than one value from the list

2302260
virtualbox	esx	virtualbox	vmware	vmware	esx
pattern4	
because of compatibility with vmware infrastructure esx i would prefer vmware for headless server operations and virtualbox for anything that required user integration photoshop gui etc

2303940
google-maps	bing-maps
pattern0	
bing-maps platform previously microsoft virtual earth should be a cheaper option than google-maps for commercial use can printing routes between nodes supports distance calculation and provides a javascript api

2303951
google-maps	bing-maps
pattern0	
bing-maps as suggested before me may also be an option one of my customers chose them because the entry fee was much less than google-maps

2305116
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
pattern7	
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

2305597
gnome	xfce
pattern4	
if you prefer gnome or xfce gtk qt can also use your gtk themes

2308120
png	gif
pattern0	
convert it to png 10-30 smaller than gif on average

2310380
oracle	mysql
pattern0	
i know oracle better than mysql but i guess in this case it s the same

2315102
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
pattern4	
i think it doesn t work entirely correctly in ie6 but it is fine in ie7-8 firefox safari win opera google-chrome

2315512
margins	padding
pattern0	pattern0	
simpler than padding margins in some cases to shift stuff around a bit i think maybe it s just opinion

2315847
udp	mtu
pattern0	
udp uses datagram chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story

2320135
udp	tcp
pattern10	
udp is a connectionless protocols which has zero error-checking it is that is the trade-off with tcp it is faster than tcp

2321232
malloc	free
pattern4	
additionally i try to add the code to delete destroy free as soon as i add the code to create init malloc

2322091
javafx	swing
pattern7	
the integration of swing components within javafx is easier

2324076
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

2324403
subtraction	division	subtraction	addition	addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	addition
pattern10	pattern8	pattern10	
multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

2328780
any	set
pattern4	
certainly you only need to compare any points to its neighbours and only if they re already in the set which will save you a huge numbers of comparisons

2329664
hash	md5	salt	md5
pattern10	pattern10	
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

2331561
delphi	c++
pattern4	
and you will be able to mix and match delphi and c++ as you want in the same project

2331766
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
in that case the answer is basically both. normally int won t be bigger than a processor register unless that s smaller than 16-bit but it could be smaller a 32-bit compiler running on a 64bit processor

2334903
font-size	width	text-align	font-size	text-align	width
pattern10	
text-align justify works best with small font-size with slightly higher line-height - line-height is for readbility and smaller font-size puts more characters in one line abstract characters-per-line width therefore gaps between words justified text looks better

2335416
contains	elements
pattern0	
most important lesson i ve learned is that a ring buffering of can never contains more than elements

2336552
png	gif
pattern7	
png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not

2336560
png	gif
pattern7	pattern7	
compared to gif png offers better compression larger pallette and more features including transparency

2336727
put	get
pattern4	
from the results get all the user_id s that match put them in an arrays

2338532
implements	extends
pattern4	
i recommend extends one of the list classes that has already implements a dataprovider properties it s a lot to tackle

2339286
environment	execution
pattern4	
in the jre tab choose execution environment

2339570
python	java
pattern10	pattern0	
instead python has much more transparency and easier introspection than java

2340832
.net	wcf
pattern7	
speed wise - maybe but take note that .net 3.5 is even bigger than 1.1 since it include new technologies such as linq wcf cf wpf etc.

2340843
contains	any
pattern4	
all the char listed in the after will be treated literally and this will match any string that contains char other than

2342496
silverlight	wpf
pattern7	
silverlight 4 brings more parity to the party in that it allows you to run as a trusted desktop .app and brings more of the wpf functionality in but still not equals

2342979
python	perl
pattern3	
personnaly i prefer using perl or python for such tasks

2344081
python	c++
pattern0	
slower than c++ there is ongoing work to make python faster

2344106
python	c++
pattern0	
i like them both but i can get python code working a lot faster than c++

2346116
hide	show
pattern4	
while i understand the class named parent child - to sort the reply to thread i didn t figure out why the id s are continuous - maybe to choose hide show specific comments

2346607
python	c++
pattern7	
this does essentially the same thing as the python does and is about the same length as well -- the c++ has more syntactic fluff but they have exactly the same numbers of line-of-code that really do anything though there s no question that the individual line in the c++ versioning are longer

2347286
while-loop	for-loop
pattern10	
there s no points in using a for-loop a while-loop is more readable

2347569
silverlight	wpf
pattern0	
if you have a wpf .app you have more than what silverlight can give to you

2347906
log4net	nlog
pattern2	
i believe you can choose between nlog and log4net

2348771
decrement	increment
pattern0	
now to replace the duplicates traversal your numbers arrays and if the current numbers appears more than once decrement its count and replace it with a numbers that appears 0 time and increment that numbers s count

2349298
updating	updates
pattern7	
as with any of such approach this improves reading data because they are readily available but updating data becomes more costly because you need to updates the replicated or precomputed data

2349624
union-all	union
pattern10	
union-all is faster than union but won t remove duplicates

2349847
persistent	transient
pattern7	
memcached data lives in memory and isn t persistent .so is for more transient data

2350341
.net	wcf
pattern0	
see peer-to-peer programming with wcf and .net 3.5

2350342
push	pull
pattern7	pattern0	
the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow

2350959
ecdsa	rsa
pattern0	
if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signature - ecdsa signature are considerably smaller than rsa signature of an equivalent security factors

2351557
contains	elements
pattern0	
here s what i have .so far which works for me if the linearlayout contains more than one elements

2354091
udp	tcp
pattern4	pattern2	
why would i choose udp over tcp for a serious high-performance server with the added overhead of messages

2355827
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
pattern0	
once you have this you should be able to have more than one sqldatareader shared on the same sqlconnection in your code and use them independently of one another

2355987
facebook	linkedin
pattern2	
that way later .when someone logs in i can exactly match by facebook linkedin id and tell the user which of their friend connections is also attending the party

2357311
average	median
pattern10	
taking the median instead of the average is better it eliminates outliers due to sudden activity on your machine by other process

2359002
interpolation	cosine
pattern7	
what i don t know is whether an interpolation is actually less costly than computing a cosine

2360256
mouseover	mouseout
pattern7	
also if you re setting these on mouseover and mouseout it is arguably clearer to simply use the hover event instead

2360320
ubuntu	debian
pattern8	
anyway for the past year i ve been using fink and apt-get on leopard because i m more familiar with debian ubuntu

2361205
radio-button	selected
pattern0	
but unfortunately the radio-buttons inside the table seem to ignore the fact that they re inside of the radiogroup tags and because of this you can selected more than one radio-button at the time

2363609
python	php
pattern7	
i d rather not use php as python is much easier to distribute as part of a larger project ironpython or jython

2364588
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	pattern7	
linux 64bit environment has 8 time more memory than windows 32-bit environment and linux 64bit has faster disk raid 10 compare to raid 5 of windows

2364598
haskell	python
pattern0	
twenty years before python 1.0 was published knuth already foresaw the key syntax aspects that was to become such a hallmark of python and independently haskell release a bit earlier than python -- from personal discussion with knuth peyton jones and van rossum i can attest they all claim that these three inventions of indentation for grouping were entirely independent from each other just a case of great minds think alike -- or in charles fort s words it was just steam engine time

2364616
udp	tcp
pattern10	
udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built-in to tcp

2364737
python	perl
pattern0	
python ubiquitous but might be older versioning anything python 2.3+ is good and you are not likely to find older in the wild great libs ease of use maintainable code because of stricter syntax than perl

2364951
python	php
pattern4	
also on a subjective note if you re unfamiliar with neither python or php definitely pick python

2365016
value	field
pattern0	
if your dataset is not sorted by the specific field then you have to visit each recording however if it is sorted then you only have to find the first non match which is greater than the value your looking for

2366053
revision	updates
pattern7	
i would like to have these files always updates to whichever revision that s newer .when i do a merge

2366602
triggers	insert
pattern10	
of course on some sites there is a delay because it takes time to do the insert and the server is slammed or the insert is more complicated than you realize including adding recording to multiple tables or hitting triggers or the insert just may not be optimized

2367222
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern2	
you could easily apply most of the principles to a webforms site as necessary though i d recommend going with asp.net-mvc if yo have the choice...

2369434
multiplication	addition
pattern7	pattern0	
multiplication has higher precedence than addition + which is why 2+3 4 is interpreter as 2+ 3 4 both in c and normals math

2369500
innodb	myisam
pattern0	
innodb tables are even slower than myisam tables for insert and the delayed key write option is not available

2373307
key-value	key
pattern0	
you might also want to consider having more than just key and value in the key-value table

2373830
python	java
pattern4	
besides that there are a ton of languages you might choose python and java are popular

2374164
hide	show
pattern10	
it display things normally on the screens of course but .when you go to print-preview in ie7 the only thing that show is longer description. .so in other words it hide that first column and it al.so hide the second column

2377467
swing	awt
pattern7	pattern0	
in swing has more features than the awt components

2377819
preorder	inorder
pattern7	
especially look at the last two results for longer strings for which the preorder inorder approach is much faster than brute force

2378007
swing	awt	swing	swt	swt	awt
pattern0	
if you want a java gui that actually looks nice well nicer than swing or awt then you want to checkout swt from ibm

2378779
mobile-devices	mobile-phones
pattern4	
i don t have money to buy mobile-phones iphone etc but i do want to make my web-applications available to mobile-devices

2378847
python	java
pattern4	
i personally would choose python for scripting for which shell is not really suited and for which java may be overkill

2380391
mbunit	nunit
pattern4	
i would also recommend mbunit which has all of nunit s features along with some good support for the integration-testing that you will probably be writing by accident as you are starting out with testing

2381298
scala	java
pattern0	
if you learn scala it is very likely that implements your fsm parsing will be easier than in java--but learning scala plus implements a simple fsm parsing is probably not easier than just doing it in java

2381471
scala	java
pattern7	pattern0	
in general using java libs from scala code is easier than using scala stuff from java

2381953
jquery-svg	raphael
pattern0	pattern0	
if you re going to do something more complex i chose to use jquery-svg because i can manipulate the actual markup significantly easier than with raphael

2383229
specifications	w3c
pattern7	
the w3c dom specifications has more info

2383315
multiplication	exponentiation
pattern8	
you still get one or two modular reductions per iterator .so this will not be the fastest exponentiation algorithm ever modular reductions are substantially more expensive than multiplication

2383447
fiddler	charles
pattern4	
i prefer charles but any web debugging proxy fiddler include should help out

2383461
function-call	inline
pattern10	
on a more general basis the jit compiler should recognize this call to size as a call to a known instances .so that it may perform the methods dispatcher with a direct function-call which is faster or even inline the size methods call reducing the call to a simple instances field access

2384162
calayer	uiview
pattern0	
there is something deeper with the calayer in the uiview which is in the uiscrollview..

2384641
versioning	upgrade
pattern4	
can anyone verify that i need to upgrade subversioning on the client machine to match versioning on server 1.6.9

2384758
ssl-certificate	ssl
pattern4	
for testing purposes i have and ssl-certificate set up on a dev site where the domain does not match ssl domains valid for that certificate

2386794
double	int
pattern7	
the double has a bigger mantissa the int bits of the real numbers

2392859
imperative-programming	imperative
pattern7	
these are not generally available in imperative-programming but that doesn t mean imperative is worse

2393129
pyside	pyqt
pattern4	
personally i recommend pyqt pyside overall power a+ ease to get started with the above tutorial and book a- nokia-phone programmer similarity a

2395283
subclassing	inherited
pattern2	
prefer encapsulation over inherited having each of your current subclassing contains a complex properties with all the common field

2395395
tokenize	parsing
pattern7	
secondly it s a non-trivial form to parsing and would required a lexer or using the php tokenize which is much more work than it s worth

2395858
tuples	any
pattern4	
you can pass a tuples to startswiths in python 2.5+ to match any of its elements

2396060
json	xml
pattern7	pattern0	
json is much simpler than xml

2398216
filesystems	fat
pattern8	
most modern filesystems are also considerably more complex than fat which would add further difficulty to the implementation

2398989
checkbox	button	checkbox	textbox	textbox	button	value	field
pattern4	
i would favor field controls like textbox checkbox and dropdown menus rather than cmd button .so that the cmded value is clearly show

2400605
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
pattern4	
.so i m considering php python or ruby i prefer python because it s better syntax than other i feel it closer to delphi al.so i want to deploy the application to shared-hosting specially linux

2401286
groovy	java
pattern0	
it s based on groovy instead of java but since groovy is really close to java it won t be a problem actually it s easier than java in many aspects a grails application is actually a java ee application

2401837
sql-server	mysql
pattern10	
mysql takes up less spaces on disk and uses less memory and cpu than does sql-server

2402860
richfaces	trinidad
pattern8	
regarding skinning i feel trinidad default skinning to be more basic than richfaces one but i think both have ways to make them as beautiful as your css skills allow you

2402860
richfaces	trinidad
pattern10	
i think richfaces has a more mature ajax integration and their ajax components and events are more easy to use for me than trinidad ones

2403874
entity-framework	nhibernate
pattern4	
entity-framework has improved since versioning 1 and this blog .post from a nhibernate contributor compares nhibernate and entity-framework 4.0

2405493
delta	diff
pattern0	
see the sd java smart differencer tool for a tool that often computes much smaller delta than conventional diff

2406180
processor	cpu
pattern10	
for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processor it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encode in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime

2406721
umask	sudo
pattern10	
if you forget to use this and your default umask is more restrictive or less restrictive then you will need to re-run the non- sudo

2406881
decimal-point	digits
pattern0	
also i need to checked if the cents part after decimal-point not more than 2 digits and throw an error messages if exists

2407900
similarity	distance
pattern4	
you may take a look at the levenshtein distance which is used to compare similarity between sequences and here s a sample implementation in c#

2408810
testcomplete	selenium
pattern4	
at any way for frontend unit-testing html css javascript forms i would recommend selenium or if you have the money testcomplete

2413175
eigen	gsl
pattern4	
in addition to mentioned ones from which i prefer gsl and eigen there is also simple libs called tnt which is very nice for simple tasks

2413533
contains	elements
pattern0	
to cut down the ridiculous numbers of possible combinations to a lower amount if a contains more than 5 elements i will simply replace it with a contains a single char from my master original

2413767
json	xml
pattern10	pattern8	
json is more compact than xml and much easier to process in javascript it s also the javascript object notation

2413848
multiplication	multiplying
pattern10	
and don t use divide where multiplying will do multiplication is typically faster though not always

2414632
python	java
pattern4	
if you re not comfortable with them a tool that uses and produces a language you prefer python or java will undoubtedly be a much better choice

2415238
bazaar	git
pattern10	
this types of flexibility is what draw me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster

2415943
csv	xml
pattern7	
the excel csv import don t appear to offer all these capabilities .so i think xml is the better way...if i could just get a specifications for it

2416964
background-image	height
pattern0	
if you know the #sidebar or #main will always have a visual height the same or larger than the background-image then you can simply add the background-image to

2417993
ubuntu-server	ubuntu	32-bit	64bit
pattern10	pattern10	
you might argue that ubuntu-server 64bit is faster but i have observed a similar speed difference on ubuntu 8.10 32-bit desktop edition

2418093
value	field
pattern10	
this is useful if initial value for some static field needs some more complicated computations

2419146
python	c++
pattern7	
for the numerical calculations i do writing straight c++ is just faster than using straight python

2419210
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
pattern8	
it is less expressive than perl ruby python etc

2419890
numeric	zero
pattern0	
i would like to create a function that checked if a numeric value passed as an arguments has a value greater than zero

2419913
gridview	listview
pattern0	
the error is because the gridview is being applied to more than one listview

2421056
firefox	opera
pattern0	
my site display just like in need in ie and opera but in firefox i can t get via css to have fonts sizes smaller than firefox default minimum-fonts-size

2421616
jndi	jdbc
pattern4	
i have also tried to put the direct jdbc configuration together with jndi configuration into the configuration file but it looks like hibernate always favors jndi over direct jdbc configuration if both exist

2422339
mstest	nunit
pattern7	
he concludes that nunit wins for unit-testing but mstest has much better abilities for integration based testing and team testing with team systemd

2422410
mstest	nunit
pattern10	
for example nunit offers more assert methods than mstest

2423469
python	ruby
pattern7	
then 2 years ago i learned python and i learned it quite well python is easier for me to learn than ruby

2428697
strtol	atoi
pattern4	pattern7	pattern0	
i would recommend strtol which provides better error-handling than atoi or sscanf

2429581
boolean	int
pattern0	
types narrower than int are widened to int in expression anyway - .so the boolean operators would still work on int operands

2430207
font-size	width
pattern7	
you can then checked if the width of the text is greater than 800px and reduce the font-size until the width is less than or equals to

2430207
font-size	width
pattern7	
that is repeatedly reduce the font-size by 5 until the total width is less than or equals to 800px

2430575
beautifulsoup	lxml
pattern7	
lxml also has more features and offers beautifulsoup too

2430852
selected	button
pattern4	
you can click on choose button and selected the file types you wish to see in your search results

2430914
any	set
pattern0	
this won t work if there is more than 1 set of span tags per line and also won t work if the line doesn t have any span tags

2431212
jackson	gson
pattern0	pattern7	
since i am more familiar with jackson here are some aspects where i think jackson has more complete support than gson apologies if i miss a gson feature

2432171
exception-handling	error-handling
pattern8	
however common-lisp has many advanced features that make it quite expressive such as powerful error-handling more powerful than exception-handling multimethods and support for aspects oriented programming

2433836
hide	show
pattern4	
would i just have different user-controls for each page and create show and destroy hide them on request

2434175
scala	java	erlang	scala
pattern4	
if you re using this as an excuse to learn a new generally useful language i d pick scala as a nice blend of highly performant which erlang is not in general though it is fantastic with efficient concurrency highly functional which java and c# are not highly deployable due to running on the jvm and reasonably familiar assuming you know c-ish languages

2434783
perl	awk	python	perl
pattern7	pattern0	pattern7	
for me perl is simpler than python for some awk is simpler than bash

2435681
value	field
pattern7	
i m not sure how to format my insert query .so that the value of the key field is 1 greater than the maximum value for the key in the table

2435707
display	height	pixels	line
pattern0	
it returns the numbers of pixels added to the text height .when it display more than one line of text

2436304
common-lisp	scheme
pattern10	
common-lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure

2436701
triggers	insert
pattern0	
the overhead on insert updates should be less than using triggers and the query time will probably be equivalent

2438099
nvidia	ati
pattern8	
for example i ve noticed nvidia s glsl compiler is a little more picky than ati s and rejects some shader code that otherwise works fine

2438951
linux	osx
pattern7	pattern0	
i suspected that the fsync api in osx is slower than linux

2439408
32-bit	64bit
pattern4	
not sure exactly what you re after but if it is to compare 32-bit and 64bit gac d assemblies try something like this

2443221
stax	sax
pattern10	
a sax or stax parsing seems more suitable of the xml is indeed very long

2443259
communication	messages
pattern4	
in this way if a process is terminate or loses communication with the other process temporary it will be able to retrieve whatever messages it has missed .when it starts up again

2443473
processor	cpu
pattern10	
as soon as you go beyond single processor it s much more effective to add another cpu or two to systemd than to struggle with gpu calculations

2444334
cryptography	openssl	openssl	nss
pattern8	
nss provides a numbers of hash and cryptography algorithms and has a more liberal license than openssl

2444719
python	java
pattern4	
i prefer java or python

2445355
binary-data	chunks
pattern0	
allows for more than one chunks of binary-data .when you dump one of these to a bin you get one big bin file with fill data to pad it to the next block

2445529
ftp	scp
pattern7	
i would get everything resize first and then ftp ing or scp which is simpler to scripting

2445540
perl	awk
pattern10	
perl s a general purpose language awk s more oriented to text process of the types you ve describe

2445668
perl	awk
pattern0	
in terms of speed of process files awk is often on par or sometimes better than perl or other languages

2447484
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
is postgresql better than mysql for such purpose

2448434
grouping	sorting
pattern0	
on myisam tables in some cases the subselects tend to be faster than grouping by queries due to the fact that grouping by in myisam is quite expensive due to sorting materialization overhead

2448714
value	field
pattern4	pattern7	
how can i selected the average value of these field but only compare field where the value is greater then 0

2449000
dictionary	arrays
pattern0	
if you are going to get elements by positioning index in the arrays then arrays will be quicker or at least not slower than dictionary

2449505
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
for the shift operators to work shifting more than 32-bit tmp_data will need to be a 64bit types - as several other answers indicated

2451292
packets	ping
pattern7	
you can do an icmp ping to the server in question but many servers will have firewalls that drop icmp packets without replying .so it s not exactly accurate besides if then ping is much less than 100ms then the biggest contribution to latency probably comes from the server s internal process not the actual network meaning an icmp ping would be useless anyway

2451552
error-handling	try-catch
pattern0	
if you want finer control over error-handling lookup the documentation for try-catch here s a primitive usage example instead of getting an error as before we ll return na

2451695
constructor	object
pattern10	
your outermost function may be ginormous but only because it namespaces other big functions which act as object constructor which contains even more callback which contains closures

2451750
cvs	git
pattern0	
with git or mercurial managing branches is much easier than cvs and subversion

2451785
jquery	dojo
pattern4	
somehow people like to compare dojo to jquery

2451785
jquery	dojo
pattern10	pattern8	
and see why jquery has more mass appeal than dojo or any other competitor

2451785
jquery	dojo
pattern4	
is dojo going to beat jquery at numbers any time soon

2452060
linux	osx	ifconfig	linux
pattern4	
it needs to work in linux win osx and i d prefer to not have to parsing ifconfig ipconfig unless i absolutely have to

2452926
postgresql	mysql
pattern8	
postgresql will always be a little bit more mature than mysql

2453665
performance-testing	profiling
pattern3	
for this kind of performance-testing i would recommend using profiling and running each query multiple time and taking an average to compare

2455319
expression-blend	wpf
pattern2	
.when comparing cocoa to wpf you should compare interface-builder with expression-blend not with visual-studio

2456075
build-process	msbuild
pattern0	
if you want more control over the build-process you would have to create a drivers msbuild file which would replace your solution file

2458071
aptana	jsdt
pattern0	
jsdt wasn t very good at all but i did have more luck with aptana used as eclipse plugins not the standalone product

2458875
oprofile	gprof
pattern0	
oprofile on linux works fairly well actually i like it better than gprof

2459201
contains	elements
pattern0	
it seems unlikely that someone using the features of the c# language to their appropriate level would required a tuples contains more than 7 elements especially given the existing and established techniques for problem solving and c# s primarily oo approach to solution development

2460688
.net	wcf
pattern4	
if both the client and the server are written in .net c# i would recommend wcf insted of raw-sockets as it saves you a from a lot of plumbing code with serialization and deserialization synchronized of messages etc

2461383
strtol	atoi
pattern0	
all have more or less cumber.some and non-obvious error checked involving errno strtol is way much better than atoi in any case .so avoid using atoi

2461396
google-maps	openlayers
pattern4	
it looks like they may be a good source of data which could be used on top of a google-maps solution i d recommend openlayers personally though

2462607
google-chrome	firefox	player	movie
pattern10	
the problem is that on the mac in firefox camino and google-chrome .when i scroll down such that the quicktime player is no longer visible any methods call on the quicktime movie no longer work

2465422
ruby-on-rails	django
pattern4	
i personally can recommend django and from other people who i trust ruby-on-rails

2466651
ebnf	bnf
pattern7	pattern0	
for building parsing especially bottom-up a bnf grammar is often better than ebnf

2467039
hash	md5
pattern0	
some common examples are the crc checksums of which crc32 is very common but you can also relatively easily compute 64 or 128bit or even larger crcs much much faster than an md5 hash

2467724
pubsubhubbub	xmpp
pattern7	
pubsubhubbub also seems simpler as a protocols than xmpp

2467779
observer-pattern	singleton
pattern7	
i think this is similar to an observer-pattern but the singleton has more control

2468148
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
pattern4	
in general i would recommend using a proper xml-parsing libs in a language like python ruby or perl for manipulating xml files i recommend python+elementtree but in this case it is simple enough to get away with using a regex solution

2468442
strstr	strcat
pattern4	
also i would recommend strstr strcat for concatenation your strings

2469679
boolean	int
pattern10	
from the link which is mentioned in question my question is that microsoft says the c# types keyword and their alias are interchangeable but why we need alias from my points of view boolean is more meaningful then bool and int32 is more meaningful then int then why alias

2470483
crypt	salt	crypt	hash
pattern4	
if you want to compare hash compare the output of your crypt call with the value in shadow both hash need to be created with the same salt

2471185
constructor	object
pattern4	
i strongly prefer object with default constructor

2472793
webserver	upload
pattern0	
i believe that django form receives file only after it was upload completely.that s why if somebody upload 2gb file you re much better off with webserver checked for size on-the-fly

2473506
decimal-point	zero	decimal-point	digits	digits	zero
pattern0	
if the scale is less than zero the value will be rounded to scale digits left the decimal-point

2474454
armadillo	lapack
pattern10	
edit in response to the comment armadillo does not required lapack but works better with it and better still with tuned blas

2474666
firefox	safari
pattern10	pattern8	
i just tested geolocation on firefox 3.6 and iphone safari os 3.1.3 the result is interesting firefox is more accurate than safari

2474858
json	xml
pattern7	
you could send receive xml if you like though json is easier to parsing and is smaller to send

2475931
python	ruby
pattern0	
ruby quine slightly smaller than python quine

2476905
repository	entity
pattern0	
however this would become more and more difficult as well as ugly if the repository has to return more than 1 entity for a test scenario

2477109
value	field
pattern7	pattern0	
however .when that cck nodes reference field has more than one value i get stuck

2477773
scala	java
pattern7	
scala is better java you have access to all java libs of course

2478463
png	gif
pattern4	
png beats gif on everything except that animation are not supported mng supports them though

2479042
actionscript	mxml
pattern0	
what s the deal i thought actionscript would be nicer than mxml

2479932
scala	java
pattern10	
in fact my scala code is often faster than my java code because i find it .so much easier to make my highly optimized code convenient to use and reuse--but the java would be as fast or faster if only i had more time and patience.

2481866
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
pattern7	
having worked with ruby-on-rails the asp.net-mvc aspects of codeigniter were easy to pick up although codeigniter is much looser a framework than ruby-on-rails

2481915
while-loop	for-loop
pattern10	
i ve done a small experiment as will be show below and it looks like that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop in perl

2482760
mockito	jmock
pattern8	
for the recording jmock as of today supports more complex scenarios than mockito that s why the initial learning curve is steeper

2482765
google-earth	google-maps
pattern10	
unforuntatly google-maps only supports a limited set of kml .so not all features are supported and google-earth is more flexible .so it might support

2483182
flac	mp3
pattern7	
if a flac file is newer than the corresponding mp3 file or the corresponding mp3 file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of cmd to convert the flac file to an mp3 file and copy the tags across

2483418
flac	mp3
pattern7	
if a flac file is newer than the corresponding mp3 file or the corresponding mp3 file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of cmd to convert the flac file to an mp3 file and copy the tags across

2483757
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern0	
asp.net-mvc just makes doing rest much easier than webforms

2483794
wxwidgets	mfc
pattern10	
of the two wxwidgets is more similar to mfc .so it would probably required less rewriting but would maintain more or less the same disconnect you re seeing between what you want and what it provides

2483794
wxwidgets	mfc
pattern10	
as i commented previously wxwidgets is more like mfc in this respect -- it uses a document and view not a model-view and controllers

2484006
any	set
pattern4	
the regular expression is trying to match any occurrence of not 0o1iil because omitting a at the beginning of the set will prevent the regular expression from seeing the as the character-class metacharacters

2486561
javascript	dom
pattern7	
if you re modifying dom content it seems like javascript jquery is a better approach for this

2487141
selected	textbox
pattern0	
you ll need to do some small refactoring if you are selected more than one textbox put the if-statement inside of an each on the elements

2487642
value	field
pattern7	pattern0	
if the converted value has fewer characters than the field width it will be padded with spaces on the left or right if the left-adjustment flag has been given

2488290
autotools	cmake
pattern7	
i have never used autotools but a lot of other users have commented that cmake is easier to use

2489871
alignment	layout
pattern3	
typically i had a program which used the same layout the etl used and did a compare ignoring alignment within a field

2492747
emacs	vim
pattern4	
although you can look on vim or emacs i prefer emacs - they are hard on the beginning but very .when you are experienced user - they give you many cool features

2497073
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern4	
if you re looking to get away from asp.net webforms the i recommend asp.net-mvc with a custom view engine like spark or nhaml

2499632
font-size	width
pattern7	
if the width is greater than the fixed width bump the font-size down and then checked the width again

2499632
font-size	width
pattern7	
keep on lowering the font-size until the span s width is less than the fixed width

2500668
entity-framework	ado.net
pattern4	
i use and would recommend ado.net entity-framework

2500838
google-chrome	firefox
pattern2	
i really recommend browsing with google-chrome .when you re looking to debugging javascripting it s error console is very useful for not just determining errors like this but also for pinpointing the location in the scripting that is throw the error which might be an advantage beyond firebug in firefox

2502963
wxpython	pygtk
pattern7	pattern0	
also pygtk is lighter than wxpython but i ended up bitting the bullet and using wxpython for the same purpose recently it is heavy but it didn t have any affect on the scripting performance

2504224
unsigned	short
pattern0	
that does leave one loophole though it s one that would generally be quite horrible that char and short have the same range size_type is the same as unsigned short and int has a greater range than char short

2504896
ubuntu	linux
pattern7	
i ve used python on windows and on ubuntu and linux is much cleaner

2505194
itextsharp	itext	apache-fop	itext
pattern0	
in this case directly converting from xhtml to pdf a would be an ideal solution either using itext directly the example uses itextsharp a .net ports of itext but it s the same for java or by using apache-fop as others have suggested which also uses itext internally .when outputting to pdf and although it is more bloated inefficient and complicated to setup than using itext directly it might produce better results than the itext example -- only one way to settle that you have to try it out on a few of your xhtml files as samples

2507588
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
pattern4	
compare safari or google-chrome and firefox click the tabs

2508351
common-lisp	lisp	common-lisp	scheme	scheme	lisp
pattern7	
if you want to learn lisp paip is a better choice to start with because it will teach you a lot about common-lisp and a smallish chunks of scheme

2508366
union-all	union
pattern10	
sometimes a union or union-all is better

2508620
listboxitem	selected
pattern7	
thus the background of selected items is clearer .so that the user can still read text of the selected listboxitem

2512427
expression	evaluation
pattern10	
icons s goal-directed evaluation is more restrict in scoping see this a brief introduction to icons the backtracking implied by the goal-directed evaluation mechanism is limited to the expression in which it occurs

2512461
google-chrome	firefox
pattern0	
.so i wonder the benchmarking is al.so influenced by the install extensions or google-chrome is really .so much higher than firefox in performance

2514024
delphi	c++
pattern8	pattern4	
given that i am slightly more comfortable with c++ is there any compelling reason to choose delphi over bcb or is this just a case of how long my particular piece of string is

2514778
calloc	malloc
pattern2	
compare against calloc instead but also note that malloc and calloc are both available from c++ in the unlikely event that they do prove measurably faster

2514962
delphi	c++
pattern4	
i use both frequently each in its own domain i prefer delphi for ui-centric code components or .when i want to use modern language-features generics anonymous-methods rtti class polymorphism but c++builder .when i need to interface with 3rd-party c or c++ code which happens frequently

2515457
delphi	c++
pattern4	
if you like the c++ language then i d use the bcb if you like a language with a larger userbase and where support is easier to find in that language i d choose delphi

2516971
c-preprocessor	macros
pattern4	
i think i would look at using a separate macros processor rather than trying to beat c-preprocessor into submission

2516971
perl	awk	python	perl
pattern0	
the classic example that people points to is m4 but for this you might do better with awk or perl or python or something similar

2517519
multiplication	addition
pattern8	
note that this algorithm avoids any math more complicated than addition and multiplication .so will likely have much better performance than .something that required trig functions

2518299
nvidia	ati
pattern8	
more useful with nvidia than ati for example

2519132
json	xml
pattern10	
but json is probably better because it s not as verbose as the xml generator by cfwddx

2519419
maven	sbt
pattern3	
hudson display very helpful information based on the results in the surefire report but i would much prefer using sbt to maven

2521374
double	int
pattern10	
by contrast void doitagain int is more specific than void doitagain double because int is a subtyping of double according the the jls

2522937
spawn	exit
pattern0	
if less than threshold spawn new process otherwise exit here threshold can be defined in your scripting

2523038
png	gif
pattern0	
but keep in mind that the gif color palette is way smaller than png

2523083
png	gif
pattern0	
note that if you convert your png files to gif images they are likely to look uglier as gif files can only have 256 colors and do not support alpha-transparency

2523752
textbox	button
pattern10	
in your opinion .when the focus is on the textbox is it more intuitive for the enter return key to click the submit button or move the cursor to the next line within the textbox

2526042
perl	php
pattern4	
i prefer php or perl

2526770
contains	elements
pattern4	
the leafs have an empty alist and since following different paths from the root to the leafs you have to choose elements from the root s alist in different order the blist of the leafs themselves contains all the various permutation of the root s alist

2526817
order	join
pattern0	
i know about setmaxresults and setfirstresult but because of the left join and distinctrootentity that could return less than x order

2526831
speex	mp3	speex	wma	mp3	wma
pattern0	pattern0	
speex is designed for speech and should perform better than wma mp3 or other audio codecs that are designed to handle music if you are just encoding speech which i assume since you are grabbing from the mic

2527133
tapestry	guice
pattern4	
i prefer tapestry but guice is pretty similar and more widely adopted .so that might be a better choice since it will be easier to find tutorials etc

2527385
python	c++
pattern7	
python is easier to extends with c and c++ code

2527784
jquery	dojo
pattern4	
fortunately javascript frameworks such as jquery and dojo can compensate in good part for such issues i per.sonally prefer dojo but jquery s more popular and the choice between two such good frameworks is more of a matter of taste -- plus there are advantages with going for the popular choice such as you can probably get better support on .so

2528064
python	perl
pattern8	
from many threads comparing perl vs python on .so it appears to me that perl s cpan is more expansive than python repository but i have no experience with python and can t substantiate with real compari.son

2529053
singleton	facade
pattern0	
can any one tell me which one is better between session facade class and singleton object design-patterns in asp.net

2529510
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern2	
compare between webforms regular asp.net and asp.net-mvc to see what methods would be easier for you to follow

2529589
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern0	pattern0	
i think you ll find that learning asp.net-mvc will ultimately prove useful as it really is a lot easier cleaner than webforms and more people will probably move in this directions eventually.

2530254
groovy	java	spring	grails
pattern7	pattern0	
grails looks great it uses groovy which is better than java for web application i think.. but it s slower than pure-java based frameworks hibernate strut spring it looks pretty simple to deploy send .war and it s ok

2530361
scala	java
pattern0	pattern0	
scala s extra expressiveness means you can write programs that are shorter than thus less buggier than in java

2531314
ruby	php
pattern4	pattern2	
you should compare ruby with php or ruby-on-rails with some php framework i am not familiar with php frameworks and do not know an example

2531471
scala	java
pattern0	
scala s for are notably slower than java .when just increment indic -- the .solution .so far is to use while loops instead though .someone wrote a compiler plugins that does that conversion automatically

2531668
python	java
pattern0	
having coded a bit in python i ve found that clojure is as a general rules much much much faster than python and you can usually get a clojure program to get within 2x-4x of the speed of pure java

2531962
packaging	building
pattern4	
i strongly recommend building your package from source within the debian packaging infrastructure

2532011
any	set
pattern4	
match any characters not in the w set except hyphen

2532053
ip-address	hostname
pattern4	
following up to regular expression to match hostname or ip-address

2532143
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
though there is more difference between 32-bit and 64bit architectures than this

2532180
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	
a program generally has to be compiled with 64bit support to take advantage of the speed-up and even then you usually won t see a difference unless you re manipulating data larger than 32-bit can store

2532754
spring	seam
pattern0	
seam framework would be a better choice as spring is anyway extensible enough to be leveraged by seam

2533132
value	field	numeric	zero
pattern0	
i have two widget that can be checked and a numeric entry field that should contains a value greater than zero

2533132
widget	button	value	field	numeric	zero
pattern0	
whenever both widget have been checked and the numeric entry field contains a value greater than zero a button should be enabled

2534316
python	perl
pattern0	
if everyone likes python more than perl for whatever reason they are probably going to get more done in python

2534316
python	ruby
pattern0	
if they like ruby more than python it s the same thing

2534358
lgpl	gpl
pattern0	
even if you manage to finesse the issue much easier with lgpl stuff that full gpl the community may react badly

2534507
type-safety	generics
pattern4	
that means i cannot create a simple generics template-function as i lose type-safety and potentially incurring a runtime problem for validation within the function

2534795
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
pattern0	
perl is used plenty for website no less than python and ruby for example

2534952
perl	php
pattern7	pattern0	
php is better than perl because

2534952
perl	php
pattern7	
syntax-wise you will find php is often easier to understand than perl particularly .when you have little experience

2534952
perl	php	configuration	environment
pattern10	
i believe the reason perl is used less often in shared-hosting environment is that historically the perceived slowness of cgi and hosts unwillingness to install mod_perl due to security and configuration issues has made php a more attractive option

2535143
.war	jar
pattern4	
you can use eclipse to compare jar .war files

2535303
lwjgl	jogl
pattern4	
otherwise i would definitely recommend jogl or its competitor lwjgl

2535830
ubuntu	linux
pattern7	
if you just want the fun of linux command-line programs without access to all of ubuntu cygwin is smaller and might be faster

2537475
json	xml
pattern4	
and i prefer json to xml because it s more compact and semantics less unambiguous as well as closer to common object model

2538204
getter	setter
pattern0	
i generally don t write unit tests for bean classes with little more than getter and setter

2538310
contains	any
pattern4	
will match any string that contains a numbers somewhere not all numberss

2539525
scriptaculous	jquery
pattern10	
i have used both prototype scriptaculous as well as jquery in many project and based on what i am seeing it appears jquery has the more plugins available .so am leaning towards using jquery

2542137
droppable	draggable
pattern7	pattern0	
but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable

2542867
moss	wss
pattern7	
you can technically use wss for this task but moss has more features aimed at building public facing website

2543226
perl	awk	python	perl
pattern10	
perl is generally faster at this sort of thing than the sed awk and python

2549944
sftp	ftp
pattern3	
just go to project properties | runtime configuration - i recommend using sftp instead of ftp

2549960
mupdf	xpdf
pattern4	pattern2	
i d prefer mupdf over xpdf because it is actively maintained and has better pdf support

2550486
scala	java
pattern0	
scala programs can be much shorter than java programs

2550735
python	c++
pattern0	
i d recommend you to use python way better than c++ .when it comes to developing applications like the one you re trying to achieve

2551024
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
pattern0	
i find ruby allows me to do that easier than perl and python

2551061
digits	zero
pattern4	pattern4	
the wildcard means match zero or more .so means match zero or more digits which include an empty result

2551657
double	int
pattern0	
edit actually my solution does not work because double can be very big much bigger than int and also very small like fractions

2551916
attributes	properties
pattern0	
i d hope to be able to apply no more than an attributes to the properties currently set to xmltext in the hope that it would wrap the content in but that doesn t seem to work

2552348
google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	
now in google-chrome and firefox it is 1px wider than the windows causing an h scrollbar.

2552372
gstreamer	vlc
pattern0	
it s not clear from your .post if gstreamer is really a requirement .so just fyi live-streaming is easier with vlc

2553327
scala	java
pattern0	
but the business-logic is where the ball is rolling and .so scala and fp can handle this better than imperative java

2553584
json	xml
pattern8	
other ways to transfer data are xml and serialization both which have much more overhead than json

2554490
perl	c++
pattern8	
i understand oop i m getting more familiar with c++ oop aswell i understand the points of the pointsers and some arithmetic and references widely used in perl

2554530
linked-list	arrays
pattern10	
maybe a perl arrays is more like a linked-list data structure

2556364
tapestry	jsf	tapestry	wicket	wicket	jsf
pattern8	pattern8	
in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s inversion-of-control containers makes it more powerful than wicket

2558762
binary	hex
pattern7	
a hex string is significantly longer than the corresponding binary string

2560929
directory	folder
pattern0	
obviously in this case the call could return more than one item if there was more than one folder named test in your directory tree

2561747
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
pattern7	
sometimes sql-server is the better match sometimes it s mysql sometimes it s oracle

2561800
chown	chmod	chown	umask	umask	chmod
pattern7	
but changing the chmod maybe even working with umask is better than dealing with root-access and using chown

2561862
sql-server	oracle
pattern0	
sql-server s pricing is extremely competitive and has a very substantially lower tco than oracle

2566364
any	set
pattern4	
a test versioning of what the regex states would be something like match any set of characters until you reach novice and put it into a capturing-grouping then maybe match something that starts with a and has any numbers of characters after it and then ends-with but don t capture it but then there only match something with a white spaces and then maybe match again something that starts with a and has any numbers of characters after it and then ends-with but don t capture it which must then be followed by programmer followed by any numbers of characters and put that into a capture grouping

2566763
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
also if you open to moving away from mysql i ve found that postgresql has much better resolution of deadlock

2566810
dictionary	arrays
pattern10	
and i am using .net collections too much like dictionary and list i am wondering if using arrays is more efficient

2567035
order	add
pattern0	
if the order was pending and the total received payment now add up to equals to or more than the order value the order should be marked as paid indicating that it is ready to be shipped

2567567
arrays	loops
pattern7	
how should i form a loops methods for this .so i can get the title even .when the list in url arrays gets longer

2568456
exponent	modulo
pattern0	
rsa parameters contains more parameters than modulo and exponent if i remember correctly

2568778
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern2	
webforms has a few things to recommend it over asp.net-mvc in some situations

2570457
binary-search	shellsort
pattern0	
if the latter you may find that a plain insert-sort using a binary-search for the insert step might be better than a shellsort

2570552
malloc	free
pattern0	pattern0	
why new delete is slower than malloc free

2570593
malloc	free
pattern0	
if the constructor and destructor are empty like for built-in new and delete shouldn t be slower than malloc and free are

2571426
google-chrome	firefox
pattern2	
button you will notice that the sign in panels fieldset#login-controls is show improperly compare with firefox or google-chrome

2573955
zero	nan
pattern0	
for example if in a square equation discriminant is less than zero the x1 and x2 value are nan .so .when i assign x1 and x2 value to uilabel they show nan as well

scala	java
pattern7	pattern0	
the first question is easier to answer the scala language is richer than java

2573959
scala	java
pattern10	
mastering these takes time and that s why scala is more complicated to learn than java

2575251
python	lua
pattern10	
lua has a more formal interactive mode like python which will show you the indentation level of your code at the prompt

2576102
udp	tcp
pattern7	pattern0	
udp is simpler protocols than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp

2576512
udp	tcp
pattern4	
it can be done to beat tcp for streaming transfer using udp if you don t have nat to think about

2576553
scala	java
pattern7	
java is simpler but java also doesn t have the same amount of capabilities as scala

2576667
entity-framework	nhibernate
pattern8	
since i m personally more familiar with entity-framework i thought it would be easier to use than nhibernate

2577829
double	int
pattern7	
it should be always string if its int value is greater than 2 32 unsigned simply cast by string userid is not work and printf .0f ... will only works .when int value less than 2 52 because on 32-bit os .when a numbers is greater than 2 31 32 unsigned php will assume it is double types and default precise is only 14 decimal but fbid is 20

2578122
mousedown	mouseup	mousedown	mouseout	mouseout	mouseup
pattern10	
mousedown mouseup is indeed the only way you can get notified of middle button integration .so detection a down-then-up event without intervening mouseout event is more or less the best you can do

2579251
cakephp	django
pattern4	
i ve worked with cakephp and django and i really recommend django

2579403
sql-server	mysql	sql-server-express	sql-server
pattern4	
.so at the end you need to compare mysql which is a fantastic db and at the same time free and sql-server-express edition which is a free versioning of the enterprise professional versioning of micro.soft sql-server

2579561
python	perl
pattern0	
im open to doing this in another language like python if its easier however i am more comfertable with perl

2580312
javadoc	doxygen
pattern7	
maybe doxygen has more configuration possibilities than javadoc

2580633
player	movie
pattern7	
like for instances if the movie file is smaller in dimension than the player then there is black background it

2581152
export	csv
pattern4	
choose csv export to retrieve all the results

2581188
any	set
pattern4	
while there are ways that you could accomplish this both straight-forward create a methods that explicit resets all properties value and not straight-forward using reflection to find all properties and set their value i would not recommend any of those approaches for what it sounds like you re trying to accomplish

2581314
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
pattern0	
the jpopupmenu has this behavior but i need more than just jmenuitem

2581919
perl	php
pattern7	
not a big difference but might help if php is more of your comfort zone for web stuff than perl s cgi

2582032
double	int
pattern7	
double has range more than a 64bit int but its precision is less dues to its representation since double is 64bit as well it can t fit more actual value

2582047
highlight	selected
pattern7	
.when another elements on the windows is selected however the highlight becomes a lighter blue as the source list is no longer focused

2583601
scala	java
pattern10	
edit perhaps this should be said also it seems that functional oo hybrids like scala is becoming more popular especially because of how functional languages handles parallels process as opposed to how we know it in languages like in java

2584158
exception-handling	error-handling
pattern4	
i really prefer exception-handling over old-fashion error-handling

2588516
32-bit	64bit
pattern0	pattern0	
loading 64bit of data from memory will generally be slower than loading 32-bit of data -- but if you re using more than 32 flags you ll have to load more than 32-bit of data anyway and handling the masking in one cycle will improve speed over doing it in two or three instructions

2588997
udp	tcp
pattern8	
instead you can use udp and implements your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp

2589257
aspect-ratio	scale
pattern0	
for example if the aspect-ratio width height of the screens is larger than the aspect-ratio of the image then it s too wide - .so scale the width of the image but keep the height the same size as the viewport

2591500
expression	brackets
pattern7	
if expression length is more than 3 and its field is not 200 then add brackets to it

2591577
expression	brackets
pattern7	
you say if expression length is more than 3 and its field is not 200 then add brackets to it

2593216
contains	any
pattern4	
if you have a situation where a raw pointers is cast to an intptr_t and back for some reason it cannot be replace by a smart pointers because the casting operation would lose any reference count information contains in the smart pointers

2593898
udp	tcp
pattern7	
to be trying to implements them using different protocols tcp and udp is even odder h.323 voip is the only applciation i know of which does this

2594349
scala	java
pattern10	pattern8	
in my opinion scala is much more concise than java .so i guess a junior programmer should be able to handle it

2595274
expression	evaluation
pattern7	
note that the grammar you will need for validation expression is simpler than the examples above since the examples also implements evaluation of the expression

2596223
selected	checkbox
pattern0	
i ve seen some for web using javascript but i am looking for a windows form-control that is a combobox that .when opened display a list of checkbox and labels allowing to selected one or more with a selected all option

2596789
digits	radix	digits	base
pattern0	
alternatively you could convert the numbers themselves to a base radix in the unencoded uri character range see which should work well if many of the numbers are larger than 2 digits

2597297
any	set
pattern4	
if you re working with an 8bit character set the regex matches any character that is not ascii

2598199
javascript	dom
pattern7	
it also helps the javascript to process faster .when the dom is lighter

2599270
multiplication	division
pattern10	
as a general rules division is slow and multiplication is faster and bit shifting is faster yet
