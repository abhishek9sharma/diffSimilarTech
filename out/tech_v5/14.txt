version-control	git
or they might like a different kind of version-control all-together suchas git or mercurial

140026
expression	evaluation
the language needs to be capable of simple expression evaluation as well as querying table indexes and iterator through the returned rows

140053
javascript	dom
but regarding what you said i think it s because there s conflict in the way your browser handles javascript dom

140072
assign	add
if may change the sequences of firing if you add the javascript for the return confirm coding to the button in a hijax methods where it s assign to the onclientclick event after the page has been loaded fully into the browser--but i ve never utilized that method.sology for that capability .so don t quote me there

140100
windows-xp	windows
dynamic libs were considered to be the better approach most of the time but originally they had a major flaw google dll hell which has all but been eliminated by more recent windows oses windows-xp in particular

140107
union-all	union
edit actually i believe the union process will only bring back distinct rows anyway as opposed to union-all but i could be wrong - i haven t actually tried this..

140108
put	get
it may be acceptable to put the apache server on the dev server and hosts the files remotely on a stable backed-up fileserver though there are a numbers of pitfalls with this approach if you are unable to get additional server resources

140111
signals	sigint
signals are created by certain user input ctrl-c triggers a sigint on both platform for instances

140134
modifiers	final
this works great using the eclipse save actions which adds these final modifiers among other things .when saving the file

140168

if you log into the bugzilla systemd as an administration you ll see on the bottom a link that says field value click that on the next page you ll see resolution go there then click on the resolution you d like to change

140192
svnkit	svn
if your using oracle s java jvm you could try to use svnkit to communication with the svn server nativly from java instead of shelling out to the operating systemd to execute cmd

140228
scheme	lisp
you may have a parsing-generator tool like antlr or yacc you can use to help you generator the parsing or use a language like lisp scheme and marry the two up

140233
function-pointers	member-functions
thus ordinary function-pointers and pointers to non-static member-functions have different and incompatible signature

140236
progress-bar	progress
there s a feature that i d like to see in issue tracking software that just doesn t seem to be all that common and that is the ability to divide a ticket bug feature request etc into sub-tasks and view them in a hierarchical fashion perhaps with some kind of progress-bar styles report of progress on a particular ticket and its child tickets

140275
where-clause	sql
however if what you are after is simplicity and your users understand sql you could simply ask them to types in the contents of a where-clause and programmatically building up the rest of the query

140279
deep-copy	object
now you can create a deep-copy of any object that is marked as serialization without writing any special code

140303
textbox	button
obviously it is a viewstate exception-handling but i can t reproduce the error on the page that is throw the exception-handling a simple two textbox form with a button and navigation links

140311
perl	ruby	python	perl	python	ruby
there s a mod for ruby perl and python for instances and probably a fair few others

140320
mantis	trac
having tried trac and mantis its my personal fav

140331
primitive	int
then a runtime notsupportedexception is throw telling that it can t create a constants user types and only primitive like int string guid are supported

140335
installation	upgrade
you may have trouble with this if you upgrade your installation to 3.5sp1 even in the core functionalities

140339
base-class	inherited
another approach may be to inherited both of your results from the same base-class or interface

140359
bugzilla	mantis
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface

140390
perl	ruby	python	perl	python	ruby
i don t know how familier you are with a scriptlanguage like perl python or ruby

140415
xsd	xml
well as said in the other post and in the question xsd will ensure that you re using the right types at the right place in your xml and that you ll have to think twice before changing its structure

140415
xsd	xml
hopefully xsd is not the only way to validation a xml a much more simpler approach is to use relaxng and especially its compact syntax which is really more readable than what you could ever imagine with xsd

140436
bin-packing	np-hard
this is a bin-packing problem and it s np-hard

140437
xsd	xml
xsd s are not the only xml schema available

140437
xsd	xml
relaxng lets you express the schema in xml rather than necessitating learning yet another data language as xsd s do

140444

i would recommend that you make them aware of the legislation advise them to get a lawyer there are lots of good ones around who specialise in information law and put it in writing

140471
python	java
for generics possibly malformed html there are libs to handle that kigurai recommends beautifulsoup for python i know also tag-soup for java there are others

140502

i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying

140517
application-pool	was
an application-pool recycling between the time the viewstate was generator and the time that the user post it back to the server unlikely

140529
perl	c++	python	perl	python	java	python	c++
i m debating on how to .approach this - i ve got some experience in java c++ perl and python but have never had the chance or opportunity to write and distribute an .app to others of any significance

140533
derived-class	base-class
actually the derived-class constructor is execute first but the c# compiler insert a call to the base-class constructor as first statement of the derived constructor

i ve made a few assumptions as follows there are no overlap of date ranges there are no null value in any of the field and the start date for a given row is always less than the end date

140602
sniffing	traffic
i know this because i am sniffing all http traffic with fiddler and it is not a localhost call

140609
python	java	python	c++
in terms of language support you can do it in c++ java c# python etc

140690
put	get	quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort	bubble-sort	mergesort	bubble-sort	quicksort	bubble-sort	heapsort
if you have some code that you want to get other opinions on how to optimize the code then not having the author participate may be helpful in getting ideas and then having the author either make the change or justify why the change doesn t improve the code if someone wants to put in a bubble-sort algorithm this may be rejected because of other more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort mergesort and heapsort

140690
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	queue	generic-list	hashtable
in contrast if one implements an api with a dozen methods then it may be better to have some documentation that summarizes what was used in the implementation and why some choices were made what kind of list implementation was used like an arrays hashtable linked-list generic-list stack queue etc

140717
python	perl
perl and python do

140719

140978
delphi	c++
i ve actually seen this in production code albeit delphi not c++

141011
configuration	installation
depending on your mysql installation and or configuration you have to set the connection encoding .so that mysql knows what encoding you re expecting on the client side meaning the client side of the mysql connection which should be you php scripting

141075
firefox	safari
this works in common browsers i checked in ie firefox and safari

141105
dictionary	arrays
if you are trying to use a generics dictionary in c# like you would use an associativity arrays in another language

141120
for-loop	arrays
you can put a hack in your foreach such as a field increment on each run-through which is exactly what the for-loop gives you in a numerically-indexed arrays

141162
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
it can be systemd dependent for linux specifically debian and or ubuntu

141198
firefox	safari
in my tests of safari 3.1 and firefox 3 window.event is always undefined

141220
arrays	map
php arrays act as a map table mapping key to value

141220
for-loop	arrays
if you need to have an index make sure your arrays are fully defined before crawling over them and use a for-loop

141225
click	mouse
if you re looking for a way to detection the mouse positioning while the bookmarklet is being physically click no there is no way

141244
attributes	properties
if you want you can specify a named attributes for each data-members .so .when the properties gets serialization deserialization it uses that named

141261
connection-pooling	pool
it then release the connection to the connection pool or closes the connection if connection-pooling is disabled

141261
connection-pooling	pool
you probably haven t and don t want to disable connection-pooling .so the pool ultimately manages the state of the connection after you call close

141271
decimal	hex
0x04 is hex for 4 the 0x is just a common prefix conventions for base 16 representation of numbers - since many people think in decimal and that would be the fourth byte since they are saying offset they probably count the first byte as byte 0 .so offset 0x04 would be the 5th byte

141275
decimal	hex
0x04 in hex is 4 in decimal

141275
decimal	hex
0x10 in hex is 16 in decimal

141275

141291
directory	folder
i want to be able to list only the directory inside some folder

141325
tuples	set
before the queries are run against the dataset they are put through a query optimizer the optimizer attempts to organize the query in such a fashion that it can remove as many tuples rows from the result set as quickly as it can

141325
tuples	set
often .when you use subqueries especially bad ones the tuples can t be pruned out of the result set until the outer query starts to run

141337
constructor	object
question should i ensure my object have copy constructor and store copies of object within my stl containers or is it generally better to manage the life scoping myself and just store the pointers to those object in my stl containers

141341
strtotime	mktime
there is a documented mysql bug on mktime localtime strtotime all returning this odd value .when you try a pre-epoch time including 0000-00-00 00 00 00

141346
instances	self
in summary assume they are different instances and don t inject your self those kind of object

141351
instrumentation	profiling
i ve used a python memory profiling specifically heapy with some success in the development-environment but it can t help me with things i can t reproduce and i m reluctant to instrumentation our production systemd with heapy because it takes a while to do its thing and its threaded remote interface does not work well in our server

141357
pointers	stack
obviously if you opt for smart pointers then you can t store temp stack allocated object as you have said

141360
frame-rate	fps
since everything i ve read on flex flash hammers home the points the frame-rate is c.apped at the fps set in the top level .app it seems the only way these extra rendering can be h.appening is due to some events causing them no programmatic changes to the stage s frame-rate are done anywhere

141372
punctuation	words
emacs has a useful transpose-wordss cmd which lets one exchange the words before the cursor with the words after the cursor preserving punctuation

141394
assign	add
i don t know if anybody with enough rights to edit the answer will see this but while the answer is correct i would like to add that without specifying the collation explicit the default collation of the database would be used in this case since it is implicit assign to every varchar-variable without a collation statement

141401
multiplying	subtract
multiplying that count by 8 and subtract it from your total hours

141415
boolean	int
building on what oregonghost said rather than using an isworkingday function at accepts a day and returns a boolean have a holidaycount function that accepts a range and returns an int giving the numbers of holidays in the range

141422
spaces	output
it is easy to transform input output to and from the coordinate spaces but the end user is only interested in the coefficients a b .... z since they can reconstruct the polynomials on their own

141443
design-view	designer
caveat beware that you can only edit a non-equi join in the access query designer in sql-view -- switchinging to design-view could cause the join to be lost though if you do switching access tells you about the problem and if you immediately switching back to sql-view you won t lose it

141445
blacklist	whitelist
you want to use whitelist validation on everything you do but i realize that s not always possible .so you re forced to go with the best guess blacklist

141445
blacklist	whitelist
there are ways around any usable blacklist you can come up with and some whitelist too

141459
firefox	safari
event object are passed to an event-listener as an arguments in firefox and safari

141515
internet-explorer	firefox
xpath in internet-explorer is 10-20 time slower than in sf firefox

141529
subtract	time
the most efficient way to do this is to calculate the total time difference then subtract the time that is a weekend or holiday

141541
onchange	onfocus
onfocus openx true onblur openx false onchange openx false

141546
any	set
i worked on a project that required another set of eyes on any code prior to committing

141550
subtract	time
then do some math to find out if your start time or end time falls on a non-working day and subtract the difference

141550
subtract	time
if your query on isworkingday start returns false subtract from 24 the time from start to midnight which would give you 12 hours or 36 hours total non-working hours

141551
punctuation	words
if the cursor is on the first letter of the second words as in the example you gave you can use dwbp or dwbp to handle punctuation

141554
value	field
your key in the prepopulated_field dictionary is the field you want filled and the value is a tuples of field you want concatenation

141576
multiplication	division
bitshifting can be used for insanely fast multiplication and division provided you are working with a power of 2

141576
32-bit	x86
now we get the same offset as before except instead of an expensive multiplication operation we use the two bitshifts...in x86 it would be something like this note it s been forever since i ve done assembly editor s note corrected a couple mistakes and added a 32-bit example

141576
16-bit	8bit
something more useful now would be to use bitshifting to store two 8bit value in a 16-bit int

141595
exception-handling	try-catch
if you put the try-catch inside loops you ll keep looping after an exception-handling

141606
meta-tags	meta
unfortunately both the javascript solution and the html meta tag approach does not work on hosted wordpress.com blogs since they don t allow javascript in post and they don t provide access to edit the html meta-tags directly

141607
msbuild	nant
while you could do all this with regular scripting using nant or msbuild give you a solid framework for doing all this

141607
build-process	msbuild
if you re just interested in compiling and not the entire build-process you may find one time saving benefit of msbuild is the support for building with multiple processor

141612
project-management	project
i m working on database designs for a project-management systemd as personal project and i ve hit a snag

141612
ticket-system	trac

postdata	request
i need to analyse the form s postdata in the navigating event handler before the request is sent

141642
perl	ruby	scheme	lisp
where x is any programming language c# javascript lisp perl ruby scheme etc which supports some flavour of closures

141642
python	ruby
some limitations are mentioned in the closures in python compared to ruby s closures but the article is old and many limitations do not exist in modern python any more

141669
python	ruby
i am considering building an application that is a blend of a dynamic-languages python or ruby and compiled language and need some help getting convincing myself that this is a good idea

141679
linux	osx
plus it works on windows linux and osx

141690
python	ruby
many programs are a mixture of a high-level language like python or ruby and a low-level language like c

141733
duplicates	lookup	lookup	any
this results in duplicates ejb references and will break any jndi lookup such as java comp env ejb ejbname

141752
debugging	trace
the only rea.son that i found out is i save a binary trace log and the one from the release building is ever .so slightly off from the debugging building it looks like the bottom two bits of the 32-bit float value are different about 1 2 of the cases

141775
value	field
the way this was handled is by running some pretty ugly code to evaluate field value and reset the display properties in the during page load

141785
perl	ruby
otherwise just pick a root language perl and ruby use c .so their incorporation is pretty simple

141785
python	ruby	python	java
you could also run python jython or ruby jrunby on a java viewmodel which would give you java as a backend

141791
memset	memcmp	memset	calloc	memcmp	calloc
but if you use calloc or memset the full size of the structures before using them you can do a shallow comparison with memcmp if your structure contains pointers it will match only if the address the pointers are points to are the same

141792
configuration	environment
most of the places i ve worked have used the first methods with environment specific configuration information deployed separately and updates much more rarely outside of the .war ear

141793
processor	cpu
then have a busy while-loop that basically keeps on checked those value figuring out the current cpu usage and waiting a calculated amount of time to keep the processor at a certain threshhold

141798
javascript	dom
using display none in conjunction with javascript and css is the easiest way of simply showing or hiding dom elements on-the-fly

141814
show	next
next i d introduce them to perldoc and show them the basic of using it the -f and -q flags perldoc perl and perldoc perltoc etc. they need to know where to look .when they have questions

141816
extended-ascii	codepages
.so codepages 437 was the codepages i was calling extended-ascii it had the ãª as character 136 .so i looked up .some other chars as well and they seem right

141827
contains	any	flash-cs3	swc
also any actionscript code compiled with the mxmlc compiler -- or even the flash-cs3 author tool -- can use the flex classes it s just a matter of making them available in the classpath refering to the framework swc .when using mxmlc or points to a folder contains the source .when using either

141840
rollback	commit
if you called begin transactional before you did it and have not yet called commit then you can call rollback otherwise.

141856
derived-class	base-class
imagine that you have base-class named animal and a derived-class named dog

141856
derived-class	base-class
the derived-class adds some functionality to the base-class

141856
derived-class	base-class
therefore .when the constructor of the derived-class is execute the base-class instances must be available .so that you can add new functionality to it

141873
digits	zero
as you can see the digitss have shifted to the left by one positioning and the last digits on the right is filled with a zero

141926
subclassing	accessor
or since ipdc_map_template iterator is a subclassing of std map iterator you can still use the original accessor which i find more readable

141949
combinations	permutation
you ve got all the correct combinations now but you re still checked many more than you need to as evidenced by the many permutation your result show

141972
python	java	python	c++
antlr provides libs for python sql java c++ c c# etc

141975
postgresql	mysql
how do the full-text-search systemd of postgresql and mysql compare

.war	jar
it also means every deployment machine has a different jar .war file

141996
.war	jar
copy the jar .war files to a production server in a shared directory named after the subversion revision numbers

142009
value	field
if you re dead set on performing semantic checked in your grammar however antlr allows semantic predicates in the parsing .so you could make a date field that checked the value like this

142018
postgresql	mysql
i m not well versed in postgresql unfortunately but if you use the full-text-search in mysql you re immediately tied to myisam

142057
any	set
as was stated above - xbox360 is fully capable of any hlsl calculation and specifically it can handle vertex and pixels shader model 3 instructions and has an enhanced set of instructions that are specific to the platform

142062
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
in my mind there is absolutely no reason to use classic asp compared to asp.net webforms or asp.net-mvc

142064
backgroundworker	winforms
see my threading article for a winforms example - although the article was written before backgroundworker arrived on the scene and i m afraid i haven t updates it in that respect

142085
highlight	cell
in excel scroll lock allows you to scroll a spreadsheet with the arrow key without moving the active cell pointers from the currently highlight cell

142100
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
that being said i greatly prefer asp.net both asp.net-mvc and webforms myself - but i left asp development about 7 years ago

142112
contains	any
the problem is simply that the validation doesn t have access to any state that it doesn t close over this means that it isn t as reusable as say validationrules that contains their own state

142114
value	field
or is a class like dictionary ideal for storing this kind of information as it will deserialize all the field on disk automatically and if there are new field added in i can just catch exception-handling and substitute in blank strings and int for those value

142132
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know what asp.net-mvc is and i work in webforms but i don t know how asp.net-mvc will be that much different

142143
updatepanel	gridview
one time i had a gridview in an updatepanel with three ajax calendar controls in each row

142156
any	set
just remember that if you have a warehousing strategy of dropping indexes before updating a table then recreating them you will have to set the index up for monitor again and you ll lose any monitor history for that index

142165
entity	poco
if you remove the generics constraint above where t entity you could make this a generics rules engine that could be used with any poco

142170
selected	cell
there are many ways to selected a cell or a range of cell but the following will work for a single cell

142201
put	get
i have found that if i just let them code i will get something very naive put together

142214
display	width
if it s really important to get the full string to display in the titlebar of a form then only way i can think of to ensure that the entire title is display would be to get the width of the titlebar text and use that to increase the width of your form .so that it can accommodate the complete title string

142225
buildr	gant
i like rake but i m thinking it may be better to have something based on a .net dynamic-languages such as boo similar in spirit to gant or buildr for java

142229
alter-column	alter-table
the only a reason i can think of .when you have to know the default constraint s named is if sql-server doesn t support alter-table xxx alter-column yyy set default... cmd

142234
mocking	stubs
in both cases i mean test double created by some mocking libs fakes where that works for the test stubs where you need to return something to the object under test and mocks if you really have to

142240
processor	cpu
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer windows than the cpu sees to better utilise the processor

142249
low-level	hardware
basically anything that needs to have every ounce of performance or low-level hardware access should be in a low-level language

142291
g++	gcc
gcc g++ will from versioning 4.2 and newer

142297
value	field
this would still box unbox but it would allow you to store the clone back into the field effectively making it the real value

142317
void	main
public static void main string arguments throw exception-handling

142318
order	add
add a column contains a calculated random value to each row and use that in the order clause limiting to one result upon selection

what i want to do is inject this value using scripting i can t use a hidden-field as it defeats the purpose into the form .post - and i don t know how to do that with jquery

144479
sql-server-express	sql-server
as far as a dbms foundation use sql-server-express then move to sql-server if you need to

144538
repository-pattern	dao
i m also using the repository-pattern for my dao and i m quite happy with it

144544
rhino-mocks	moq
rhino-mocks or moq will create test double for classes as well as for interfaces

144569
firefox	opera
i know you asked for plugins for ie and firefox but i thought i d just add that opera supports text-to-speech both for issuing cmd and for opera to read web email to you out of the box in windows and possibly mac os

144602
sql-server	oracle
if you re using sql-server 2008 or oracle you can pass in a table value parameter

144610
pointers	stack
since system.valuetype s children live on stack there is no reference pointers to the heap and thus no way to do a reference checked you must compare object by value only

144610
value	field
system.valuetype overrides equals and to use a reflection based equality checked it uses reflection to compare each field value

144659
put	get
.so i managed to get a page with ajax ui.tab and in one of the tab i put jwysiwyg textarea plugins

144661
python	ruby
i don t want to start a language flame .war and i m sure both ruby and python have their tradeoffs .so i ll list what s important to me per.sonally

144661
python	ruby
please tell me whether ruby python or some other language would be best for me

144685
python	ruby
both python and ruby can do what you want

144707
python	java
python java etc have binding and i can code in those languages i just dont want the additional dependencies in this project

144716
gnome	kde
example kde gnome x11 itself

144723
gnome	kde
mono does not use qt kde or gtk gnome widget because they don t match up with the winforms api

144723
cairo	x11
cairo deals with the native graphics implementation such as x11 in linux or quartz in os x

144734
hide	show
most of the low-level database and network methods operate on a global reference to the main form and directly show hide and modify the form

144744
scrollbar	widget
if you decide to put in analog controls scrollbar rotation widget etc be sure to put in a digital control also

144761
dictionary	map
where dictionary is a map like this with more entries

144762
keyboard	mouse
i would also recommend that you accommodate yourself as a programmer from a testing standpoints and from the points of view that things change and there may need to be a keyboard mouse attached to a non-touch workstation

144767
web-services	security
basic security practices for php and web-services in general

144771
contains	set
and just as a complete set of tax forms include not just the main tax form but others that may need to be filled out additional scheduling for example .so a package contains not just the main classes but other classes it may need to interact with

144812
mediator	facade
but you should keep the view decoupled from the framework and just have it dispatcher events and have a mediator deal with the facade

144814
linked-list	nodes
but if i had a private helpers class that would only be used by one other class like a linked-list s nodes or elements i wouldn t recommend separating them

144837
put	get
don t put any controls near the edgess of the screens - it s very hard to get your finger into the edgess particularly if the screens has a deep bezel and a slight calibration problem can easily shift the control too close to the edges to use

144864
python	ruby
there s not really a huge difference between python and ruby at least at an ideological level

144890
quicksort	mergesort
other than that quicksort is known to be very fast on arrays just like mergesort is the common choice for lists

144902
contains	lookup
how fast would the lookup time be for the contains ... methods and for retrieving the value to store in object o

144911
lookup	any
i imagine that any lookup would be o n as i don t think they would use any types of hashtable but would actually use more of an arrays for finding rows and columns

144928
cgimage	cfdata
then get the cgimage s data provider from that a cfdata representation of the bitmap

144929
attributes	properties
also it is worth mentioning that attributes with cacheduration properties set can avoid unnecessary execution of the web service methods

144938
ubuntu	debian
there is also a debian and ubuntu package named nxml-mode

144938
xhtml	tidy
all that being said you will probably have to use something like tidy to re-format your xhtml example

144939
attributes	properties	getter	setter
put the attributes on a short methods or the getter or setter of a properties and you ll fly right by even .when hitting step into in the debugger

144956
javascript	dom
then you can find it through javascript by traversal the dom

144963
json	xml
should probably get into rest vs nonrest formats xml json csv...

144979
default	reset
selected tools -- import and export settings -- reset all settings to restore the default and see if that restores the guid option to the tools menu

144988
value	field
this include methods parameters local-variables and rarely value object field

145024
plugins	add-on
a mozilla developer made a canvas plugins for ie - we could potentially see an open-source ie add-on that brings it up to a certain standards that users could install much like flash

145025
credentials	security
as you may know in wcf there is an operationcontext object from which you can retrieve the security credentials passed in by the caller client

145049
inlining	inline
if you have a smart enough compiler it will do some automatic inlining for you even if you did not specify inline

145054
32-bit	64bit
in many cases assemblies will run the same on the 32-bit or 64bit clr

145059
i2c	spi
that rules out i2c or spi which is unfortunate because they meet your other requirements

145059
put	get
if you re not building a commercial product but instead building something for your own use to put in the engine compartment you can probably get by with usb

145064
fragment-shader	shader
i have implements a yuv to rgb conversion via a fragment-shader written in nvidia s shader language

145070
haskell	ocaml
if your goal is to learn functional language-concepts try starting with a pure functional language like ocaml or haskell

145075
glassfish	weblogic
that said one of the pluses of developing a web application in java is that the interface for working with the http is standardized the servlet specifications .so that you can pick any servlet-container you want be it glassfish tomcat jetty or weblogic

145087
processor	cpu
if its mainly cpu bound then i would create no more than 1 worker thread per processor core on the box

145088
return-value	arguments
the idea that you would pass two functions through as arguments to a third function and then have the return-value be some execution related to the first two functions is an advanced technique that almost always appears only in the core of full-blown libs like jquery

145094
environment	building
you can do all the things you list -- log php errors with request environment data do mysql slow query logging and do analysis and application profiling -- relatively easily without zend platform from the cli and i ve always done it by building logging hooks into the application and then things like shell scripting mon and monit for alert status gui

145102
put	get
danger of falling victim to the second-system effect -- in summary people who have designed something only once before try to do all the things they didn t get to do last time loading the project up with all the things they put off while making versioning one even if most of them should be put off in versioning two as well.

145108
32-bit	64bit
personally my boss has a 64bit vista computer and i program in a 32-bit mode

145115
any	set	double-quotes	single-quotes
of course just for completeness there is an environment variables delimident that can be set - to any value but y is safest - to indicate that double-quotes always surround delimited identifier and single-quotes always surround strings.

145117
boost	stl
programming c++ with boost or stl is a very different experience than programming in c

145136
32-bit	64bit
in c the answer is normally 4 32-bit systemd with 8bit characters or even 8 64bit systemd with 64bit int

145138
controllers	routes
1 you could add routes with the prefix v1 v2 etc. that set a parameter that you can then access in the controllers to specify the process to occur

145151
managed-code	native-code
in some cases managed-code can actually be faster than native-code

145153
python	ruby
there isn t really a lot to separate python and ruby

145153
python	ruby
i d say the python community is larger and more mature than the ruby community and that s really important for me

145153
python	ruby
javascript was originally designed to be scheme for the web and it s prototype-based which is an advantage over python and ruby as far as multi-paradigm and metaprogramming is concerned

145175
expression	evaluation
right now i write expression in the buffering and test them by evaluation with c-x c-e

145191
python	ruby	ironpython	ironruby
i understand that ironpython is an implementation of python on the .net platform just like ironruby is an implementation of ruby and f# is more or less ocaml

145195
ironpython	ironruby
ironpython and ironruby are built on top of the dlr -- dynamic-languages runtime -- and are compiled to cil the bytecode used by .net on-the-fly

145196
boost	stl
also c++ is catching up with new note the quotes features like the stl containers auto pointers etc -- see the boost libs for example

145218
expression	evaluation
then use c-j instead of c-x c-e which will insert the result-of evaluation the expression into the buffering on the line after the expression

145230
python	ruby	python	java	haskell	python
there s only about a dozen or .so oss written in java about half a dozen in c# .something on the order of two oss in haskell only one in python and none in ruby or javascript

145235
internationalization	translation
many of the big words translation into three- or four- letter kanji combo such as å ½éš åœ internationalization 20 chars é å ç æ high availability 17 chars

145236
binaries	install
a lot of software seems to just release new versioning on their binaries that need to be install over older versioning but some software operating systemd like windows in particular seem to be able to release very small patches that correct bugs or add functionality to existing software

145260
environment	building
is necessary for user macros to be defined in the environment used for building events

145270
python	c++
what would be the quickest way to construct a python binding to a c or c++ libs

145273
vb.net	vb6
if it ll be dealing with natural text filenames then it would be better to use vb.net cause vb6 doesn t support unicode well

145292
linux	osx
available on osx linux and windows

145300
ironpython	ironruby
ironruby has the potential to be as fast ironpython since many of the interesting features that make ironpython fast have been extraction into the dynamic-languages runtime on which both ironpython and ironruby and managed javascript dynamic vb ironscheme vistasmalltalk and others are built

145300
python	ruby
e.g. common-lisp is a language that is even more dynamic than ruby or python and yet there are common-lisp compilers out there that can even give c a run for its money

145327
emacs	vim
vim emacs

145347
python	c++
one of the official python document contains details on extends python using c++

145348
arrays	loops
but the most efficient general way i could find is to use a foreach loops on the arrays short-circuiting whenever a hit is found at least the implicit loops is better than the straight for

145351
contains	any
for named must not contains any punctuation and cannot begin with a

145361
debugging	trace
the best way i ve come up with is to enable page tracing in the web-config file write trace messages throughout my code and access trace.axd whenever i need to debugging

145384
python	c++
they re python-like languages for integration between c++ and python

145389
for-loop	arrays
as i am using for-loops on large multi-dim arrays any saving on the for-loop mechanism itself is meaningful

145399
while-loop	for-loop
in most languages compilers the for-loop is just syntactic-sugar for the later while-loop

145424
ubuntu	linux
but later i have to move on to linux ubuntu for an requirement

145424
syntax-highlighting	gedit
by your requirement gedit already have a decent syntax-highlighting and tab

145433
buildr	maven
in this blog article by assaf arkin there is a nice case study a 5 443 line 52 file maven configuration was reduced to 485 line of buildr

145433
buildr	maven
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven

145434
virtual-machine	vmware
you can do it in a virtual-machine with vmware or virtual-pc if you have xp on your workstation

145437
post-increment	pre-increment
btw unless you need post-increment you should always use the pre-increment operators

145449
revision	svn
notice in the bottom right hand corner of this page it has the svn revision id

145450
feedback	account
by deferring account status feedback until a later date they fail to understand what got them caught

145454
python	ruby
i ve use python a very bit but much more ruby

145470
revision	utility
you can use the svnversion cli utility to get a more specific look at the revision including the highest numbers

145481
python	ruby
unfortunately i cannot compare python to ruby since i never used that language

145491
python	ruby
your 4 important points lead to ruby exactly while the 2 somewhat important points ruled by python

145513
perl	ruby
compare that with perl ruby or whatever where you have an extreme freedom which isn t that good in this case

145519
packaging	building
if it is possible for you to building static-libs of your project you can merge them using the libs manager by extraction object-files from all libs and packaging them into a new libs

145526
ref	out
what is more important is to establish best practices for example use as little out or ref parameters as possible.

145533
organization	naming
i think this is also important for opensource project there is no supervisor to tell you how to write your code but many languages have specifications on how naming and organization of your code should be

145536
expression	evaluation
returns true .when evaluation the regular expression of starts with empty string

145538
organization	naming
coding standards are a common way of ensuring that code within a certain organization will follow the principles of least surprise consistency in standards starting from variables naming to indentation to curly braces use

145540
debian	linux
is it easy to set up a user-mode linux sandbox on debian

145541
uniform	points
having the code uniform all the way through presents a better code to the end user .so it looks as if it s written by one per.son - which from an end users points of view it should - that per.son being the company and it al.so helps with reliability within the team.

145543
contains	any
that way the server is abstracted from your actual computer and any virus or .so forth are contains inside the virtual-machine

145544
ip-address	hostname
in iis this will required you to either add each hostname manually however this could also be archieved through scripting or have a dedicated ip-address only for you site

145551
python	ruby	python	java
.so is there any thing like a universal reflection api that would work for all languages or maybe for a few mainstream languages .net java ruby python

145558
exception-handling	error-handling
error-handling - exception-handling hresults error codes

145559
difference	zero
i have yet .so see a real life effect on this i played only with concepts but by then the difference was seconds of execution for jit and zero for c++ but this is worth mentioning alongside the fact templates metaprograming is not trivial.

145565
any	set
is there any free set of forms icons styles images etc for building web-based admin interfaces

145580
radio	click
by simply removing the radio button initially and having the user click a button to call a methods i could simply add a the list of radio button without a problem

145581
perl	ruby	perl	c++	python	perl	python	ruby	python	java	python	c++
this is easy for languages like python or java somewhat blurry for c++ and almost impossible for perl and ruby

145592
codedom	.net
in .net there is codedom which provides a way to generator a universal syntax tree and then serialization it as c# vb .net etc... code and or compile it

145599
rollback	commit
you can t rely on ide pretty-printing to save the day because .some of your developers may not like using an ide and because .when you re trawling through a codebase of thousands of .source files it s simply not feasible to pretty-print all the files .when you start working on them and perform a rollback afterwards .so your vcs doesn t try to commit back all the changes clogging the repository with needless updates that burden everyone

145616
rdbms	acid
if you don t need acid you probably don t need the overhead of an rdbms

145631
hostname	router	hostname	proxy
if you don t verify the hostname part somebody somebody sit at any of the router or proxy the request passes though could do a man in the middle attack

145642
c++	lua
if you re using c++ as the application level it is perfectly reasonable to throw in the lua engine 100kb of binary just for the sake of reading configuration data or writing them out

145648
macports	fink
whereas in linux you can easily required users to have libxxx v.y.y install in os x there are multiple packaging approaches fink macports and for a commercial tool the requiredd libs are expected to be contains in the application

145655
fparsec	parsec
see also fparsec parsec for f#

145659
python	c++
javascript c++ and python

145727
delta	diff
satellite-assembly is a diff delta of your main assembly resources and your localized resources

145727
culture	french
.so if you have a strings.resx with 100 strings in mainassembly.dll of which 10 change in french canadian culture you should have a mainassembly.re.sources.dll satellite-assembly contains just those 10 strings in the fr-ca subdirectories of the dll folder

145731
perl	php
it s not a mutually-exclusive choice you can run both on one system.in the same way that perl and php for example are run side-by-side on many systemd

145737
configuration	environment
viewmodel console works well for accessing each environment and depending on the configuration you set up with nat vs

145754
smalltalk	scheme
uncommon web sounds like a pun on peter norvig s description of scheme in paip is from what i can tell a more complete framework based heavily on the idea of continuations much like seaside for smalltalk

145755
virtual-machine	vmware
run an older versioning of windows in a vmware virtual-machine itself running in a modern os

145758
vmware	esx
we have been using vmware server in production for 2 years now and are migrating to esx next year

145772
windows-vista	windows-xp
windows-xp windows-vista linux and

145790
value	field
this way a controllers could use the field of the view interface to get at the value of the controls the view uses

145794
dlopen	dlsym
alternatively you can load .so files at runtime just as you can with .dll s using dlopen and dlsym

145796
versioning	upgrade
if successive versioning of this get updates all it needs to do is know if its an upgrade or not

145803
32-bit	64bit
i must building with references to either the 32-bit set of dll s or 64bit dll s

145814
type-conversion	double
a suggestion of using a dynamic_cast also does not work as again a type-conversion is attempted at compile-time that is not possible for example with t double std string

145820
32-bit	64bit
i read this as include the 32-bit sqlce files as well as the 64bit files if distributing for 64bit clients

145832
32-bit	64bit
reading and writing to 64bit value is not thread safe on a 32-bit platform

145833
32-bit	64bit
if you are using registry systemd folder or anything related the msi itself must be aware of this and you must prepare a 64bit msi to properly install on 32-bit machine

145834
python	ruby
ruby is my choice after exploring python smalltalk and ruby

145843
contains	lookup
lookup table that contains pk description and code value s used by one or more applications

145852
dictionary	arrays	data-structures	dictionary
there are countless data-structures arrays dictionary etc

145858
function-call	inline
if your function is inline it s basically insert in the code where the function-call is made to it rather than actually calling a separate function

145870
linked-list	arrays
what would be an o 1 lookup in an arrays is o n for a linked-list

145884
header-only	boost
if you re using a header-only libs most of the boost libs are some notable exception-handling are signals serialization and date time you can just copy those header-files

145895
png	gif
create a sample thumbnail convert it to png gif and jpeg and see which is smaller

145897
webserver	nginx	hostname	proxy	httpserver	webserver
i ve setup a webserver with a proxy httpserver nginx which then delegation traffic to different openvz containers based on hostname or requested path

145897
lighttpd	apache	webserver	nginx
inside each containers you can setup apache or any other webserver nginx lighttpd ..

145897
ip-address	proxy
i ve even heard from ssh proxy .so the extra public ip-address might be unnecessary even in that case

145899
python	java
a reflection api depends on the metadata generator for the code .so you can have a universal api for all languages on the jvm or all languages on the clr...but it wouldn t really be possible to make one that does python java and vb etc.

145900
versioning	upgrade
i have an install that upgrade a previous versioning of an .app if it exit

145903
32-bit	64bit
solving the msi issue is up next and unfortunately this will required a non-vs.net tool i prefer caphyon s advanced-installer for that purpose as it pull off the basic trick involved create a common msi as well as 32-bit and 64bit specific msis and use an .exe setup launchd to extraction the right versioning and do the requiredd fixups at runtime very very well

145903
32-bit	64bit
although it s trivial to specify certain actions that should only run on certain platform using the versionnt64 and not versionnt64 execution conditional respectively the built-in ai custom actions will be execute using the 32-bit framework even on 64bit machines

145907
linked-list	tree
i doubt that means that binary tree are not useful but that in kernel and embedded world the linked-list probably fits better

145907
low-level	hardware
and then even in embedded it probably not the only structure used i m living in the world of low-level hardware protocols probably up the hill more data-structures used.

145918
nsstatusitem	nsstatusbar
the cocoa apis for this are nsstatusbar and nsstatusitem

145924
buildpath	libs
the most common problem i can think of is libs errors in which case you have to edit the buildpath

145938
binaries	install
if the people you are distributing are not up to installing boost then i would suggest distributing binaries in an install package to make it as easy as possible for them

145944
boolean	int
you can use a class like this to transform at compile-time a boolean or int into a types

145952
defined	declare
.when used in a header it makes your header file larger and thus will dilute interesting informations like the list of a class methods with code the user don t care about this is the reason that i declare inline functions inside a class but will defined it in an header after the class body and never inside the class body

146011
implements	abstract
for a basic appreciation you should know of a few abstract data types set dictionary order list queue stack etc. and several ways of implements each with their relative trade-offs

146081
arguments	default
i m writing an interactive function that i d like to have remember the last arguments the user supplied and use it as the default

146100
windows-server	windows-xp
it is also worth noting that most pcs are running windows-xp however some are windows-server 2003 and a few are vista

146102
arrays	loops
i find myself using arrays very frequently in combinations with the foreach control-structure to loops through the items

146146
png	gif
q 0.9 application xhtml+xml image png image jpeg image gif image x-xbitmap

146152
http	ssl
the only way to protect the data is to send it trought ssl http instead of http

146180
contains	elements
page -- takes the specified xaml file and compiles into baml and embed that output into the managed resource streaming for your assembly specifically assemblynam resources additionally if you have the appropriate attributes on the root xaml elements in the file it will create a blah.g.cs file which will contains a partials class of the code-behind for that page

146180
any	set
this basically involves a call to the baml goop to re-hydrate the file into memory and to set any of the member variables of your class to the now-created items if you put x named foo on an item you ll be able to do this.foo.background purple

146189
hash	md5
you can either encrypt the http connection via http or there are md5 and other hashing algorithms implements in javascript that can be used client side to hash the passwd client side before sending it hence stopping a sniffer being able to read your passwd

146191
elisp	lisp	lexical-scope	lisp
also keep in mind that elisp is a very old school lisp and variables have dynamic call stack not lexical-scope

146221
sqrt	sin
stuff like sin log sqrt take arrays instead of scalar

146250
push	pull
should i push keypresses to vehicles .when they re pressed or should vehicles pull key pressed from the engine

146250
push	pull
if the player controls the vehicle with the arrow key should a keypress set the accelleration push and a key-release clear the velocity or should the vehicle ask the game-engine if the accellerate key is pressed pull

146250
push	pull
i think a push would mean that the keyboard control module would need to know about vehicles whereas pull would mean a vehicle needs to know specific keyboard controls

146264
keyboard	mouse
if keyboard events are a callback don t use the pull approach for your mouse events for instances

146269
selected	listbox
i need to change the datatemplate for items in a listbox depending on whether the item is selected or not display different more information .when selected

146278
required	checked
usually the configuration change required is to make request for all file extensions go through the asp.net filtering you can checked the configuration for the .aspx extension in iis

146282
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
the reason for this is just that if your data has only o n inversions then you can finish sorting it in o n time using insertion-sort or cocktail sort two-way bubble-sort

146288
required	checked
meaning what value are the ones the accountants will checked yes it required business knowledge hance the tricky part

146288
double	int
double int value n 10.0 10.0

146288
required	checked
of course you need to checked exactly which kind of rounding do your financials required

146293
runtime-compilation	reflection
i ve seen this runtime-compilation use of system.reflection.emit classes in generator dynamic proxy code project sample or other means of optimizing reflection call time-wise

146296
any	set
for any of the styles rules that apply to a single page or a small grouping pages i will set the body to an id and a class making it easy to target particular pages

146318
extends	final
because if the class is final you can t extends it and make it mutable

146336
contains	elements	extends	final
note that it is possible in principles to extends an immutable class and change the base field if the base-class contains a reference to an arrays the elements within the arrays cannot be declare final

146343
arguments	default
by default tab is used to move around autocomplete function-call arguments

146367
url-rewriting	query-string
while the url that is generator with actionlink works it uses query-string variables rather than url-rewriting

146385
any	set
i dont want this properties set in any of my servlets

146393
duplicates	contains
note that if one of the sources contains duplicates you might see duplicates in the output

146393
duplicates	sorted
if you want to remove these duplicates in the already sorted lists use the following methods

146403
dictionary	arrays
another way is to implements an set as an hash arrays dictionary and add all the elements of both the arrayss to the set

146405
freebsd	linux
there are some difference in systems-programming between linux and freebsd

146413
any	set
although there might be potential gotchas methinks any set of such bytes accessed as an int divided by the maximum int of that size will yield a floating-point value between 0 and 1 with approximately that distribution

146462
pointers	stack
unlike pointers it authentication manipulating the object as if on stack

146463
python	java
i d have to checked up on how annotations work in java though but this stuff could easily be done with python annotations.

in short it is all built-in data types ex int char float long int unsigned char double and all aggregation of pod data

146476
metaphone	soundex
soundex extended soundex and metaphone encoding

146490
python	c++
it may seem like the project is geared towards python at first but it can be used for pure c++ as well

146510
value	field
inorder to avoid the inner-join of two tables inorder to get a highly recurrent field requent you can violate the normalize rules and duplicates it on the table relating to the one that has the value

146520
windows-xp	windows
windows-xp and 2003 include a new start menu cmd called windows security that does this but windows 2000 has no such option

146528
return-value	arguments
i know i can get the methods for date by typing date.methods but as far as i know this doesn t provide details about arguments types or return-value

146569
sql-server	postgresql
i am not sure if this is possible in postgresql but here is a working sql-server versioning

146572
constructor	private
.so there are workarounds as always - provide another class with a private constructor which will serve as a namespace for the static-methods

146577
ffmpeg	libav
which means that for example it is physically impossible to compile ffmpeg or its libav libs in msvc because they use many c99 features such as named struct elements

146578
cryptography	security
cryptography is security but security is not explicit cryptography

146589
double	int	unsigned	short
int char wchar_t bool float double are pods as are long short and signed unsigned versioning of them

146589
data-members	constructor
a class struct or union of pods is a pod provided that all non-static data-members are public and it has no base-class and no constructor destructor or virtual methods

146589
constructor	private	data-members	constructor	data-members	private
8.5.1 1 an aggregate is an arrays or class clause 9 with no user-declared constructor 12.1 no private or protected non-static data-members clause 11 no base classes clause 10 and no virtual-functions 10.3 .

146590
conditional	parentheses
the all pseudo-method generator a sublist of the parent list of all the elements in the parent list for which the conditional in the parentheses holds

146624
python	ruby
i totally agree with mikael - if you know what systemd will be running the scripting and you can install interpretters on them go with a scripting-language like python or ruby

146624
python	ruby
of course it depends on what types of automation you need to do - if you re messing with the os or active-directory settings go with wsh - but for your average file housekeeping use python or ruby

146627
python	ruby
i d recommend python over ruby as a windows scripting-language

146627
python	ruby
python windows-support is much more mature than ruby s

146634
engineyard	heroku
if you re using heroku or engineyard the main cloud-hosting solutions today - they building on top of amazon-ec2 you can also use git to manage your code and both heroku and engineyard have great instructions on how to use integrated git with them

146636
put	get
for example if your project is hacked together now and three years later your customer wants to add a feature you will be glad that you have put in the time to get unit tests now

146691
defined	declare
this declare the types elements and struct elements_ says they exist but doesn t defined them say what they are

146691
defined	declare
all you need to store a pointer-to-blah is that blah is declare not that it is defined

146717
perl	ruby
since ruby takes its regexp from perl this latter versioning should work

146725
.when	ready
we use subversion and all we do is save the sql code in the directory for our subversion project and then commit the code to the repository .when we are ready and updates from the repository before we start working on something already in there

146739
selected	button
add a new framework by pressing the + button at the bottom left of the panels and selected from the list presented in the sheet that appears

146743
boolean	int
i need to store a list of key-value pairs of int boolean in .net

146744
keyboard	mouse
for development i tend to switching between the keyboard for typing and shortcuts and the mouse for points at things

146753
keyboard	mouse
spodi i agree on the keyboard for shortcuts .so the only button i use on either the mouse or the tablet are the first and second both of which are available on the pen

146767
keyboard	mouse
my left hand is always on the keyboard while my right is jumping to and from the mouse

146767
click	mouse
who looks at their mouse .when click a button

146777
organization	naming
specifically .when you create an interface implementor pair and there is no overrides organization concern such as the interface should go in a different assembly ie as recommended by the s# architecture do you have a default way of organizing them in your namespace naming scheme

146810
display	height
if your windows display both the detail and editor view you can zoom the editor in to expand the editor view to the full height of the windows

146869
rad-controls	telerik
telerik s rad-controls for asp.net-ajax can be deployed in the sharepoint environment and have a menu control with the accordion behavior out of the box

146871
perl	php	python	perl	python	php
in this way php and the lisp community have .some similarities but .so does other fragmentation open .source platform such as python and perl

146871
common-lisp	scheme
i have decided that i prefer scheme over common-lisp .so that narrows it down a bit

146873
16-bit	8bit
how can a string that only supports 8bit characters contains a 16-bit character unless it uses a codepages which would negate the supports unicode claim

146875
optional-arguments	arguments	arguments	default
using nargin to set default value for optional-arguments and using nargout to set optional output arguments

146886
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	perl	python	ruby	python	php
in fact i d argue it s even behind so-called scripting languages like python perl php ruby and even javascript in these regards

146886
xamarin-studio	monodevelop
with an immature standard-libs no support in any modern ides there are plugins for both visual-studio and xamarin-studio monodevelop limited dynamic shared libs support and few binding to other languages d is simply not an option today

146942
assign	add
it comes up with the correct query to add the parent and assign a new guid for id however it doesn t associate that parent id to the children object in the sql it tries to execute

146981
constructor	object
if there is considerable mixing and matching of behavior i would consider using composition of other object then have either the constructor of the specific event types object-create those object or use a builder to create the object

146988
instances	private
then for each of your event classes just specify the category interfaces it implements and keep a private member instances of the category implementation class .so you use composition rather than inherited

147039
binaries	install
install them in their own directory and make sure you keep package binaries separate you should be fine

147084
directory	folder
i want to ensure that any files or folder created inside the server directory have grouping write permissions and belong to the developers grouping

147112
firefox	opera
the input event also has various bugs in firefox and opera

147139
implements	abstract
why not make animal include an abstract methods that pig and dog are forced to implements

147161
double	int
.so generator a 52 bit or larger unsigned random int for example by reading bytes from dev urandom convert it into a double and divide it by 2 numbers of bits it was

147184
communication	messages
the .app design and business model expects to communication with cell devices via sms text messages

147187
http-get	put
what is the practical benefit of using http-get put delete .post head

147187
put	get
why not focus on their behavioral benefits safety and idempotent forgetting their named and use get put or .post depending on which behavior we want

147187
put	get
why shouldn t we only use get put and .post and drop head delete

147195
put	get
the rest 1 approach uses .post get put and delete to implements the crud rules for a web resource

147208
hide	show
i ve got some javascript that show hide some table rows but .when the rows are set to display none

147209
configuration	logging
additionally aop provides a single points of configuration for additional transactional setup and teardown and the usual logging things

147233
executable-jar	jar
see also distributing your application as an executable-jar file and the oracle docs on how to create a jar file that can be execute with a double-click on windows

147233
deployment	install
it makes java deployment much smoother and user-friendly as it is able to find any install java viewmodel by itself

147233
solaris	linux
currently installanywhere creates launchanywheres on windows 95 98 nt 2000 me solaris linux and mac os x

147234
any	set
by the way it doesn t have a meaning to set java and javascript as equals in any context a popular way of putting it could be

147248
rollback	commit
you d have to handle the storing of the actions in a db if load balanced or in memory or such then handling commit rollback timeout

147299
order	add
in the same way that you can add multiple items to a shopp basket and then submit that basket to process the order you can add bob s account entry to the transactional wrapper and then bill s account entry to the wrapper

147305
grouping	sorting
if the data is both directly related to the additive fact and is not something you want to be grouping sorting search on then putting it in the fact table is okay

147326
put	get
you could use only get and .post but then you are losing out on some of the precision and clarity that put and delete bring

147326
put	get
if you think of a resource management api then get put and delete probably cover 80 -90 of the required functionality

147361
environment	building
1 - updates makefile or building environment to use 32-bit compiler and linker

147363
emacs	vim
i know vim and emacs and vim fits my brain and my habits better

147364
value	field
i need to have these field updatess dynamically .so that as users change quantities the totals and grand total updates to reflect the new value

147364
postback	ajax
i have attempted to use ajax solutions to accomplish this but the asynchronous postback interfere with the focus on the page

147378
python	ruby
what options do you have if you want to write the easy bits or refactor the old bits in a language like python ruby c# or whatever

147388
environment	building
apart from getting your building environment right here are few specifics you will need to address

147388
32-bit	16-bit
in win16 they were 32-bit and could be returned as a dword caller would split return-value into two 16-bit value

147389
python	c++
if you want to work between c++ and python than boost-python is what you re looking for

147389
python	c++
you have to embed the python interpreter into your c++ application but the work necessary to do that is documented here

147389
python	c++
this is an example of calling the python interpreter and extraction the result the python interpreter defined the object class for use in c++

147390
python	c++
python integration for instances is most easily done with boost-python and many other languages will required you to interface them as you would with c using their c libs and declaring your callback to be extern-c unfortunate that you can t use the c++ class definitions in other languages usually

147391
mersenne-twister	generator
i need to do a random_shuffle and want the random numbers generator for this to be from this shared state .so that they can be deterministic with respect to the mersenne-twister s previously generator numbers

147392
emacs	vim
emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs

147392
emacs	vim
i have no doubt that anything you can get done in emacs you can also get done in vim just not standards

147394
oracle	mysql
the next release will include support for third party providers think oracle mysql db2

147415
fitnesse	dbfit
dbfit a framework which integrated with fit and fitnesse to do functional-testing of databases

147416
base-class	inherited
my collectionss are generic-collectionss inherited from the base-class -- collections of

147427
shallow-copy	deep-copy
however one thing i would be concerned with is whether or not it does a shallow-copy or a deep-copy

147449
tiff	png
my custom homebrew photography process software running on 64bit linux gnu writes out png and tiff files

147449
tiff	png
even though i have the tiff 6.0 specifications png specifications and other info in hand it is not clear how to include color calibration data or implements color management systemd on linux

147458
webforms	asp.net
i have an asp.net 3.5 webforms that leverages the frameworks page.clientscript.getcallbackeventreference methods and i d like some of the call to be synchronous

147498
interpreter	runtime
you ll need to be more specific with the os and perhaps language if it s interpreter or runtime compiled ie php java .net etc

147499
strcpy	memcpy
there s some duplication of effort between strcpy and memcpy it d be nice to get rid of though

147505
content-length	http-headers
i am noticing that i cannot read the postdata received because flex does not seem to include the content-length in the http-headers

147505
any	set
any ideas how to set the content-length header

147505
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.3 gecko 2008092417 firefox 3.0

147506
fseek	ftell
also what does the ftell answer with right before the fseek

147561
jquery	dojo
jquery is a javascript libs akin to prototype dojo etc

147570
silverlight	wpf
however silverlight can do .some more interesting things by using the .net and allows you to muck around with with wpf .so you can add 3d-rendering advanced printing playing back movie drm ugh and more things that jquery just can t do yet

147573
icmp	tcp
ping doesn t use tcp - it uses icmp .so using a proxy doesn t really make sense

147581
heuristics	greedy
there are a lot of greedy heuristics where you periodically selected the minimum of a set

147581
heuristics	greedy
the greedy heuristics is not perfect .so even if you pick the minimum you aren t guaranteed to get to the best final answer

147587
constructor	object
in terms of why bother freeing individual members in response to comments to mike b s answer the automatic freeing only applies .when an exception-handling is throw in a constructor of an object being new ly allocated not in other cases

147587
constructor	object
also the memory that is free is those allocated for the object members not any memory you might have allocated say inside the constructor

147589
constructor	object
.when the constructor throw no destructor will be called in this case you don t show a destructor that frees the dynamically allocated object but lets assume you had one

147589
pointers	stack
this is a major reason to use smart pointers - since the smart poitners are full fledged object they will get destructor called during the exception-handling s stack unwind and have the opportunity to free the memory

147589
constructor	object
.when an exception-handling is throw inside a constructor there are several things that you should take note of in terms of properly handling resource allocation that may have occured in the aborted construction of the object

147589
constructor	object
this means that if your object owns resources you have 2 methods available to clean up those resources that might have already been acquired .when the constructor throw

147589
constructor	object
.when the constructor for your object throw an exception-handling the member object will have desctructors called and will have an opportunity to free the resource whose lifetimes they are responsible for

147612
nvidia	ati
have you actually tried ati s rendermoney or nvidia s fx composer

147649
one-to-many	entity
.some tables are one to one relations like a company is one entity and .some are one-to-many entity can have several addresses and .so on

147650
paster	pylons
i ve just started playing around with pylons and was wondering if there is a way to startup the paster server through eclipse .so i can debugging my webapp

147654
crypt	salt
do not store crypt passwd in configuration file but insted of this store crypt salt + passwd

147654
aes	des
for crypt function you can use some well known algortithm as aes idea des or something as simple as xoring each byte with byte from some other string that string will be your key

147657
margins	padding
and especially to rearrange the controls one control per table cell padding margins etc

147690
contains	any
it doesn t have to contains any real data just enough to show the problem

147709
parentheses	braces
...a set of parentheses braces etc

147713
unsigned	zero
in c i could for example zero out bit #10 in a 32-bit unsigned value like .so

147722
operators	keyword
python has c styles bit-manipulation operators .so your example is literally the same in python except without types keyword

147726
lan	wan
the idea was that instead of having our program beat against the wan .when it s down they d send a configuration file contains the closely-guarded admin credentials run it in each lan and zip up the results and email it back

147731
authentication	login
if you are on windows not specified in the question and want to use a windows login to authentication you might want to checkout jcifs

147731
authentication	login
jcifs allows you to obtain the user named of an authentication windows login in java

147768
directory	folder
set the base directory to the root folder also

147776
internet-explorer	firefox
for the reserved-words of the most popular implementation that is firefox and internet-explorer see benc s answer

147776
reserved-words	keyword
the reserved-words in emcascript-262 are the keyword s future reserved-words s nullliteral and booleanliteral s where the keyword are

147777
environment	building
while i use vs 2005 for the release building i still use msvc 6 for much of the gui building simply because classwizard is .so much quicker in this environment than the weak equivalent tools that followed

147786
javascript	dom
javascript relies soley on the underlying page structure and dom augmentation to yield results silverlight is like flash and tends more towards being just a windows in the page with its own canvas etc

147826
output	cat
however .sort with --merge -m can open the output file before reading all input .so a cmd like cat f | .sort -m -o f - g is not safe as .sort might start writing f before cat is done reading it

147839
selected	button
i want to able to add a button onto my prompt page that .when click selected predetermined options such as adelaide north south east and west

147839
selected	button
for example an adelaide button to selected adelaide north adelaide south adelaide east and adelaide west instead of making the user selected the 4 choices in the multi-selected list box

147886
text-rendering	gdi
again you re only going to be able to manage a rough heuristics without something along the line of a full text-rendering engine because what you really want is something like gdi s measurestring or any other text-rendering engine s equivalent

147908
gridsplitter	grid
under the view-model-viewmodel pattern for wpf i am trying to databind the height and widths of various definitions for grid controls .so i can store the value the user sets them to after using a gridsplitter

147916
configuration	environment
boost program_options this allows you to read program options from configuration files environment variables and the command-line

147962
unique	words
wordss will have idwords words and be a list of unique wordss from all the document a specific words appears only once

147962
unique	words
words_docs will have idwords iddoc and be a list of unique id-combinations for each words and document it appears in

147996
windows-vista	windows
setfileinformationbyhandle can do exactly what i want however it is only available in windows-vista my application needs to be compatible with previous versioning of windows

148005
sequences	unique
i want to updates some rows in a postgresql database setting one column to a numbers from a sequences where that column has a unique

148033
click	mouse
as the back forwarding button aren t their own windows you ll need to figure out how to do this with simulating a mouse click at a certain x y positioning .so google-chrome knows what you re doing

148051
minimum	median
the algorithm needs to get some answer about the data such as for instances the minimum or the median

148056
children	nodes	children	tree
in my base-class certain methods involve initializer new tree nodes adding children

148056
duplicates	contains
however i don t want to overrides those methods because they also contains shared logic that shouldn t be duplicates

148057
perl	ruby	python	perl	python	ruby
in other words how does one use mathematica like any other scripting-language perl python ruby etc

148069
contains	elements	queue	fifo
this is a good application of a min-queue - a queue fifo fifo which can simultaneously keep tracking of the minimum elements it contains with amortized constant-time updates

148098
unique	words
find all unique words in the text file

148098
insertion-sort	binary-search
if you use insertion-sort which uses binary-search to find the right insert positioning to insert a new elements into an already sorted list you not only have a fast algorithm to find out if the words is already on the list or not in case it is not you immediately get the correct positioning to insert it and if you always insert new ones like that you will automatically have a sorted list .when you get to step 3

148098
contains	any
on the other hand the database .solution buys you .some advantages you can use it even if the document contains .so many words that the index files wouldn t fit into memory anymore unlikely as even a list of all english words will fit into memory of any average user pc

148098
updating	updates
further you also can prevent locking problems between searching words and updating indexes .when a document has changed that is if the database can perform the locking for you or can perform the updates or updatess as an atomicity operation

148105
any	set
you could also use mutex or semaphore if you want it to work cross process with a slight performance penalty or if you need to set any other numbers than one of allowed simultaneous threads running your piece of code

148114
python	perl
here is how i did it using python instead of perl but that should not matter

148117
event-log	logfile
this include listener that listen for your trace methods and then write to a logfile output windows event-log ones in the framework that are include are defaulttracelistener textwritertracelistener and the eventlogtracelistener

148118
cappuccino	sproutcore
sproutcore and cappuccino

148118
jquery	dojo
i ve seen related questions on stackoverflow but they generator mostly standards answers like use jquery or mochikit or mootools or dojo or yui

148122
implements	abstract	subclassing	superclass
it s still a bit ugly because my superclass foo in the above example is not abstract which means subclassing are not forced to implements the hook

148124
any	set
any global variables are declare and set in the master file

148135
bufferedinputstream	inputstream
for a general inputstream i would wrap it in a bufferedinputstream and do something like this

148140
reliability	scalability
it totally depends on your requirements scalability throughput reliability and .so forth

148151
32-bit	64bit
my guess is that it is that the c libs is probably pre c89 standards and actually treating the 64bit long-long as a 32-bit long

148154
instances	private
remember you can always have the static synchronous methods to be protected or private leaving it visible only to the instances of the class

148161
getter	setter
i m using zend-studio for eclipse linux and i m trying to generator getter and setter methods in a php class

148161
getter	setter
but i haven t generator getter and setter option in source menu it s missed

148162
instances	private
i usually try to make all the resources i try to protect from being accessed by multiple threads private instances-variabless of a class and then have a lock as a private instances variables too

148165
getter	setter
edited i guess it is not possible to generator getter and setter automatically in your versioning though you would be able to create templates for the same and use it as per your requirements

148167
postgresql	mysql
both mysql and recent versioning of postgresql have full text indexing by default

148173
debugging	trace
try debugging or adding some event-log trace to make sure it is

148179
telnet	ssh	telnet	tcp
what you probably want is to tunnel your tcp connections http telnet ssh via your http-proxy using the connect methods

148179
http	ssl
keep in mind that some http proxy are configure to allow connect connections only to certain destinations for example to ports 443 ony for tls ssl http

148180
buffering	streaming
testing was done using a filterreader filterinputstreaming add one to the direct streaming and one to the buffering streaming to see the difference

148194
memcached	apc
lookup articles on apc zend-optimizer memcached quickcache jpcache

148199
triggers	insert
with triggers you specify how to handle data in insert updates etc.

148202
javascript	dom
microsoft recently announced that the javascript html dom libs jquery will be integrated into the asp.net-mvc and into asp.net visual-studio

148214
selected	button
if you have between 2 and 5 answers you should use radio button to have the user selected the answer and an ok button to have the user accept the answer

148214
selected	button	selected	cell	highlight	cell	highlight	selected
.so the user selected a tablerow by click on it which highlight the table cell and then click on an ok button to finish

148214
selected	cell
alternatively you can directly continue as soon as the user selected any table cell but that way you take the user any chance to correct an accidental click

148221
contains	elements
calling tostring on the collections should return a string contains all the elements string representations

148225
unsigned	short
suppose i have one long-long int and want to take its bits and construct four unsigned short int out of it

148225
unsigned	short
i generally know that i need to shift bits and truncated to the size of unsigned short int

148244
photoshop	layer
if you want to have the same effect as the screens layer mode in photoshop then you have to replace all the shades black in the image with shades of the new color to keep the white parts white

148254
packets	ping
no network errors - do a ping and look for missing packets

148265
contains	elements
then reset text-align in the elements if it contains text

148268
getter	setter
omnipotent it s zend-studio v6.01 generator getter and setter feature should be available

148268
getter	setter
edited templates and code assist works fine but are not usefull as generator getter and setter

148278
command-line	cmd
you can also just easily call windows cmd cacls.exe or icacls.exe -both are easy command-line tool

148284
perl	php
regardless of what database management systemd you are using you could use a scripting-language such as perl or php to set up a connection to your database parsing the file and then insert the data into your database

148351
attributes	properties
edit i had an audit attributes on each properties i wanted to consider auditable and used reflection to find them making the methods non-specific to the object being audited

148354
webserver	upload
i have just started using silverlight 2 beta and cannot find how to or if it is possible to rendering a canvas to an bitmap image and then upload it to my webserver

we re using install4j to building install for windows or unix environment

148554
required	checked
further to the couple of comments realting to the use of the system.diagnostics methods for logging i would also like to points out that the debuggingview tool is very neat for checked debugging output .when needed - unless you required it there is no need for the apps to produce a logfile you just launchd debuggingview as and .when needed

148559
sql-server	oracle
main difference of known rdbms oracle sybase db2 sql-server open-source ...

148574
variables	boolean
the caveat about comparing two boolean is a bit of a red-herring as most of the time you re either comparing two boolean variables in which case swapping them round doesn t help or testing whether a flag is set and woe-betide-you if i catch you comparing anything explicit with true or false in your conditional

148610
c-preprocessor	macros
these macros use c-preprocessor to construct enums arrays and code blocks from a list of source data

148623
triggers	insert
triggers writing is tricky as well and if you find you must write a triggers make sure to use set-based statements becasue triigers operate against the whole insert updates or delete yes there will be time .when more than one recording is affected plan on that

148867
command-line	cmd
aside of the cmd command-line

148880
swing	swt
in my experience as a general rules java programs that use swt as the gui toolkit are more accessible then programs that use swing which is why i stay away from netbeans

148880
any	set
for any .net programming i use visual-studio 2005 since it was the standards versioning used at my internship and is very accessible using jaws and a set of scripting that were developed to make things such as the form designer more accessible

also do i need ssl to stop someone sniffing http response between the browser and the webserver

148965
formatting	printing
if a styled text view with colors formatting and pretty printing grows to large append more data at the bottom becomes pretty slow

148968
32-bit	16-bit
as i understand it .bat is the old 16-bit naming conventions and .cmd is for 32-bit windows starting with nt

149003
contains	elements
as you can see the section elements contains a child elements that is of types section

149011
sniffing	traffic
you definitely need ssl to prevent sniffing of the sensitive web traffic not to mention login but that doesn t solve your server-side encryption problem

149028
http	ssl
you should use tls ssl http .so that eavesdropping on the http traffic is harder to perform

149033
rounding	currency
i know that a float isn t appropriate to store currency value because of rounding errors

149047

149136
solaris	linux
we have a systemd written in c and running under solaris linux that uses the sybase ct-library to access a sybase database

149137
triggers	insert
i would further bet that the triggers assumes the insert or delete special tables will only ever have a single row which is in fact not the case in mass updates like the one you re execution causing the problem

149139
key-value	key
the power of the b+tree is that you can easily find a single key-value within the tree and then simply walk the leaf nodes to scroll through the data in key order

149139
dbase	dbf
for a simple format that s useful and popular consider looking up the original dbase format -- dbf files

149140
contains	any
if foo s index also contains an index on bar that additional indexing level will not affect the utility of the foo index in any current uses of that index nor will it appreciably affect the performance of maintaining that index but it will give the database additional information to work with in optimizing queries such as in the example

149146
authentication	login
if you use the standards membership-provider and set the authentication for the directory page the code will automatically set a query parameter of returnurl and redirect after a successfull login

sql-server	oracle
.so behind the scenes oracle and sql-server for that matter will first locate the range of rows on both indic

149164
worksheet	excel
your webserver should use compression for this extension and your code should checked if the numbers of rows returned is greater than what excel can display in one worksheet

149169
rounding	currency
rounding at the last minute is not the answer as real currency calculations are rounded as they go

149173

149194
common-lisp	forth
i d also suggest common-lisp and other people will doubtless have other suggestions can you get a good forth systemd nowadays

149247
contains	elements
in the simplest case of homogeneous simple elements in a single collections you would just merge directly to a new file on disk avoiding much in-memory work ensuring that the outer contains elements are stripped off and added around the collections

149287
http	ssl
this is almost certainly going to be true given that ssl required an extra step of encryption that simply isn t required by non-sll http

149311

you can already see how if i declare more colx variables to defined other columns i could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of sort .

149380
filtering	sorting
ps be glad i didn t show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting dynamic filtering text-searching of columns paginator via rownumber over and try...catch with transactional rollbacking on errors.

149380
any	set
with sql-server 2005 we can set permissions on a per-user basis if need be at the schema level on individual stored-procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly

149381
windows-server	windows
however i believe that windows-server 2003 does not support paravirtualisation at all and i m not sure what level of support is delivered in windows 2008 server

149388
communication	messages
my best guess and one i think is probably pretty close is that it uses mach ports or an abstraction on top of them to provide intra-thread communication passing selector information along as part of the mach messages

149397
http	ssl
edit one points that has been brought up by several others is that ssl handshake is the major cost of http

149397

nsrunloop	nstimer
a nsrunloop internally is a linked-list and by adding a nstimer object to the runloop a new linked-list elements is created and added to the list

149471
keyboard	mouse
if the fire date for every timer is still in the future and there is no other event to process like a keyboard mouse event from user-interface or a sent notification it would return null

149471
nsrunloop	nstimer
performselectoronmainthread creates a nstimer object like this one that fires only once and where the time to fire is already located in the past .so it needs firing immediately then gets the nsrunloop of the main thread and adds the timer object there

149474
libxml2	libxslt
i was using python libxml2 libxslt to process this

149490
shared-objects	.so

149506
getter	setter
in this tutorial the following bean getter and setter omitted is used as an example

149527
pascal	scheme
in the grand scheme of things pascal vs camel doesn t matter that much and you re not likely to convince anyone to go back over an existing codebase just to change the case of named

149567
32-bit	64bit
if you ve hit the 32-bit 4gb limit consider moving to a 64bit architecture or compiling your program for 64bit

149593
xsd	xml
.so i generator .some linq2sql xml to see how they do it and they pass types but types isn t a valid attributes according to the xsd .so it fails

i m not aware of any per-source file flag setting but you can set the option for each result binary with

149648
eclipse-plugin	aptana
the zend development-environment is now an eclipse-plugin you may be able to run it alongside aptana and just use it s indentation code feature

149675
triggers	insert
you could create an insert triggers to do this however you would lose the ability to do an insert with an explicit id

149703
value	field
if the value test esf foo bar was in the field foofield

149709
children	nodes
if the order of the children within the nodes is relevant then you need to maintain the task order within the parent

reed-solomon	crc
it might not be a crc it might be an error correcting code like reed-solomon

149720
interlocked	atomicity
intel s open-source threadbuildingblocks has a templates atomicity that offers the same functionality as .net s interlocked class

149725
perl	awk
this is the types of work that got me to move from awk to perl in the first place

149726
put	get
in the meantime you can put an extra comment character at the end of your comments to get it to look okay

149740
installation	building
we needed the user to be able to modify some settings in the installation such as the deployment path - it wants to serve the files from their network shared not known at building time

149741
exception-handling	try-catch
you have to do a try-catch and if the clickonce versioning building numbers throw an exception-handling then the application is not running as a clickonce-deployed application that is it s running as a regularly compiled application or from visual-studio

149795
any	set
.so does anyone know if there is any relationship between the acl table and the snmp set community named

149851
.net	wcf
this is being done on .net 2.0 without the use of wcf or ws-security

149865
irrlicht	ogre
ogre and irrlicht both are said to have a cleaner design than crystalspace .so i wouldn t worry to much about problems with the latter

149884
arrays	loops
it s not a dependency loops it s a a reference loops li holds the b object the b object holds an arrays of li object s

149886
oprofile	valgrind
try something like oprofile or valgrind or take a look at this for a more extended list

149908
msbuild	nant	build-server	msbuild	build-server	nant
if you have an integration build-server then of course you have no choice but to use the command-line no native tasks for msbuild ant nant that i know of

149908
accurev	svn
accurev is new therefore there has little resources available online as apposed to svn which you would find tons of integration work that was done by hundreds with jira for example

149913
double	int
the standards way of generator a double uniformly in 0 1 is to generator an int in the range 0 2 n and divide by 2 n

149913
cryptography	openssl
for cryptography purposes you should use one of the standards cryptography libs out there instead such as openssl which will indeed use dev urandom .when available

149918
32-bit	64bit
cmd.exe is the 32-bit cmd processor in windows-nt 64bit windows oses also have a 64bit versioning

149918

149918
environment	execution
the order of execution is controlled by the pathext environment variables

149928
unchecked-exception	runtimeexception
i would say it s okay as long as you make them unchecked-exception subclassing of runtimeexception in java

149929
perl	awk
unless i had to do this lots of time then i d find a way to take two time output and add them up to the screens using awk or shell or perl or something

149947
interlocked	atomicity
strictly speaking linux cannot offer atomicity interlocked functions like ones in win32 simply because these functions required hardware support and linux runs on some platform that don t offer that support

149952
worksheet	excel
i even liked wax which allows to implements simple testcases via excel worksheet

149975
silverlight	wpf
.so instead of silverlight vs flex you are looking at wpf vs air

149978
subclassing	superclass
the crtp gets a lot less curious if you consider that the subclassing types that is passed to the superclass is only needed at time of methods expansion

149978
subclassing	superclass
you just need the pattern to import the symbolic subclassing types into the superclass but it is just a forward-declaration - as all formal templates param typess are by definition - as far as the superclass is concerned

149978
subclassing	superclass
we use in a somewhat modified form passing the subclassing in a traits types structure to the superclass to make it possible for the superclass to return object of the derived types

149978
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
the application is a libs for geometric calculus points vectors line boxes where all the generics functionality is implements in the superclass and the subclassing just defined a specific types cfltpoint inherited from tgenpoint

149995
unsigned	short
if i change the types of the field wwindow to unsigned int wwindow 16 which has the same numbers of bits as an unsigned short the program tells me the size of the struct is now 20 bytes the correct size

149995
32-bit	x86
i am using microsoft visual-studio 2005 with sp1 on a 32-bit x86 machine
