from the view a i open the view b which contains category in a uitableview .when i selected a category i open the view c which contains subcategory for the category using the coredata persistent in a uitableview .when i selected a subcategory i open the view d which contains all my product using the coredata persistent .when i selected the the product how can i set the value into the view a

2101860
versioning	upgrade
make sure that you named your .sqldataprovider file with the appropriate versioning prefix if your module versioning in 01.00.01 then your sqldataprovider file named should be 01.00.01.sqldataprovider -- dotnetnuke will install upgrade based on a comparison of what you are already have install vs what you are installing and it will execute the appropriate scripting to bring the module up to-date

2101862
kerberos	ldap
.so ad could be authentication with kerberos or ntlm or ldap bind

2101862
kerberos	ldap
.so maybe your application in question is multi-protocol capable and because it is operating in an ad domain it is default to kerberos but if it were operating in an ldap only environment it would default to ldap bind

2101874
sql-server	mysql
i have the following query running on a mysql but it fails .when i run it on a sql-server database

2101881
margins	padding
like regdwight says it s about margins padding not alignment

2101884
user-controls	ascx
i m building several user-controls ascx for my website and several of them are very similar in what they do

2101898
any	set
that way you can set the background on your windows without any problems

2101901
icollection	ienumerable
if the query in your properties accepts iqueryable as a parameter and returns iqueryable and there are no conversions to from ienumerable or icollection before the return the query will not be execute in the properties

2101904
subclassing	nsobject
that means any subclassing of nsobject can be a delegation for nsurlconnection

2101914
mapping	unique
a unique match is determined by the set of nodes in t not the mapping between the nodes in t and s

2101920
authentication	login
the login screens only authentication the user to your application it does not give you authentication to the user s gdata

2101959
directory	folder
in the root directory i have a folder called views with all of the pages that i use

2101965
callback	methods
the animation wont happen the way you expect slideup is asynchronous meaning that it will start sliding up and then immediately load you probably don t want this behavior .so look into jquery s methods of chaining animation via callback see the docs for slideup for example or take a look at jquery 1.4 s delay methods

2101979
inline-formset	formset
i ve got an inline-formset and i would like to exclude some model object from being display in the formset

2101979
inline-formset	formset
i wonder if it is possible .somehow to filtering the list of b object before the inline-formset is rendering .so not all b object related do a gets into the formset

2101980
value	field
you have a serious problem to fix it create a field called types with avalaible value such as apple orange pear and the notorious pomogranite

2102000
dbase	dbf
seems the issue is primarily related to the ole dbf dbase drivers is unable to write to the clipper native format which is a modified versioning of dbase iii

2102001
python	java	python	c++
that s pretty common boilerplate used in java c++ python and i m sure other languages also

2102001
instance-variables	class-variables
the alternative is to make the transitions rules instance-variables instead of class-variables and then create the instances after all the classes are defined

2102003
ruby	php
this time around we tested our proof-of-concept with php ruby coldfusion java and .net to make sure it was actually interoperable

2102011
rollback	commit
while creating a repository by using nhibetnate or whatever should i keep explicit begintransaction commit rollback like the following

2102028
environment	building
if the other ant scripting is going to be called by some other scripting or excessive environment has to be set inorder to run the building then it s probably better to give a custom named to that scripting

2102029
rollback	commit
create a separate itransactionmanager which will return my.itransaction which you ll later commit and rollback as needed

2102030
contains	lookup
in your case i would suggest you create a servertype lookup meta table which will contains a list of your server types orange apple watermelon etc

2102043
value	field
instead of mysql returning null it just seems to drop the where parentusersvalue.user_id usersvalue.user_id clause and pick the first value that matches the other two field

2102048
contains	any
according to msdn an azure service can contains any numbers of worker roles

2102049
keyboard	mouse
native keyboard mouse hook

2102059
attributes	properties
i used reflection to get the url of the page through it s description attributes and i pass query-string parameters as an anonymous types also using reflection to add each properties as a query-string parameter

2102060
fdt	swc
you need to include the -library-path parameter .when you call the application and include either users mga document fdt workspace vgline libs or the location of each of the swc or swf files you re referencing

2102064
web-config	app-config
if there s a section configure in the app-config or web-config the .net creates another instances of the specified class to decode the section and merge with the already created instances

2102077
value	field
in that same tab blank line checked also the value of the before field declarations 1 could explain the blank line you see

2102086
contains	any
i ve checked my elisp files to make sure that i do not have any binding that contains shift+r and i have not found any

2102097
contains	any
you should be able to use bringintoview to bring your new item into view within any scrollable regions it is contains within

2102100
configuration	environment
how useful is partial-trust configuration in asp.net environment

2102109
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
this approach assumes you are using an uinavigationcontroller with a stack of uiviewcontroller instancess each of which having a managed object context instances as a part of a core data application

2102109
any	set
from any view controllers thereafter you will be able to set and access your selectedproduct value

2102113
.net	wcf
.so i believe all you have to do with .net 2.0 vanilla web-services not wcf is the following

2102184
arrays	loops
if you don t want to use a plugins and you have your users and passwd stored in an arrays simply throw it into a loops and use the wp_create_user function

2102223
.when	ready
the correct design pattern is to assign a function for the ajax call to run .when the ready state changes

2102227
value	field
you can easily display its value as a hexadecimal numbers by extraction the component field from the encoding which would give you 0x8.66666 but converting it to decimal is rather harder to do correctly

2102229
shell	bash	bash	zsh
i use bash and zsh as shell

2102235
environment	building
using debian openjdk runtime environment icedtea6 1.6.1 6b16-1.6.1-2 openjdk 64bit server viewmodel building 14.0-b16 mixed-mode

2102252
duplicates	elements
removes duplicates elements from self

2102252
arrays	loops
however later in the same program i am pushing elements onto another arrays inside of a loops

2102252
arrays	loops
then under loops i d like to de-dupe the arrays but i dare not write hooks_tested.uniq

2102261
put	get
you can certainly write perl scripting that provide a tk gui that will work on any platform and you can even package the libs they need to work with par to put together an application that will run anywhere with an appropriate versioning of perl install without requiring the end use to install a bunch of stuff from cpan to get it to work

2102261
solaris	aix	solaris	linux	linux	aix
edit following daotoad s response it does appear that activestate s perlapp can building cross-platform binaries for for windows mac os x linux solaris and aix

2102271
debugging	trace
debugging in dataflow is excellent because it is very easy to detach a set of items from their surrounding patch and run them independently and turning on trace for a part of the flow is as easy as attaching a numbers box to an outlet

2102293
silverlight	wpf
for years i have exclusively worked with wpf and never touch silverlight

2102293
silverlight	wpf
is there a quick tour for wpf pros that introduces me to silverlight 4.0 its unique features and its difference to wpf

2102322
blacklist	whitelist
im spamming is easily blocked by using a whitelist blacklist

2102331
silverlight	wpf
contrasting silverlight and wpf

2102332
credentials	account
i think you need to store credentials for the datasource as well as for the execution account in the ssrs configuration tool especially if you re using local systemd

2102345
configuration	environment
this approach works very well for cli scripting as well for cli you set the os environment variables for apache you can use setenv switches in the hosts configuration

2102377
compact-framework	.net
we ve got a model-view-presenter setup with our .net compact-framework .app

2102382
multi-query	mysql
you re right multi-query does not work by default and it s not supported at all by the plain mysql extension in php

2102383
.when	ready
im goign to guess your dom isnt ready .when you call the accordian in the external file but it is .when you call it in the scripting tags

2102399
scheme	lua
the functional features of lua have the same semantics as scheme but lua has a unique implementation of first-class-functions which i think they ought to submit for publication in the journal of functional-programming

2102402
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested it on my test page with firefox 3.5.7 and google-chrome 4.0.223.11

2102413
contains	elements
you could also write to only match elements that contains a in their text

2102429
solaris	linux
we building it on windows linux and solaris sparc mostly

2102429
solaris	linux
i was never able to find a linux solution for building pkg files that can be install on sparc solaris -- does anyone know if one exists today

2102485
click	mouse
nor it possible using dom features - dom do not fire events on every properties change - instead it only fires events on certain user actions mouse click key presses or page lifecycle and their derivative

2102487
linked-list	arrays
.when you allocate some memory maintain that information in a linked-list storing the index of the arrays and the length in the data part

2102487
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
deletion will be scanning the arrays for the particular index and removing the nodes in linked-list

2102487
linked-list	nodes
once the nodes is removed have a separate linked-list contains these free allocation

2102487
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
regularly scan the free nodes linked-list and for each elements move the elementss in the arrays and updates the index of the nodes in linked-list appropriately

2102493
temporary	copy
this is because internally the std for_each makes a copy of the functor as it is poassable to pass temporary object

2102496
contains	elements
if onfinish is really called after the movie is finished you may remove the elements contains the flash

2102503
opensolaris	solaris
on opensolaris o eq solaris vers

2102516
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i ve been testing in various browsers since my return home and it seems that firefox 3.5+ gives the same behavior -reporting button one on both windows-xp and ubuntu 9.10 all webkit browsers midori epiphany safari and google-chrome fail and report button two.

2102532
children	nodes
the hardest part would lay in properly setting up the graphing keeping tracking of which nodes gets which children but if you can devote some cpu cycles to that you d be fine afterwards

2102534
localization	translation
the example given on msdn is really insufficient for serious localization it assumes every string is entirely present and has no parameters the reality is you will have value you wish to embed within the string but need placeholder to mark the location of that variables in the string .so a translator can move the marker as they translation

2102534
silverlight	wpf
it s quite a pain but the localization story is just noticably lacking - even chatting at the pdc09 over silverlight 3 4 there is really not a great route at present in-place - if wpf multibinding makes it across to sl4 that makes it slightly easier but i havn t seen a good alternative implementation as yet except for people outputting all the strings from the viewmodel - which seems wrong form the designers perspective

2102595
value	field
but this value depends on the types field

2102606
children	tree	children	nodes
each nodes of the tree might have an arbitrary numbers of children

2102626
getter	setter
simply to distinguish them by more than just case from corresponding getter setter

2102631
compact-framework	.net
i have a .net 2.0 application that runs on compact-framework

2102642
selected	button
i d like to set up the uitextfield to show the keyboard if the user click into the main area of the uitextfield to enter a new tag and use a button as its rightview to display a uipickerview that will allow the user to selected from a list of known tags that have already been entered

2102642
any	set
surely .someone out there has already done this .so any hints on how to set this up or if i m using the iphone s user-interface elements correctly would be great

2102645
credentials	security
during creation of each proxy i d like to defined programaticaly specific endpoint behavior adding localization headers etc and defined client credentials settings i m using messages level security with username client credentialss

2102658
common-lisp	scheme
the difference between common-lisp and scheme are over-rated

2102660
reflection	runtime
some parts of libgcj use reflection to load classes at runtime

2102660
any	set
usually launchd scripting are used to set any environment that you need for running the executable

2102680
interpreter	runtime
.so the runtime systemd has to include a java bytecode interpreter and or a jit compiler

2102694
compact-framework	.net
it s also generally evident that the built-in docking and anchoring features in .net compact-framework v2.0 is far from being sufficient

2102697
children	nodes
every nodes holds address of region in vector occupied by its children

2102697
children	nodes
that way you can easily find children of any randomly given nodes and reorganize arrays without moving all elements just copy children to end of table updates pointers and add next child to end of table

2102708
document	editing
my libs is being used by atalasoft the company i work for to generator pdfs from whole cloth and to do editing within a very limited domain annotations document metadata

2102716
binary-tree	tree
the standards way of storing a full binary-tree in an arrays as is used for binary heap implementation is nice because you can represent the tree with an arrays of elements in the order of a level-order tree traversal

2102722
children	nodes
represent each nodes as where val is the nodes s value and each int is the positioning in the list of one of it s children

2102724
associations	model
i have nested-attributes for a ruby-on-rails model and the associations validation are failing for some reason

2102726
contains	set
i have set up a svn repository on a development that contains a website

2102744
hash	md5
normally tfs will checked the contents of the files upload and will only include a file in the changeset if the md5 hash of the file is different to the last versioning that was in versioning-control

2102760
return-value	arguments
i would recommend providing a boolean return-value as well for your function for additional peace of mind while working with your stored procedure and referencing your arguments by named unless you re planning on targetting older versioning of postgresql in which case you ll need to add a declare section

2102789
factors	matrix
conversely if you use maximum likelihood factors the choice of either covariance or correlation matrix does not affect the results

2102803
negative-number	zero
you are creating a 32-bit bus result whose 16 most significant bits consist of 16 copies of bit 15 the msb of the a bus and whose 16 least significant bits consist of just the a bus this particular construction is known as sign extension which is needed to right-shift a negative-number in two s complement form and keep it negative rather than introduce zero into the msbits

2102804
entity-framework	ado.net
if you want simplicity and abstract layer then you can use ado.net entity-framework with mysql .net connector

2102813
vb.net	vb6
the key to shifting it from vb6 to vb.net for example is to use the interop libs - here s one article

2102824
unicode	wstring
of course if i am using unicode i use std wstring and wchar_t

2102848
digits	zero
you need to remember the numbers and the rest of the line separately .so the pattern is which is basically zero of more digits followed by spaces followed by any numbers of characters

2102877
annotations	mapping
you can create the database-schema out of the mapping or annotations turn automatic generator of tables on with eclipselink.ddl-generator and then compare the two database-schemas using some database tool that will depend on your database

2102897
environment	building
as far as deployment our building scripting are setup to building the code and copy only the files that have changed including the assemblies to our environment

2102899
python	c++
.so far i ve been looking into python with py2exe c++ c#

2102924
children	nodes
each nodes has buckets of children

2102942
c++	lua
currently i m building my own scripting viewmodel manager class in c++ i have no problems with any of the lua lua c or c++ stuff but the one section that confuses me is .when to use lua_pop and .when to use lua_remove

2102950
put	get
get .some complicated constantss nearby which cannot be written in 1 simple instruction .mov r3 #0x12345678 is impossible to complete in 1 instruction .so the compiler may put this constants in the end of the function and use to load it instead

2102967
attributes	properties
then click on a tab will simply make the display attributes of the appropriate content s div block while making the other two divs display properties none

2102973
hide	show
another thing you could do is make sure you have a unique viewmodel for each of these views you want to show and hide

2102973
hide	show
then from your parent or main viewmodel you show or hide the views you want by virtue of having them in a collections of viewmodel

2102983
conditional	operators
give if s and conditional operators exactly what they ask for boolean

2103018
installation	building
easy gui building single exe with copy go installation object-pascal as language .

2103029
operator-precedence	associativity
here s an article listing operator-precedence and associativity

2103029
double	int
alpha is being declare as an int but you seem to be comparing it against a double

2103032
contains	any
empty.dll embed its own manifest contains dependent assembly references on any public or private assemblies it required

2103032
windows-server	windows
if you want to put the emptyassm manifest and dll in a different folder to your .application folder and if you are targetting windows-server 2008 or windows 7 or later you can add a configuration file for your .app -

2103032
contains	any
they are always in this model located in the same folder .so the file nodes of the manifest cannot contains any pathing information at all - only the named of the dll

2103032
windows-server	windows
windows versioning 6.1 otherwise known as windows-server 2008 or windows 7 and later will additionally to the module folder search the path specified as the privatepath elements of the probing elements in an application configuration file

2103038
textbox	button
at the footer of the listview is another button add new step which opens up an empty textbox and two button to save and cancel

2103043
hide	show
initially only show the first tab content and hide all others using css display none

2103049
swing	awt	system.out	system.in
if you want a program to work on the command-line then you read and write the from system.in and system.out or files rather than using swing or awt

2103062
ie-developer-tools	developer-tools
any user of the site can change the src value of the iframe using developer-tools like firebug and ie-developer-tools

2103068
children	tree	children	nodes
this algorithm corrects performance issues in walker s algorithm which generalizes reingold and tilford s methods for tidy drawings of tree to support tree with an arbitrary numbers of children at any given nodes

2103071
parsing	comma
.when i read a comma seperated file or string with the csv parsing in python all items are represented as a string

2103075
decrement	increment
i have a javascript file called pendingajaxcallscounter.javascript with a variablesiables variables pendingajaxcalls which is increment decrement .when variablesious methods in the javascript file are called

2103093
primitive	int
and not all primitive wrapper types just the supported ones - byte short char int

2103101
parentheses	braces
basically you don t have that much syntax with braces and parentheses in the way of your code

2103122
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	linux	netbsd	linux
tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally

2103122
logfile	tail
tail -f will keep following the old file which is no longer the active logfile while tail -f will watch for a new file being created and start following that instead

2103124
malloc	free
it is hard to say but i think at the heart of the problem is that there are two heap in your application which need to be maintained -- the standards java heap for java object allocation maintained by the jvm and the c heap which is maintained by call to malloc free

2103144
selected	textbox	selected	cell
i ve created a sub afterupdates for the textbox in the form and can simply create a selected case to updates the cell based on what value is entered

2103144
selected	cell
.so in my form .when i selected a for one cell another cell would automatically updates with the information 1 00

2103149
constructor	object
i know grails has a map based constructor for domain object to which you can pass the params of a url to and it will apply the appropriate field settings to the object using introspection like this.

2103149
constructor	object
i was wondering whether there was an equivalent methods of taking the params and applying them to an existing object and updating value in the same way that the map constructor must work something like.

2103165
python	php
appcelerator s aptana acquisition faq says they intend to continue developing the server-side python php and ruby-on-rails product

2103165
openvz	xen
often you have to use more expensive hosting to get something like xen rather than a more efficient viewmodel systemd like openvz that doesn t let you use swap spaces

2103178
binary	hex
to show the binary representation of the floating-point numbers in hex

2103188
key-value	key
after you are done with a single iterator you need to have the key on top of stack .so that lua_next knows which key-value pair comes next

2103205
parentheses	operators
the following is more concise but it s hard to remember the c language s operators associativity and operators-precedence i prefer the extra clarity of some added parentheses and whitespace provides

2103212
contains	elements
aside from simple types contains companyid companyname companydescription etc. inside the xml there is a series of the same elements contains tons of metadata involving contact

2103221
mocking	stubs
i would read up on using phpunit s mocks and stubs and mocking the filesystems in the phpunit manual

2103226
children	tree	children	nodes
for a tree having a as root nodes and b c d as children its representation will be as below

2103228
object-reference	instances
i am trying the following but i am getting object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2103235
contains	any
however i need to delete this file after the daemons has process any cmd contains therein

2103240
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
ruby - also a good choice look at hpricot a lot less mature than perl or python in terms of modules available

2103242
bazaar	git
also for various reasons i won t be able use git unless there is a bulletproof strategy to convert this specific repo from subversion to git to hg bazaar

2103245
plotrix	lattice
some other options include levelplot in lattice or color2d.matplot in plotrix

2103254
value	field
just as an after thought this will not updates value to a table as the textbox will not be bound to a field

2103257
windows-vista	windows
event tracing for windows include in windows-vista and later provides a nice capability for this

2103265
configuration	installation
to make sure the problem was not on permissions for the files i did a separate branding new joomla installation on another folder and it worked just fine i could access the website and i also could login to admin page then i changed the configuration file to connect to the joomla i m trying to move and now i find myself again unable to login

2103276
variables	boolean
variables songpaused boolean

2103276
variables	boolean
variables songstopped boolean

2103276
variables	boolean
variables changeclr boolean

2103285
environment	execution
taking into account the execute disable bit what is the recommended way of execution instructions against a native processor from a high level managed environment such as vb.net 2008 or c#

2103288
installation	environment
one option is to have everyone set an environment variables like libname_root that points to the root of their installation of the libs and then add paths like and to your project s compiler and linker settings respectively

2103303
linked-list	tree	binary-tree	tree	binary-tree	linked-list	put	get
a good hash-function is supposed to more or less randomly distribute the hash value .so that .when you put the hash value into a binary-tree you get a good evenly distribute tree and not one that is just a linked-list down one side

2103326
delayed-job	worker
.when the first application-server whether through mongrel or passenger starts it ll start my delayed-job worker

2103326
delayed-job	worker
.when the last running application-server terminate it ll kill all the delayed-job worker

2103326
delayed-job	worker
is there another way that you start end delayed-job worker that you think is best

2103326
delayed-job	worker
could the same thing be easily done in the development-environment where there s guaranteed to only be one application-server not a cluster of them by fork a child-process to run the delayed-job worker that would always terminate .when the parent terminate

2103329
textbox	onblur
the error msj should be display on the onblur event of that textbox username textbox and email textbox

2103338
cursor	row
why don t you just use a panels with image in it and move the panels to corresponding location in row that cursor is in right now using mousemovehandler mouseouthandler

2103349
contains	set
.so if my set contains

2103366
contains	elements
attributes cannot contains multiple value child elements can

2103377
bimap	map
you probably want to use a boost bimap instead of a normals map -- it provides this capability quite directly

2103381
highlight	selected
this is all well and good but i don t like the way it is selected highlight each item in the tree i m dropping on it s less clear where the item is going to drop

2103392
scheme	lisp
sicp is more a general book about programming and computer science not .so that much about scheme or lisp programming

2103394
jax-ws	cxf
that said with cxf in your jax-ws endpoint configuration you can overrides the wsdllocation with an attributes on the jax-ws endpoint to specify something like web-inf testservice.wsdl

2103397
parsing	comma
.so i m using the php function fgetcsv to parsing a .csv file comma separated field are enclosed by and import it to a mysql

2103432
any	set
also any new data types that you need to support complex numbers perhaps would need its own set of heuristics and would have to placed in the most appropriate place in the chaining of checked

2103435
difference	zero
you should be able to tell the difference between a zero entry and empty field using the following.

2103445
value	field
it s an extension of the mysql database drivers that lets you do those to add any calculated value as a field

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
in every other browser i tried firefox google-chrome safari it works fine

2105220
hide	show
in my case i choose to show or hide based on an expression to which i set the expression to the value of a parameter which is a boolean types

2105220
export	csv	export	report
the functionality works as expected during the initial rendering however .when i choose to export the report to csv the visibility expression is either ignore or not evaluated because the columns show up regardless of the setting

2105220
export	csv	hide	show
the visibility dialog has three options show hide show or hide based on expression - if i explicit set hide option the csv export does not include the column as you would expect however if i use an expression it will - i even went .so far as to make the expression explicit like true and still it was ignore

2105246
any	set
to see if any value have changed you will probably have to set a store the row id somewhere .when something is changed then go through all the rows that have changed and do your updates

2105247
export	report
this is because the expression will only get evaluated in the report itself not the export

2105247
hide	show
a workaround would be to hide the columns by default and show all others using the expression

2105247
hide	show
it seems what you will have to do is make a parameter that will show which columns to hide or display then .when the report runs just don t display any data in those columns

2105249
margins	padding
.when i add a h1 tag i expect a margins and padding on it

2105256
mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseout	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseover	mousemove	mouseout	mousemove	keydown	keydown	mouseup	keydown	keyup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown	keyup	mousedown	mouseout	mousedown	keydown	mouseup	keyup	mouseout	mouseup
possible event value click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout keydown keypress keyup

2105256
mouseleave	mouseenter
currently not supported blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change submit

2105272
division	modulo
don t use the modulo floating-point division is fine

2105279
value	field
i believe that eav would required me to have a table defining the fields-for each import data capture specifications and then another table with the import - field - value data and that seems impracticle

2105282
pure-virtual	subclassing
- c is a subclassing of a and b and overrides a s pure-virtual function

2105283
any	set
to be sure that everything is set up .when you call this make sure it s after awakefromnib is called in any object created through ib

2105292
hashtable	set
if it fits in the k c spaces heap is not at capacity yet or it pushes another object away insert it and set a bit in the hashtable to denote that the object is in the heap

2105294
content-length	http-headers
if using rest you don t need to defined your own chunks protocols as the http-headers content-length content-range and transfer-encoding are all used for sending chunks data

2105304
.when	ready
we are ready to start our road planning for 2010 and 2011 and we are trying to figure .when will be the end of the life of our application

2105315
value	field
the database saved the form field value along with any encoding associated with it

2105320
default	reset
also you need to take into account .when this scripting is being run - the server may well also have been configure to perform an application reset by default this is set to every 29 hours in iis if your server is set to something like 24 hours and this coincides with the time your scripting it run you could be seeing that too - although the fact that the scripting s logging its response probably rules that out - unless your xml document is badly formed

2105338
viewdidappear	viewdidload
if you want to force a default color of a navigationbar why don t you set the tint color in viewdidload viewdidappear of your view controllers

2105352
latitude-longitude	location
selected from location where abs latitude - 51.123 0.12 and abs longitude - 0.123 0.34 order by distance latitude-longitude 51.123 0.123

2105352
latitude-longitude	location
...where 51.123 0.123 is the centering latitude-longitude points you re searching relative to and the value of 0.12 and 0.34 are used to narrow down your search to a latitude-longitude square-on-a-sphere of an appropriate size a square of n kilometres by n kilometres at that points on the earth s sphere where the size depends on the average geographical distribution of your location

2105360
jquery-plugins	jquery
standards practice is to put all of your scripting at the bottom of the page but i use asp.net-mvc with a numbers of jquery-plugins and i find that it all works better if i put my jquery scripting in the section of the master page

2105367
contains	elements
basically what happens is the dynlib types types contains an std vector to which it adds an elements in its constructor

2105378
ruby	php
web programmer someone who uses backend server languages like asp php ruby etc to write the logic for a web application

2105389
font-size	height	font-size	width
the viewbox doesn t change the width height or font-size properties themselves but the final rendering appears different

2105389
textblock	viewbox
what you re actually looking for is an initial layout for the viewbox itself that will make its initial size equals to that of the textblock which will effectively set the scaling of the viewbox to 1 1

2105389
margins	scale
you can achieve this in a numbers of ways depending on your application directly in code binding with valueconverters etc but the basic methods would be to measure the initial size of a parent elements and set appropriate margins to scale down the viewbox within the layout area assign to it

2105412
constructor	object
give the object constructor that take the appropriate other object that you want it to refer to then make the field into properties that verify the types you assign to them

2105438
joomla	drupal
joomla drupal etc.

2105439
windows-server	windows
edit apparently there s an equivalent for windows systemd in the windows-server 2003 resource kit called timeit.exe not verified

2105448
textbox	button
i have a clear button that needs to clear the textbox value that is entered on this button click using jquery function

2105466

2105466
ruby	php
web developers persons responsible for the execution of pages designed by web designers including the html css javascript and server-side components such as php asp ruby etc

2105491
jquery	.post
then it should be the matter of using jquery .post or .ajax and set up the callback function right

2105493
debugging	exit
the following simple code exit with source not found .when debugging

2105499
arrays	map
at a later points i wish to retrieve just one row the set of coordinates for one area and send them to a function that accepts an arrays of coordinates and draw the polygons on a map

2105535
any	set
if you extends a templates any value set in the child templates using a set tag will be accessible from the templates it is extendss

2105583
properties-file	jar	versioning	upgrade
at first i tried using a properties-file that lived inside the jar but i was concerned if someone were to upgrade to a later versioning replace the existing jar they would loose all of their settings

2105584
attributes	properties
from the types editor for subprop2 i want to get hold of the attributes applied to properties mc

2105584
attributes	properties
if i look at the attributess applied to myclass though it will only return the attributess applied directly to myclass and not the extra attributes applied to the properties mc

2105605
hide	show
you could hide the object from the interface indefinitely or you could choose to show it - depends on usage needs

2105613
parentheses	operators
you subclassing the matrix .so that you can provide a reindex operation and overrides the parentheses operators .so that it is aware of the new index offset

2105633
repository	entity
a separate repository for the child entity is all right

2105646
put	get
.so you can use startup to get and set your data for views and if you need .some initialization before like getting reference to controllers put it in component s initializer methods

2105680
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
there are places that we lower case table named to work correctly with case-insensitive databases but then it causes problems with case-sensitive databases

2105686
uitextview	uilabel
i set + 30 because over the messages uitextview is a uilabel

2105688
attributes	properties
approach 2 create a custom movie class that receives the xml and exposes all the movie attributes as public properties to which the controls are bound

2105702
put	get
if id can have any limitation i can simply put small words as named attributes for link but is it possible to get link by named

2105714
deep-copy	object
i m also a bit loathe to do a deep-copy of the object or parsing the json using new w.object etc

2105728
subnet	ping
i am trying to create a simple network tool to ping all possible ips on your local subnet and provide a list of such ips in a datagridview

2105737
insertion-sort	quicksort
i know that this is a rather simple idea but it gives a pretty significant improvement in runtime .when i add in the standards quicksort improvements median-of-3 pivot choosing and insertion-sort for small arrays for a start

2105744
defined	declare
alternatively you can use one source file which defined temp and just declare it as extern in the header

2105748
selected	button
selected edit button next to anonymous access and authentication control

2105776
row	col
thus after the flood-fill we can find out what nodes each cell belongs to in the underlying graphing by looking at the value of colour row col

2105787
contains	any
i believe the real question here is why do you have methods in your business-logic-layer that don t seem to contains any real business-logic

2105792
macros	vba
i m sure there is no perfect protection because ultimately the user can turn vba macros off

2105803
triggers	insert
i want my triggers to updates the last column the total price of product without iva to do this totalprice totalprice 1+ iva 100 each time i insert or updates an entry on that table

2105812
wait	hang
if the function wait or hang then my user-interface will freeze and this is not desirable

2105813
iframe	popup
.when i comment out the iframe object declaration in the html the call to donavclick works i popup an alert to test ....yet .when the iframe declaration is present it doesn t even receive the call

2105814
contains	elements
the width of an elements does not necessarily prevent elementss contains within it from overflowing that elements

2105816
rar	zip
i m doing this because i have a portable gui image viewing .app that will need to detection archive file types rar zip more

2105830
selected	button
.when the edit button is click the existing viewmodel launchd an editing view viewmodel pair editing screens allowing the user to edit the currently selected account

2105840
contains	any
the easiest way to deal with it is to ensure that the frame you call setjmp doesn t contains any such variables you care about

2105883
value	field
for this sort of problem i think it would be better to store a high value for the expires field that will naturally always be greater than now

2105886
updating	updates
i d like to find a way to have notes that are in multiple lists or notes that are linked in such a way that updating one will updates the other or be edited simultaneously by some other means

2105890
python	java
if you ve got experience with java use that and if you ve got experience with python use that

2105916
python	java	python	c++
c or c++ is preferred but java or python might be ok too

2105917
wicket	lift
even dave pollak once suggested this combinations if you prefer wicket to lift or have an existing wicket application you want to retrofit scala with

2105919
hide	show
what s wrong with loading the entire questionnaire html and hide all the blocks except the one you want to show

2105926
.when	ready
i m not familiar with qt s main loops but i know that gtk s supports adding event sources that can integrated into a selected or poll -style loops running handler after either a timeout or .when a file-descriptor becomes ready

2105946
hide	show
then use jquery to show hide each of the questionnaire pages

2105954
revision	svn
the date and time is in the special revision properties svn date

2105957
updating	updates
i made a splash-screens and want to have some text change on it as different parts of the program are loaded but the screens isnt updating .when i use refresh or updates

2105961
subclassing	base-class
i think what you ve done is more complicated than using some kind of subclassing the base-class can either be abstract or not

2105973
instance-variables	class-variables
you appear to be assign what should obviously be instance-variables as class-variables which is clearly a very wrong tack to take

2105977
x-ua-compatible	compatibility
in the absence of an x-ua-compatible http-equiv header the compatibility mode is determined by the

2105980
attributes	properties
.so what appears to be happening is that ie-up-to-7 redirects all use of attributess called named to an otherwise-invisible properties internally called submitnamed that for form field changes the data the field will generator as part of a form submission but which doesn t change the real named attributes used for htmlcollection indexing radio-grouping getelementsbytagnamed or in the case of i frame targeting

2105983
widget	button
perhaps you might consider disabling the cancel button as well as any other visible non-alert-view widget .when there is an alert view present and adding a button title to the uialertview instances which performs the same task

2105995
callback	methods
also once this function is part of my existing memcached class will that callback be able to call methods in other classes

2106008
put	get
why don t i have to put to get the reference

2106010
order	add
alternatively as a less sophisticated solution if data input is only through java you could compute these strxfrm value in java java will probably have a different named for this concept .when you add the data to the database and then let postgresql index and order by these precomputed value

2106014
python	java
even python is a better option than java imho

2106016
callback	methods
the arrays must either contains two strings a classnamed and a function named - callback for static functions or an object and a string an object and the methods to call on that object - for member-functions

2106016
decrement	increment
using increment and decrement would solve that problem

2106021
default-value	default
to cause an empty variables to not disappear use default notation to give them a default-value

2106031
linux	osx
i need to know this for osx but it would be useful to know for linux windows and commodore 64 as well

2106045
spring	grails
i have grails project using my existing java domain classes of a spring project and i need to configure typedefinitions

2106045
spring	grails
in the spring project it is possible to configure this properties of the localsessionfactorybean - but how do you do that in a grails project

2106073
32-bit	64bit
my desktop is 32-bit but the server is 64bit etc

2106075
margins	padding
you can use a css-reset tool like to get rid of default margins and padding on all elements

2106090
jsonp	ajax
i m using jsonp to allow cross-domain ajax request

2106091
highlight	selected
in other words i want to highlight the selected link

2106092
value	field
my alternative is to specify the additional parameters directly in the url.action call but that would required a lot more complexity with value coming in and out of jquery ajax through various hidden field which would be a huge mess.

2106102
attributes	properties
if this is possible i m assuming it would be achieved by using an html attributes in the loaded content rather than setting some sort of uiwebview properties

2106104
contains	set	contains	elements
unfortunately the td elementss contains a div elements wrapping the content and that div is set to white-space nowrap by extjs s stylesheet .so overrides the td css does no good

2106107
jsonp	ajax
points the ajax jsonp request at a php file in the same domain and in that php file trought libcurl do the request to the second domain

2106108
json	xml
my service dishes out soap xml and json

2106108
json	xml
soap wasn t a problem this solution works for xml but json is still messed up

2106108
put	get
if i put the arrayquerystring behavior first i get no results

2106108
put	get
if i put it second then i get the same results as the xml endpoint

2106138
google-chrome	firefox
the behavior i m looking for is that similar to tabs in firefox and google-chrome

2106140
google-chrome	firefox
otherwise it works in google-chrome but firefox show a blank screens

2106140
youtube	vimeo
as vimeo unlike youtube doesn t allow url parameters to be passed for determining the video size and percentage widths apparently have quirks my only other suggestion would be to specify a fixed width and height on the video object like on this page see the page source set the visibility of the content div to invisible use a javascript or jquery function to determine the page width change the width height attributes of the object-tag accordingly and set the object to visible again

2106142
facebook	linkedin
facebook and linkedin each solve this by using non-relational key-value stores

2106142
facebook	linkedin
facebook uses cassandra and linkedin uses project voldemort

2106150
recording	playing
after reading all the documentation and playing with some sample code i think i understand the classes pretty well and have implements my own playback and recording application without any problems

2106157
double	int	boolean	int	boolean	double
the primitive-types in c# are boolean bool byte byte sbyte sbyte int16 short uint16 int32 int uint32 uint int64 long uint64 ulong intptr uintptr char char double double and single single

2106158
constructor	object
using constructor is also my personal styles i like knowing that .when an object is created from a class that it will be in a state that is well defined and stable

2106161
anchor	nav
well i have a scrolling plugins that i m using to move divs .when i click nav anchor

2106165
administration	account
well you could always run the application-pool of the web service as with an administration account

2106176
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
subframe refers correctly to the iframe alert subframe returns object htmliframeelement and the function runs in both ie7 and opera 9.23 but not firefox 3.0 google-chrome 3.0 or safari 3.03 beta windows

2106181
callback	methods
i have a callback class with the methods - void fire and it call

2106189
triggers	insert
next make this a before insert updates triggers and replace the updates statement with

2106208
csv	xml
mockrunner can load a csv or xml file and create a mockresultset automatically

2106224
stderr	stdout
a reasonable default to stdout or stderr would make more sense

2106225
implements	extends
will i have to extends bunglows also and implements the same function again

2106230
abstract-class	subclassing
constructor for abstract-class are used by subclassinging invoked from subclassing constructor using super params

2106234
cvs	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	git	perforce	cvs	perforce	git	perforce	bazaar
this extension is distribute with mercurial and understands cvs subversion git darcs monotone bazaar gnu arch perforce and mercurial as source formats and mercurial and subversion as destination formats

2106238
nslocalizedstring	nsstring
my recommendation is to use nsstring constants or nslocalizedstring if you have a localized strings table to title your alert views

2106247
database-table	mysql
edit to clarify something each item is stored in a mysql database-table as seperate rows

2106250
order	join
if both the left side can offer an access path that guarantees an order on the joined column and the right side has a similar possibility then you may end up with the merge join which is the fastest join

2106254
value	field
the datetime field will be indexed and i will be searching on it a lot as well as reading in thousands of datetime value in sequences

2106274
abstract-class	subclassing
you don t initializer abstract-class but the constructor is invoked .when a subclassing is initializer

2106278
nsstring	nsdata
i suggest looking into the nscoding protocols and examples which will allow you to use nskeyedarchiver and nskeyedunarchiver to serialization your object to nsdata for transfer or base64 encode to an nsstring if necessary

2106287
arrays	loops
i generator a list of one dimension numpy arrayss in a loops and later convert this list to a 2d numpy arrays

2106311
onmousedown	mouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmouseup	mouseup
if you want to listen for any mouseup event you ll need to register an onmouseup listener on the page body in your onmousedown callback and then unregister the onmouseup listener from within the onmouseup callback .so it only happens once

2106347
silverlight	wpf
basically this is a variation of the mvvm pattern which is considered the right way to do wpf silverlight code

2106353
contains	any
i have several identical button on a page and they are each made up of a left middle and right background where the middle contains the text and can expand to any size necessary

2106367
click	mouse
.when a user click on the corner of a jframe to resize and drag the mouse around the jframe redraw based on the current positioning of the mouse as the user drag

2106380
python	java
c# and java are everywhere python scripting can compile to some sort of bytecode and i m sure a whole bunch of other programming languages do the same

2106385
python	lua	erlang	lua	erlang	python
at this time my research is turning up erlang stackless python and lua

2106407
value	field
the remote url is hit passing in the value of the field to which itâ s expecting a json true false in return are you in this one

2106431
nsmutablearray	plist
the plist is an nsmutablearray of nsmutablearray of nsstrings

2106442
gridbaglayout	miglayout
i would avoid gridbaglayout as much as possible - use a nested jpanel or miglayout if you can external jar

2106443
postgresql	mysql
both mysql and postgresql use backslash-escapes for this by default

2106443
postgresql	mysql
i would presume the simple backslash-replace methods also goes wrong if you turn off the backslash-escapes which are themselves non-compliant with ansi-sql using no_backslash_escape sql_mode in mysql or standard_conforming_strings conf in postgresql which the postgresql devs have been threatening to do for a couple of versioning now

2106443
postgresql	mysql
this gets used instead of the backslash-escape in mysql and postgresql making them conform to what everyone else does and giving a guaranteed way to include the out-of-band characters

2106443
postgresql	mysql
this works on postgresql mysql and ansi sql-compliant databases modulo the paramstyle of course which changes on different db modules

2106444
private-key	rsa
for rsa i don t know of a standard-library function that generator a public private-key pair

2106446
attributes	properties
if i look at the attributess applied to myclass though it will only return the attributess applied directly to myclass and not the extra attributes applied to the properties mc

2106446
attributes	properties
the attributes added to the mc properties are not added to the attributess applied to the myclass class.

2106446
attributes	properties
attributess are static metadata you won t have an extra attributes on myclass just because a properties of types myclass has this attributes

2106446
attributes	properties
there s no way for myclass to retrieve the attributes of the mc properties unless you retrieve them directly from the mybutton class through reflection

2106446
attributes	properties
but you won t be able to retrieve those attributes using typesdescriptor since it can only give you the attributes defined on the types not on the properties

2106448
csv	xml
over that amount of data i could see xml taking three time as much spaces as say csv

2106452
buffering	streaming
.so far i ve tried changing the file streaming and webrequest streaming sizes buffering etc

2106455
python	lua
however lua lacks a expanded standard-library and this is where python wins big time

2106471
haskell	c++	haskell	ocaml
have a look at bnfc which can generator working code and the makefile from labled bnf for a numbers of target languages like haskell ocaml c++ and java

2106478
value	field
i know how to get the value of a field in a row from a result set

2106478
value	field
but i would like to be able to get the value of a field in a row by specifying the named of the table in front of that field

2106484
build-process	msbuild
i have a build-process which takes my vs 2008 .net 2.0 asp.net project and building it using msbuild

2106484
build-process	msbuild
or should i use my build-process to copy the .xmlserializers.dll assembly into the bin folder after msbuild has finished

2106527
updating	updates
the important thing is to have your timer checked to make sure that something has changed before blindly updating the user-interface - you don t want it doing screens updates every half-second for no reason

2106547
http	ssl
if the request are sent over http without ssl tls then the messages are subject to a range of man-in-the-middle attacks of course

2106553
shell	bash
but since you are using bash shell then use shell internals

2106570
markup	xhtml
its material focuses on moving away from tag-soup presentation-based markup and stateful applications towards xhtml css and rest.

2106584
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
firefox safari and google-chrome all fail to run the function

2106599
cosine	cos
and shouldn t that be arc cos not cosine

2106630
beautifulsoup	lxml
try beautifulsoup or lxml

2106632
listbox	textbox
i changed things to a listbox but tried this same methods with textbox and labels with some tweak they all worked very well

2106665
arraylist	treeset
if you want the collections of nextword s sorted why not use a treeset rather than an arraylist

2106665
duplicates	sorted
or look in the apache commons or google collections classes - i don t know them off the top of my head but i m sure there is a sorted list that allows duplicates in one or both of them

2106668
contains	elements
s before declare a variables with types of structure elements types contains in subjects variables edit other functions works with more arguments ie

2106685
scala	java
i think most statically typed languages are terrible to program website in java i m looking at you here but scala gets rid of 90 of the pain and gives even more safety

2106690
selected	cell	selected	button
.when you selected the cell will not affect the button state

2106692
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am migrating from webforms to asp.net-mvc and former implementation was in .so how should i do it now in terms of best user experience for the user

2106695
click	mouse
i m using rx to simulate the double click but i can t figure out what control to attach the mouse handler to the mouse event on the e.row object in datagrid.rowloading event doesn t seem to work

2106704
checkbox	button
the last one would have say the button or a checkbox or whatever

2106704
postback	ajax
then you again postback via ajax to an action result make the changes and come back

2106704
jquery	.post
some jquery for you to do a .post to an action result

2106705
controllers	routes
i tried it with different combinations of including the default controllers and not including it and also tried a numbers of different routes all without any success

2106725
order	add
the idea is to add an ipackage to the list for the total quantity of ipackage on order

2106737
linked-list	nodes
once the caller is done with the list he will have to call list_delete which will traversal the linked-list and free each nodes

2106739
search-engine	seo
you need to ensure that you have seo d or search-engine optimisation the pages properly with title text and description key words in your meta data

2106795

reserved-words	curly-braces
as long as the text contains no pipe or two curly-braces as they are reserved-words in my tag builder.

2106805
contains	any
if i had to guess i d say that your manager probably doesn t contains any focusable field in it and therefore your hardcode true return-value for isfocusable is lying about the true state of the summaryfield

2106815
display	height
if you read the display height while the virtual-keyboard is showing you ll see that the device actually shrinks the screens size given to your .app while the keyboard is showing

2106834
expression	evaluation
i ran into a curious problem regarding evaluation of expression

2106853
filtering	sorting
table sorting paging and filtering with jquery

2106868
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
this pattern will work fine on both mac os x and iphone os because nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller on mac os x take implicit ownership of top-level object for you and relinquish that in their own -dealloc methods and iphone os doesn t take any implicit ownership of top-level object for you during nib loading

2106884
json	xml
then your iphone .app can simply be a json or xml or whatever parsing and interface

2106906
performselector	dealloc
i just don t understand i thought .when you dealloc it the object everything associated with the object should be removed or canceled even the performselector with delay

2107047
worksheet	excel
pressing ctrl + end in excel takes you to the bottom-right-most cell of the worksheet

2107090
xsd	xml
the primes purpose of the xsd is not .so much to validation the xml but to add design-time discoverability to the xml file .so that one would get intellisense for available elements and attributes

2107097
silverlight	wpf
a new presentation technology has been added to .net since 2.0 called wpf windows presentation foundation it is the newer way to create .net uis and which is also used by silverlight

2107101
xsd	xml
then updates the xsd to permit that xml to validation

2107118
shell	bash
arrayss in the korn shell and bash and others are sparse-matrix .so if you use unset to delete members of the arrays you won t be able to use the size of the arrays as an index to the last member and other limitations

2107135
dictionary	arrays
tolist takes any ienumerable lists arrays dictionary sets etc and turns it into a list

2107157
ironpython	ironruby
you can t really do this easily and if it s really something you need to do consider using a .net language more inline with your needs like ironpython or ironruby

2107159
.war	jar
the problem is that to re-install them on the new server the websphere dialog asks me for the jar ear .war file which i don t have

2107159
.war	jar
in the install section it doesn t even mention ear or .war only jar

2107159
configuration	upgrade	directory	folder
i am currently thinking that perhaps the best thing to do might be to just copy the directory over to another was 3.5 systemd and then upgrade that systemd and hope it converts the folder structure and updates the configuration as part of the upgrade

2107171
xsd	xml
having actual people look at them both xsd and xml instances discovered flaws which would never been found out by automated testing

2107187
versioning	upgrade
does the table have an entry for your upgrade code does the product versioning of the currently install versioning fall within the range of versioninging specified for upgrade do the attributess look ok for instances is the msidbupgradeattributes.sonlydetect attributes not set and .so on

svnadmin	dump
on the main svn server load the dump using svnadmin load

2107353
worksheet	excel
first using option xml source from menu developer in excel 2003 i think it was under menu data you create a map from an xml schema or a sample xml data file into a worksheet

2107353
worksheet	excel
the obvious limitation here is the size of worksheet to hold your data which was often an issue before excel 2007 with only 65 000 line

2107354
google-chrome	safari
for instances the following page rendering different controls depending on the browser - tested using ff3.5 google-chrome and safari

2107357
restart	exit
have a controlling program which does nothing more than run your program with the same parameters it was given in a loops while your program exit with a specific restart code

2107357
restart	exit
.when you want to exit fully have your real python program exit with return code 0 or anything that s not the restart code in an error situation

2107357
restart	exit
if you just want to cycle to another iterator of your program to re-read the configuration for example exit with the restart code recognised by the controlling program

2107362
selected	cell
i have a lot of columns and .when they are off screens i would like to selected a cell and bring that cell into view i can selected a cell that is off screens and .when i horizontal scroll to bring the cell visible the cell is selecteded

contains	set
note that if rotate90 tries to reference angle before angle is called angle will contains zero or whatever default-value you set and is unlikely to be useful

2107372
contains	elements
the jquery-validate plugins required a form elements to function .so you should have your form field no matter how few contains inside a form

but i want to printing 4 digits of numbers preceding with zero if necessary

2107424
managed-code	native-code
much of the implementation of system.string is in native-code c++ and not in managed-code c#

2107441
debugging	trace
trace and debugging classes are very useful

2107450
arrays	map
i have written very simple code which accepts a php 2d arrays index key from a query to just draw markers on a google map javascript

2107457
simplemodal	fancybox
i ve looked at fancybox and simplemodal but as far as i know these are positioning relative to the viewport only

2107457
lightbox	jquery
what jquery plugins allows lightbox that scroll with the page

2107506
hosts-file	hosts
alternatively you can also try adding a bogus entry in your hosts-file windir system32 drivers etc hosts for crl.verisign.net points to localhost

2107513
low-level	hardware
knowing the size of the basic datatypes is sometimes useful .when you have to operate with low-level structures for example if you have to exchange data with c or assembler programs or data from specific hardware interface or .when you have to process lots of data and need an estimation about memory consumption

2107524
abstract-class	subclassing
and if your real or abstract-class basetable had a constructor basetable int columns the fictious subclassing vectortable with a single column wouldn t need to implements it and could do something bad like

2107544
unsigned	short
short int - 2 bytes - signed -32768 to 32767 and unsigned 0 to 65535

2107545
associations	model

triggers	insert
and if triggers are they only way then how can i test that the parent row has been insert within the current transactional

2107556
protected	public	subclassing	superclass
and automatically all public protected methods properties field etc of the superclass become a part of the subclassing which can be overrides if necessary

2107560
contains	any
in any case the configuration file refers to the assembly that contains the p invoke methods the most likely issue is that you created the configuration for the main assembly while the p invoke methods are in a separate libs assembly

2107563
debugging	trace	logging	trace
if you want to inject logging warns debugging trace etc then i would opt for log4net

2107565
joomla	drupal
i don t mind whether it is joomla drupal or wordpress

2107586
constructor	object
the difference with the first example is that .when we apply the super constructor to the this object inside sub it adds the properties assign to this on super directly on the new instances subinstances contains the properties member1 and member2 directly

2107586
contains	set
this technique can be better than simple object augmentation because the inherited properties aren t copy-paste over all the new object instances since the base object is set as the of the extended object in the above example subinstance contains physically only the member3 properties

2107593
pagespeed	yslow
have a look at the w3c qa toolbox for markup links css validation and the popular yslow firefox extension pagespeed another firefox extension and speedtracer sort of like yslow

2107643
processor	affinity
also i agree all others answers such as processor thread affinity

2107669
primitive-types	generics
finally sort of related .when generics were introduced in java they also added autoboxing which allows you to use primitive-types with generics

2107669
primitive	int
autoboxing means that a primitive types is automatically boxed in its class equivalent an int is boxed in an int object .when it is used in a generics context

2107672
revision	svn
a branch is not a tag svn is a revision systemd which tries to propose versioning feature s like branching and tagging through directory with cheap file copy that does not mean a tag is a branch

2107673
cygwin	gnu
i think all of the section 2 and 3 systemd call in the gnu c runtime and libs are implements by the cygwin runtume

2107673
cygwin	gnu
on 4 anything built against gnu libs should work with little or no change between cygwin and linux assuming there are no dependencies missing on cygwin

2107673
shared-libraries	cross-compiling
on 5 cygwin will building a program against its own shared-libraries by default but gcc can cross-compiling to target other platform

2107673
any	set
you could in theory set gcc up to cross-compiling to any target supported by the compiler

2107673
linux	unix
as with linux unix qt on cygwin uses an x11 backend .so you will need to have an x server such as xming running

2107673
linux	unix
it has all of the usual suspects - libs and header-files you would expect to find on a unix linux gcc development-environment and is very stable

2107673
linux	unix
using the qt apis where possible should help with portsability and the unix linux flavoured libs that come with mingw mean that it might give you a good platform for making applications that will ports between win32 and linux with relatively little platform dependent code

2107677
double	int
performance is identical to making specialized classes except in cases where you are using what would have been a raw-data types int float double char bool short

2107677
double	int
in these cases the value-type must be boxed to their corresponding reference-type int float double char bool short which has some overhead

2107683
row	col
i can go the long way round loops over each row get a trect from cellrect col row then query its state for gdselected .

value	field
there d be no way for python to know whether you intended to keep a field s old value or set it to null for example

2109092

python was the language google appengine was originally designed for and it has been supported for longer than java which only got include comparatively recently

2109891
python	java
it seems that there is more documentation and articles about python on appengine than java probably because python has been used in appengine for longer

2110297
attributes	properties
clearly this is not ideal - i need to take account of the jxb class and jxb properties markup in the schema giving me a class that uses the more readable jxb named but that serialization to the single-character elements attributes specified in the schema

2112127
checkbox	button
inorder to have a state on my itemscontrol to know whether i m in a delete mode or not i m thinking maybe to create an attached properties that i can then set in a variety of ways such as binding it to the state of a toggle button or a checkbox for example

2112127
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
at this points the concept makes sense but the fine details are a little unclear to me whether using the itemtemplate is the best move since in some cases an itemtemplate may already exist for a given itemscontrol and i do not want to overwrite it but instead would only want to wrap it if that makes sense

i have an application that ping every possible ip on your local subnet inorder to compile a list of responsive ip addresses

2114274
subtract	add
getting a result-of either -1 or 0 or of either 1 or 0 for that matter from your comparison operations is impossible if you are using only bitwise logical-operators and add subtract where the carry is lost

2114274
subtraction	complement
and a subtraction assuming 2 s complement here can be considered as just such a composition x-y x+ not y +1

2114283
any	set
i thought that i could use axuielement set attributevalue to do this but i am not getting any success

2114291
value	field
to populate this map you will have to use introspection to find list of all field and their value

2114295
arguments	default
i find using an optional arrays of arguments to be useful .when i want to overrides a set of default in the function

2114295
arguments	default
al.so with this methods we know that options will always be an arrays and we know those key have default .so we don t constantly need to checked is_arrays or isset .when referencing the arguments

2114300
administration	account
if it runs with limited user a pop-up will appear same as run as context menu .so that user will input an administration account user pass switching my application rights to this user

2114315
hide	show
i haven t done this myself but you could layer a uiview at the top of the view hierarchy and use sethidden to dynamically show or hide it

2114332
strcmp	strtok
strcmp .when fed the results of strtok in the following code seems to be blatantly lying to me

2114344
bayesian-networks	fuzzy-logic
bayesian-networks base around fuzzy-logic value -- an action may give a gain with a given probability

2114368
arrays	loops	while-loop	loops	while-loop	arrays
all reading and writing is done in a while-loop loops has a max of 12 concurrent connections if that is not hit then it move on and proceeds to add another url to the arrays

2114370
gtk	x11
it s still a hack -- via x11 and gtk

2114385
google-apps	gmail
would it be possible to provide a android-emulator image that has all the google-apps that come with real devices like gmail etc

2114387
implements	extends	implements	final	extends	final
alternatively if the third party class isn t final you could just extends it have that implements serialization and write your own writeobject and readobject methods

2114395
stderr	stdout
it also provides options for generator xml files that include collected stdout and stderr from these tests which is big plus for automated-tests and can also generator html report though you would need to install additional package

2114415
getter	setter
whether that involves reflection or just getter setter and constructor depends on the class

2114422
ubuntu	linux	32-bit	64bit
i ve also reproduced the problem on two different linux machines albeit both running the same versioning of ubuntu one 32-bit the other 64bit

2114437
selected	button
a cmd can be execute .when a button is click a keyboard shortcut is pressed a menu item is selected etc

2114447
perl	ruby
it s my understanding that there s no bridge between ruby and perl to let you call into perl functions directly from ruby

2114447
perl	ruby
it s also my understanding that to call a perl program from ruby you simply put it in backticks

2114447
perl	ruby
is there any way to provide input to perl programs from ruby aside from arguments

2114447
perl	ruby
am i wrong that there is no bridge between ruby and perl

2114454
hide	show
hit the show hide code button and it will show you the code required to turn the original into the filled in versioning

2114464
python	php
another way would be to open a server socket directly in c# and have apache via php python or some other scripting-language connect to you c# application to handle the request

2114471
perl	ruby
perl and ruby both have various glues

2114471
perl	ruby
a ruby daemons could put up a listener and perl could contact it or vice versa

2114471
perl	ruby
but no you can t just embed ruby code into perl or vice versa

2114474
perl	ruby
seemed to import ruby class s into perl s namespace ok but was less successful import standalone functions

2114474
perl	ruby
summary if you need a quick and dirty bridge for perl and ruby inline ruby will probably disappoint you

2114505
innodb	myisam
convert 5 write-intensive tables to use innodb engine and keep the rest on myisam engine

2114509
design-time	designer
if by at design-time you mean change the way your components behave while in the form designer that s something you really shouldn t be trying to do

2114510
arguments	default
if i have to wrap an existing methods let us say wrapee from a new methods say wrapper and the wrapee provides default value for some arguments how do i preserve its semantics without introducing unnecessary dependencies and maintenance

2114515
bar-chart	pie-chart
the way a widget is display may be changed easily say changing a widget from display as a pie-chart to display as a bar-chart

2114515
bar-chart	charts	bar-chart	pie-chart	pie-chart	charts
widget are of various forms including static jpeg images loaded from a remote site ie json based javascript widget or charts of various kinds pie-chart bar-chart etc.

2114515
defined	declare
let s say i abstract the widget class .so only the shared methods are defined concretely and the rest are declare as abstract-methods

2114516
myfaces	mojarra
looking at the generator javascript function you re using sun mojarra as jsf implementation please mention that with more detail in the future you could for instances also have used myfaces

2114518
nsarray	nsdate
nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray

2114537
innodb	myisam
cons memory must be shared between the innodb buffering and myisam key buffering

2114537
innodb	myisam
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

2114546
selected	cell
where i m at is that from my test can find the datagrid and i can find individual cell within the grid using the gridpattern.getitem methods and selected them by setting selectedionitempattern.selected

2114546
selected	cell
this seems to work but it only selected the first individual cell not the entire tablerow which has 10 columns but i can t work out how to deselect an item

2114546
selection	cell
cannot change cell selection .when the selectionunit is fullrow

2114546
click	mouse
sidenote i had previously been using the white ui-automation framework - this doesn t use ui-automation to selected grid rows instead it move the mouse to the row location and click it - which caused random failures of our tests - is this why they re using the mouse to do the selectedion though

2114548
any	set
however it isn t very reliable it s hard to set a good waiting timeout absolutely a nightmare to work with in any webpage involving frame and lacks many features popup downloading

2114550
innodb	myisam
these days i always default to using innodb especially on the write-intensive tables you mention where myisam suffers from full table locking

2114550
innodb	myisam	required	checked
automatic crash recovery â in case mysql shutdown was unclean innodb tables will still - recover to the consistent state- no checked repair like myisam may required

2114553
silverlight	wpf
for #2 if you are using wpf on windows or silverlight in general consider using mvvm pattern mvvm here is explanation with a wpf implementation

2114620
python	ruby
here s how ruby can use a python scripting integration with the scripting s stdin and stdout

2114627
pycrypto	pyd
in the old days .when there was just cython most extensions were written in c as platform independent as possible and compiled into pyd s think pycrypto for example

2114627
jython	pypy
now there is jython ironpython and pypy and the pydâ s do not work with any of them ironclad aside

2114627
jython	pypy
you could also program a pyd for cython a similar c# dll for ironpython and a java class or jar for jython i m not sure about pypy

2114628
display	width
but i am trying to figure out if there is a way for an elements to know that it has just become visible as anytime you need to know the actual width of an elements then you can t really set it up until it is display

2114635
python	php
.so windows versioning of things like python and php come precompile with all options enabled

2114640
windows-xp	windows
this behavior is observed with both the windows-xp and windows classic themes

2114640
any	set
is there any way i can set the size of the client area reliably

2114649
value	field
.so what i was thinking of doing was using prototype inplaceeditor without specifying a postback url or make it a generics postback url that returns true and then as part of the onleaveeditmode for the field have it updates a hidden form field with the new value

2114658
attributes	properties
the three properties in that class are implicit serialization even without the xmlelement attributes

2114677
selected	listbox
.when i go selected different items on the listbox the data in the 2nd and 3rd combo gets removed and therefore setting the data in the initial row to disappear

2114720
dbase	dsn
dbase files is an odbc datasource named dsn i believe its install by default with ms office

2114720
linux	unix
for linux unix the same thing could be done

2114720
linux	unix
how do set up an odbc dsn on mac or linux unix

2114724
display	height
after you add a height value also add a display properties to the nav class like

2114741
google-apps	gmail
you can run some of the google-apps including gmail and google-maps in the android-emulator

2114741
google-apps	gmail
the one with google-apps has apps such as gmail and google-maps

2114774
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
the concept of asp.net-mvc applied in a web environment has been pretty well established by ruby-on-rails and the frameworks that followed and i m assuming zend is similar to something like cakephp in this regard the application-server has a router systemd that maps http call to controllers actions that respond with specific views

2114795
value	field
this will .post the firstname and lastname form field value and you pick them up in your action like in trimack s example

2114819
common-lisp	scheme
to begin not only are there two main dialects of the language common-lisp and scheme but each of the dialects has many individual implementation

2114819
python	java	python	ruby
think java c# python ruby etc where each has a single definitive site you can go to for api docs downloading and such

2114826
toolbar	tabs
you can hide the tabs then implements your action methods for the toolbar items to act as the tabs changing the selected tab view item to whichever one corresponds to the pressed toolbar item

2114846
profiling	debugging
this is generally used for debugging and profiling and not as interprocess communication but its a possibility

2114847
telnet	ssh
recently i got into sockets with twisted which was good for learning telnet ssh and message-passing

2114849
similarity	distance
i m not really sure if i m answering your main question but you could determine the similarity of two messages by calculating the levenshtein distance between them

2114851
common-lisp	elisp	common-lisp	scheme	scheme	elisp
you get scheme common-lisp elisp arc

2114864
value	field
either the entire sql query needs to be in a cmd or you can use a sql expression field if the sub-query returns a scalar value

2114881
any	set
you go out of your way to set the rounding bits in the fp control words and then don t perform any operations that are affected by rounding

2114887
spaces	output
.when i make an error in a django templates i get no error just blank spaces in the output where i was expecting content

2114888
authentication	login
initially i passed the desired authentication classname to my session object then had a login methods that created an instances of the authentication object and validation the credentials

2114900
python	java	python	c++
it has c++ d java c# go javascript python and many other languages which i can t think of

2114929
ubuntu	linux
how do you extraction the contents of a jar file in ubuntu linux

2114941
widget	button
i don t need anything like maximize button - using a small screens with widget taking up the entire view with no borders

2114945
javascript	dom
you must be using javascript to modify the dom in some way

2114961
any	set
.so what i did was set continueonerror to true then searched the xml file that the results were written to for any failed test cases al.so i aggregate the messages from that file

2114986
web-applications	webserver
i d recommend against buildinging your own webserver and handling raw socket call to building web-applications

2114986
web-services	webserver
it makes much more sense to just write your web-services as wsgi applications and use an existing webserver whether it s something like tornado or apache with mod_wsgi

2114999
search-engine	seo
well let s take a step back and look at what seo is supposed to accomplish help a search-engine identify quality relevant content for users based on key phrases terms

2115008
any	set
since gdb doesn t have any symbols information you ll have to set the breakpoints some other way

2115012
put	get
get a job as a junior developer that will put you on a project that is developing a web application

2115015
strncpy	strcpy
firstly strlcpy has never been intended as a secure versioning of strncpy and strncpy has never been intended as a secure versioning of strcpy

2115015
strncpy	strcpy
some programmers today get confused by its named and assume that strncpy is somehow supposed to serve as limited-length cstring copying function a secure sibling of strcpy which in reality is complete nonsense and leads to bad programming practice

2115021
scheme	lisp
i m wondering if it would be beneficial to start with scheme read the-little-schemer and sicp or some other lisp variant

2115021
python	java
my only other programming experience is with java and python which is pretty minimal

2115030
lighttpd	apache
most webserver like apache lighttpd are configure to serve .html files as static files while .php files will have to first go through the php engine to be interpreter and only then delivered to the client

2115036
textbox	button
just create form1 with a textbox and form2 with two textbox and a button to run

2115038
dwarf	coff
gdb understands debugging info in several formats stabs coff pe dwarf som

2115043
python	java
and if you only know java and python then learning a functional-programming language will stretch your mind

2115043
scheme	lisp
scheme is among the simplest of lisp variants and it s well-documented

2115068
qmainwindow	qwidget
if you don t want the things provided by qmainwindow you don t have to use it - you can use any qwidget subclassing

2115070
scheme	lisp
i ve also found scheme ides much more user-friendly than lisp s plt scheme is a good one

2115070
common-lisp	scheme
in addition there are plenty of excellent re.sources on either common-lisp or scheme .so that shouldn t be the deciding points

2115072
strncpy	strcpy
.when people say strcpy is dangerous use strncpy instead or similar statements about strcat etc. but i am going to use strcpy here as my focus they mean that there is no bounds checked in strcpy

2115076
python	perl
if someone can give me the one line iâ d need to turn a words into a png the words can be the filename too in perl or python i can probably figure out the rest of the scripting

2115077
strcpy	memcpy
drepper says we should somehow know the length and use memcpy and avoid string functions altogether the standards committee argues that the secure strcpy should return nonzero on truncation unless otherwise stated by the _truncate flag

2115099
common-lisp	scheme
i suggest that you start with scheme and then move on to common-lisp as scheme is simpler

2115099
scheme	lisp
as you are new to lisp a good starting points will be teach yourself scheme in fixnum days by dorai sitaram

2115099
common-lisp	lisp
lamkins practical common-lisp peter seibel and on lisp paul graham

2115101
common-lisp	scheme
there really only are two common variants scheme and common-lisp

2115111
parentheses	macros
.when you do macros you have to be careful about how you place parentheses

2115113
multiplication	division
division and multiplication have the same precedence and have left-to-right as.sociativity .so this is parsing as

2115113
parentheses	macros
this is why c macros should always be defined with liberal use of parentheses

2115118
multiplication	division
since multiplication and division happen left to right that works out to

2115142
chipmunk	box2d
ok im trying to make an iphone versioning of a game i made here is box2d or chipmunk better and where are some tutorials for each one

2115145
common-lisp	scheme
scheme and common-lisp are standardized

2115153
base-class	inherited
for this you can have a car base-class that implements the year field and all other implementsation can inherited from it

2115157
attributes	properties
but is it also necessary for attributes properties value class and id for elements

2115158
contains	any
it cannot contains any code itself

2115168
comet	chat

the next set of parameters is the url properties and the link attributes themselves

2115236
xsd	xml
i am trying to genarate xml from xsd using perl

2115247
multiplication	division
now division and multiplication both have the same precedence in c but the associativity is left to right for both

2115247
subtraction	division	subtraction	addition	addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	addition
also if u remember the old arithmetic rules of bodmas brackets off division multiplication addition subtraction this is the order of precedence then we do division first and then multiplication

2115253
bison	yacc
i am trying to building a parsing with bison yacc to be able to parsing a flow of token done by another module

2115263
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
there is a ruby-on-rails like migrations plugins for codeigniter here that seems like it might be a good idea

2115281
contains	any
interfaces do not contains any implementation

2115298
.when	ready
that way bb can have intermediate building and bb can only pull .when its ready to take on the changes in aa

2115317
google-chrome	safari
my sticky-footer works great in all the browsers expect safari google-chrome particularly the work.html page itself

2115318
twitter	tweets
for context imagine that we need to building something like twitter but with the comments tweets organized around a live event

2115333
csv	xml
of course there are lots of alternatives -- xml csv etc. but the general idea remains the same store and edit as close to raw-data as possible and automate adding the extra stuff necessary to keep the tools happy

2115334
perl	ruby
you mentioned in one of your comments that you want to run perl code inside ruby

2115334
perl	ruby
this will not work unless you can make the ruby interpreter understand perl syntax

2115339
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
afaik webkit-based safari google-chrome etc. firefox opera and ie 8 support some not all of the html 5 features

2115357
contains	elements
the first elements anarray 0 should contains a value of 1 the second elements should have a value of 0

2115363
nested-class	accessor
i have a static nested-class which i would like to return via a static accessor getter

2115377
protected	public
field are typically private or at the most protected internal or protected internal the term field is typically not used for anything public

2115394
division	modulo
.so have looked at the obvious ways to recover i j from ij using division modulo expensive operation and using if-statement break vectorization branch-prediction problems .in the end i came up with the following using c-style compari.sons

2115397
duplicates	sorted
variables duplicates from c in sorted

2115399
any	set
finally depending on whether the iterationselected properties is doing any other jobs an alternative approach is just to have your setter set the visibility directly

2115400
nested-class	accessor
well if your static nested-class is public as in your example i m wondering why you want to create an accessor while you can directly access the nested-class

2115407
erlang	scala
if you want to go with a highly reliable fault tolerant systemd that is well suited for scalability environment then you should consider scala or erlang

2115410
http-request	httpresponse
httplib now http.client and friend all have conn.getresponse and an httpresponse class but the server-side operations of conn.getrequest and an http-request class seem to be lacking

2115437
erlang	lisp
choosing lfe will give you both erlang and lisp at the same time

2115453
.when	ready
that means the function will return even .when the data isn t ready yet

2115453
.when	ready
but your call assumes the json response is ready .when getplants is called

2115475
decimal	octal
regular expression of nonnegative int constants in c where numbers beginning with 0 are octal constants and other numbers are decimal constants

2115479
selectedindex	selecteditem
also you are setting both selecteditem and selectedindex

2115479
selectedindex	selecteditem
.so to fix the problem after setting items.source set either selecteditem or selectedindex depending on your requirements and your datamodel

2115483
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i ve got this working with xhtml-1.0-strict in firefox 3.x+ opera 9.x+ ie6+ but not in google-chrome 3.0.195.38 or safari 4.0.4

2115499
vxworks	linux
suggestion for tools which work with c code and can run on windows linux and vxworks will be helpful

2115500
any	set
is there any limitation set by yahoo on attributes exchange too

2115506
digits	zero
your regex for int constants will not match base-10 numbers longer than two digits and octal numbers longer than three digits 2 if you don t count the leading zero

2115524
firefox	safari
the word-wrap properties is supported in ie safari and firefox 3.5

2115527
google-chrome	safari
figure out where google-chrome and safari go silent by putting alert before this ajax call

2115529
getter	setter
my take is that no class local variables should be accessed without a setter getter properties and thus they are all private - given that why not named them in a way easier to read and use autocomplete on

2115537
buffering	streaming
it required some sort of streaming buffering data structure but you can quite easily write a takeend methods

2115550
contains	set
if an interface is a collections of slots that contains methods then some of those slots can also contains the get and set methods of a properties the get and set methods of an indexer and the add and remove methods of an event

2115575
linux	unix
i am a professional c++ programmer in windows domain but new in unix linux

2115583
subtract	time

inorder to provide a readonly properties provide a getter use propget attributes and don t provide the setter propput

2115615
double	int
int double or string

2115623
updating	updates
i have a question concerning the performance reliability and best practice methods of using extjsjs s updates methods versus directly updating the innerhtml of the dom of an extjs elements

2115623
compatibility	platform
browser and platform compatibility are important and if the two are fundamentally the same then ditching ext.element.dom.innerhtml altogether for updates would probably be my best solution

2115626
buffering	streaming
i would also note that you re currently reading from the streaming without taking the return-value into account - that s a bad idea as you don t know how much of the buffering actually contains new data

2115644
project-management	project	project-management	scrum
if one does use scrum for the software development portion of a project does one still use pmbok or some other project-management methodology for the other tasks on a project the business marketing training tasks

16-bit	x86
originally a .com file was a literals blob of 8086 code that is 16-bit x86

2115714
command-prompt	cmd
lastly a .bat file is a list of cmd to be execute as if you typed them at your command-prompt

2115719
droppable	draggable
you would think that the draggable s stop -event would be called before the droppable s drop event though.

2115738
postgresql	mysql
db mysql server 5 postgresql server 8

2115742
callback	methods
if you do not need to load scripting dynamically into your updatess html or process a callback after the updates then the two methods you ve outlined are equivalent

2115758
dialog	pop-up
i want to display a dialog pop-up windows with a messages to the user that show are you sure you want to delete this entry

2115758
dialog	pop-up
i have written a click listener for those button but how do i invoke a dialog or pop-up and its functionality

2115786
order	add	value	field
inorder to make it really easy for users and developers to add custom field to things the main parts of magento product customers order etc. are all represented by what s known as entity-attribute-value systemd eav where rather than having a typed column per value you have a row with a key c.f

2115795
sql-server	mysql
.so i migrate my mysql query to sql-server

2115816
put	get
if i use a different jpg i get the same kind of windows and if i put an invalid filename in i get a very tiny windows expected

2115829
contains	any
bu if address variables contains any character your variables will be corrupt

2115835
click	mouse
there is an advanced technique for working around this where you implements the winforms control off-screen then using bitblt or similar copy the image into your windows as an image and forwarding mouse click and keystrokes to the offscreen windows

2115835
panels	grid
a good wpf user-interface always uses panels like grid dockpanel etc to lay out controls in a flexible manner .so they automatically adjust to containers sizes rather than using fixed sizes and positioning

i thought all was lost until i learned about tcpdf and fpdf

2115855
value	field
if not is there a work around that doesn t entail simply writing in the value on top of the form field as opposed to within the field

2115855
value	field
writing the value on top of the field means that the javascript won t validation the value and that i d need to manually change the streaming value every time

2115856

i need to the following dynamically add rows to a table that contains two selected boxes and use ajax to auto-populate the selected options of the 2nd selected box based on the value of the first selected box.

2115856
populate	row
i can easily populate dynamically a selected drop-down using ajax javascript based on the value of the first drop-down in the first row

2115856
populate	row
i can even populate three or more selected boxes in the same row using ajax javascript functions to load each additional selected

2115856

codeigniter	yii
yii unlike codeigniter works on php 5 only which gives it capabilities like auto loading of classes

2115954
lookup	any
if i remember correctly you can not pass any arbitrary arguments to methods that are called from the django templates and the identifier that can be used in the templatess can only consist of a-z a-z 0-9 underscore.js and dots where dots signify lookup dictionary- attribute- method- list-index

2115956
eigenvalue	diagonal
if your matrix really is positive semidefinite then all of the eigenvalue the entries on the diagonal of d should be non-negative

2115956
factors	matrix
this is probably the test that your factors analysis algorithm is doing as well to see if the matrix is positive semidefinite.

2115956
numeric	zero
if you re suffering numeric problems some of the eigenvalue will probably be barely smaller than zero

2116013
any	set
for example i want to set all event handler of any component to nil

2116119
selenium-ide	selenium
it s the nature of the beast unfortunately and a major issue i find with selenium which is my prefered ui-testing tool for browsers is that people start on the selenium-ide which tries to recording everything you do but it can only do .so much making tests unreliable

2117507
low-level	hardware
it is just a mix of both that gives you some additional possibilities - reuse existing c++ code or use faster c++ in more time critical code sections or use c++ code where no objective-c cocoa interface is exposed mainly hardware related low-level stuff like serial ports ioctls opengl ...

2117523
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
updates 2017-06-28 a good article from google-chrome developers discussing the state of math.random prng quality in google-chrome firefox and safari

it s not appropriate to put in a default-value for the birth date - people don t like getting birthday cards on january 1st if that s the default if their birthday is actually july 22nd

2117575
global-asax	web-config
it basically handles all your application errors in the global-asax without the need for an error controllers decorating with the attributes or fiddling with the customerrors nodes in the web-config

2117617
cos	sin
how do you calculate trig functions like cos sin tan in the iphone sdk

2117619
default-value	default
a default-value is useful .when you may presume that if the user or other datasource had provided a value the value would have been the default

cakephp	yii
anyone who disagree just can try a demo project with cakephp and yii and he will see how things are easier with them as crud form validation etc

2117652
python	java	python	c++
python is a dynamic-languages .so you can t simply checked for compiling errors like in static languages c++ java

2117655
cos	sin
functions like cos sin and tan are in the standard-library and can be used by including math.h

2117655
radians	sin
you will then see that sin takes a radians arguments not degrees

2117688
git-rebase	git-merge
if you do commit experimental or debugging changes you might use git-rebase to move them after the commit you get via git-merge to make it easier to get rid of them or to avoid pushing them to a repository accidentally

2117697
getter	setter
.when you have a class with instances-variabless and you also created properties that are simply getter and setter for these instances-variabless should you use the properties inside your own class or should you always use the instances variables

2117697
getter	setter
of course things change .when the properties setter or getter does a little more than just wrapping the instances variables

2117723
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
making subclassing inherited superclass

2117723
subclassing	inherited
in the latter example assuming subclassing is a function you are saying that all new instances of subclassing should inherited ie

2117723
subclassing	superclass
subclassing superclass

2117723
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
.when i wrote above that subclassing inheriteded supertypes using prototypical inheriteded i mean that all new instancess of subclassing inherited from one particular instances of superclass not from the superclass types function itself

2117727
postgresql	firebird

2117808
cryptographic-hash-function	md5
second off md5 is no longer secure as a cryptographic-hash-function indeed it is not even considered a cryptographic-hash-function anymore as the forked one points out

2117808
hash	md5
.so if you ve got a ssl-certificate with a md5 hash on it i can generator a duplicates certificate that says what i want that produces the same hash

2117808
hash	md5
thirdly similar to messages you can al.so generator different files that hash to the same value .so using md5 as a file checksum is broken

2117837
textmate	vim
a good solution which i use is to printing from textmate via vim which gives you a syntax-highlighted and line-numbered result or however you choose to configure it. in addition to vim it required ps2pdf but these are easy to install with macports etc

2117842
png	gif
i don t know the rest of your code but maybe you want someone to allow upload png or gif images

i have found that jquery windows .width return a wrong value in safari and google-chrome

2117895
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox but not in safari google-chrome

2117895
google-chrome	safari
what happens in safari and google-chrome is the handle of the slider .when the page loads is non existent until you click on the slider rail and .when it does appear it cannot be dragged hower you can still scroll by click along the slider rail

2117905
delphi	basic
there were always better technologies around for gui development from gupta s sqlwindows and borland s delphi to microsoft s very own visual basic

2117917
authentication	login
the authentication is performed by a so-called sts security token service and it manages all the possible login mechanism that you want to support

2117917
contains	set
.when a user has been authentication the sts issues a token contains a set of claims and the user s identity

2117918
contains	set
the issue i m running into is that the result set contains one row per ingredient rather than one row per recipe

2117925
32-bit	64bit
we have an application that now has a 64bit target as well as the old 32-bit target

2117930
authentication	login
this involves using the membership-provider to add a comment to users server side recording .when they login and out and then confirming that .when a cookies is used to authentication that the user hasn t logged out

2117955
buffering	streaming
one of the arguments presented to me before was that you might catch an out-of-memory and then switching to lower-memory code like a smaller buffering or a streaming model

2117966
output	cat
you could look at the source for cat to see if it does any detection on the state of the output streaming

2117971
user-controls	tabcontrol
al.so you can have many user-controls on one form .so if you have a form with a tabcontrol that has 5 tabs the content of each tab could be a user-controls .so instead of having hundreds of controls all mixed up in one form each user-controls has its own controls and validation logic and you end up with just six controls in the form the tabcontrol and the 5 user-controls

2117981
lightbox	jquery
i use the below code within for my jquery lightbox without include javascript file ac_runactivecontent.javascript or swfobject-1.5.javascript in the html file

2118040

what if the .net object has a static constructor that open a logfile

2118114
.net	wcf
we have a .net program that uses wcf to listen for communication from another process

2118116
reflection	runtime
however there s nothing stopping you from using reflection to examine the methodss at runtime and throw an exception-handling if the methods in ptsalesperson is not explicit overrides there however i would consider that a hack

2118133
margins	padding
and br tags but do it with css padding margins instead

2118141
implements	abstract
if you aren t going to create a salesperson instances directly then the simplest thing to do would be to make salesperson abstract and that would force any child classes to implements it instead or be abstract themselves

2118149
selected	button
now i want that .when a user click on a button say transferbutton the selected elements from one jlist is added from the first jlist to the second jlist and remove those selected elements from the first jlist

2118161

.so i feel the best rules is leave the value as null if you truly cannot know at the time the data is entered what the value of the field should be

2118209
32-bit	64bit
checked also if you are using a tortoisegit to use the 64bit versioning and not the 32-bit one

2118215
contains	any
is there any chance that windows class contains display methods in your example and windows class that is a parameter to the extension methods are actually two different classes

2118227
oracle	mysql
this java code can be used with schema stored either on oracle 10g or mysql 5.1.x

2118246
subclassing	inherited
not only is there no need for it to be concrete but after some more reading i am convinced that object not being abstract is in conflict with the basic inherited model - we should not be allowing abstract subclassing of a concrete class since subclassing should only add functionality

2118255
malloc	free
as an alternative you can allocate the spaces you need with malloc as long as you will remember to free it .when you don t need it anymore

2118259
spaces	output
a secure hash-function should look like a random oracle an oracle is a black-box which .when given a messages m as input output an answer h m which is chosen at random uniformly in the output spaces all n -bit strings if the hash-function output length is n

2118271
python	ruby
the basic unit of storage is analogous to json python dictionary ruby hash etc

2118271
mongodb	schema
since mongodb is schema-free your code defined your schema

2118287
implements	abstract
assuming all the methods are implements the only effect of marking object abstract is that it cannot be construct new object is a compile error

2118294
cout	cin
you should look at how the and operators work for the streaming classes cout and cin for example

2118358
hide	show
add each of the views in ib and lay them out on top of each other then show hide them

2118390
jquery-plugins	jquery
can someone concisely explain the difference between jquery-plugins and jquery user-interface widget

2118401
constructor	object
secondly you should inject into the constructor or fetch it from a registry object instead of using global

2118406
addition	modulo	addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	modulo	multiplication	addition	division	modulo
most typical operations like addition and multiplication can be reversed while modulo division can not be reversed

2118406
division	modulo
modulo division

2118406
division	modulo
with that being said one-way hash-function have the same mathematical quality as modulo division

2118406
division	modulo
first i found two numberss that .when divided using modulo division gives me a numbers in the range between 1 and 1000 second i erased the original numbers and written on it the divi.sor from the pair of numberss second i chose a bus terminal that has a guard protecting the lockers from miscreants by only letting people try one locker a day with their key third the banker already knows the dividend .so .when he gets the key he can do the math and figure out the remainder and know which locker to open

2118416
authentication	login
login to google mail with the email address you are using to smtp authentication with

2118446
selected	button
go to the the virtual-server properties dialog selected the access tab click the access-control button and make sure that anonymous access is enabled

2118463
exception-handling	try-catch
wrap the code in a try-catch block and see if the exception-handling messages contains useful data

2118483
arrays	loops
.when the user submit a search request the engine splits the search terms into an arrays and loops through

2118483
arrays	loops
building the sql query and the refine suggestions in the same loops feels somehow wrong to me but to separate them would add more overhead because i would have to loops through the same arrays twice and test all the same scenarios twice

2118504
selected	checkbox
would this javascript work using jquery selector by selected only those checkbox checked within a div called feedselector

2118504
selected	checkbox
get selected checkbox ids

2118529
arrays	loops
another way to break this out without falling into the god methods trap would be to have a methods that runs a single loops and returns an arrays of matches and another that runs the search for each elements in the match arrays

2118541
contains	any
i was wondering if c++0x provides any built-in capabilities to checked if a parameter pack of a variadic templates contains a specific types

2118557
while-loop	arrays
if you want to keep the marker line in the arrays elements move the assignment statement with its flag test to the top of the while-loop before the case

2118560
firefox	safari
on the newest browsers firefox 3.5 safari 4 this works fine

2118563
contains	set
this way you can create your own attributes to set the image contains in the button and don t have to rely on multiple styles

2118573
attributes	properties
a process later called an object could now be regarded as consisting of two layer a prefix layer contains references to its predecessor and successor along with a numbers of other properties and a main layer contains the attributes of the object in question

2118578
scala	java	python	java	python	ruby
the attendees are all going to be new to scala and could come from any of a numbers of languages i m presuming they can code in at least one mainstream language - i m including syntax comparisons with java c# python and ruby

2118578
scala	java
part of the appeal of scala is that it s practical - you can use it as a drop-in power java java with less syntactical clutter closures immutability fp traits singleton object nifty xml handling type-inference etc. that still runs on the jvm and on the .net clr supposedly and doesn t required you to change build-tools server infrastructure libs ides and .so on

2118583
vbscript	jscript
your application can expose its properties through active scripting and write rules in vbscript jscript

2118598
lightbox	jquery
since lightbox uses jquery not flash you shouldn t need them

2118607
gdal	ogr
currently ogr from gdal does not perform any recoding of character data during translation between vector formats

2118618
any	set
i know a uk based hosting company that prevent any php errors from being returned at all even if you ve set e_all

2118650
hide	show
the way around this is hide the selected boxes .when you want to show the overlapping div and un-hide them .when the overlapping div goes away

2118675
required	checked
the onchange event is only fired .when you selected an unselecteded option .so no additional checked are required

2118679
buffering	streaming
2 your php scripting can log the request then send out the appropriate mime types for the image and dump the real file to the output buffering this shouldn t be affected by your rewrite rules as long as you load from the filesystems rather than using a url streaming

2118719
postgresql	firebird	debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
firebird it s easier to administrate than postgresql and it does have various linux ports ubuntu fedora debian if you need n secure os selinux

2118729
triggers	insert
based on this link it looks like i can get date insert date modified information for free without the need for triggers etc. using sql-server 2008 by simply enabling change-tracking

2118732
derived-class	base-class
surely it is up to the developer of the derived-class to determine whether or not the base-class implementation is correct for the derived-class or not

2118742
value	field
to checked a field based on the value of another field use the f operators

2118765
double	int
use the types double instead of int to get the value you re probably looking for

2118809
any	set
perhaps if we have a master set of templatess but then each company can have a different subfolder with any replacement templates files.

2118829
sequences	unique
note that tranxdate is not unique and due to some backdating the id field is not necessarily in the same sequences as tranxdate for a given item

2118831
constructor	object
in simple english if you call new constructor where constructor is a function the operators creates a new object with a link to inherited properties from the constructor applies the constructor function to it and returns either the value returned by the constructor or the new object in case the constructor returned something else which is not an object

2118831
constructor	object
at any time before or after creating new instances using a custom constructor you may modify the prototype object on the constructor function

2118831
constructor	object
through the hidden link added to all object created using this constructor see cheap trick in createnew the properties of the prototype object can be accessed on all these instances unless overrides by properties defined on the object directly

2118834
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
of an asp.net-mvc page compared to asp.net webforms

2118835

how do i program the ability to hide and show the dock .when i roll over a certain spaces on my desk top

2118837
any	set
we currently have separate cruisecontrol.net building set to run any time a file is committed to the app1 app2 or libs folder hierarchies

2118852
php-extension	xdebug
xdebug is a very useful php-extension which features a remote debugger with support for some editor though neatbeans isn t listed

2118852
debugging	trace
generally with symfony i find i can get most of what i need from stack trace or by dropping items into the logger and picking them up with either the debugging toolbar or firesymfony

2118854
configuration	logging
enable logging and the web debugging toolbar via apps appname configuration settings.yml

2118887
textbox	button
the button is not necessary the parsing will be done automatically .when the textbox loses focus if you use the default updatesourcetrigger

2118888
user-input	output
why you should never output user-input directly

2118891
value	field
for example the words pizza in the index may have a dollar field value like 5.50 dollars

2118896
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it provides an abstract interface to browsers for testing including interfaces to internet-explorer by default firefox firewatir google-chrome google-chromewatir and safari safariwatir - ie only on windows obviously and safari only on os x i m not sure i don t think they ve made it work with safari for windows

2118912
checkbox	textbox
your xaml has checkbox and textbox definitions something like

2118912
attributes	properties
instead bind those attributes to properties that are managed in your viewmodel

2118916
double	int	click	mouse
that s accomplished by double click click the middle mouse button or using the dive option on the context menu -- all after having placed the mouse cursor on the variables int he source code panels or stack frame panels

2118916
click	mouse
repeat the double click or middle mouse button this time on the data value in the variables windows

2118916
value	field
the data area will now show two columns field and value and 10 rows

2118916
value	field
the field column will be the index in the arrays 0 - 9 and the value column will tell you what data you have in each arrays location

2118922
quicktime	qtkit
i currently have an application that should capture real-time video from a camera via qtkit which is based on quicktime but is cocoa and i would like to further process the frame via core image glsl shader etc.

2118935
compatibility	platform
i think you answered your own question browser and platform compatibility are important and if the two are fundamentally the same then ditching ext.element.dom.innerhtml altogether for updates would probably be my best solution. javascript libs are intended in part to abstract browser difference

2118947
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you can use asp.net-mvc s router with webforms if you are in a 3.5 or later environment

2118947
webforms	asp.net
stuff with webforms in asp.net 4.0

2118951
pointers	stack
pure luck - you could easily trample stack and overwrite the return pointers to the next execution code

2118955
callback	methods
cocoa uses delegation to allow another class to implements callback -type methods

2118959
streamreader	streamwriter
it would also be a good idea to specify the string encoding in the streamwriter and streamreader constructor

2118961
attributes	properties
the second templates makes a copy of the input properties nodes with all its attributes and modifies the text contents

2118962
unique	words
depending on the numbers of unique words this can also take some time

2118970
pixels	line
my only change from the code was to grab a color a bit closer to the one used in apple apps plus i got it a bit closer to apple s look of having a line above the uisearchbar by reducing the frame origin y coordinate by one pixels

2118973
user-input	output
to output user-input raw-input you should always use htmlspecialchars at least

2118986
textbox	button
naturally if you re making a loan simulator with no animation or skinning or whatever it s sensible enough to just use an asp.net-mvc pattern and then slap a static display layer on top with each button pointed to a c and each textbox pointed to a v

2118987
return-value	arguments
the former because arg is passed by reference the latter because the return-value of the function is a copy of not a reference to the initial value of the arguments

2118987
protected	public
q what is the difference between public protected and private in a class definition

.so why not just a button that popup a timepickerdialog

2119109
16-bit	x86	32-bit	x86	32-bit	16-bit
on x86 in real-mode you can have 16-bit and 32-bit mixed

2119109
32-bit	64bit
some compilers allow for mixed memory model where the code is guaranted to be within 32-bit size and data is addressable with 64bit pointers or the converse

2119116
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
all of the parameters are identical .so it doesn t have anything to do with 16-bit vs 32-bit vs 64bit as far as i can tell

2119119
attributes	properties
we test the properties model for the correct attributes using reflection

2119127
libavformat	ffmpeg

2119424
keyboard	mouse
all of the keyboard and mouse messages fit that category

2119429
implements	abstract
i don t understand why most seem to believe that making a fully functional class which implements all of its methods in a use full way abstract would be a good idea

2119429
implements	abstract
both those questions can be answered with no it is a fully working class on its own making it abstract just leads to people implements empty classes

2119429
implements	abstract
useableobject inherited from abstract object and surprise it can be implements it does not add any functionality and its only reason to exist is to allow access to the methods exposed by object

2119436
environment	building
the unit test is one of many in a maven building and this test has to run in linux and windows-xp environment

2119464

2119524
jqplot	flot
flot is an open-source plotting libs based on jquery like jqplot

2119534
buffering	streaming
what i think you could do is use an in memory buffering to store the mp3 mix and then use fsockopen to open a streaming to the server you want to upload it and then manually write the headers necessary to upload the file

2119550
value	field
what s cool about this is that you can then get the data back out of the list as the original object not just the value field as in asp.net

2119553
.net	wcf
client is .net using wcf to connect to a webservice in weblogic 10.3 using the jax-ws annotations to create the web service

2119575
dictionary	arrays
from cocoa s perspective the simplest format is a plist as cocoa can parsing this natively into a dictionary or an arrays

2119575

for instances i would not speak of dependency-injection self typess and the cake pattern or of types classes the pattern that simulates such with implicit

2119612
function-calls	void
i believe that the list_map function-calls the function pointers f which is a pointers to a function that takes a void pointers and return void

2119613
linked-list	nodes
i would guess that the being passed into your sorting function will probably be to a nodes within the linked-list

2119621
selected	listbox
instead of a listbox on each row have the selected event popup a form showing the available color options

2119621
selected	cell
the user selected one or more items in that list and the selected value are passed back to the cell s contents as a comma-separated string

2119621
selected	cell
.when ok is click the selected items come back to the cell as something like red blue white

2119626
.when	ready
what i d additionally recommend is to have a scripting that gets the latest changes from svn and deploys the entire site to the production server .when you re ready

2119633
groovy	java
to work around this you need to know how groovy code gets translation to java

2119655
ruby	php
to send a custom email onclientclick of a link you ll need server side code such as php sendmail or ruby actionmailer

2119694

the old way of doing that in .net simple asmx web-services is deprecated in favor of wcf

2119732
return-value	arguments
given a block of text replace a words in that block with the return-value of a function that takes that words as an arguments

2119740
triggers	insert
i found it plenty easy to just create the insert and lastmodified columns in each table myself set a default-value for each and building an updates triggers for lastmodified

2119752
required	checked
you can either use in your form and your if-statement will checked for that or you could checked for the existence of the required field first_name last_name or both as your form required

2119780
exception-handling	try-catch
however if the functions try-catch catches something it throw out another exception-handling for the try-catch block outside the function to catch

2119792
value	field
you basically do an outer-join between the tables on the common field - those rows that are present in both cases will have value for both t1 and t2

2119819
ftp	ssh
take a look at macfuse macfusion the latter is the application the former is the libs behind it to mount remote directory via ssh ftp as local ones

2119820
multiplication	division	multiplication	modulo	division	modulo
to generator the multiplication table of 1-9 with a single for-loops you could loops 81 time and use the division and modulo to get the two operands

2119823
groovy	java
groovy is awesome for execution quick java tests

2119823
groovy	java
and yes i realize they made some minor changes but for the most part if you execute java code in groovy it will execute just as it does in java

2119854
constructor	object
it s a technique where you wrap a resource in an object whose constructor allocates the resource and whos destructor frees the resource

2119854
rollback	commit

the second arguments to usort accepts a php callback which is a pseudo-type that lets you specify which function instances methods or static methods

2119889
realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free
in all the source files where you use malloc realloc and free

2119889
malloc	free

2119889
malloc	free
are you sure tex isn t changed between malloc and free

2119892
google-chrome	firefox
it s quite a bit faster in google-chrome than firefox i haven t tested it in any other browsers

put	get
using hashmap would destroy any attempt to order by in your sql since you are not guaranteed to get back the order you put the items

2119896
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
.so if they are using ie8 without the latest security patch or if they are using firefox 3.0 instead of 3.5 or 3.6 at this points or using an older versioning of safari google-chrome .when a newer stable versioning has been release

2120000
rad-controls	telerik
i prefer commercial toolsets and am currently quite happy with telerik s rad-controls for asp.net-ajax

2120001
environment	execution
mostly because the java world tries to be vendor independant and platform independant it needs a coherent specifications and execution environment for server side development - and that ended up beeing j2ee

2120001
.net	wcf
iis wcf com to mention a few is really the .net versioning of a j2ee server

2120026
python	java	python	c++
we would then do this for each file-format we wanted to support java c++ python etc

2120069
jython	jacl
don t use jacl since was 7 only uses jython

textbox	button
frank goes to www.myflexsite.de there are 2 textbox and 1 button labels add two numbers

2120103
tablelayoutpanel	panels
for that case i think i m going to look at using different layout panels flowlayoutpanel and tablelayoutpanel to hopefully organize the controls appropriately

2120111
lisp	tcl
tcl is an example of such but there are a numbers of dynamic-languages that have the same issue lisp

2120113

2120173
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit
if i send you 0x2fd483eb there s no way for you to know what it means unless you know what i intend to represent with it - maybe it s a single 32-bit numbers maybe a pair of 16-bit numberss perhaps a string of 4 8bit characters

2120175
dlopen	dlsym
on windows this is done using loadlibrary getprocaddress and on pthreads systemd using dlsym dlopen

2120183

.whenever an uicommand component etc fails to invoke the associated action methods or an uiinput component etc fails to process the submitted value and or updates the model value and you aren t seeing any googlable exception-handling-handling and or warnings in the server log also not .when you configure an ajax exception-handling handler as per exception-handling-handling in jsf ajax request nor .when you set below context parameter in web.xml

2120183
primefaces	tomahawk
for tomahawk checked this answer and for primefaces checked this answer

2120184
type-safety	generics
if all of the different messages are well-known and you have generics or templatess available to you you could have the narrowtointerface methods be a templates methods that took the return-value as a templates parameter .so that you would have better type-safety

2120197
sql-server	firebird
if this isn t implements in firebird maybe you could do it through the technology calling your sql-server and get the resulting timestamp

2120198
32-bit	64bit
if you are on a 64bit systemd but are using a 32-bit jvm then you should downloading the 32-bit versioning of eclipse

2120209
display	height
note that since is an inline elements you can t set it s height unless you set it to display block

2120218
strong-typing	types
luca cardelli s article typesful programming describe strong-typing simply as the absence of unchecked runtime types errors

2120218
type-conversion	int
this staticly typed languages are .so verbose already .so if we decide to add .some explicit int type-conversion like wirth did in oberon-2 take a look at short and long functions their become even more verbose

2120238
data-members	private
concerning friending for the operatorss as non-members if either operators needs access to private protected data-members as is your case then it must be a friend as it is external to the class

2120243
selected	button
during this add the user push one selected button and add the content in one her folder like userfolder thecontent

2120264
web-config	app-config
you will then need to add web-config app-config entries for the caching as you would .when using sharedcaching without nhibernate for example

2120269
digits	zero
look at the month and day arguments it will be always display as two digits with a leading zero if necessary

2120273
output	mode
if this is output onto a page that ie8 rendering in strict mode or if you load into firefox etc then the inside of the div the white area where test is will be 150px wide but the div in total will be 50 + 150 + 50 250px wide account for the border

2120273
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera	quirks-mode	firefox
if you are putting a html fragment onto a page and you do not know ahead of time which mode will be used are there any reliable hacks css javascript or otherwise that will ensure that the div has the same overall dimension in both strict quirks-mode on all major browsers ie6 7 8 firefox opera google-chrome

2120279
cursor	row
basically you are positioning the cursor before the first row and then requesting data

2120279
cursor	row
you need to move the cursor to the first row

2120279
if-statement	loops
it is common to do this in an if-statement or loops

2120283
fseek	ftell
if the line-size if fixed then you could use fseek and ftell to move to the end of the file

2120286
oracle	mysql	put	get
in oracle the constraints get default namedd if not specified however in mysql i don t know i think i heard once that if you don t specify a named for the constraint mysql will not put a default one

2120291
put	get
i couldn t get this to work .so i put alert imagebrowsercontent

2120298
contains	elements
if push_back didn t violate this spaces would it still be an issue i would assume .so if it.end points to one past the last elements in the vector that contains .something

2120319
webserver	upload
i d have to look at your code to see how the user is upload the data to the webserver though

2120339

rollback	commit
transactional commit rollback error-handling

2120367
value	field
in my actual code i have to make several of these tests and it seems tedious and error-prone to types the numbers in by hand either by adding up the prior field in the struct or by copying value out of the fieldoffset attributes

2120396
implements	abstract
an interface in c++ is implements by marking all methodss on a class as abstract also called pure-virtual . that s done by putting an 0 after the methods declaration but before the semicolon

2120396
member-functions	pure-virtual	implements	abstract
in other words an abstract c++ class is one that has at least one pure-virtual-method and an interface is implements in c++ by making all member-functions pure-virtual

2120396
private-members	object
any c++ class with protected or private-members uses encapsulation but a class implementss only pure-virtual methods is describing a contract promising to deliver certain service for which you need to know absolutely nothing about how they are implementss or about other service the same object may implements

2120397
transparency	outline
the usual way to do something like this would be to use white all 1 s and black all 0 s for your outline instead of transparency and opaque

2120407
margins	padding
if you stick to the basic divs with background colors for instances and don t fiddle too much with padding and margins you should be able to get a pretty consistant result

2120432
any	set
if the segmented control is not quite to your taste just put up any set of five button to change sections and make them visually appealing

2120443
joomla	drupal
just read about a benchmarking where joomla drupal wordpress plone3 4 had been tested

they were rendering fine in ie6 ie7 and firefox 3.5 but after upgrading to firefox 3.6 it now looks the same as google-chrome

2120499
google-chrome	firefox
and here s what it looks like in google-chrome and firefox 3.6

2120499
google-chrome	firefox3.6

2120512
any	set
is there any way to set an int to a negative value using a hexadecimal literals in c#

2120533
emacs	vim	versioning	migrate
i ve tried to migrate to emacs several time for clojure development following a variety of blogposts screencast and tutorials but somewhere along the way something always went wrong - key-bindings that didn t work incompatible versioning etc and i found myself scrambling back to vim

2120533
paredit	slime
but i know i want paredit and slime

2120546
difference	count
see for difference between count and count id

2120554
any	set	getter	setter
of course if you want a getter and a setter and you don t need any extra process just pure java-bean-like get set youc an do this

2120583
firefox	gecko
firefox 3.6 include a new versioning of the gecko rendering engine

2120585
textbox	button
then to the right of that textbox is the usual edit and delete button but i also have an up-arrow and a down-arrow

2120587
attributes	properties
the web service you are calling should ignore anything it doesn t understand but if that s not happening you can prevent a given properties of your class from being serialization and therefore from becoming part of the soap messages using that attributes

2120596
firefox	safari
to work in safari and firefox but not ie7 or ie8

2120596
key-value	key
if you only want to disable the enter key make sure that you re also checked for the key-value 13 for enter and only setting event.preventdefault for that key

2120619
if-statement	while-loop
you can solve this in many different ways one would be to use while-loop for image 2 - n another would be to have an if-statement checked if it is the first image

2120631
return-value	return-type
i would then like to know if the function-call worked or not and if it miraculously did what is the return-value provided that the return-type is not void

2120651
contains	set
here s the rub the result set should contains only the recordinging with tstamp between 2010-01-03 and 2010-01-09 and the one recording where the tstamp is null for each order_num in the first set there will always be one with null tstamp for each order_num

2120655
combinations	permutation
i know for a fact the solution to this lies in discrete math specifically permutation without repetition if your answer doesn t use permutation or combinations you are incorrect

2120660
digits	base
instead of using base 10 where each digits goes from 0 to 9 you ll have to use base 2 32 4294967296 where every digits goes from 0 to 4294967295

2120660
multiplication	addition
i would first implements addition as your algorithm for multiplication might use addition as an auxiliary

2120674
multiplying	addition
multiplying as your example by append zero and calling the addition methods per step .so for multiplying with 20 append the 0 and addd that numbers twice

2120674
multiplication	addition
implements multiplication by repeated addition like in your example

2120681
multiplication	bit-shift
this might prove to be fairly simple .when you implements your multiplication with s bit-shift lefts and additions

2120691
arrays	loops
you can then loops through the grouping and store them in a string arrays that can be used in the formsauthenticationticket

2120705
environment	building
the server is responsible to produce the official building artifacts that will be deployed to all environment

2120705
environment	building
at deploy time we would need to run this building step to the appropriate environment

2120714
tokenize	parsing
while i do like regular expression in general for this kind of state-dependent tokenize i believe a simple parsing which in this case is much simpler than that words might make it sound is probably a cleaner solution in particular with regards to maintainability

2120723
double	int
what s much worse is that you re then passing those double to printingf with the d conversion .so it s trying to treat the as int instead of double you d printing a double with f

2120743
execute	prepare
logging prepare statements will not contains the bound data and if more than simple insert are execute you might be forced to implements parts of sql to reproduce what you recorded

2120748
e-commerce	product
if you re doing any e-commerce transactional your international customers or local customers with international browser settings may get incorrect or inaccurate product information descriptions and terms and conditional

2120749
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
i prefer to write general scripting in ruby because i find the language more intuitive than python perl or bash

2120795
selected	button
i want to loops through the form after the user click on a submit button to get the selected option

2120802
any	set
make sure your php memory limits are set high enough to run drupal and any modules you install

2120804
mongodb	couchdb
mongodb and couchdb the two i m most familiar with both use javascript as part of their query interface though in very different ways

2120804
key-value	key
instead you create views which are essentially simpler key-value stores using map reduce functions written in javascript and then query those views from a start key to and end key

2120809
perl	ruby
i used to do a lot of ruby scripting programming because of what ruby offered compared to perl

2120809
python	ruby
i chose ruby over python partly because of the hype and was generally happy with it

2120822
selected	textbox	contains	any	contains	elements
it selected the item any time any contains elements like textbox gets keyboard focus

2120824
lookup	any
it seems having required proxy once in any model will add it to the lookup path

2120846
filtering	sorting
i also required the sorting and filtering apply to the parent elements only based on their own data

2120846
filtering	sorting
next i apply any sorting and filtering to the parent arrays perhaps by using an arrayscollection wrapper and iterate through the parent copying the visible ones and their children if the parent is marked expanded to a display arrays

2120850
executable	jar
there seem to be no way to change the executable while the simulator is running since jar file are loaded in memory

2120859
binaries	install
although it is delivered in install i m sure you can rip the binaries from install versioning or take the sources and compile it yourself

2120873
any	set
obviously zf is flexible enough that you can set your structure up any way you please but if you go outside the standards youre going to have to write a lot of uneeded configuration if not code.

2120898
commandargument	onclientclick
then in the button s onclientclick event use the commandargument to reorder and updates your linqdatasource - then rebind the repeater to display the changes

2120938
windows-mobile	windows-ce
i have a game written in java working on windows-ce now i would like to upgrade to windows-mobile 6.x

2120947
python	ruby
i prefer ruby to python for general scripting and calculations

2120947
python	ruby
i find ruby a bit smoother to use though python does have it s market in the non-web applications

2120947
python	ruby
the other bad thing about ruby is that at the moment it is slower than python

2120947
python	ruby
python is also more generally accepted for commercial at least more than ruby

2120958
hide	show
im trying to show and hide a div elements with the jquery toggle methods

2120963
jcreator	bluej
you d better use an ide - for educational purposes there s bluej and jcreator

2120972
digits	zero
because your data format appears to be zero padded up to a maximum length of 4 hexadecimal digits i assume that all the characters you need to consider are in fact in the bmp

2121008
stderr	stdout
a somewhat a better option is to let nohup run your scripting and redirect the output both stdout and stderr to nohup.out

2121008
put	get
make sure you use proper shell escaping there i just put it between apostrophes but the braces might need other escaping this way you only suppress occurences of this particular messages from stdout but let all other messagess get through

2121043
python	ruby
his essay is over 5 years old .so a lot has changed - i don t think python or ruby can be considered e.soteric

2121050
constructor	private
i know you can initializer private constructor with it .so maybe you can overrides a sealed class.

2121064
sql-server	postgresql
below is the error produced by sql-server postgresql would emit something similar

2121084
value	field
your year field has null for the initial value

2121085
python	java
you didn t mention that your python scripting actually compiles the java source file after applying the edits

2121093
grouping	sorting
this file is used to grab multiple items of manufacturing flows up to 4 different set ups with a total of up to 10 distinct flows of up to 1000 step each with the information being flow specific sub-flow specific for grouping sorting purposes and data such as movements inventory ct ...

2121132
any	set
also this error occurs long before any of my timeout would be reached which are set on the client and server-side the same

2121133
value	field
i have a formview it rendering field from a sql-server database but also much static text specific to the database value i get

2121137
any	set
i ve set all the memory limits to zero and imagick still functions without any problem .when it should report insufficient memory

2121143
custom-server-controls	user-controls
any user-controls or custom-server-controls on the page

2121161
linux	osx
.so if you want .sound support on linux osx etc

2121164
relational-database	schema
the fact that a relational-database has a well-established schema is a consequence of the fact that it has a well-established set of extensional predicates which are what allows us to attach meaning to what is recorded in the database and which are al.so a necessary prerequisites for us to do .so

2121177
value	field
you can declare an object of types adodb.recordset then do recordset.field.append to add field to it then .open it and finally .addnew set field value and updates

2121177
getter	setter
a simple set of public variables in a class is faster than using getter and setter

2121177
defined	declare
a user defined types is even faster than a class but you can run into gotchas trying to pass around udts in classes they have to be declare in a non-class public module and even then they can give problems

2121182
double	int
in fact a double sounds like it d be double the regular size and if you think of int as a good baseline than a double is indeed double the size of an int

2121195
double	int
note that both alice and bob changed the types of bar from int except alice made it char and bob made it double

2121202
tostring	equals
it can be tempting to use case classes because you want free tostring equals hashcode

2121215
dedicated-server	dedicated
i don t know if you plan on using a virtual hosts or dedicated hosts or what but the route i initially took was to go to serveraday.com and get a dedicated-server and then install mono and then install my asp.net apps

2121219
spaces	output
output the original html with no extra spaces

2121221
mta	sta
shell functions work with sta threads only and .net threads are mta by default

2121229
sql-server	postgresql
sql-server and postgresql are just guarding against laziness by forcing you to make a decision to disambiguate each column

2121231
environment	building
building a website in a hosted environment is a good exercise

2121245
silverlight	wpf
a ports of silverlight s dataform control to wpf on codeplex

2121263
.when	ready
another approach is to pull messagess through the systemd instead of pushing them - in this case the receiver asks the sender for a messages .when it s ready

2121269
32-bit	64bit
it will .sometimes hang due to lack of re.sources and al.so vs 2008 was made for 32-bit os .so if ur running it on 64bit os with office-2010 64bit it can .sometimes cause problem of re.souce management

2121290
response	timeout
i would like to be able to points them to a specific webpage that will run an x-minute test where multiple http request would be made via javascript every y seconds which would then report back any problems such as longer-than-usual response 5 seconds and timeout

2121292
controllers	routes
i m not really sure if this is best practice or not but usually what i like to do is to leave the routes open to respond_to by append . format to the end but only use it in the controllers .when it s necessary

2121292
json	xml
that way you aren t cluttering up your action_with_one_response methods with an unnecessary block but you also have set yourself up quite nicely if you want to someday return your object in xml json etc

2121299
alt	src
src alt test image

2121301
32-bit	64bit
got the answer the mgtwitterengine wants a unsigned long but the iphone is 32-bit and .so the the 64bit numbers gets smaller and mgtwitterengine gets the wrong numbers

2121311
value	field
it would be complicated to do it with a single control but with two controls a dropdownlistfor for choosing the value to add and a textbox display the memo field you could have the combo box s afterupdate event append a comma and the chosen value to the existing data

2121311
populate	row

2121475
switching	screens
remove current windows address bar and tabs switching browser to full screens view equivalent to pressing f11

2121945
python	php
putting aside my previous experience with php libcurl what is the recommended libs in python

2121958
deep-copy	object
if you have to make originally-unsafe methods thread-safe you ll have to bite the bullet and use locks or a queue and an auxiliary thread to serialization the operations -- i guess that if you further need to silently ignore the methods attempts to alter object you ll moreover have to deep-copy everything why stop at self -- what if those methods were altering globals for example

2121961

2122568
binary-tree	nodes
and by my understanding this makes it impossible to know exactly .when one level ends and another begins unless you assign each nodes it s level .when the binary-tree is created and then just checked the level .when you are doing the breadth-first traversal

2122568
binary-tree	nodes
something like this the code is in php but this is not a php related question it is a general algorithm related question - this is part of a function that adds a nodes to a binary-tree storing the level in the nodes .when each nodes is added

log4net	nlog
i don t think it makes sense to do this through common.logging because common.logging is intended to provide a facade over the actual logging implementation .so that you can switching between log4net nlog entlib etc

2123308
python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django
imo ruby and ruby-on-rails have a large advantage over python and django and most other platform in tooling and automation generally

2123318
selected	button
according to the apple hig .doc the disclosure should present another more detailed listview and the the blue + disclosure button should reveal extra details about the selected tablerow

2123334

which contains alpha expression a words any words one single spaces opening and closing parentheses and inside of the an intiger

2123347
zend-framework	kohana
.when i call zend_feed instead of loading classes zend feed.php kohana loads zend from my servers shared zend-framework libs zend zend server .so i get a cannot redeclare class zend_uri_http error

2123355
profiling	trace
run an sql profiling trace to see what the duration reads is for each versioning

2123367
enterprise	licensing
however due to the licensing google won t allow you to use it in anything other than an internet environment unless you use there enterprise license

2123371
arrays	loops
just run compact in a loops on the sub arrays

2123392
linux	unix
tkcvs is old but if you are on unix linux it mighty even be install

2123396
any	set
you should set to false any options regarding auto sizing of rows and columns and use a caching for your row data of size about 2 time the actual numbers of rows display in the grid see msdn

2123414
boolean	int	decrement	increment
increment boolean decrement boolean changed_by int user_id post_id int

2123414
decrement	increment
you can also identify if the points were increment or decrement

2123427
dictionary	arrays
maybe dictionary or associated arrays can help you

2123428
scala	java
i can only assume that the designers of scala added the + operators as a convenience for java developers who are used to append using add and then had second thoughts about it

2123439
put	get
the funny thing is if i put a file in the same directory with a different extension .txt for example and try to load that it doesn t get treated as an action

2123458
32-bit	64bit
if you want to have 100 working solution for 32-bit intval both on 32 and 64bit platform then i suggest you to use the following solution

2123478
spring-roo	hibernate
th question is related to general database-design i suppose but i would like to mention that i am using hibernate with spring-roo .so perhaps there is .some thing already out there addressing it

2123479
associations	model
the way it works is via a join model line item that has a polymorphism associations called recordable

2123483
business-process	bpm
this product works like a lot of other bpm solutions in that you design multiple process maps which defined the flow of a particular business-process you re trying to model and each process map consists of multiple task nodes connect together which perform particular functions calling web-services etc

2123490
coff	elf
some compilers spit out coff others spit out elf etc

2123506
target-platform	platform
this compiler specifically targets a platform and generator object-files and programs that are compatible with the target-platform

2123506
powerpc	arm
.so you can use an x86 linux systemd for example to make programs for a powerpc or arm based systemd using the appropriate cross-compiling

2123523
linux	osx
take the apple s mac osx before the intel chip were put in they were running on the powerpc platform even if it has the gnu c compiler the binary is specifically for the powerpc platform if you were to take that binary and copy it onto a linux platform it will not run as a result-of the difference in the instructions of the platform s microprocessor powerpc

2123527
hide	show
on the show function i am trying to hide the txtemail box but it doesnt seem to be able to find it

2123528
fflush	stdout
stdout is line-buffered .when connect to a terminal but i remember reading somewhere that reading at least from stdin will automatically fflush stdout

2123528
fflush	stdout
would need an extra fflush stdout

2123528
fflush	stdout
.so is stdout guaranteed to be fflush here

2123532
selected	cell	selection	cell
i m trying to pass the user on to the interface based on their cell selection in the uitableview ie if the user selected cell 1 they are taken to viewmodel 2 contains uiwebview

2123532
selected	cell
to display the named of the cell selected

2123543
put	get
this can happen .when you attempt to put get or delete too many entities or an entity with too many properties or if the datastore is overloaded or having trouble.

2123545
fflush	stdout
you need to fflush stdout

2123547
fflush	stdout
to answer your question you do need the extra fflush stdout

2123547
fflush	stdout
reading from stdin doesn t fflush stdout

2123560
hide	show
i believe that the ajax call hasn t completed by the time the show methods is invoked and thus the elements doesn t exist at the time that you are going to hide it

2123572
fflush	stdout
you need to explicit fflush stdout inorder for the buffering data in the video memory unix terminal s memory to be pushed out on to a view device such as a terminal

2123572
fflush	stdout
edit thanks jonathan to answer the question reading from stdin does not fflush stdout

2123572
void	main
int main void

2123572
spaces	output	buffering	streaming
set up output streaming for line buffering using spaces that

2123574
sql-server	oracle
if you have a program on your sql-server that does several things in a row to different tables and they re encapsulated in different transactional i can envision scenarios where data will get insert into oracle but it won t be in sql-server

2123575
push	pull
application instances may pull data from sensor or sensor can push data to an application instances but controllers is the one who will control which application instances is linked to which set of sensors

2123581
sftp	scp
i need a methods of paramiko based file transfer with a lightweight ssh2 server dropbear which has no support for scp or sftp

2123619
order	add
just a thought but you could perhaps create an order test and add the same tests twice add all tests once then all tests again in the same order

2123643
python	java
i don t know much about j2me but you might be able to use python pipe facility to invoke a methods in the jar java -jar myjar.jar org.package.main param1

2123646
contains	any	contains	elements
it doesn t contains any data or even logic relating the elements to one another

2123649
mstest	nunit
normally with nunit i d use a generics or parameterized fixtures but i m not sure whether mstest has similar capabilities

2123660
spring	grails
grails uses spring underneath .so you can inject as many service into your controllers as you wish if you know spring

2123675
base-class	inherited
i feel like the actual .solution should be a mix between an inherited hierarchy i know at least that all agents are decidable .so that should go in a base-class couple with pluggable behavior

2123705
integrated	manual
the integrated file management needs a bit of manual configuration more information about this is in the include readme.txt file

2123710
account	api
for more than that you ll have to request an increased access level for the account you use to access the api

2123725
directory	folder
how would i take a file in the application s directory the same folder the .app is in and get it s absolute-path

2123730
attributes	properties
sadly the j-language exposes the nature of the attributes access mechanism to the client code .so that to introduce a properties at .some points in the future is an intrusive refactoring task that will required a rebuild of all clients that make use of that class and its a attributes

2123731
numeric	zero
replace the empty string in this query with zero to checked against numeric field

2123738
value	field
is there a way to write an sql query that finds all rows where the field value is a substring of a given string

2123752
windows	ms-dos
the only time int 13h would be used would be during boot stage before windows loads or if you are using ms-dos as the systemd no windows just boot into ms-dos then the int 13h would be valid to use

2123764
google-docs	spreadsheet
i found javascript solution for removing gridlines on google-docs spreadsheet using downloading as html and then past javascript in web address bar works great

2123784
createfile	drive
with the right permissions administration has them you can use win32 createfile and related functions to access physical drive and logical partition directly

2123807
32-bit	16-bit
as others have mentioned it won t work unless you are using 16-bit - ms-dos but if you are on a 32-bit systemd and have debug.exe you could try it for yourself

2123825
contains	any
this form instructs the preprocessor to look for include files in the same directory of the file that contains the #include statement and then in the directory of any files that include #include that file

2123825
g++	gcc
also see this duplicates similar question for g++ gcc

2123837
subclassing	inherited
versioning is a class methods of n.sobject .so all subclassing of n.sobject inherited it

2123851
graphviz	doxygen
you can always use a external tool like doxygen that can dump graphviz diagram

2123863
where-clause	sql
this is because the where-clause is dynamically created on an otherwise static sql

2123870
.war	jar
your last assert is wrong your exported resources can and should be copy-paste to b .war web-inf .lib as a jar file

2123879
any	set
any idea on how i can include a set of this size inside a published properties

2123888
gethashcode	equals
i have a class a that implements iequatable using its field say a.b and a.c for implements overrides equals and overrides gethashcode and everything works fine 99 of the time

2123888
gethashcode	equals
they can all be stored together in a dictionary dictionary thus it s convenient .when they all carry their own default equals gethashcode

2123888
gethashcode	equals
in that case i don t want to use the default equals gethashcode overrides provided by a

2123888
gethashcode	equals
thus i was thinking of implements a referenceequalitycomparer that s meant to force the use of object s equals gethashcode

2123888
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
one way of course would be for a to not implements iequatable and always supply an iequalitycomparer to any dictionary that i create but i m hoping for a different answer

2123919
entity-framework	data-access
it s not part of asp.net-mvc per se but i d recommend using linq-to-sql or linq-to-entities entity-framework over the data-access application block if you re interested in a pure ms object relational mapping

2123930
entity-framework	nhibernate
try nhibernate entity-framework or linq instead

2123931
dreamhost	bluehost
i use dreamhost bluehost now and i have used many others and i know that most will not let you

2123938
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
edit i want a fix on ie .so it does the same thing as firefox google-chrome safari etc

2123971
zlib	libz
libz zlib compression headers

2123975
aes	rsa
also considering ill be doing some basic aes and rsa based encryption - is there an advantage in using bouncycastle instead of the tools provided off the shelf in the jce

2123988
assign	add
this approach should work because you defined virtual attributes in company model and by assign to them string in format 1 2 6 you add remove those ids from your collections of associated people

2124010
perl	awk
i can use any standards unix regular expression like perl sed awk etc

2124011
python	java
i don t know of any implementation of python or for that matter other languages with constants strings such as java that takes the trouble of identifying possible duplicates to reuse a single object via multiple references .when reading data from a file -- it just doesn t seem to be a promising tradeoff and here you d be paying runtime not compile-time .so the tradeoff is even less attractive

2124018
webforms	asp.net
that d be simpler if you re already familiar with asp.net webforms

2124018
asp.net-mvc	webforms
both asp.net-mvc and webforms would allow you to make one page that dyamically show a product and still have a nice url- plus you might save yourself development time down the road

2124021
selected	cell
however i was wondering if anyone found out how to manipulate a uitableview .so that a cell any or if that is not possible it could only be the selected one can have a different height

2124023
subdirectories	archive
the problem here is that the .lib tag is a custom fileset that targets it s files into the .war archive s .lib subdirectories

2124023
.war	jar
the advantage of this approach is that you use the ivy conf attributes of each project dependency to ultimately decide if the jar gets include within the .war file or not

2124048
selected	cell
the thing is i need to retrive the date from the datagrid .when the user selected the particular date cell in datagrid and want to display it back on the datetimepicker control .so that the user can edit it

2124056
selected	cell
what to do .when a cell was selected

2124084
xsd	xml
question numbers 1 why does the schema of xsd contains definition that xml validation cannot handle

2124091
command-line	cmd
most php functions for executeution external cmd execute take an 1 string arguments for the command-line to executeute

2124096
32-bit	x86
if you compile as x86 then the x64 systemd will run you .app in wow64 and you ll be able to load 32-bit dlls

2124096
32-bit	x86
.so i think you should choose any cpu if your dependencies can run in either environment but choose x86 if you have 32-bit dependencies

2124104
aes	rsa
if jce supports the algorithms you want to use and it does support aes and rsa switching to bouncycastle is extra hassle with no benefit

2124132
height	frame
you should put nslog frame height f frame.size.height

2124138
textbox	button
i have a requirement to have a small form with some textbox on them and a button at the end which with a specified aspect-ratio in hidden textbox enable the user to types in a value into the width box for example and .when the user changes the value the height textbox will change also..also .when you types in the height box the width will change

2124143
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the text links are correctly vertical aligned in safari and google-chrome and .so are the image links but in firefox 3.5 the text links are slightly out of positioning a bit towards the bottom

2124149
.when	ready
your ready would actually try to building up a line and only .when it has done .so successfully would it return true

2124152
arguments	default
it has a default zero arguments constructor with any access modifiers will work

2124180
32-bit	64bit
pps beware 64bit process calling 32-bit dlls they will always fail

2124230
constructor	private
they usually have private constructor methods but in the example i linked they used protected to prevent initializer

2124231
google-chrome	firefox
this was tested in firefox google-chrome and ie 7 but it should work all modern browsers

2124243
constructor	object
by the time the constructor is invoked it s too late for the code in the constructor to control whether or not an object is initializer

2124268
webserver	upload
.when you want to publishing a new versioning of your application all you need to do is increment the versioning numbers of your application updates the versioning info file with the new versioning numbers and upload an updatess containers file to your webserver

2124279
versioning	migrate
i got first versioning running in about three weeks and just a small feature set was migrate

2124294
updating	updates
i am having a problem using php s pdo object to prepare an updates statement and updating the recording

2124302
constructor	object
without using a factory the creation of complex object would required long constructor with too many parameters

2124315
click	mouse
i do this through a mouse click and some ajax

2124324
tostring	toarray
would the toarray and the tostring methods be the best options

2124371
python	ruby
however this work has actually been done for you in some underlaying code for appscript appscript-objc appscript is an libs for python and ruby and objective-c that lets you communication with applescriptable applications without actually having to use applescript

2124380
export	csv
examples would be csv excel pdf export

2124401
ruby	php	ruby-on-rails	django
.so it will be better if the cms is written in php but other languages and frameworks like ruby on ruby-on-rails or django will be fine too if the cms is simple

2124415
python	java
this is because python has proper multiple-inheritance and also duck-typing which means that the places where you must have interfaces in java you don t have to have them in python

2124415
subclassing	abc
another usage is if you somehow want to specify that an object implements a specific interface and you can use abc s for that too by subclassing from them

2124420
contains	elements
however what each iterator contains differs depending on the containers must just have the elements but maps have pairs

2124429
authentication	access-token
this is a uri that you send a request to inorder to exchange an authentication request token for an access-token which can then be used to obtain access to a protected resource

2124459
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net webforms or asp.net-mvc

2124459
spring.net	ninject
ninject or more advanced frameworks enterprise libs spring.net

2124464
xhtml	tidy
however i think that using some converter to xhtml like tidy and maybe somewhat simpler xquery like only the last part from yours

2124468
hash	md5
i am .so convinced that i saw an overrides of a hash-function that allowed me to calculate a md5 or other hash at the same time as writing ie calculating the hash of one buffering then feeding that resulting hash into the next iterator

2124473
contains	any
rewrite any part of the page that contains absolute urls and rewrite them to use your scripting

2124476
subclassing	base-class
your base-class break encapsulation by exposing implementation details to subclassing in the form of protected members

2124476
subclassing	inherited
the more tragic flaw however is the new subclassing brings with it all the baggage and opinion of the inherited chaining

2124483
visual-c++	dev-c++
i m using dev-c++ for programming but i al.so have visual-c++ express install .so both are good

2124486
python	c++
here is combined tutorial presenting how to read and write images using c++ c and python apis

2124488
dictionary	arrays
the value associated with the key should be an arrays or dictionary which can then contains multiple value

2124527
contains	any
how can i checked if a contains any of the items expressed in an arrays

2124537
ip-address	proxy
you can t use somebody else s ip-address as the originating address for call except if you re misusing them as a proxy or spoofing addresses of course

2124552
player	movie
i have seen many examples of people who just have issues with the movie player but it s starting to annoy me that it sometime seem to work fine and other time it just doesn t again appearing like a memory issue

2124553
contains	any
i need to defined a java regex that will match any string that does not contains any of these

2124563
directory	folder
the .subversion directory in you home folder is only intended for settings

2124633
decrement	increment
i have googled for atomicity increment and decrement operators on mac os x and found osatomicity.h but it seems you can only use this in kernel spaces

2124641
32-bit	64bit
even if the machine s native words size is 64bit that only means that 64bit cpu operations won t be any slower than 32-bit operations

2124665
windows-live	hotmail
hotmail server report the error 550 sc-001 mail rejected by windows-live hotmail for policy reasons.

2124673
32-bit	64bit
checkout running 32-bit applications on 64bit windows

2124673
32-bit	x86
if iis is running the component in x86 32-bit worker process try registering it with c windows syswow64 regsvr32.exe

2124683
pygtk	gtk
i d use the win32 apis directly to display the notification if i could but i can t seem to find any way to get the tray icons id from either gtk or pygtk

2124690
arrays	loops
loops over the post_csv_order arrays and returns the arrays itself which is not what you want

2124690
arrays	map
map returns a new arrays contains the result-of each invocation of the block

2124775
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
there are two browsers or http clients in this scenario the one that is giving you the result you want ex. firefox ie google-chrome or safari and the one that is not giving you the result you want ex. lwp wget or libcurl

2124867
assign	add
the easiest approach would be to add dependencyproperty to your control to which you would assign the map control i ll use the typename mymap in this example -

2124877
hashmap	arrays
i also tend to agree with akappa -- what you re doing sounds slightly unusual and it might be better to rephrase your question as what data structure do i need inorder to do x rather than assuming that an arrays of hashmap is the appropriate one from the outset

2124895
account	in-app
i created a test account to checked in-app purchases

2124895
account	in-app
now i cannot test the in-app purchases anymore since the app-store log me in automatically with a ghost account that already doesn t exists

2124902
selenium-ide	selenium
it is based on selenium and allows you to capture scripting in the selenium-ide plugins for firefox and then upload onto our servers for running

2124923
chown	chmod
should it try to chown chmod the file

2124958
emacs	vim
simply edit and save the file in vim or emacs switching back to your editor and hit compile

2124962
implements	extends
the other problem with using abstract-class is that you can then no longer implements mixins that is you can implements multiple interfaces however you can only extends one abstract-class

2124967
udp	tcp
you have unix functions for tcp udp communication and you have windows functions for tcp udb communication

2124970
contains	any
it does not however allocate any spaces in memory to actually hold those characters nor does it guarantee that named even contains a valid address

2124970
contains	set
just like after declaring the value of an int you might later set its value after declaring a pointers to-char you might later set its value to be a valid memory-address that contains a character -- or sequences of characters -- that you are interested in

2124973
implements	final
unlike interfaces abstract-class can contains field that are not static and final and they can contains implements methods

2124973
abstract-class	subclassing
such abstract-class are similar to interfaces except that they provide a partials implementation leaving it to subclassing to complete the implementation

2124973
abstract-class	subclassing
by comparison abstract-class are most commonly subclassing to shared pieces of implementation

2124973
abstract-class	subclassing
a single abstract-class is subclassing by similar classes that have a lot in common the implements parts of the abstract-class but also have some difference the abstract-methods

2124978
abstract-class	subclassing
i would advocate the use of abstract-class more in situations where you wish to provide a partials implementation of a class possibly delegation some behavior to concrete subclassing implementation

2124979
jquery	.post
i m wanting to selected some dom elements using jquery modify some attributes and then write the dom elements back out as xhtml snippets for .post process

2125003
contains	any	enumerator	any
2 since the playing of any sound effect call the same stuff with the only difference being the file it opens i could create a single soundeffect class with its constructor being an enumerator that contains the named of the sound effects

2125022
chown	chmod
i would go with eilon s answer for the most part but would add the following caveat - i would not try to chown chmod a file unless you really need to if the purpose of your program is managing file-permissions or acting as an install of some sort

2125022
chown	chmod
this is because a your attempted chmod chown may not work and b your application should respect the user privileges with which it is run - if these are not sufficient you should inform the user via whatever mechanism you do this

2125029
asp.net-mvc	webforms
but i suggest you first learn asp.net-mvc framework and building at least one semi complex .app with it and then start experimenting with mixing asp.net-mvc with webforms controls

2125029
webforms	asp.net
in other words presumably knowing asp.net webforms would you suggest someone to heavy use dynamicly created user-controls in their webpage if they re just about to learn the technology of asp.net webforms

2125048
value	field
since only the getter is public how do they acheive to set the value of the component gameobject field

2125069
buffering	streaming
try to limit them whenever you can for instances load all data to a buffering or arrays with bufferinging streaming in one step

2125094
xsd	xml
if it is intended for interop to other systemd then validation via xsd is a reasonable idea not least because you can use xsd.exe to write your classes for you from the xsd you can also generator xsd from xml or dll but it isn t as accurate

2125097
xsd	xml
if you aren t editing the xml with a text-editor you can guarantee that it will come back in the right way in which case xsd is definitely not needed

2125103
assign	add
.when you add a component to the gameobject there is most likely an internal setter that assign the parent gameobject of the component

2125115
z-index	overlay
checked the z-index properties of your li tags or the underlying ul and either set it below 100 or set the z-index of your modal windows and overlay .so it s higher than that of the li s

2125116
triggers	insert
a triggers on the insert statement can add rows to other tables but there s no way to supply data to the triggers other than those columns in the table that spawned it

2125139
any	set	value	field
is there any way to programmatically set the value of this field short of bundling a custom webkit in my .app that has been altered to allow this

2125187
.when	ready
for example .when i call read the first time if it reads an elements start tag is it now at the end of the elements tag or ready to begin reading the elements s attributes

2125219
double	int
2 how can i convert t to a double given that it s an unsigned int

2125236
common-lisp	scheme
i was in your positioning and split my attention between scheme and common-lisp

2125236
common-lisp	lisp
looking back now i think that for the purposes of learning clojure as opposed to personal development i would ve been better off focusing on common-lisp with practical common-lisp and postgresql s on lisp

2125259
exponentiation	exponent
exponentiation can be the same as shifting moving the points if the numbers base is identical to the exponent base

2125259
exponentiation	exponent
you see that exponentiation of 10 with the exponent n simply shifts the numbers

2125259
base	zero
now computers mostly use the internal base 2 bits .so calculating 2 19937 is setting a bit in positioning 19937 count bit positioninging from zero

2125261
contains	set
you will have to set up an environment contains at least of the sap netweaver developer studio a customized eclipse 3.3 and the sap netweaver application-server

2125282
implements	abstract
conversely if your component consumes or accepts instances of abstract types that its callers must implements abstract-class are usually a better choice

2125329
put	get
we are going to put the stdgen instances in a state monad then provide some sugar over the state monad s get and set methods to give us random numbers

2125329
put	get
we use get to get the stdgen and we use put to install a new state

2125330
put	get
if i put the has_alpha at location2 i get

2125333
actionscript	mxml
assuming these mxml object have been compiled into my application is there any way to initializer these object using actionscript sort of like this

2125334
short-circuiting	equivalent
is equivalent to using a short-circuiting test for null and zero length

2125344
authentication	login
for example using the popular restful-authentication plugins to handle user login and authentication it creates two controllers for authentication and authentication users and sessions

2125345
javascript	dom
the restrictions is probably because the dom bridge hooks directly into the same code as the javascript runtime .so you need to bypass any javascript dom bridge

2125356
google-chrome	firefox
this works great on firefox and google-chrome but ie gives me a javascript error

2125364
user-interface	look-and-feel
of look-and-feel of graphical user-interface - various windows have completely different look

2125364
licensing	gpl
of licensing - imagine visual-studio product is licensed on bsd but .net on gpl -

2125373

reply .when ready

2125379
playstation	xbox
its getting easier with dnla devices such as the xbox 360 and the playstation 3 to connect to other audio hardware that also support the standards

2125386
hash	md5
i should add however that md5 is a hash algorithm which is a one-way process which generator a unique string on each input collision aside

2125401
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie8 and google-chrome and firefox but ie8

2125409
value	field
i wanted to write a regular expression using the asp.net regexp validation that would ensure a field contains only numeric and decimal value and at least one character

2125412
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
other browsers firefox opera google-chrome ignore the css file and rendering the page without styling

2125426
value	field
the regex validation does indeed not run unless the field has a value

2125429
assign	add
get the offset based on the subscript value of 1 and add it onto the pointers address 0x9877 to retrieve the value at that memory-address o and is assign to ch

2125429
assign	add
get the offset based on the value of 5 and add it onto the pointers address 0x987a to retrieve the value at that memory-address r and is assign to ch

2125429
decrement	increment
also the compiler knows that a sizeof char is 1 hence you can do pointers increment decrement operations like this

2125429
malloc	free	environment	execution
yes the block of memory is free up and handed back to the runtime environment for use by another upcoming code execution of malloc

2125429
linux	unix
yes the code will crash and burn with a segmentation fault this is common under unix linux

2125429
malloc	free
also remember this for every malloc there is a corresponding free if there is no corresponding free you have a memory leak in which memory is allocated but not free up

2125437
updating	updates
how can i pull the named of the install antivirus from wsc and if the virus database is updates or needs updating

2125457
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2125457
object-reference	instances
nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an

2125466
pixels	line
my line is only 1 pixels thick

2125475
entity-framework	ado.net
for several months i ve been working on a customer site building a website using asp.net-mvc with c# sql-server 2005 ado.net entity-framework jquery and some esri web apis and geodatabases

2125475
environment	building
this is in an academic environment and the server is in another building somewhere under the control of another department

2125476
physics-engine	box2d
i ve been making a game which uses the box2d physics-engine and i ve come across some weirdness with the stack-pointer esp and multiple-inheritance

2125481
postgresql	mysql
if you use sqlite as a database you don t even need to setup mysql or postgresql

2125485
boolean	int
derived1 has a constructor taking a int and derived2 a constructor taking a boolean

2125485
subclassing	base-class
is it possible to determine at runtime or at compile-time which of those two subclassing to create and assign it to the base-class

2125485
boolean	int
value where value is of types int or boolean

2125501
derived-class	base-class
even though the compiler might allow you to call a static methods of a base-class as through a derived-class it will in reality call the methods from the base-class

2125506
any	set
just now if i access to set any top level value of cascade the methods of my class will be invoked

2125529
python	java	python	ruby
is there any simple java web framework like sinatra for ruby or web.py for python

2125536
ienumerator	ienumerable
recently erik meijer and others have show how iobservable iobserver is the dual of ienumerable ienumerator

2125540
attributes	properties
basically xml elements can have two kinds of properties attributes and elements

2125540
contains	elements
now suppose you want to add elements to reside within task -- this is also okay as i said xml elements can contains other elements or have attributes

2125540
contains	any	contains	elements
simply defined any elements you want to contains within task ...within task

2125540
primitive	int
perhaps there s a disconnect for you here -- .when you defined the simplest form of elements we can call that a simpletypes and it can have value that are strings or int or any kind of relatively primitive types dates are valid too

2125540
attributes	properties	contains	elements
but if you want that same elements to also have attributess it suddenly needs to become a complextype since it has complexcontent -- it may contains both simple content and properties like say an attributes

2125542
attributes	properties
the serialization looks at the properties on the tasks class and finds the id properties which you marked with .so it gets serialization as an attributes to the task elements for the object

2125552
version-control	cvs
selected a version-control systemd cvs or svn to be honest cvs would suit this particular use case better by the .sounds of it and then set up building triggers on finalbuildinger .so that checkins cause a compile and send the results back to you

2125555
python	java	python	ruby
writing and deploying a java web application is not going to be as fast as in ruby or python but java isn t particularly known for its succinctness

2125555
python	ruby
it s a web application framework built on groovy which is a dynamic-languages similar to python and ruby that compiles to the jvm

2125585
xlsx	xls
of course csv files would be more straight forwarding but are there any ways to import the various excel formats xls xlsx without writing your own file parsing routines

2125588
ruby	php
i m trying to learn django and i would like feedback from anyone who has any asp.net-mvc mtv php ruby framework experience

2125590
sql-server-express	sql-server
there is a free edition of sql-server called sql-server-express

2125591
double	int
value-types such as int etc live on stack reference-types live on the managed heap however if a reference-types has for example has an instances variables of types double it will live along with its object on the heap

2125602
ref	out
.when you pass by ref with the ref out keyword it is passing the same reference to the object that you are using in the caller rather than creating a copy of the reference

2125607
erlang	python
or python or erlang or anything else that isn t c for that matter

2125638
ref	out
all parameters are pass-by-value unless you use the ref or out keyword to pass them by reference

2125666
web-services	webserver
you could run your own webserver stripes some of the key methods out of your code and refactor them into web-services that you would hosts on your server

2125681
typedef	struct
you don t need to typedef struct in c++ just is sufficient

2125685
duplicates	sorted	duplicates	elements
if the vector is not sorted unique will not find the unsorted duplicates elements

2125711
required	checked
however the main difference is that load doesn t hit the database to checked and load the entity you required since it assumes you know the entity exists

2125717
defined	declare
in the docs under customizing-the-error-list-format it show how you can give a form a special error rendering function but it seems like you have to declare it .when you initializer the form not .when you defined it

2125743
activerecord	datamapper
it would need to be significantly more sophisticated than that since the apis are quite different between datamapper and activerecord

2125770
void	main
if there is no main i want the cursor to go to void without an error prompt

2125796
markup	xhtml
i use a xhtml doctype only for one reason it helps me find â œerrorsâ in my markup in a more stricter way compared to html

2125796
docbook	mathml
features svg docbook mathml ofx

2125802
version-control	cvs
.when the dare i say inevitable time comes .when you decide to migrate away from cvs to a more modern version-control systemd the correct history without fake merge will probably be easier for the migration tool to make sense of

2125821
jquery	.post
i d be using jquery and then do an ajax .post to a controllers passing in an id of some sort

2125827
revision	svn
here s the relevant block of code from joystick.c via svn at revision 2652 root pygame

2125844
linked-list	nodes	children	nodes
one limiting factors is that libxml2 the xml libs underlying nokogiri stores a nodes s children as a linked-list

2125845
32-bit	64bit
i suspect this is due to the difference in pointers size .so that on my 64bit machine size_t is alias to a long int ld whereas on my 32-bit machine size_t is alias to another types

2125846
output	cat
this like the backtick solution takes the output of the cmd within and uses that as a parameter to the cat cmd

2125848
derived-class	base-class
the problem is called hiding - a member function in a derived-class hide functions with the same named in the base-class

2125851
output	cat
in which f | cat the cat program gets the output of which f on standards input

2125851
output	cat
to get the output of which f as a parameter to cat you can as others have answered use backticks or

2125851
output	cat
here the shell takes the output of which f and insert it as a parameter for cat

2125861
unique	words	sequences	unique
in another words instead of using unique sequences numbers am going for an unique non-sequences+randomize numbers solution

2125865
ruby-on-rails	django
this is a general question about how limiting are web development frameworks such as django and ruby-on-rails

2125865
json	xml
i am planning on building a restful web service which will have a purely json xml interface no gui

2125865
web.py	django	pylons	django	pylons	web.py
i ve looked at the full asp.net-mvc frameworks such as django and more basic ones such web.py and pylons

2125865
ruby-on-rails	django
this is what it seems like but i suspect that it might be an incorrect impression given how many sites are written in django and ruby-on-rails

2125865
ruby-on-rails	django	web.py	django
am i totally wrong and there is a way to easily do anything with a framework like django or ruby-on-rails or given my requirements i should go with something like web.py

2125881
base-class	inherited
i don t know if virtual inherited using the virtual keyword in the declaration of the base-class is standardized though

2125916
simplecursoradapter	spinner
i would query your database and get a cursor wrap that cursor in a simplecursoradapter and call setadapter on your spinner instances passing it the simplecursoradapter instances

2125930
acceptance-testing	bdd
sikuli could become a great companion for various flavor of testing bdd acceptance-testing etc

2125936
windows-xp	windows	installation	upgrade
.so i started about a week ago learning x86 assembly in that time i upgrade my computer to 8gb ram .so obviusly my x86 windows-xp installation was wasting up all that memory now i m running a x64 windows 7 copy .so the question is

2125953
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
i have several checkbox 4 and only one at all time can be selected to show off associated radio button as a grouping of 6

2125953
radio-button	checkbox
with the selection of a checkbox i also make visible a new radio-button grouping of 4

2125962
32-bit	64bit
most programs are still 32-bit and run fine on 64bit windows systemd

2125979
ruby-on-rails	django
django and ruby-on-rails for instances abstract away .some database functionality .so you ll only have to worry about your model object

2126004
any	set
in other words are there any substantial instuction set difference that would be materially different in 64 vs 32

2126006
json	xml
i use a similar framework in scala called step for xml json based web-services where i care about performance and there s no presentation going on

2126009
click	mouse
thinking about how you use a textarea you click on it you types and then you move the mouse to do something else

2126009
click	mouse
this event will only fire .when the mouse move outside of the textbox area like to go click file- printing

2126010
any	set
can i have any chance to set it show up for themes folder

2126015
python	c++
there are other crazy ones like stackless python google s implementation in c++ cython etc

2126018
output	cat
cat echo the contents of files to the standards output

2126018
output	cat
.when you write stuff | cat the file cat works on is the standards input which is connect to the output of stuff because pipe are files just like nearly everything else in unix

2126028
firefox	safari
these two document display differently in firefox even though they have the same contents safari appears to treat them the same .so this extent of this problem varies between different browsers

2126030
ruby	php
i have used ruby ruby-on-rails for years now and unlike just about every other language framework i have used across nearly 15 years of java php coldfusion asp etc etc it gets out of the way .when you need it to

2126034
buildpath	libs
i believe it s right click on project choose buildpath libs per balus-c and then modify classpath

2126037
margins	padding
it is maddening in margins padding handling or used to be and with other idiosyncratic elements netscape s old layer tag but not really with forms

2126052
msbuild	nant
.so generaly msbuild functionality nant functionality

2126052
msbuild	nant
while i ve certainly spend quite a lot more time with msbuild vs nant .so i can t be a truly expert opinion from my experience if you are using visual-studio it is probably a better tracking to go down by staying with msbuild for building your project since it s most likely already in tune with your development-process

2126052
msbuild	nant
i m unaware of anything that nant offers at this points that msbuild does not except for the fact that it is more in alignment with the open source mode

2126052
msbuild	nant
again since my experience with nant is limited i can t say that this is still true but .when i last used nant it was quite a bit more verbose to accomplish the same tasks as compared to msbuild which if still true would be another reason to me to use msbuild instead

2126052
msbuild	nant
your need to drop binaries as a post-build task is a common one easliy accomplished with msbuild or nant

2126052
msbuild	nant
for the aformentioned reasons i d suggest looking to msbuild first to see how this would work then looking at nant only if msbuild doesn t fit your bill

2126052
msbuild	nant
certainly if msbuild doesn t do what you want and nant does by all means take that route

2126060
python	c++
it c++ let me know if there are any problems converting this code to python

2126062
arrays	loops
however since there is no indexof in at least ie7 and below we have no way of matching the current color to its positioning in the arrays without a loops

2126069
any	set
this module will execute before any request and will have a chance to set the httpcontext.user properties as appropriate

2126075
hide	show
i have a ajax.request in which i use onloading and oncomplete to show and hide a load animation gif

2126092
default	reset
example the default implementation while it supports adding ranges of elements just throw a reset i believe for the whole collections rather than piece meal throw out a single notification with all the new items on it

2126099
activerecord	datamapper
i m in the process of replacing activerecord with datamapper in one of my apps

2126099
activerecord	datamapper
since there aren t any authentication solutions that are compatable with datamapper i m thinking that i could use activerecord just for user authentication and then use datamapper everywhere else

2126119
opensuse	rpm
i aske this because .so fare i know there are no rpm s for opensuse 11.2 or suse

2126129
value	field
.when i click my image i want to set the value of all three field to empty

2126138
implements	extends
i built a plugins that supplies a custom artifact call it foo and supplies a scripting to let the developer make new instances myfoo yourfoo and i have the artifact templates extends a base-class could implements an interface

2126173
activerecord	datamapper
however .when you use them on the same table you should be aware that the caching mechanisms that are used for loading recording may break if you modify a user with datamapper and then access it again with activerecord

2126175
highlight	selected
just highlight both the user_id and role_id at the same time right click on the left and selected primary key.

2126207
python	ruby
python scripting lauange like ruby which may help you learn quickly

2126208
svn	rcs
over the years i have used rcs cvs and - for the last 5 years - svn

2126218
constructor	object
i think you are required to put a default-constructor in any class where you defined any other constructor if you want to use object of that class in any kind of arrays or containers

2126233
waveform	music
this research problem is often referred to as music transcription the act of converting a low-level representation of music waveform into a higher-level representation such as midi or even sheet music

2126233
python	c++
all of the mir libs i know are typically c++ python matlab

2126237
scala	java
if you want to use something like java then look at scala as an option

2126240
preventdefault	event-bubbling
preventdefault is preferred to return false if you want event-bubbling to continue as normals but keep the default browser-action from continuing

2126253
textile	bbcode
other sites support textile or bbcode

2126265
contains	elements
an arrays is returned as the result-of the match with each elements contains one of the matched grouping in brackets

2126285
widget	button
animation affect only the drawing of widget which means after the animation is done your button is still at its previous location

2126303
groovy	java	spring	grails
it looks a lot like grails another spring technology except that instead of creating artifacts for the groovy language you create them for java

2126303
groovy	java
personally the demo didn t make me change my preferred toolkit grails but that s because i can achieve faster results with groovy parsing xml for example is much more painful in java than in groovy

2126303
dojo	gwt
last but not least in grails you have tons of plugins to make fancy ajax website zk for example if you want to avoid javascript but there are plugins for gwt yahoo dojo etc...

2126303
groovy	java
.so if you don t want to learn groovy which is not too difficult if you already know java roo is the way to go to building clean web project with all the power of hibernate and spring

2126312
windows-xp	windows
i need to write a program in any programming language preferably delphi 7 delphi 10 c# that emulates pressing 1 every 10 seconds to a given process in windows-xp or windows 7

2126315
ruby-on-rails	django
most web sites will be well suited to rich frameworks like ruby-on-rails or django -- but you re building a web service and that has very different tradeoffs

2126315
werkzeug	webob
my personal favorite collections of modular wsgi components is werkzeug with webob for request and response object

2126322
external	embed
i wan t to embed an external application using iframe in my google project page

2126344
cursor	row
but you have neglected to join the rows selected by the inner cursor with the current row of the outer cursor

2126345
keyboard	mouse
using event taps for this purpose is inherently a bad idea because the user can change where he she is typing with the mouse as well as the keyboard

2126356
ref	out
it would be closer to the thruth to state that every parameter was pass-by-value but still not entirely correct ref or out

2126368
contains	elements
an elements cannot contains line break because the textinput only accepts a single line of text

2126368
contains	elements
if you wanted to match it the other way around and your input elements contains the text sequences of n you could do a replace on the text value before testing

2126370
textarea	textbox
if you want multiline textinput you should be using textarea not input textbox

2126386
contains	any
that is because any serialization engine needs to be able to understand your custom made object in the runtime and c++ doesn t contains the necessary information for that

2126390
exception-handling	try-catch
for ex use a try-catch block to fetch a newly added column if it throw an exception-handling in the catch block write a routine that will return versioning 1 of the datastore object

2126392
python	ruby
while most scripting languages most notably python and ruby lack proper support for multithreading due to them using global interpreter locks this is not really a problem for web-services

2126392
python	ruby
the bigger problem with python and ruby is that they execute the code extremely slowly

2126401
processor	cpu
cpu utilization in this context is the proportion of the total available processor cycles that are consumed by each process

2126424
contains	set
2 onclientclick event handler are set to procedure contains if..then statement wrote above

2126435
unsigned-integer	int
this resulting value is printed as unsigned-integer which works because int and unsigned are same size

2126449
entity-framework	ado.net
watch evolving ado.net entity-framework in .net 4 and beyond for what you can do with ef4

2126451
jax-ws	cxf
another very good stack which also implements jax-ws is cxf

2126451
jax-ws	cxf
updates i ve mentioned jax-ws ri metro cxf and i would understand if you tell me that this is confusing

2126482
where-clause	sql
you want a delete with a where-clause this is standards sql

2126487
double-quotes	spaces
i ve still kept the double-quotes immediately around in case someone s committed the heinous crime of creating a file with a spaces in it -

2126488
margins	padding
work out how many li s would fit into that width taking into account the margins and padding of #list-wrap

2126494
affinity	cpu
for example say you wanted to make sure that an application is never using more than 50 of the computing power of a dual-core machine i m not saying it s a good thing to do i m just giving an example then there s a very easy way to do it you could set the cpu affinity of your program to only one of the two cores

2126494
affinity	cpu
note that i don t recommend to do it in your case all i m saying here is for the sake of completeness that it exists it has valid uses and there s a reason why both linux and windows developers have written apis and end-user cmd allowing to set the cpu affinity on a per-process basis these functionalities are fully available both to programmers and to end-users

2126503
keyboard	mouse
if the .application don t process wm_char etc windows-messages xinput directinput your best bet is to make a dll to inject into the .app overrides some of the functions cause those use directly the systemd resources to access the keyboard mouse gamepad

2126507
perl	awk	perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
however i suspect it might be simpler to write some kind of scripting with awk perl ruby python etc. that process the files

2126510
csv	xml
is there a way to convert an xml file to a csv using php

2126513
csv	xml
to create a csv file from a xml in php 5.0 itâ s very simple we will just have to write some line

2126513
csv	xml
first we should read our xml using simplexml_load_file passing the named of the file and returns an object with all the properties and value of the csv

2126513
csv	xml
here is the complete source code that converts xml to csv in php 5.0

2126516
contains	any
it needs to be noted that the popular methods of saving entire struct by casting them to-char and writing sizeof struct bytes is completely unportable it doesn t support versioning and it break if the struct contains any pointers or c++ non-pod object

2126524
profiling	debugging
beside using print_r or var-dump you should consider using firephp or php quick profiling to help you debugging and display variables s value

2126526
profiling	debugging
beside using print_r or var-dump you should consider using firephp or php quick profiling to help you debugging and display variables s value

2126529
buffering	streaming
the sql 2005 requirement is a pain as otherwise you could write directly to sqlfilestreaming however i don t think it would be too hard to write your own streaming implementation that buffering 8040 or some multiple bytes and writes it incrementally

2126531
appfuse	spring	wicket	spring
.so while you can compare spring web flow + spring and wicket + spring the later combo doesn t offer anything comparable to roo out of the box maybe appfuse or appfuse lighting but you didn t mention them and they are third-party project

2126531
wicket	spring
in other words i don t think that spring-roo vs wicket and spring makes sense

2126536
derived-class	inherited
virtual base classes are special in that they are initializer by the most derived-class and not by any intermediate base classes that inherited from the virtual base

2126536
derived-class	base-class
if the most derived-class being construct does not list it in its member initalization list then the virtual base-class is initializer with its default-constructor which must exist and be accessible

2126541
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu and tried to use xerces

2126545
ubuntu	linux
in x ubuntu s file-manager my application appears with the default linux executable icons which i would like to replace with my own

2126564
specifications	w3c
mozilla has the -moz-doc ie has it s own hacks but none of these are part of the w3c specifications and we all know standards are important

2126566
managed-code	unmanaged
code project - sinking events from managed-code in unmanaged c++

factors	primes
factors all the int from 1 to 20 into their primes factorsizations

2127111
factorization	primes
now for each primess p that appears in the primes factorization of some int in the range 1 to 20 find the maximum exponent that it has among all those primes factorizations

2127111
factorization	primes
for example the primes 3 will have exponent 2 because it appears in the factorization of 18 as 3 2 and if it appeared in any primes factorization with an exponent of 3 3 3 that numbers would have to be at least as large as 3 3 27 which it outside of the range 1 to 20

2127121
contains	elements
the official reason is that in html4 strict the form elements can only contains block elements but block elements are in turn allowed to contains form input

2127121
contains	elements
form elements being inline elements need to be contains within a semantic

2127121
contains	elements
this makes me think that form elements is not semantic enough to contains other elementss

2127121
contains	elements
hence it technically is a block elements but it needs something more semantic to contains the actual input-field

relational-database	schema
schema looks like standards adjacency list - one of methods to implements tree in relational-database

2127210
any	set
lastval returns the last value returned or set with the last nextval or setval call to any sequences .so the following would get you in trouble

2127217

.so for example the code will do .some work using a nodes in the parsing tree and call itself on the nodes s two children combining their results to give the overall result for the tree

2127219
hash	md5
i was thinking md5 on the input value and then using bytes from the hash casting them to int and mod them into acceptable indexes for lookup tables but i suspect there must be a better way

2127271

json	xml
data interchange is one of the main use cases of xml of which json is a subset

2127405
csv	xml
you can transfer tab delimited or csv files but the data they contains is not as well defined as xml - non-ascii-characters how are they represented

2127405
json	xml
thus i would stick to the xml json format unless the speed of transfer or process makes a noticeable difference to the process

2127422
duplicates	elements
the .clone methods .when used in conjunction with one of the insert methodss is a convenient way to duplicates elements on a page

for a beginner and using the three examples you gave i would say start with kohana or codeigniter for these reasons

2127849
zend-framework	phpunit	zend-framework	kohana	phpunit	kohana
lacks mature features that are useful in enterprise development a decent unit-testing systemd there is rudimentary phpunit modules to use in kohana and you can certainly use base phpunit but in contrast zend-framework has extended phpunit functionality to better suite it s framework

now the problem is that the notify methods in my callback object never gets called

2131991
ubuntu	linux
compare the linux versioning taken on ubuntu 9.10

2132002
oracle	mysql
some programmers don t realise that and write code that doesn t get shared and then complain that oracle isn t as fast as mysql

2132007
required	checked
i don t believe there is any explicit permission checked that required a shortcut to be removed by the same .app that added it but you could get around that anyway by using a shareduserid for both apks

2132008
any	set
you can also set it to 0 which removes any time restrictions - although this is not best practice

2132025
python	php
overall although you could follow the php model of doing things i would very much suggest a high level python web framework

2132034
selected	cell
i would like to selected all cell of the first column of a table

2132060
chipmunk	box2d
if you downloading the cocos2d-x sdk in the include project is a sample of box2d and chipmunk

2132060
chipmunk	box2d
box2d is more powerful but i think a little harder to use than chipmunk

2132072
selected	button
i selected one and .when i click a button i want to send its id in the server side and based on that id to create some excel file

2132072
jquery	.post

emacs	vim
choices would be vim or emacs

2132093
selected	cell
this will selected both td data and th header cell btw

2132101
python	perl
an editor is probably the wrong tool here - if you want to generator all those insert statements you are probably better off writing a small program in a scripting-language like perl or python

2132108
windows-vista	windows
if anyone uses this unit with another versioning of delphi and or windows-vista or windows 7 please tell me if this unit will work there too

2132114
data-structures	tree
as we know that the tree are recursive data-structures we use recurrsion in writing the procedure of tree like delete methods of bst etc

2132119
eventmachine	twisted
this required you to get rid of the conventional http servers and use an event based one node.js eventmachine twisted

2132122
contains	elements
but as contains an arrays of key to the elements rather than a single key to the elements you would need to write your own functions to do what you want

2132123
markup	xhtml
if you make sure you ve got a around the rows in your markup for xhtml and browser fixup compatibility you could better say

2132156
webforms	asp.net
on the other hand if we use javascript grid we can have behavior like the old school grid views in asp.net webforms

2132156
filtering	sorting
i ve looked at jquery tablesorter and quick search plugins but they work just on the currently-fetched data and won t help in real sorting and filtering that may need to touch the database

2132156
asp.net-mvc	webforms
another approach i looked at was using dynamic data on webforms but i didn t find any suggestions out there as to whether or not it is a good idea to integrated asp.net-mvc and dd

2132156
filtering	sorting
i know implements filtering and sorting for an individual case is simple although it has some issues like using dynamic-linq which is not yet a standards approach but creating a sorting or filtering tool which works in all cases is the idea i m looking for

2132174
defined	declare
is it correct that to declare in c is equals to defined in c++

2132192
defined	declare
for functions i ve seen declare being used for just writing the header whereas defined was used for writing the body

2132201
checkbox	button
what i d like to do is to have multiple ajax submit button to perform different actions for a list of items with checkbox

2132201

.so .when i selected as many checkbox as i want then i can choose what to do with them

2132241
fputs	fgets
i know how to do it in php using fputs fgets and fsockopen

2132243
mongodb	couchdb
couchdb and mongodb both have mechanisms for extraction and analysing information buried deep inside the document

mongodb	couchdb
as for which is best - couchdb vs mongodb - that s partly personal preferences and partly requirements

2132255
miktex	tex
i use miktex for compilation of the tex files

2132263
zipfile	archive
you can downloading a zipfile like any files with the webclient class look at the details and examples in the msdn documentation for downloadinging content on demand it even talks about how to downloading and get a specific file from a zip archive

2132273
realloc	malloc
would the answer be same for realloc malloc 0 0

2132290

emacs	vim
answering on the ide part besides a good plain text-editor vim and emacs have been suggested already i found the netbeans ide to work really well especially on windows

2132312
daemons	systemd
if same daemons i m running from terminal then its working properly and also systemd function is getting success with return-value 0 and gui is getting popped up

2132318
realloc	malloc
malloc and realloc functions is unspeciï ed

2132319
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
this is valid for all three allocation functions ie calloc malloc and realloc

2132347
extends	sealed
if you want to extends an existing class you will either need to inherited it if it is not sealed or create your own new class that contains the classes that you wish to combine information from

2132383
python	php
most similar to the php model is perhaps python server pages psp

2132387
getter	setter
at that points you still have a public getter and a private setter but the backing field and properties implementation is generator for you behind the scenes

2132387
value	field
additionally in this case you can t mirror the behavior you want the ability to read the value publicly but write it privately with a field - you could have a readonly field but then you could only write to it within the constructor

2132408
contains	set
in terms of your question on hibernate s uniqueresult - all this does is return a single object .when there is only one object to return - instead of a set contains 1 object

2132445
selected	cell
you can selected a column in a table by using jquery cell selectedor plugins

2132454
getter	setter
in eclipse there is a source- generator getter setter can you do something similar to synthesize properties in xcode

2132454
getter	setter
i do know that synthesizing properties will generator getter setter for me but i am looking for a way to generator the properties synthesize code by selected the variables

2132464
click	mouse
you wouldn t scripting copying files from one directory to another by simulating the mouse click and dragging would you

2132517
getter	setter
generator getter and setter for properties is done with the properties and the synthesize keyword

2132523
getter	setter
in eclipse there is a source- generator getter setter can you do something similar to synthesize properties in xcode

2132523
getter	setter
in your implementation if you want to generator getter and setter for my_array

2132524
execute	prepare
i m writing a semi-simple database wrapper class and want to have a fetching methods which would operate automagically it should prepare each different statement only the first time around and just bind and execute the query on successive call

2132537
meta-inf	jar
.when you use -jar then only the classpath attributes defined in the meta-inf manifest.mf file inside the jar file will influence the classpath

2132539
logout	login
but spaced in between all my queries are several rows where the eventclass is audit login or audit logout - and the duration of an audit logout can be up to a minute

2132555
meta-inf	jar
you could unpack the jar file with jar -xf mainprog.jar and look at the meta-inf manifest.mf file

2132565
logout	login
login logout events are related to the setting up tearing down

2132569
32-bit	x86
is vc++ 2005 sp1 x86 supported on windows 7 32-bit

2132571
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i think recent versioning of safari opera and firefox support the nth-child css selector .so thatâ s another option

2132599
realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free
how malloc realloc free do this is implementation-specific

2132599
realloc	free
you should never do this from your code it s only for use by realloc and free

2132626
atmosphere	netty
remoteactors are using netty it s basically only the jax-rs jersey and comet atmosphere integration that runs over servlets

2132638
setinterval	settimeout
you can use settimeout or setinterval again

2132693
decrement	increment
the stack-pointer register is simply increment or decrement depending on the cpu-architecture every time you push .something .so it points to a new but existing memory location

2132696
qmail	exim
on a linux server you will have something like sendmail qmail exim or postfix install

2132706
attributes	properties
you can still leave your attributess on the properties of dto for simple attributes properties level validation

2132709
contains	elements
the second is that oracle dates contains a time elements

2132713
oracle	mysql
while in my experience there definitely seems to be a performance benefit using prepare statements with oracle i m not convinced that the same is true for mysql - however a lot will depend on the structure of your database and the complexity of the query or more specifically how many different options the optimizer can find for resolving the query

2132720
linux	unix
instead of directly investigating your dependencies in python and if you are running in linux unix you can wrapper your program with code memoize.py code

2132732
children	tree
if we consider the problem of count the levels of a tree the answer is that the height of the tree is 1 more than the height of the tallest deepest of the children and the height of a leaf is 1

2132742
contains	set
the result set contains groupinging where each grouping s key is a key from the original dictionary and the contents of the grouping are an of the lists with the same key

2132743
s#arp-architecture	nhibernate
it is a bit specific to s#arp-architecture and nhibernate .so i m not sure if it suits your needs

2132743
filtering	sorting
automatic request sorting filtering paging handling

2132747
any	set
the dll project settings are set to dynamically link with atl but this doesn t seem to make any difference

2132767
32-bit	64bit
the problem was the architecture 32-bit powershell hosts could not list 64bit modules.

2132804
hash	md5
the following compares using the plain query-string vs first creating the md5 hash

2132811
nsarray	nsdate
i have an nsarray of diaryentry object where each diaryentry has an nsdate date_ field

2132811
nsarray	nsdate	value	field
.so i need to take the nsarray and convert to an nsdictionary of arrays where the key is the day of the week nsdate and the value is an nsarray of diaryentrys order by the date_ field in ascending order

2132819
value	field
you will have to store all the value of your field in some variables checked them whenever use changes the page url or click on some link to trap the page change event use page unload event

2132824
python	java
for example the first versioning of google.com was built using java and python

2132825
printf	scanf
in c if we include #stdio.h we get some functions like printf scanf

2132831
windows-live	hotmail
i am currently working on import contact from windows-live contact hotmail addressbook

2132837
checkbox	textbox	required	checked
whats the best way to make a textbox required if a checkbox is checked

2132841
any	set
if you set iis to use windows-authentication and the site is in the intranet zone for your clients then the login will automatically happen without any prompt at all

2132859
dependency-injection	inject
dependency-injection is simply allowing the caller of a methods to inject dependent object into the methods .when it is called

2132874
delphi	vb.net
i am using delphi 7 to try to use a .dll created by vb.net

2132908
getter	setter
or just use setter and getter as beans suggest

2132941
user-controls	ascx
in asp.net if the code and the asp.net markup is in one ascx file for example for a user-controls would it perform poorly compared to a user-controls with code-behind using a cs file and a designer.cs file

2132949
zero	nan
since it isn t zero the numbers is not an infinite and must be a nan

2132955
abstract-factory	factory-method
i ve read up on the factory-method abstract-factory and builder patterns and i think one of the factory patterns is suitable but i don t really know how to apply it to such a complex hierarchy

2132955
constructor	object
edit it has become clear from the discussion in suggestions given .so far that i should have explained more about why i required factory to building my object hierarchies rather than allowing constructor themselves to building their dependencies

2132955
constructor	object
i m taking a mockist approach to the testing which required the ability to inject mocks representing an object s dependencies and as such i have to avoid using new in any constructor

2132955
constructor	object
create a secondary constructor in each class that building any dependencies required by the object being construct

2132982
32-bit	64bit
i have a lot of sharepoint web-parts etc all of which are compiled for any cpu they run fine on 32-bit sharepoint but moving to server 2008 in 64bit causes the following error

2132984
getter	setter
generally you want to use getter and setter for public field access and you don t want to have global public variables

2132987
tostring	equals
you can make sure that hashcode equals does what you want can overrides tostring for sensible logging and it probably reads much better anyway

2132988
jquery	dojo
there are implementation for various javascript toolkits such as dojo or jquery

2132990
associations	model
the associations of particular formats with portions of your text model is much less intensive

2132999
.war	jar
the maven philosophy is that each project should building one and only artifact jar .war whatever

2133004
default	reset
i need to reset display settings to default if new one connect

2133010
blacklist	whitelist
but it would be certainly better to use a whitelist instead of a blacklist

2133018
inline-code	code-behind
they actually do reveal that the speed of inline-code is the same as code-behind

2133018
inline-code	code-behind
this makes me think that performance and maintainability is not always the main reason why you choose inline-code over code-behind

2133031
python	c++
maybe the best way is to compute the big arrays with c++ and then transfering them to python

2133088
value	field
my datasource not only selected data for the data textfield and value field but it also selected a couple of other columns

2133091
java-wireless-toolkit	midlet
.when i run my midlet with java-wireless-toolkit midlet runs correctly but .when it try to parsing a textfield following error occurs

2133095
value	field
the field needs to store a unique value and i was wondering whether given a string i could get a unique numbers and then store it in the datetime field which is a double

2133095
value	field
and the value returned would be assign to the datetime field

2133101
32-bit	64bit
you can t mix 32-bit and 64bit assemblies

2133101
32-bit	64bit
you can run 32-bit binaries libs on 64bit os but again you cannot mix them together

2133107
delphi	c++
since the tag is language-agnostic and the words null-pointer in delphi object-pascal it is nil in c# it is null in c++ it is null

2133111
contains	set
the .cs files that contains the controllers are compiled into dll files .so at the very least you have to upload a new set of dlls

2133133
32-bit	64bit
64bit process cannot load 32-bit dlls and vice versa

2133141
rollback	commit
see autocommit commit and rollback

2133142
postgresql	mysql
we re on a linux apache postgresql php stack but a mysql supported installation is not the end of the world

2133147
assign	add
i d just make two properties min max assign them the value of the first item you add to the arrays then each time you add a new item just checked if its datetime is less or greater than the min max ones

2133158
virtual-functions	derived-class
see the templates pattern use an abstract-base-class with pure virtual-functions that can be configure in a derived-class

2133159
ready	live
if you can live with the points above they may not matter to you at all it is certainly ready for production use

2133168
joomla	drupal
other than that try drupal joomla or one of the many other standards cms s

2133170
constructor	object
sometimes your object need to get initializer with for example a data-layer and a user and a context and a factory can maintain those things make your object and save you from having to repeat yourself in a lot of different constructor

2133170
constructor	object
just building your object with good constructor

2133185
arguments	default
i m trying to get the default jvm arguments of the available jvm but i m getty a strange output

2133206
setinterval	settimeout
n.b. don t pass strings to settimeout or setinterval - best practice is to pass an anonymous-function or a function identifier as i did above

2133217
setinterval	settimeout
note that settimeout and setinterval are very different functions

2133229
authentication	login
i have a normals html page in a normals apache with an authentication form with that form i need to access with the credentials to an application located in other server with diferent ip that server have a secured application with tomcat here is the login form in the apache

2133229
google-chrome	firefox
the submit only works random in google-chrome and dont work in ie and firefox

2133238
duplicates	elements
.sorting makes same elements grouping together and .so makes checked for duplicates easy

2133245
conditional	operators
the basic advantage i see is that if i know i m always going to be doing the same thing it becomes one location to change a methods instead of two or perhaps many if i m implements a switching statement via conditional operators

2133254
zend-framework	symfony
i can t speak specifically to symfony but i know that i purposely shun zend-framework s form validation and instead validation on my model zend-framework does not provide its own model component .so it has no actual opinion on the matter

2133260
defined	declare
that is declare it but don t defined it

2133260
defined	declare
during compilation a types that is declare but not defined is called an incomplete-types

2133262
conditional	operators
conditional operators are not a standards way of dealing with different value

2133265
value	field
here is what i got now with all your help but i still want a more elgant way to pump the term field value into the query

2133314
duplicates	elements
building an arrays duplicates of size where each elements is zero

2133326
sftp	scp
i need a methods of paramiko based file transfer with a lightweight ssh2 server dropbear which has no support for scp or sftp

2133359
modbus	tcp-ip
i m looking for an implementation of modbus rtu for rs-232 rs-485 but a modbus tcp-ip implementation would be welcome as well

2133378
default-value	default
however if you have the classpath variables set then this will overrides the default and you need to explicit set the classpath back to its default-value

2133383
stderr	stdout
instead read from the stdout or stderr attributes to read the output

2133383
stderr	stdout
if the process output to both stdout and stderr and you want to read it separately you will have to be careful to actually read from both without blocking or you can deadlock

2133386
processor	cpu
processor make and cpu types

2133388
realloc	free
one points nobody cared to talk about yet in your first program is that realloc with length 0 is the same thing as free

2133393
subset	unique
i thought that the operation updates with nested selected is atomicity - that means that every client receives his own set of data that is unique no other client received a subset of his data

2133402
textbox	button
i have a child panels in a form which contains some textbox and button

2133419
tuples	set
which will work if thing_collection is a list tuples set or dictionary

2133424
javascript-debugger	inspector
you could also look into using tools like firebug firefox only - these sorts of tools are very good at inspector and tweak the layout of the page however i ve always found the javascript-debugger to be a little lacking

2133445
build-system	cmake
you can use a build-system like cmake

2133445
linux	unix
highly portable across common environment it can produce solution files for several versioning of ms visual-c++ as well as makefile for unix linux systemd

2133464
proxy-server	apache
now i want to use a proxy-server via apache to hide the ip and use a domain named

2133464
directory	folder
now i create an entry in the sites-available sites-enabled folder of my apache directory etc apache2 sites-available called mydomain.com

2133474
triggers	insert
the insert event is triggers as soon as the user queries an account

2133477
credentials	account
your framework should access sql under its own credentials whether it be a sql login or a domain account that the framework runs under

2133487
specifications	w3c
also the best place to look for what is allowed and not allowed for html tags the best source is the actual specifications available on the w3c website

2133488
logging	trace
use this to enable trace logging on the service

2133495
put	get
you are using double quoting you put quotes around _post email and inside it making it get interpreter the wrong way

2133505
animation	rotation
in the first animation you are using a helpers keypath to change the transform to produce a rotation and in the second you are changing the transform directly to produce a scaling

2133505
animation	rotation
it appears that you can cause both scaling and rotation of your layer to occur by using helpers keypaths for both animation

2133510
attributes	properties
however .when querying the metadata the non nullable properties end up with a required attributes

2133538
http	ssl
the responsetext will be a valid xml that i can manipulate but the webservice can be accessed both via http and http ssl and i must do it over http because authentication is required to do some stuff

2133548
contains	any
step 3 for this row pick a random column weight by the count of 1s in that column except ignore any cell that may already contains a 1 - more on this later

2133549
perl	awk
then checkout man sed and man awk and have a peek at perl

2133551
nsmutablearray	nsarray
is it because they wanted to have an nsmutablearray rather than an nsarray to edit change it later

2133556
python	c++
other solutions are quite close too pyrex python fortran using f2py and inline c++

2133562
inlining	inline
to avoid inlining along a deep call chaining inlining stops .when the accumulate inline bytecode size along the call chaining exceeds 40 bytes. although they have runtime profiling information methods call frequency they are still careful to avoid inlining large functions or chaininging of functions to prevent bloat

2133567
pagespeed	yslow
you can also test your page using yslow or pagespeed add-on for firebug

2133585
realloc	free
.when you pass in a non-null pointers and size of zero to realloc realloc behaves as if youâ ve called free â

2133585
realloc	malloc
.when you pass in a null-pointer and size is non-zero realloc behaves as if youâ ve called malloc â

2133595
children	tree
practically i have a tree of elements like parent and children with a dept of more levels

2133606
conditional	operators
if the result might vary during a single run you may be able to use lazy-evaluation of boolean operators to split your conditional into a cheap part and an expensive part and run the cheap part first

2133620
value	field
how can i have it .so it compares the value of the field s4 or whatever value of numberofcycles with null

2133628
javascript	dom
nope javascript always applies to every valid elements in the dom no matter where it came from

2133638
netbsd	linux
i mean is it possible to read write co-processor register in user spaces in netbsd linux

2133643
google-chrome	firefox
this works on ie firefox google-chrome

2133643
google-chrome	firefox
then firefox and google-chrome work fine using diff as a value for the images left-margin as i intended but ie throw a runtime error and stops running the scripting citing an invalid arguments in jquery file

2133644
selected	button
users would choose from the first box and either drag value items to the second for selectedion or would selected items and then click a button to move them over to the 2nd box

2133646
invoices	product
becasue you should not be changing the address information in the actual invoices unless it has not been shipped in which case you had better change it or the product will be shipped to the wrong place this is sufficent to maintain data-integrity

2133679
versioning	upgrade
to test this we have an ant target that install an older versioning upgrade it and compares the schema to a newly created one

2133683
integrated	manual
however the gcc manual says that the function will not be integrated by the compiler into the code if

2133689
hide	show
i have a jquery function which hide the smaller div and show the larger div .when click

2133694
conditional	operators
conditional operators used for this purpose is fairly rare .so the eye isn t really looking for it

2133711
selected	cell
with key_down event the selected cell is unknown with focus_out we don t know the key pressed

2133724
assign	add
i would also need to see if you have assign something to jcontentpane since you only add the list if that panels is null

2133755
compact-framework	.net
keep in mind as well that the article is from 2002 and was talking about .net compact-framework 1.0

2133774
nsmutablearray	nsarray
if i remember correctly using creates an immutable copy of the object by default .so if you have nsmutablearray it becomes nsarray

2133776
google-chrome	firefox
using firefox or google-chrome the file is downloading properly and our application is launchd via a custom mime types and all is well

2133783
.net	wcf
however as you know wcf can consume and expose a web service in addition to a wcf or remoting service etc. all you need to do is expose it as a web service for the other .net .app to consume

2133788
textbox	button
i have a test page with a panels contains a textbox an instances of my custom button and a standards asp.net button

2133788
textbox	button
the button are wired to an event handler which will change the textbox to the id of the caller

2133788
textbox	button
.when defaultbutton of the panels is set to the asp.net button hitting enter in the next box works correctly - the page post back and the textbox is populate with the named of the standards button

2133788
textbox	button
.when defaultbutton of the panels is set to my button hitting enter in the textbox causes the page to postback but the click event is not fired

2133805

simple reason there is no std ostream operators with cstring.

2133805
ostream	std
std ostream operators std ostream s const cstring str

2133806
reflection	runtime
i m not sure what it does exactly but i would expect it to perform some kind of runtime class generator logic since that will be faster at runtime than raw reflection

2133808
oracle	mysql
both oracle and mysql have command-line tools and from experience i know you can run them thus

2133824
databound	gridview
i have a gridview that i need to get the width of columns for after the gridview is databound

javascript	dom
a validation will still validation the document - since it doesn t execute the javascript - but is there .something theoretically wrong with modifying the dom .so it is no longer consistent with the and returned content-type or is the only relevant to the markup .when it is in textual form

2133848
exception-handling	try-catch
he al.so nests two levels of try-catch in his code sample for re.solveall .so the second time submitchanges is tried he s able to log any exception-handling before exiting

2133857
arrays	loops
implicit it will of course loops through your arrays twice in fact

2133882
keyboard	mouse
besides the fact that you don t have to checked for the specific mouse key it also has the advantage that this enables the user to create the context menu using the keyboard or maybe to use a totally different way if the user is working on a platform where context menus are requested via other means

2133888
temporary	copy
you can either export your working copy into a temporary directory and sync from there or configure the tool to ignore the .svn directory

users would not expect that click a selected radio-button will deselect it since that s not normals behavior

2134352
background-color	height
i have a div that has fixed height and a background-color - as you can imagine the background-color does not expand to fill the full height of the div

2134362
event-listener	listener
you need to add an event-listener to the checkbox and modify the variables from the listener

2134365
radio-button	selected
you could add an onclientclick function to each radio-button that would de-select it if it was click while selected haven t tried it but it seems reasonable

2134368
ruby-enterprise-edition	passenger
in my own experiments lately i have been thinking about using ruby-enterprise-edition and having a master thread that fork many poller worker threads .so as to get the benefit of the reduced memory footprint much like passenger does but i think the em trick could work as well

2134732
signals	sigint
should i be trapping another signals sigint sigquit

2134746
derived-class	base-class
derived-class is supposed to assume that base-class implements idisposable properly and then overrides dispose bool which is not even a part of the original interface

2134798
primitive	int
on the very high level i know that we need to wrap the primitive data types such as int and char by using their respective wrapper classes to use them within java collections.i would like to understand how java collections work at the low-level by asking why do we need to wrap primitive data types as object to be able to use them in collections

2134801
protected	public
the design decision to allow for a protected virtual void dispose bool disposing methods allows for extra flexibility that wouldn t be easily and safely handled in a public interface

2134805
samba	ntfs
to verify this mount a ntfs filesystems or whatever types you are mounting over samba on your local machine and see if you get the same coloring behavior from ls

2134811

viewwillappear	viewdidload
the viewdidload is called everytime as the viewwillappear

2134843
subclassing	inherited
alex s on-point diagnosis of the problem notwithstanding i would strongly argue that you should not multiplying inherited from dictionary in this case or in general for that matter. while it may seem convenient to subclassing from it and automatically inherited all the dictionary behavior dictionaryionary and built-in types in general are often subject to shortcuts internally

2134844
put	get
i understand the troubles you can get into .when you put a using-declaration inside a header file .so i don t want to do that

2134864
double	int
you can easily building your own collections class that doesn t need wrapper but at the end you will have to building one for each types char int float double etc multiplying by the typess of the collectionss set map list + their implementation

2134888
getter	setter
in response to setter getter comment

2134894
primitive-types	reference-type
at the virtual-machine level it s because primitive-types are represented very differently in memory compared to reference-type like java.lang.object and its derived types

2134894
primitive	int
primitive int in java for example is just 4 bytes in memory whereas an object takes up at minimum 8 bytes by itself plus another 4 bytes for referencing it

2134905
derived-class	base-class
one problem i see with your implementation is that there is potention for the derived-class not to call the base-class dispose methods

2134914
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
our website uses the superfish jquery plugins for our menus and they work fine in firefox ie6 ie7 safari google-chrome etc

2134928
contains	set
you could have a set of role object contactrole parentrole etc. each contains the field associated with that role

2134932
contains	any
i want to selected the correct cascade types .so that .when i delete an a object any b object contains it is updates and vice-versa

2134938
ienumerator	ienumerable
instead of collecting the value in a list you can return an ienumerator or ienumerable and use the yield-keyword

2134939
attributes	properties
i guess these are new 1.8.0 attributes of properties task

2134939
attributes	properties
on the other hand if you need a relative-path to a basedir just use a value attributes of properties task

2134940
java-me	midlet
good guides to java-me should give you an overview of other methods available on graphics other code you ll need in your midlet class how to handle cmd for handling button presses etc

2134953
cos	exp	cos	sin	sin	exp
most matlab functions will take vectors matrix as arguments including cos sin exp log etc

2134969
macros	vba
or you could also write some vba macros for excel like you mentioned

2135066
haskell	scala
examples haskell scala

2135072
value	field
if i have a multivalued field types of text and i put value cat dog green blue in it

2135074
put	get
in all their examples they seem to put all the logic in the controllers and just use the model to get and set data

2135081
nsurlconnection	uiwebview
i use http but only via nsurlconnection and uiwebview

2135086
execution	exit
the idea is this if is true then your under construction page is show and execution stops at exit

2135095
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
you can use spreadsheet read which will delegation to the appropriate module to read spreadsheet in a variety of formats such as excel openoffice.org and csv

2135096
value	field
at a pure design level it would be most straightforward to tracking each change from any object in a generics table with columns for the object types object primary key primary key of the user that made the change the field named and the old and new value

2135109
hide	next
i would like to be able to create an arrays of field sets hide those field then each time i click on the #createeventform-eventinformation-addelement button it display the next one

2135129
double	int
.when the compiler wants to infer the types of the mt it fails since k which is specified as loops bound has one types probably something like double and loops step implicit the int constants 1 has the types int

2135149
hide	show
the problem is i can t get the divs to spaces accordingly in ie6 while having an effective hide show

2135149
hide	show
the problem is the show hide

2135149
hide	show
this isn t .so bad for this small example but if there are many questions depending on a show hide large gaps start to appear between rows of questions

2135159
execvp	fork
i now call fork and execvp myself

2135159
execvp	fork
i fork and then in the child i close all the server sockets and then call execvp to execute the scripting

2135159
execvp	fork
based on that information i suspect it s something in my fork execvp code below.

2135164
emacs	vim
maybe the emacs plugins for bazaar created it and thats why vim doesn t care

2135172
pointers	stack
the language performs no typechecking of its own and the main stack may interchangeably contains pointers int strings conventionally represented as two cell start and length

2135184

regarding telling it which to use unless you re running vs2010 you can t multi-target silverlight apps .so .when you open a sl project it will be upgrade to whatever versioning you have install

2135200
implements	final
the only way to get any reasonable estimate on project duration is to completely implements and deliver some subset of the final requirements

2135207
put	get
they seem to put all the logic in the controllers and just use the model to get and set data

2135227
reflection.emit	dynamic-proxy
what i would like to do is to have a dynamic-proxy reflection.emit one liner for this

2135227
contains	any
if i wrapped my object in a class containss only the event as sam proposed such wrapper class would not contains any properties which could be accessed through reflection

2135238
datacontract	wcf-rest
how can i log what xml is sent to my wcf-rest service prior to being deserialized into my datacontract class

2135249
google-chrome	firefox
i have firefox ie 7 and 8 and google-chrome

2135256
hide	show
wrap these in divs for hide show

2135256
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
it finds the next elements with the given classname and will hide show that elements

2135257
stderr	stdout
sys.stderr is a file handle to stderr stdout is what printing writes to

2135261
version-control	cvs

you can manage what libs are compiled with your flex project by right-clicking your project folder in flash-builder and selected properties flex buildpath from the left-hand side and finally the libs path tab

2135289
any	set
any advice on where to get started or tutorials which explain how to set up eclipse would be appreciated

2135298
put	get
i ve gone through the firstresource bit of the restlet 1.1 tutorial and put together a web service that handles get .post delete put by subclassing the resource class and overrides the appropriate methods and using a router to attach the subclassing resource classes

2135302
realloc	malloc
the question is about realloc malloc 0 0

2135302
realloc	malloc
would the answer be same for realloc malloc 0 0

2135302
malloc	free
then the call is equivalent to free malloc 0

2135302
realloc	malloc
in this case malloc 0 and realloc malloc 0 0 are not equivalent

2135302
realloc	malloc
this will result in a call like realloc null 0 which would be equivalent to malloc 0 which may or may not return null

2135302
realloc	free
i am not sure if the omission in c99 is an oversight or if it means that in c99 realloc pointers 0 for non- null pointers is not equivalent to free pointers

2135302
realloc	malloc
in the second the malloc call is made twice whereas in the first you re passing a previously allocated pointers to realloc

2135302
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
al.so the return-value from malloc on the lhs hasn t been free d yet .so any other malloc calloc or realloc may not return that value

2135302
realloc	malloc
you won t see possible on the output unless both malloc and realloc fail and return null

2135303
firefox3.6	firefox
i narrowed it down to that firefox 3.5 and ie put the text at the top of the input vertically while firefox3.6 and webkit centering the text vertically

2135310
expression-blend	designer	expression-blend	wpf
.when i visit the microsoft website it talsk much about designer tools expression-blend where can i get web developer perspective vidoes of wpf just drag the control on my form and set the properties for coding

2135333
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is very similar to wpf however and can be used as a flash replacement .so your skills carry over

2135342
debugging	exit
under debugging .when i just hit f5 there is no audio output however the file cursor positioning is still increased in the console windows and the methods exit without exception-handling

2135362
pointers	stack
i need this .so i can scan stack for roots pointers and my current approach is to save stack-pointer .when entering a new thread and .when entering main and then to save it again for each thread .when starting a garbage-collection using a global lock

2135362
pthreads	openmp
but i would really like to have a more secure way of detection the boundaries because it is quite easy for roots to escape this mechanism depending on the thread implementation -- pthreads is easy to manage but not .so with openmp or grand central dispatcher

2135379
python	java
i have been working on and off with java python

2135379
any	set
does java provide any one liner for this rather than creating arraylist set or similar data structure in step and adding elements to it

2135427

embedded-linux	uclinux
that being said i am now a senior engineer for embedded-linux development developing drivers including an android-emulator for a legacy simple microprocessor inside a kernel-module for uclinux on the blackfin platform

2135427
development-environment	platform
these are usually highly platform specific both in terms of target architecture and development-environment but are highly recommended for anything beyond the usual blink-leds-after-button-press examples i am sure you will quickly outgrow

2135446
silverlight	wpf
silverlight uses the same core languages c# vb.net etc and a subset of the .net .so to that extent that knowledge is valuable but both wpf and silverlight use a declarative presentation language called xaml or xml application markup

2135446
silverlight	wpf	expression-blend	designer	expression-blend	silverlight	expression-blend	wpf
from a tooling perspective - expression-blend is really a xaml designer that can target silverlight or wpf applications

2135508
interpreter	runtime
.net is compiled into bytecode and that bytecode is interpreter jitted at runtime

2135514
subclassing	superclass
one thing i haven t tried is to convert the subclassing to overrides the new designated-initializer and see if the places in the code that use these cell now get the deprecated warning from the superclass

2135525
scala	java
i am converting some java nio code to run in scala and i am getting an error because the selectionkey i m calling returns a selectablechannel rather than a datagramchannel which is a subclassing of selectablechannel and an instances of which i declare at the beginning of the code

2135525
scala	java
i did not come to scala from java .so my knowledge of java is actually very limited

2135539
implements	extends
you can extends iterator which will required that you implements the next and hasnext methods

2135539
implements	extends
but you will get more flexibility if you extends iterable which required you implements elements or iterator in 2.8

2135542
postgresql	mysql
.so from what you all are telling me this would be an equivalent mysql table schema of the original postgresql table

2135583
value	field
the modified value are definitely in the object collections and output properly but the sort order isn t working on the modified field

2135596
versioning	upgrade
yes this is possible there are multiple places tmp and document that you can write files to - if you write the downloading file to the document directory the file will be available the next time you launchd the .app and will even persistent between versioning of your .app as it is upgrade

in otherwords it d checked to see if the component is placed on the page temlate and if .so will add the javascript function-calls it depends on to the main scripting block

2135676
progress-bar	progress
the easiest way to do this is making use of backgroundworker handling it s dowork event and report progress to the progress-bar with progresschanged event

2135679
synchronous	.when
your code is basically correct you are trying to do a synchronous call .so the code after the ajax call should be execute only .when the ajax call returns

2135679
hide	show
if you show the loader elements before the ajax call then hide it again in the success handler it should work allright

2135696
bash	zsh
these are sh zsh bash cmd

2135703
conditional	operators
one potential problem with using conditional operators is .when the arguments start to become more complex

2135707
contains	set	contains	elements
also since your body tag doesn t have a height set setting a relative height on the contains elements is kind of meaningless

2135716
macros	vba
the company i work for has an internally developed word2003 vba application that s already about 6.5 mb in size and they re looking to add an additional 200+ macros to it which i m assuming will make it much larger

2135743
silverlight	wpf
wpf xbaps can provide more features than silverlight because xbaps can make use of full .net

2135744
uiscrollview	subviews
i have been trying to implements pinch zoom in-out for photoview a uiimageview instances using cgaffintransformscale planing to use rotation .so can not count on frame for the zoom and will add subviews .so uiscrollview would be more complicated i think

2135744
zooming	touch
2- the touch points one and two keep jumping back and forth a few pixels on every move causing the image to shrink and enlarge successively and rapidly even though overall the effect is one of zooming out or zooming in as the user intended both iphone and simulator

2135830
required	checked
checked if user is authentication on each access to a page that required authentication

2135832

somewhat more concerning it s going to make maintaining the code painful and will quite possibly cause issues .when attempting to use visibility keyword such as private protected public depending on what ide you re using

2135833
shell	bash
at the front is special and normally won t be matched by a wildcard as documented in the bash manpage and common to most unix shell

2135838

still any way to use both an enumerator and an int

2135849
coff	elf
executable file-format see a list here for example coff xcoff elf

2135852

your best bet is probably a shell function instead of an alias if the logic becomes more complex or if you need to add parameters though bash supports alias parameters

2135857
coff	elf
output of final executable in elf or coff format

2135857
coff	elf
note that there s a containers of elf or coff format around the actual executable binary

2135870

remote-debugging	debugging
for debugging i use remote-debugging to attach the ide to the tomcat instances

2135898
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
judging from a quick glance and i could be totally wrong it looks like code that has been obfuscation by an obfuscation tool as to prevent what you are trying to do reverse-engineering

2135905
tcsh	bash
i came also from csh tcsh to bash

2135905
solaris	unix
for scripting i would recommand ksh because it s available on most unixes solaris hp-ux osf 1 the best unix ever

2135905
put	get
sporadicaly you would like to get more then a numbers as return-value from a function or you have some data that you can not put in a simple arrays or you need something that has better capabilities in case of regegs or what ever then i would propose perl

2135930
aggregate	grouping
an aggregate is a grouping of object with the same lifecycle

2135958
shell	bash	bash	ash
this could be the actual bourne shell or dash ash ksh or bash or another one symlinked to sh and as a result running in pthreads mode

as either xml or csv but maybe i m trying to reinvent the wheel and answer to this is hidden in some design pattern i haven t looked into

2136002
google-chrome	firefox
this code perfectly works in google-chrome and even ie but not in firefox

2136004
value	field
if you want to find a .post with a particular custom field value searching on just the .post display on the current page such as index.view or a category view you could do it with chalk in a templates like this

2136004
value	field
unfortunately graffiti cms doesn t have a built-in methods to query the database for post based on a specific custom field value

2136004
value	field
if you want to enable searching for a particular custom field value using search you d need to make a couple tweak to the source code in the graffiti.core.searchindex class

2136004
value	field
in the createdocument methods add the custom field value to the indexed document like this

2136024
where-clause	sql
.so the following where-clause is legal in mysql but not in most other sql databases

the hungarian who originally invented it charles simonyi intended it to convey semantic information using row and col prefixes in code that deals with tables .so that you don t mix up row and column indexes

2136102
frame	width
the sizes i calculated in the above way were incorrect because reduces the width of the labels s frame

2136102
frame	width
the fix was to simply reset the frame width to a known good width before sizing to fit

2136113
silverlight	xbap
i expect in another year or two silverlight will be as good as xbap for web-deployment

2136120
scala	java
i realise this is not java per se but scala a language running on the java virtual-machine permits mixins known as traits in scala

2136125
google-chrome	firefox
if i include jquery 1.4 and wire up a live click event to anything on the page whether it exists or does not this unrelated event handler stops working as expected in ie and continue to work in firefox and google-chrome

2136129
parentheses	braces
ps open parentheses brackets and braces

2136187
registration	login
my website is a content-management-system and like any other cms it has login and registration features

2136225
json	xml
i have a restful wcf service that can return xml json or jsonp depending on the arguments or

2136225
json	xml
.when i ask for xml or json i get something in the right format but the xml isn t serialization as i expect

2136225
json	xml
or do i just have to give in and write separate methods and uri templates that have different responseformat properties for json and xml

2136245
e-commerce	product
i m writting an asp.net-mvc e-commerce .app using nhibernate and i want the end-user to be able to control the order of product category not just have them .appear alphebetically etc.

configuration	installation
assuming your configuration file is in the installation program it sounds like it is .

2136277

.when the .app reaches the last line of the docalculation methods it is most likely throw a null object-reference because it is referencing the private aperture instances that has yet to be initializer

2136308
ienumerator	ienumerable
encapsulate as a composed field inside custom class mydictionary and implements a custom ienumerable and ienumerator or variations thereof for mydictionary or make a methods that implementss handy c# yield-keyword to produce the items .

2136321
any	set
in any event if you don t set up an fk to the person table you data is doomed to data-integrity issues

2136338
javascript	dom
the second example is probably performing those actions before the elements appear in the dom which would make the javascript pointless

2136344
authentication	login
i was wondering if i have some simple authentication system.in place like authlogic how does one use libcurl to .post and put data and even before talking about .posting and putting data how does one login with libcurl and have the server remember or have libcurl remember that it is logged in

2136344
json	xml
if you were to choose would you rather use xml or json to postdata

2136356
contains	any
although not ideal the practical reason for this is that the files you import theoretically don t need to contains any css

2136380
python	ruby
well add me to the list of python programmers who are falling in love with ruby but have a lingering pyaddiction

2136380
python	ruby
like the .post about python getattr i m looking for the ruby equivalent of doing this

2136451
.doc	xls
.doc pdf xls powerpoint jpg

2136454
difference	count
i suspect the significant difference between mutex and semaphore is that count semaphore supports maximum access more than one since mutext only supports at most one access at one time

2136455
svg	vml
svg on standard-based browsers rendering as vml in ie

2136455
svg	vml
.so unless you intend to building static graphing with no event handling svg vml .solutions should be better

2136489
vbscript	jscript
you can write code for asp in any language for which an activescripting engine exists ruby via activeruby but most commonly one would write code in either vbscript or jscript

2136489
vbscript	jscript
which brings us to the third reason the implementation of vbscript and jscript that ship with windows as well as activeruby and all other activescripting engines that i know of are pure interpreter they cannot compile

2136489
environment	execution
php is highly portable across operating systemdd cpu architectures and webserver there is a php implementation for nearly every execution environment from the jvm to the cli to parrot to running natively on pretty much every operating systemd under the sun

2136527
linux	osx
i m developing on a linux platform but would like my program to work on osx and windows

2136560
malloc	free
but perhaps you don t trust malloc and free not to cause fragmentation in the long run or have some other reason to prefer the static buffering solution

2136599
ip-address	proxy
i could even points the application to any ip-address ports available to my machine eg localhost 8888 .so proxy would be fine

2136782
wxwidgets	mfc
frameworks or external libs that don t belong in standards c++ shouldn t be used like wxwidgets qt mfc etc

2136839
any	set
but what just might work if all of the common changes can be integrated into the subclassing user-controls via event handler or if the changes are of the types where you set common properties of your user-controls to particular value is a class that applies the code changes to any user-controls passed to it

2136839
constructor	object
also you can directly apply changes to the control object passed to commonchanges s constructor this way

2136848
python	java	python	ruby	haskell	python	static-typing	subtyping

you could use jython or ironpython to get a python implementation with exactly the same multithreading abilities as java or respectively c# including multiple-processor usage by multiple simultaneous threads

2136964
python	ruby
much better integration with c than python or ruby

2137006

the listbox does not support the context of an edit mode however you can supply an itemtemplate which contains control such as textbox which will allow editing of the underlying data

2139215
attributes	properties
some prefer to not have these sort of checked in their domain model and instead have something like a validation attributes on the properties that can be inspected and execute external from the domain-object by a seperate validation

2139219
any	set
there is an uncountable infinite of potential hash-function for any given set of input and output and if you have no clue better than an upper bound on their computational complexity from the lag you detection you have a very long search ahead of you.

2139225
hash	md5
use the md5 hashing algorithm which generator a 16-character hash and use the 10 th through the 14 th characters

2139261

the ogr shapefile drivers from gdal ogr directly uses implementation of shapelib .so there is no difference actually

2139403
assign	add
.so what i have currently done is add a creationcomplete to each accordion child which will then assign the model reference

2139408
linked-list	arrays
i think it would be better to decouple your interrupt handler from your database access - perhaps have the interrupt handler store the incoming data and timestamp into some sort of in-memory data structure arrays circular linked-list or whatever with appropriate synchronized and have a separate thread that wait until data is available in the data structure and then pumps it to the database

2139415
double-quotes	single-quotes
in this case enclose the this is ok with single-quotes not double-quotes

runs on win linux and solaris

2139486
webforms	asp.net
i mean something like the classic webforms implementation of asp.net where components encapsulating the domain the business and the user-interface logic are sort of put together in a page the .application and they talk to each other through events that are handled by the master .app

2139494
required	checked
if the database knows the minimum client versioning it required and the client knows the minimum database versioning it required it s a simple checked to determine what needs upgrading if anything -- now whether you encapsulate the logic in a stored procedure or in code that s your decision.

2139519
append	input
append some long constants string to the input

2139521

in a after insert or updates or delete for each row triggers find out the parent id and save it in a pl sql collections inside a package

2139552
triggers	insert
then in a after insert or updates or delete triggers statement-level without the for each row part read the parent ids from the pl sql collections and updates the parent table accordingly

2139553
defined	declare
you can declare a variables to be constants you can declare a reference to a constants instances and you can defined all pointers to constants object constants pointers to mutable object and constants pointers to constants elements

2139553
primitive-types	reference-type
conversely in java you can only defined one level of constant-ness final keyword that of the variables instances for primitive-types reference for reference-type but you cannot defined a reference to an immutable elements unless the class itself is immutable

2139556
java-me	lwuit
i am using sun s lwuit libs for making my user-interface in java-me

2139557

in this case the uitabbar control takes care of handling the views .when i selected the button

2139650
display	width
you could set it to display block with css if you want it to take up the whole li width

2139655
aptana	pydev
in aptana - preferences - pydev - interpreter - pythonrun

2139656
ftpwebrequest	ftp
the thing i have found using this ftp via ftpwebrequest is it is inherently a lot slower since it is using the http protocols over ports 80 and it drive me crazy because filezilla can do it a lot quicker obviously using ftp protocols over ports 20 21

2139663
hash	md5
which is enough for the prefixed searches and add another column to store the md5 hash which would ensure uniqueness

2139672
registration	login	nsmutableurlrequest	nsurlrequest
checkout the documentation for nsurlrequest and nsmutableurlrequest you can use it to make a .post request to your login and registration pages just like a web browser

2139672

as far as display the result to the user you ll have to figure out a way to either parsing the returned html bad idea or modify your cms to return json or xml to iphone request better idea

2139681
listbox	textbox	textchanged	textbox
you could have a textchanged event on the textbox and after the text changes if there are at least 3 characters you spawn your pop-up with the listbox of results and the listbox has its selectionchanged event set to set the text of the textbox and kill its parent pop-up

2139681
listbox	textbox
textbox and a listbox

2139684

2139685
emacs	vim
make dummy my-package-vim-mode and my-package-emacs-mode rpms that required vim and required emacs respectively and provides my-package-text-editor then have your package required my-package-text-editor

2139695
internet-explorer	quirks-mode
internet-explorer 7 and 6 don t have a real non-quirks-mode it is similar to the limited quirks-mode of the other browsers

2139697
contains	set
i am not 100 sure if this will work or validation but you could try to set the contains rows and columns to visibility hidden

2139703
factors	matrix
after a satisfactorsy rotation the rotated factors loading matrix l will have the same ability to represent the correlation matrix and it can be used as the factors loading matrix instead of the unrotated matrix l

2139703
factors	matrix
the purpose of rotation is to make the rotated factors loading matrix have some desirable properties

2139703
factors	matrix
one of the methods used is to rotate the factors loading matrix such that the rotated matrix will have a simple structure

2139703
factors	matrix
each row of the factors matrix should contains at least one zero

2139703
factors	matrix
if there are m common factorss each column of the factors matrix should have at least m zero

2139703
factors	matrix
for every pair of columns in the factors matrix there should be several variables for which entries approach zero in the one column but not in the other

2139703
factors	matrix
for every pair of columns in the factors matrix a large proportion of the variables should have entries approaching zero in both columns .when there are four or more factorss

2139703
factors	matrix
for every pair of columns in the factors matrix there should be only a small numbers of variables with nonzero entries in both columns

2139703
versioning	upgrade
a new versioning if i would ever tried to upgrade it would accept a 3d matrix a set of 2d matrix as an arguments and the algorithm should return the one that better fits the above criterion

2139703
factors	matrix
p.s.2 from the same book a test of successful factors analysis is the extent to which it can reproduce the original corr matrix

2139741
firefox	opera
it doesn t work on firefox however someone told me it works on opera

2139747

scientific-notation	numeric	scientific-notation	digits	numeric	digits
.when an item is numeric and longer than 17 digits it s show in scientific-notation

2139818
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
if you re wrong about your assumption about the types your program will fail immediately and you ll be able to see the cause of failure immediately rather than waiting for a nullreferenceexception or argumentnullexception or even a logical error sometime in the future

2139826
apache-config	.htaccess
if you want to do this with .htaccess or in apache-config you can use apache module mod_headers like this

2139827
parentheses	keyword
the direct cast needs a pair of parentheses more than the as keyword

2139833
callback	methods
callback are often delegation to methods that are called .when the specific operation has completed or performs a sub-action

here s an example also with debugging messages to help trace the execution

2139862
google-chrome	firefox
thanks gazler although there was no problem with actual html and firefox error console didn t show any messages i checked developers tools in google-chrome and it said that div tag was inside table body which apparently caused all the troubles

2139877
put	get
however the issue is for example if users input data with say more than 1 whitespace or if they put some of the text in a newline etc the pattern does not get picked up because it doesn t exactly match the pattern set

2139883
attributes	properties
inorder to bind correctly i believe you can use the attributes to overrides the binder prefix which by default looks at the named of the properties on your action methods in this case collections

2139921
jquery	.post
i would recommend using jquery s .post function or a similar ajax function

2139923
arrays	map
if you don t want to use a map for whatever reason for example you just want to use the arrays you set up at compile-time you can also use a functor in combinations with

2139945
put	get
i think once you get the range it fixed up the html but .when you put it back in it could cause problems

2139968
value	field
in general account systemd often have data field that are not viewable by the user and that are generator through default value or in a way that the user doesn t see them

2139973

i d go with python of the given options although perl and ruby are good options too if you know them

2139979
viewdidappear	viewdidload
i have tried subclassing the uitableviewcontroller and looking at events such as viewdidload and viewdidappear unfortunatly also in these events the cell aren t draw yet

2139979
frame	width
i thought to accomplish this by looping through all the cell with cellforrow but although it successfully returns the cell the content is not draw yet meaning the frame remains with a width of zero

2139983
directory	folder
basically i m creating a plugins that is designed using the qtbrowserplugins class and i am trying to make my browser which is programmeed using qtwebkit to search for the plugins in a folder specified by me as i don t want the plugins to be stored in the mozilla firefox pluginss directory or the standards pluginss directory

2139985
triggers	insert
is it possible to triggers event .when there is insert updates operation on specific columns instead of the whole table

2140022
value	field
other field in this class which are static readonly too use this value to as a base to their value

2140025
constructor	object
how come i can t initializer an object of types foo with above constructor

2140025
constructor	object
how can i defined a constructor that will accept std vectors of object with the types in bar

2140045
double-quotes	single-quotes
if that works it s because html attributes should be bounded by double-quotes not single-quotes

2140046
constructor	private
then in your static constructor code initializer the private variables as you need

2140057
expression	evaluation
i need to end up with a list of expression e1 e2 e3 etc followed by and or operators .so that evaluation the list from left to right yield the same logical boolean answer

2140057
binary-tree	tree
i was thinking put it in a binary-tree and then navigate the tree postfix or something like that but that doesn t seem right to be

2140092
shutdown	restart
a user or a program shutdown restart the computer

2140092
windows-vista	windows
i need to support windows-vista and windows 7

2140093

2140120
h.264	mp4
i had to install an mp4 muxer demuxer to even get the h.264 files to play and then they consumed 40 - 50 cpu

2140126
value	field	show	next
for example if i enter a value in any dynedit field and click next on the controllers the page does correctly show the next page of recording but the dynedit column still show the same edited value of the previous page

2140131
button	popup
i m trying to create a modal view which popup .when the user presses a button

2140137
hash	md5
take for example the md5 hash string -- it has 128 bits that means 2 128 different hash can be generator

2140137
hash	md5
even taking into account the birthday paradox it is highly unlikely that a string which isn t the actual passwd can be found to generator the hash value of course md5 has been found insecure but that s another issue md5 is just an example

2140152
response	timeout
almost everytime i restart the his hip service we have a very slow response time and thus a timeout in cics

2140191
implements	extends
.when you extends the mapview there are only a few methods that you need to implements and they are really straight forwarding

2140196
subclassing	superclass
alternatively if you want to allow subclassing you should test only for properties that are in the superclass

2140224
value	field
inside this methods you can checked .when is the value of the radio box and checked other field value based on that information

2140229
arrays	map
one thing to speed things up a little without doing sql would be to put firstname middlename lastname into one lowercase string and put that into a new map that is referencing the arrays index

2140232
macros	vba
by default macros security is enabled in access and none of your vba code will run

2140241
dictionary	map
.so if at all possible depending on the size having a huge memory map hashtable dictionary with just key the actual words may be an option and would be quick as lightning

this is most often done by using some sort of prepare statement where your parameters are inject via a mechanism that prevents arbitrary sql from being execute

2140302
macros	vba
i m doing this well something very similar right now but using excel and vba macros

2140302
selected	cell	selected	button
i just have to click a button to generator the appropriate code for the selected cell then copy-paste to the ide

2140320
imageview	textview
i would think it wouldn t be that difficult to get a horizontally centered imageview with a horizontally centered textview below it then just tweak the image dimension and the text size till they look just like other icons on the home screens

2140320
switching	screens
as for the problem you are seeing .when you switching to landscape view on your home screens you will need to provide a landscape versioning of your layout xml file tweaked to display correctly in landscape mode

2140322
llvm	gcc
both the msp430 and the arm family have gcc solutions as well as it is easy to use building and use llvm with its clang llvm has a 64bit problem with its gcc front end

2140322
put	get
i have spent some time recently fiddling with an opencore msp430 which you could put in an fpga and get more memory and speed and features if you like could even add usb if you wanted

2140359

shutdown	restart
note that all this will only solve the shutdown problem restart will involve nodes manager which is very likely not configure

2140423
configuration	environment
which configuration is .applied is controlled by the environment variables in your .app s .htaccess

2140424
interlocked	atomicity
this doesn t need volatile in fact you d get a warning if you had it because interlocked already ensures an atomicity updates

2140435
memmove	memcpy
type-safe alternative to memcpy for arrays and containers could be std copy in - it may be implements in terms of memmove if all involved types satisfy certain requirements otherwise it performs assignments - with some classes you can break certain invariants if you bypass their public interface and just go and move copy them around in memory for example i suppose any class with a non-trivial copy-constructor is going to misbehave if you make copies of it with memcpy

2140435
iostream	boost
type-safe alternative to c i o routines are iostream and if you want the benefits of the format string boost format

2140442
value	field
i want to whenever a nodes types with that cck field is added grab the value of that field then add it to a variables value i have in my variabless table

once the animation is complete hide that temporary windows and show the real windows

2140533
any	set
i have set up these tables and i can change them any time

2140552
groovy	java
as you probably already know you can use any java libs with groovy grails .so there s nothing you can do in java that you can t do in groovy

2140552
groovy	java
although java is considerable faster than groovy this doesn t necessarily mean your .app will be faster if written in java as the bottleneck could likely be the database rather than code execution

2140553
show	next
you could use a datagridview which show the file namedd in one column and has a textbox in the next column which allows you to enter the new file named

2140557
numeric	nan	.when	ready
if you ready to sacrifice the performance of the application you can create a wrapper for double or other numeric object you want to use and throw exception-handling .when nan is set

2140560

changing the bottom -20px to 0px and assign padding 50px for the elements contains the content .dokuwiki .clearfix #wrap body html

2140560
google-chrome	safari
trying google-chrome for mac or safari mac

2140560
contains	elements
changing the background colors of the elements contains content to none or transparency

2140560
contains	elements
changing the z-index of the elements contains content to less than z-index for #print-footer

2140564
app-bundle	info.plist
the the info.plist for application at null suggest that xcode cannot locate the info.plist file in the app-bundle

2140577
response	timeout
the calling asp.net thread will have to wait until a response is written back to the http context or until a timeout occurs

2140577
.when	ready
have your client poll that table to see .when a result is ready possibly via ajax

2140613

i like teja s idea of using a view for table4 if that works that table does not contains any data not in table1 table2 or table3

2140637
append	input
i need to write an ant target that append together comma-delimited a list of .jar file named from a folder into a variables which is later used as input to an outside utility

2140653
32-bit	64bit
no this cannot work as a runtime checked since is fixed at compile-time at the points where you choose to compile your program as either 32-bit or 64bit and once compiled the checked will have the same fixed result regardless of which platform you are running it on

2140653
32-bit	64bit
however since a 64bit program cannot run on a 32-bit platform you will find that your checked works correctly without modification as a compile-time checked

2140653
32-bit	64bit
it will fail to run on 32-bit windows at all .so there will be no chance you accidentally use the 64bit api on a 32-bit versioning of windows

2140653
32-bit	64bit	compatibility	platform
if you compile your program in 32-bit mode your program will correctly use the 32-bit apis which will work on a 64bit windows platform in 32-bit compatibility mode and will obviously work on a 32-bit platform

2140653
32-bit	64bit
if you really want to access 64bit apis from a 32-bit program i daresay there are apis to do it but i m not sure that you would want to

2140657
ironpython	ironruby
vbx was one of the four language implementation that were originally driving the design of the dlr the other three being ironpython from which the dlr was extraction in the first place ironruby and managed javascript

2140681
python	perl
the code below sorry perl not python edits your source files in-place

2140692

in addition one can use iswow64process to checked whether you re a 32-bit process running under the wow64 emulation on a 64bit windows machine

2140709
annotations	mapping
i m migrating to using hibernate annotations for mapping .so i m moving to hibernatetools to generator the schema

it would be possible to use a .bat file -- or bash or another flavor of shell scripting -- to do everything ant can do i believe

2140717
.war	jar
package a jar zip or .war properly

2140739
oracle	mysql
mysql will gracefully write the broken character into the table - maybe oracle is more strict

2140753
javascript	dom
also just keep in mind that most javascript memory-leaks come from circular references between dom object and javascript-object not being broken .when the dom object is unloaded

2140791
compare-and-swap	atomicity
just before the actual atomicity compare-and-swap but after the function arguments are determined the other thread release the lock - lock becomes false

2140796
any	set
then i found vtkpolyline but there doesn t seem to be any add insert or set function for this

2140816
google-chrome	safari
ie google-chrome and safari have built-in profiling in the web development tools that ship with the browser

2140817
automake	gnu
i m not using it but my understanding is that the bsd make is a make program + a standard-library of templates more or less the equivalent of gnu make + automake and perhaps autoconf

2140819
maven-assembly-plugin	maven
maven assemblies first the maven-assembly-plugin site then chapter 8 of maven the complete reference for some heavy almost too heavy details

looking at this whole process now and the other answers i think this is actually a trie structure assuming the character searched for is the root of a tree as another poster had suggested

2140949
jquery	dojo
although form the way you describe your app-id have to recommend using dojo instead as much as i adore jquery

2140969
firefox	safari

push	pull
also once this is setup if i push pull to my own remote will the external remain intact

in standards return-value-optimization your return statement is a call to an object s constructor which tells the compiler to eliminate the temporary value not necessarily the copy operation

2141000
configuration	environment
by the way my environment configuration is

2141007
ruby-on-rails	django
therefore i am looking for something pretty similar to what you have in ruby-on-rails or django python

2141007

i could make my model without extends them from codeigniter s model class and then using the regular php5 constructor __construct instead of function car but problem in this case is how i access to the db object to make querys using the codeigniter s activerecord

2141014
remote-server	tunnel
the client uses ssh to log on the remote-server and remotely runs the svn cmd in that tunnel

problem is even thou i am able to connect with tcp client messages trying to setup udp n is never display

2141040
custom-events	dom-events
sometimes dom-events are propagated through a component .when it makes sense like the various click events you can handle for a grid for example but usually component events are custom-events that are specific to the functionality of the component

2141047
jquery	dojo
if you like django for the server-side bits of your front-end consider dojango -- it helps integrated django on the server side with the dojo javascript toolkit on the browser side of things dojo is not quite as popular as jquery nevertheless it s just about as powerful and some of us prefer it for architectural and stylistic reasons

2141067
value	field
it returns the value of first field of 7th row

2141072
.when	ready

ubuntu	linux
i have a c++ code that runs perfect on my linux machine ubuntu karmic

2141109
profiling	trace
you might be able to tell by running a trace in sql profiling on the database - the sql stmtcompleted event is probably the one to monitor - if the application does a series of insert into multiple tables you should see them go through in profiling

2141111
http	ssl
my task is to make it secure using http ssl or tsl

2141113
digits	zero
in your first example we count 6 zero from the backend .so we could safely divide by 10 6+4 to get not more than 4 fractions digits which is more than we actually need

2141115
profiling	trace
you can use sql profiling to trace sql queries

2141115
triggers	insert
also use can use metadata or sql tools to get list of triggers which could make a lot of actions on simple insert

2141137
triggers	insert
use triggers to create the row .when an insert is done on your summary table in the second table

2141150
getter	setter
yes you are right this would be a bug if your setter getter were serializing deserializing the object

2141150
getter	setter
if you had written your setter getter something like this you would have a bug

2141151
version-control	sync	version-control	git

2141223
frame	width	height	frame
instead of reacting to a resizeevent which will fire every frame during a resize if you hit maximize and it takes 3 frame for the component to redraw from widh ehight 0 to width height maxvalue then the resize event will fire three time you could watch the properties of width and height

2141268
google-chrome	safari
the hover background-color of the rightmost list item about us is cut off at the very right edges of the text seemingly only in webkit tested safari and google-chrome in windows-xp

2141291
contains	elements
a list contains all the elements i want to sort obviously in an unssorted fashion

2141307
realloc	memset
write your own function say reallocz that accepts the current size as a parameter and call realloc and memset for you

2141312
httphandler	httpmodule
note that i say practical way you could write an httphandler or httpmodule that handles all of the integration but you d be reinventing the wheel

2141319
http	ssl
my task is to make it secure using http ssl or tsl

2141322
buffering	streaming
also there is storing the data into a buffering then using the mysql c++ connector streaming to load the data into the database

2141324
while-loop	arrays
in c++ arrays are indexed from 0 .so you need to make sure it stores the character in s 0 on the first pass-through your while-loop in s 1 on the second pass-through and .so on

2141329
asp.net-mvc	wcf
you can see some more examples here related to some asp.net-mvc and wcf stuff

my php sucks but it d be something like this in perl

2141355
getter	setter
date setter and getter

fadeout	fadein
fadein and fadeout slidedown etc - all these are nice but animate is the granddady of them all

2141455
toggleclass	addclass	toggleclass	removeclass	removeclass	addclass
if you don t need to animate properties only change them it s much cleaner to defined css classes and use addclass and removeclass or toggleclass

2141463
updating	updates
but if the updates actually required loading each object process the data and then updating them you can use the orm or write your own sql query and run updates queries on each of the process data the overheads completely depends on the code logic

you will then have to have your project kick up with iis instead of cassini which takes a little bit of work but i think it will solve the problem with oracle at least

2141511
buffering	streaming
by reading into the c++ i o streaming you can set the size of the read buffering or have it use your own buffering

2141521
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i used the affirma.threesharp libs for s3 access and did it with webforms i m sure it wouldn t be too much different with asp.net-mvc

value	field
the problem with option numbers one is that dbnull field are throw exception-handling as the cast is failing even with nullable as string ant the problem with numbers two is that it s not preserving null value the convert.tostring dbnull yield a string.empty and i can t use them with enums too

2141589
sql-server	postgresql
we are still pretty new to postgresql and came from microsoft sql-server

2141987
selected	listbox
one way i managed to achieve this was replacing my itemscontrol by a listbox but this caused several issues it always showed a scrollbar even though i disabled it it wouldn t catch focus .when my pop-up was open but only .when i explicit selected the item in my listbox .when i enabled the overridesdefaultstyle properties the contents of the listbox wouldn t show up at all i had to re-theme the listbox control to match my user-controls layout.

any	set
if the passwd is valid the created user object will be null and the membershipcreatestatus will be set to invalidpasswd or any other creation status

derived-class	base-class
how can i prevent that exception-handling and how can i pass an arrays of derived-class to a function that suppose to get a base-class arrays

2142612
textmate	emacs
for instances if you want 4 spaces per tab then you need to make sure that emacs and textmate are both set up to use 4 spaces per tab

2142625
revision	updates
.so this means you should usually use a specific revision numbers unless you re the only committer and are therefore certain that nobody checked in changes after your last updates

2142648
contains	any
note the src does not contains any information about the image.

2142650
constructor	object
i am passing an object into the constructor of another object

2142650
any	set
in the init methods i need to loops through display s properties and set any of disabilitypaymentaddentity properties of the same named to value in the predisplay

2142656
selected	button
the mirror does not have the file yet anymore by just hitting the back button they can conveniently selected a different one and try again

2142662
udp	tcp
if udp ends up being a bit too unreliable it does not guarantee the data will arrive where it is sent you could also try tcp connections

2142662
udp	tcp
with udp you re looking at just about 10 lines-of-code to send and receive data with tcp is a bit more but more reliable

2142662
udp	tcp
then send that data via tcp or udp

2142667
value	field
what is the types value for a blob field types in yml

2142677
processor	cpu
the vmr7 is the least processor intensive 6 - 7 cpu but worst quality the evr 8 - 12 cpu is a little more efficient than the vmr9 12 - 13 cpu however they both look similar

2142679
selected	button
.so my question is if i already have the excel file opened in 2007 and i already have the file named of the open file stored in a variables programatically how can i mimic the action of going up to the office button in the upper right and selected save-as and then selected excel 97-2003 workbook

2142689
perforce	git
i ve looked into git hooks and there doesn t seem to be one that .when i commit a file to the git-repo it automatically opens the file for edit in perforce .so the perforce server knows about the changes

2142689
perforce	git
let alone anything to do with moving the file around which git recognizes automatically but perforce needs to be specifically told about

2142689
git-repo	repo
i had a few people say they were successfully using a git-repo under the covers of another version-control repo perforce or otherwise

2142691
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you would then respond to your uiimageview s touches in each object s touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended methods

2142699
udp	tcp
you will likely want to use tcp or udp directly and send recieve the raw bytes

2142702
any	set
i definitely agree that jdee is more involved getting set up i spent a good amount of time just getting settings situated to my liking and never got them completely where i wanted but in the end it seemed worth it to me as i felt immensely more productive over using eclipse -- mainly because i didn t find myself click all over the damn screens like i typically do in just about any standards java ide that s used these days

2142702
put	get
if anything the productivity you get depends on how much effort your willing to put in to learning the tools which goes for just about any ide but it did fit my styles of software development better than eclipse

2142703
google-chrome	firefox
in both ie7 and firefox but not google-chrome or ie6 the layout of this page is very odd

2142708
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited	friend-function	derived-class
if a class derived is inherited privately from a class base and the derived-class has a friend-function f .so what members can f access from derived-class and base-class

2142708
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
i understand that if a class is inherited privately from the base-class everything is private in the derived-class

2142710
put	get
get a solid-state drive and put your os and development tools on it

2142724
javascript	dom
the javascript is probably manipulating the dom and adding an image

2142749
xlutils	xlwt
there is a set of cross platform python utilities - called xlrd xlwt and xlutils - for reading writing excel files

2142753
inlining	inline
in addition to preventing the compiler from inlining very small methods simple properties accessor are inline very often the lookup takes a couple of cycles

2142755
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i m new at this but it works in firefox and yet break in google-chrome and safari

2142766
value	field
can you even set the value of a input-type-file field

2142769
any	set
in your connection-string set pooling true or remove any reference to pooling

2142770
datagrid	textbox
also ultimately that textbox needs to be within a wpf datagrid

2142776
private-members	private	protected	public
a friend of derived can access exactly what derived itself can - that is any member of derived and any public or protected member of any base-class or of any public or protected grand-parent class but not any private-members of base-classes or members of private grand-parent classes

2142780
design-principles	principles
today i saw a job description that required significant experience coding in c++ and a thorough grounding in structured design-principles .so i thought about what these principles are

2142789
web-applications	web-services
sometimes i want to manually test my web-applications either desktop applications calling web-services or website or ria to see how they behave with low speed internet-connection 56 kbps for example

2142803
contains	set
given the recording id 27 return a result set that contains first item second item third item

2142819
triggers	insert
i m trying to make a triggers in oracle using oracle sql developer i would checked that the dates entered as start date reservation to reservation date or date of a service charge will be equals to or greater than the current date is insert in the recording

2142823
e-commerce	product
as such if one tends to use everywhere i can do anything via get that i could via .post which means setting up tags on my malicious site that cause users logged into your e-commerce module to purchase product silently or i can cause them to click on links that will result in dangerous actions or the revelation of sensitive information probably to me

2142823
json	xml
for example i have a web service which can return response in url-encoding xml or json

2142823
postdata	request
.when checked the content of the format parameter it could be sent via query-string or a postdata depending on a multitude of factors not the least of which being whether or not the calling applications wants format json mixed in with its request

2142826
duplicates	sorted
both vectors are sorted and there are no duplicates in each vector

2142834
python	java	python	ruby
nor in higher languages like ruby python java since gc prevents predictable destructor of object

2142843
default	reset
i d like to allow users to reset the default in the iphone s settings for my .app

2142843
default	reset
at the bottom of the list there d be some kind of option to reset or default or whatever

2142844
json	xml
json or xml has worked best for me in the past

2142850
.when	ready
to switching to linq-to-sql after the project had already begun and .when not everyone was ready was probably a mistake yes

2142854
stderr	stdout
note that fds 0 stdin 1 stdout 2 stderr by default but these can of course be re-directed or closed typically if you are a daemons you close your file descriptors and re-open the ones you want

2142876
triggers	insert
have a look at some help on triggers as advised above and then maybe look at the special insert and deleted tables created and used by triggers

2142876
triggers	insert
two special tables are used in triggers statements the deleted table and the insert table

2142876
triggers	insert
every row that is insert or deleted via a triggers is done via these tables i believe

2142889
dhcp	arp
if you are trying to get the mac s and ip s it would be better to use the arp -s cmd instead of looking at the dhcp lease file

2142898
simplemodal	jquery
i m using eric martin s sweet simplemodal jquery plugins

2142913
updating	updates
if you do de-normalise this you have to be very careful with locking .so that before insert updating deleting any child recordinging the parent recording is locked execute your changes selected all the child recordinging updates the parent then commit to release the locks

2142916
keyboard	mouse
everything done with the mouse only extra actions like keyboard keypress not required

2142924
proxy-server	apache
our glassfish server is fronted by an apache proxy-server

2142946
value	field
third way passing to another class or field that must be static and then master load it s value

2142952
vb.net	vba
you could create a com component in your vb.net .app that you can call from vba and write to your .application s console

2142955
firefox	safari
is there a way to communication with usb devices within regular browser firefox safari ie8 etc

2142958
default	reset
you could have the reset setting labeled something like at next launchd reset all to default or the like

2142988
attributes	properties
the copylocal attributes in properties windows tells if the assembly will be copy-paste or not

2142991
javascript	dom
instead of saving a local copy of the html file you should save a local copy of the javascript file to see how exactly it s adding the image to the html file s dom

2142997
json	xml
while there is a plist gem for ruby json or raw xml are much more popular outside the apple world

2143014
32-bit	64bit
will hold a 32-bit numbers nicely on all 32-bit and 64bit systemd

2143015
json	xml
you could create your own persistent service that can handle this situation either by supporting conversioning of the old workflow into the new workflow or something more abstract like a persistent service that serialization as xml json something that might more easily support deserialization of one versioning as another versioning

2143019
pixels	line
but also i need the intersection between two line the common pixels in both line to be identified and also to be painted in other color than the line

2143019
pixels	line
i ve been trying with regions and graphicpaths but i can t find the way to identify the common pixels insersection between two line

2143034
primitive	int
none of that is present in a primitive and by making it present you would a break a lot of c code that assumes an int is 8 bytes only and b make programs take up a lot more memory

2143037
display	width
the header s datacontext is set in code and the named and data string properties are display correctly using the initial width of the datagrid like this

2143079
nsmutablearray	nsarray
the complier will let you assign a nsarray to an nsmutablearray but if you try to send it nsmutablearray specific messages it may crash

2143087
getter	setter
i ve read in the eclipse help that it is possible to delete getter and setter together with a field

2143087
getter	setter
in the eclipse help file the following is written .when you delete a field from within a view eclipse can propose deleting its getter and setter methods

2143087
getter	setter
if you use a named prefix or suffix for field be sure to specify this in the java code styles preferences page. the way i understand it eclipse should somehow ask me if i want to delete the getter and setter methods for a field that i just removed without any special configuration

2143090
debian	linux	linux	unix	linux	bsd	unix	bsd	manpage	bsd
it does a little more and comes from bsd or more exactly at t unix as the manpage says .so if you are on linux you may need to install an additional package on debian its in bsdmainutils .

2143091
hide	show
that normally has the icons to show hide the keypad

2143091
windows-mobile	windows-ce
i ve noticed that visual-studio prompt for the target-platform either windows-ce or windows-mobile .when creating a new smart-device project

2143111
basic	vba
generally speaking i found that automating excel with vba was not too hard once you understood the basic

2143111
put	get
finally i wish i could recommend a book to get you started but alas i ve never considered trying this .so i ve never put anytime in researching this

2143116
selected	cell
i want to selected all rows from table 1 and get as the last cell in each row the numbers of rows with the corresponding value in table 3

2143137
primitive	int
int is a primitive in c++ much like c#

2143139
decimal-point	zero
however as others have said trim the trailing zero and decimal-point before converting

2143157
32-bit	64bit
it seems to work great under win7 64bit and linux 32-bit but seems to behave strangely under win 7 32-bit

2143157
32-bit	64bit
the random numbers it returns is 32-bit but there s a temporary value used internally that s supposed to be 64bit and it s declare

2143164
mongodb	schema
the other thing i d recommend especially since you mentioned knowing how to normalize a schema is not to think of mongodb as a database for now

2143165
any	set
if you expect the user to jump to any arbitrary graphing then you may want to implements the menu hierarchy as a set of sidebar or pulldown menus .so the total navigation effort is minimize

2143171
getter	setter
little off topic but get rid of all your getter setter

2143182
authentication	login
can someone points me in the directions of a good java libs to use to handle basic user login authentication

2143188
dictionary	map
map as dictionary and you get your datastructure

2143189
configuration	environment
configuration environment test.rb

2143189
configuration	environment
configuration environment cucumber.rb

2143200
callback	methods
.when i set the properties in the viewmodel it correctly triggers the propertieschanged callback methods in this class which then call the scrolltoverticaloffset methods for the scrollviewer but the scrollviewer still doesn t scroll

2143202
png	gif
i need a preg_match syntax or something similar to extraction jpg or png or gif urls from a mixed text and put them in an arrays or at last store the first url

2143202
png	gif
maybe some syntax which searchs for strings that are beginning with http and ending with jpg png gif

2143216
keyboard	hid
if your cc and barcode scanners work as hid devices basically keyboard emulation yes you can and i have seen it done

2143219
if-statement	loops
as if it wasn t hard enough to maintain sqls that were created using stringbuilder now it s even worse that the sqls are construct dynamically using many if-statement and loops

2143225
configuration	logging
if you don t want to do anything with the error such as logging you d better simply use the configuration file

2143227
connection-pooling	pool
if you have connection-pooling enabled which is normally the default connection behavior the connection will only be returned to the connection pool not release and it will still show as a connection .so you would have to clear the connection pool

2143237
linux	unix
in a unix shell like in linux you ll need to escape the asterisk

2143250
selected	checkbox
i am using vb.net and have 50 checkbox that shall show up from the database data depending on the selected value of the previous dropdownlistfor

2143252
stderr	stdout
svn command-line errors go to stderr not stdout which is why you aren t able to see them

2143252
stderr	stdout
what you want to do is redirect stderr to stdout and then to determine the cause of the error

2143252
stderr	stdout
this is not ideal because it mixes stderr with stdout .when it would otherwise be unnecessary but i don t know of another way to get the desired output in this case

2143259
implements	abstract
i would abstract the intent .so that it doesn t really matter how it s implements or how the .source code is organised

2143265
subclassing	superclass
this will call the - id initwithframe from your subclassing instead of the superclass and perform your custom code

2143265
subclassing	superclass
this also send the call to your subclassing instead of to the superclass

2143270
toolchain	avr-gcc
i would suggest avr simply because it is supported by the free avr-gcc toolchain

2143271
double-quotes	single-quotes
this says that inside of the single-quotes you can have either double-quotes or a non-quote character

2143272
qabstracttablemodel	qmap
i have a class which inherited qabstracttablemodel and holds some complex struct in a qmap

2143300
protected	public
i m maintaining a ruby-on-rails .app that has content in the public folder that will now need to be protected by a login

2143303
margins	padding
try to remove the marginss and padding on your sidebar classes and have a inside wrapper with the margins and padding set to it

2143303
margins	padding
browsers have a different way of rendering margins and padding to elements

2143315
typedef	struct
edit i was experiencing the above extraneous old-style parameter list error because i was using the typedef named stack rather than using the struct keyword with stack to defined it was the structure i am currently defining

2143324
textview	spinner
as an example say i have an edittext input1 and a spinner input2 which give results in a textview named output1

2143345
uitableview	uiview
you will have to embed the uitableview in a uiview alongwith another view which you are referring to as header section

2143354
memset	malloc
i want to construct read malloc and memset my hashtable in c

2143368
implements	final
under this scenario you might well end up with implements code say half way through the sprint without any tests implements unit tests during this design stage would add significant effort and the tests would likely be throw away a few time until the final design is settled upon

2143371
windows	ms-dos
it is made from an excel workbook i tried saving in all csv formats windows ms-dos and comma delimited list i even tried saving in 2 txt file-format windows ms-dos

2143377
put	get
in addition to the security problems and wtfs caused by cookies and environment variabless in the request variables don t get me started on global consider what might happen in the future if php started natively supporting other methods such as put and delete

2143386
value	field
use strsplit with a tab character to get field value

2143388
mouseover	mouseout
.when i mouseout of the floating box and on to canada it will triggers the mouseover event for canada

2143388
mouseover	mouseout
however if i mouseover the floating box again the swf doesn t receive the mouseout event .so canada stays highlight

2143388
mouseleave	mouseover
that way you can simulate the mouseleave event to reset the country highlight and popup then .when the mouseleave the floating box you can checked to see if the mouse is over a country and perform the mouseover event normally

2143405
gridview	listview
this listview uses a gridview with two columns each templates appropriately one column is the caption just a labels and the other column is the control

2143423
stderr	stdout
just what you need is to make sure you re not insert weird data to the scripting to avoid any break and to redirect stderr to stdout to avoid to have errors and not to be able to see them

2143434
debugging	trace
in those cases where it is safe it is usually best to at least spit out some information about it in the warn debugging or trace log

2143434
where-clause	sql
they are designed to make the program or the current operation terminate to prevent unpredictable behavior like trying to load all of the recording in your the database because you weren t able to construct the where-clause for your sql statement. .when you catch an unknown exception-handling you are concealing the mistake from your currently-running code and making it possible for the code to behave unexpectedly instead of just terminating

2143441
tcsh	zsh
i m quite certain you could easily google other good alternatives such as zsh or tcsh

2143470
primitive	int
as others i saying can t be done since int is a primitive types

2143472
twitter	tweets
you can see the pattern and having looked at the twitter api documentation on twitter.com you can add methods to tweets and a bunch of other stuff

2143476
double	int
i need to cast a double to an int in java but the numerical value must always round down

2143478
windows-vista	windows
you are also prevented in windows-vista and later from display user-interface windows from a windows service

2143487
instances	private
in that case you should use an instances of random.random to get a private random numbers generator

2143489
qdatastream	qmap
on the receiving end you can get your data structure qmap if that s what you want to use back out of the qdatastream

2143502
double	int
casting a double to an int does not round it ll discard the fractions part

2143518
constructor	object
i consider it bad to do a blocking connect in a constructor because the blocking nature is not something one typically expects from constructing an object

2143539
private-members	constructor
i would go with the second one since i believe that the constructor should not do any other thing than initializer the private-members

2143550
primitive	int
more general than the fact that int is primitive is this int is a scalar types while classes are aggregate typess

2143551
attributes	properties
i have look at all the xml attributes i can decorator the properties with and have not had any success with this

2143551
object-reference	instances
using this and the default you get an exception-handling object-reference not set to an instances of an object due to the collections being null

2143556
constructor	private	instances	private
if you rely on instances being connect already make the constructor private and write a static factory-method to get pre-connect instances

2143572
system-shutdown	process
the more complicated solutions like cryopid are really only needed if you want the stopped process to be able to survive a system-shutdown restart - it doesn t sound like you need that

2143579
removeclass	addclass
it s the addclass removeclass extends functions that i think are the problem but i can t seem to successfully convert it to work with jquery v1.3.2

2143587
.when	ready
just the fact that they have wired it up is good enough to go ahead and connect option 1 or the fact they should have the option to call connect .when they are good and ready option 2

2143598
groovy	gsp
i m new to grails groovy and gsp

2143605
mit-scheme	gambit
there is gambit scheme mit-scheme plt scheme chicken scheme bigloo larceny ..

2143605
scheme	lisp
yet there s not to my knowledge a single popular scheme lisp on llvm even though llvm provides lots of nice things like

2143605
scheme	lisp
.so why is it that there isn t a good scheme lisp on llvm

2143606
contains	set
the templates class would actually contains less code to assign get and set data

2143646
push	pull
you can now replace foo-clean .hg hgrc with foo .hg hgrc inorder to preserve your repository-local settings such as the default push pull path

2143664
getter	setter	prototyping	methodology
as far as i know there is no way to use the old prototyping methodology for getter setter infact i believe the grand total of internal flex sdk classes that use any types of prototyping is 0

2143664
getter	setter
in any case getter setter aren t available in the prototype-hacking game

2143690
opacity	shadow
basically i want the sprites shadow to blend together such that they max out at a set opacity

2143690
opacity	shadow
i would be able to approximate this by making the shadow sprites opaque then applying them both to a parent sprite and making the parent sprite 40 opacity

2143698
environment	building
yes you can access environment variabless from user scripting but the problem is that srcroot is a building setting not an environment variables

2143722
postgresql	mysql
personally i love postgresql -- but other free dbs such as mysql or if you have reasonably small amounts of data -- a few gb at most -- even the sqlite that comes with python will be fine too

2143727
defined	declare
this way you can forwarding declare your classes in the header and defined them in foo

2143751
contains	any	contains	elements
elements must not contains any other a

2143772
datepart	getdate
selected datepart dw getdate

2143773
duplicates	sorted
i could use a sorted list but if i need more than one way of sorting indexing i would end up with duplicates lists

2143781
implements	final
implements unit tests during this design stage would add significant effort and the tests would likely be throw away a few time until the final design is settled upon

2143787
copy-constructor	temporary	copy-constructor	rvalue	temporary	copy	temporary	rvalue
however .when s bind to a rvalue temporary object-literal the copy is typically elided which saves a call to a copy-constructor and a destructor

2143789
click	mouse
i would like to catch right mouse click .so that i can open a contextual drop-down-menu on the underlying table data

2143789
highlight	cell
strangely i get all of the keypress events properly .when i have a cell highlight and press a key i get the keypress event

2143792
subtract	add	subtract	time
.so each time you add subtract from your foolist you ll have to redo all your lookup object

2143792
value	field
create a for each field upon which you will need to search by index where t is the types of that value

2143793
shell	bash
i want it to have a history .so that if you press the up arrow you go back to the previous cmd just like bash or other shell

2143794
any	set
specifics no breakpoints set never gets to any visible simulator results seems to blow during initialization phase before it can generator any output

2143798
markup	xhtml
some people recommend serving xhtml with a variables content-type dependent on the browser s accept request header but i wouldn t as it means you have two sets of very slightly different markup styling and scripting rules to adhere to and it makes caching less effective

2143798
contains	any	contains	elements
it can never contains any other elements or text content

2143799
tunnel	vpn
you would need to set up a vpn tunnel to your private network

2143821
strong-typing	types
scott meyer effective c++ has a very effective and powerful solution to your problem of doing strong-typing of base types in c++ and it works like this

2143821
strong-typing	types
strong-typing is a problem that can be addressed and evaluated at compile-time which means you can use the ordinals weak typing for multiple types at runtime in deployed apps and use a special compile phase to iron out inappropriate combinations of types at compile-time

2143841
temporary	rvalue
operator+ is going to have to create a temporary object an rvalue

2143841
copy-constructor	temporary
instead of invoking the copy-constructor before calling doit the compiler can pass the temporary that was created by operator+ and pass that to doit instead

2143843
mousedown	mouseup
edits can be encode as actions tool mousedown movement mouseup before they are rendering into pixels - this allows a cheap paint to be done as patches at the current mipmap level and quickly display while a background-thread creates patches at the other mipmap levels

2143848
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code which works in firefox google-chrome

2143859
hide	show
what i had intended to add in was how this would be achieved in the case of show hide toggling these with an animation speed code above changed accordingly

2143865
publishing	release
or try testing in publishing release configuration

2143866
.when	ready
.when you re ready to fflush set the variables to true like .so

2143879
put	get
now thread 1 wakes backup and tries to get lock b and will be put to sleep

2143897
scripting	shebang
what i want to know is is there a way to automatically set python to c python27 python.exe which is specified in the first line of the scripting following the shebang #

2143897
scripting	shebang
the shebang line is supposed to be modified during install time the original scripting is generator on the building machine only on the user s machine

2143921
contains	any
it just wouldn t contains any error detail

2143923
return-value	arguments
because void doesn t allow you to specify an arguments named which would be required inorder to capture the return-value of the first function regardless of what it actually returned

2143933
virtual-functions	base-class
there are good reasons for constructing the base-class interface with all virtual-functions as private or protected see this

2143940
multiplication	division
i hate to say it but i don t handle this in my code since i don t use bit shifting for multiplication or division

2143971
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
python perl and ruby are available along with the usual things you might expect on a linux box

2143971
inkscape	cairo
solutions that involve cairo scripting inkscape or installation more complex than ftp it up are probably out

2143992
arguments	default
default all function arguments types

2143992
derived-class	base-class
those goals appear to have been met here -- publicizing a protected base-class member definitely required explicit action in the derived-class and in 20+ years of writing c++ i can t remember ever needing or even wanting to do it

2143994
linux	unix	linux	bsd	unix	bsd
shebangs are only native to the filesystemss of unix linux bsd variants due to their design and layout the filesystems knows that .when a file begins with a shebang the filesystems triggers the user s terminal process to invoke the shell based on the shebang usually bin sh

2143994
scripting	shebang
in short this is not possible under windows 2000 upwards to windows 7 as the ntfs lacks such a capability to interpreter the contents of the data ntfs does not care what is in the file and therefore lack the means of having an execute call to load the shebang scripting only .exe .dll .sys .drv s are catered for but for a scripting..

2143999
value	field
what are the value for the various base url field under web in the configuration

2144010
margins	padding
margins and padding just push the bullet away

2144012
value-initialization	rvalue
the expression t where t is a simple-types-specifier 7.1.5.2 for a non-array complete object types or the possibly cv-qualified void types creates an rvalue of the specified types which is value-initialization

2144026
ontouchevent	touch-events
not sure if all touch-events will be routed to the overlay s ontouchevent though

2144031
json	xml
which format is best for saving the settings xml json

2144042
derived-class	base-class	protected	public
promoting a private protected virtual-methods to public in a derived-class does not expose the base-class methods

2144050
rollback	commit
transactional b is deadlocked until transactional a commit or is rollback

2144062
prawnto	prawn
in this case you re not really hitting prawnto it just ties prawn into ruby-on-rails better

2144065
put	get
i was wondering how to do this in iis and how he put a slash in between the scripting and the get variables and how he had the scripting with no extension in the first place

2144070
svg	vml
the libs will then handle this outputting to svg if supported or fallback to canvas vml flash silverlight etc if not depending on what s available

2144079
logging	trace
try turning up the logging to trace

2144080
value	field
a bunch of field are indexed and stored and i can see the value in the admin but i can t get querying to work properly

2144091
put	get
.when i put the variables named into a textbox i get the correct text

2144103
json	xml
if there is a lot of nesting then it might be easiest to convert to xml or json and use a prebuilt parsing

2144111
webserver	nginx
webserver nginx

2144142
16-bit	8bit
the systemd interpreter the 8bit characters as 16-bit unicode characters and they end up being interpreter as unicode characters

2144155
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
stranger still i can set to any set of numbers and .so long as it contains 22007 in particular i get behavior b

2144155
contains	any
even more strange i can actually fill my overrides with anything warnings call to core die etc.--as long as it compiles and i get behavior b still--even though the overrides no longer contains any of the code that would make it possible

2144170
string-conversion	int
below is an example of doing an int to string-conversion and back string to int such as what you re doing in your program

2144175
oracle	mysql
we have used it to synchronized 1000+ mysql retail store databases to an oracle corporate database

2144182
buffering	streaming
if you don t clear the buffering if you get an input like 123abc then abc will still be in the streaming .when you try to read from it the next time

2144187
mongodb	couchdb	document-database	couchdb
this could be a great project to use a document-database like couchdb mongodb or simpledb

2144187
amazon-web-services	hosting
simpledb is a great choice if you are hosting this on amazon-web-services

2144188
latex	tex
in the underlying tex engine with which latex is written the numbers of arguments a cmd can take is fixed

2144188
arguments	default
if .so latex takes the contents of square brackets as the arguments if not the next token is put back into the inputstream and the default empty arguments is used instead

2144190
directory	folder
i think the right way to do this is to go to the project properties click on mapping and then enter the path to the web folder in the remote directory and local directory parts and url points at the main site

2144206
directory	folder
the cms systemd running as a virtual directory gives the admin the ability to upload photos for display on the main site the target folder of which is www.mysite.com images - .when attempting disk access from the root .app i am able to write to the virtual directory but cannot do the opposite -- that is write to the root from the virtual directory getting security violations

2144206
directory	folder
if i can only upload to the admin virtual directory the entire points is moot because it s a secured folder that the public can t see

2144214
display	height	display	width
the logic works but the trouble i am having is the windows s height and width is not returning the size it is after the content was updates but is returning the size it was the last time it was display

2144216
png	gif
if you re not opposed to python one option would be to use the python-imaging-library pil which provides python binding for native decoders for many file-format including png and gif

2144216
python	c++
this past summer i wrote a few small apps to do rgb-wise comparisons of png images in c++ pure python and python using pil

2144226
.when	ready
instead of each cmd saying yes i m ready or no i m not which will be the same for each cmd just have lastrun and interval field which main can then use to determine .when each cmd needs to run

2144248
scala	java	erlang	scala
sure there s java .net c# scala erlang f# to named but a few but really go on.

2144267
.when	ready
.when you have finished coding and are ready to checked in you should have met your teams definition of done

2144268
linux	unix
this is usually located in .my.cnf on unix linux systemd

2144276
administration	account
just being logged into the administration account isn t enough

2144282
configuration	logging
i need a single log4j configuration .so i can change my logging preferences in one location

2144282
stdin	pipe
fork in my c++ .app create a pipe from f printf call to the new process stdin and start a java program that reads from stdin and logs using common.logging

2144293
python	ruby
i don t want to call them scripting because they are in my main application language plus i reserve scripting for my ruby python bash scripting that do quick and dirty stuff.

2144294
cassini	iis
i assume that your login form has an external css file and that you re using cassini or iis 7 integrated mode

2144301
installation	environment	installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the reason why this is recommended is because it makes setting of environment variables needed for your installation portable you can easily copy setenv.sh to other tomcat installation you can upgrade tomcat to a newer versioning which might overwrite catalina.sh but still have your existing setenv.sh

2144304
typename	typedef
nevertheless for portability you can use a typedef uint16_t or uint64_t although those might not be right or quote the typename with a templates

2144304
unsigned	short
that leaves unsigned short unsigned char and signed char as the only types you can t easily explicit construct

2144307
getter-setter	setter
secondly if you are setting the dependency properties from xaml the getter-setter is not used the dependency mechanism uses its own internal setter routines

2144317
windows-mobile	windows-ce
i have done a lot of windows-mobile -- windows-ce porting and in general if i need to resolve difference like this i end up setting the applicable properties at runtime after i ve performed a platform detection checked

2144332
switching	screens
this way i could easily control the logic to switching between screens like

2144340
double-quotes	single-quotes
in both cases you re nesting single-quotes directly inside double-quotes which i don t think is correct

2144341
qthread	qtimer
i have done this before with a qthread but this time i would like to do it with a qtimer

2144350
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been working on a website that is very jquery intensive in google-chrome and firefox

2144350
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to see what the website is supposed to do open it in firefox or google-chrome

2144351
subclassing	nsobject
find nsobject or any other class you would like to subclassing

2144359
decrement	increment
you can increment the pointers you can decrement the pointers you can multiplying the pointers

2144361
llvm-gcc	bitcode
an alternative possibly more flexible approach is to use llvm-gcc to compile the runtime itself into llvm bitcode and then use llvm-ld to link the bitcode from your compiler with the bitcode of your runtime

2144361
llvm	gcc
this bitcode can then be re-optimized with opt converted back to information-retrieval with llvm-dis interpreter dinformation-retrievalectly with lli this will afaik only work if llvm was built against libffi or compiled to assembly with llc and then to a native binary with vanilla gcc

2144384
mobile-devices	blackberry
i am developing a netflix application for blackberry mobile-devices

2144394
contains	any
i tried submission my application but was told that the file cannot contains any spaces

2144423
codeigniter	joomla
is there a way that i could create a form templates for submission a .post which would then save to my joomla codeigniter db

2144423
codeigniter	joomla
then on a different page use a different joomla codeigniter templates to display the blog in the form i would like

2144432
memory-management	memory-leaks
since your question did not mention language today there s automatic memory-management that takes care of the memory account tracking to ensure no memory-leaks occur think java ..net but a few can slip through the .net

2144432
malloc	free
all in all each and everyone within the dev team have their own responsibility to ensure the code works and know the rules about memory-management for example such as for every malloc there should be a free for every new there should be a delete but no blame should be accounted for the dev team themselves neither is finger points at the management for piling on the pressure on the dev team either

2144459
contains	any
for example like if the user was to enter their address which would contains numbers and characters and in any order

2144515
haskell	lisp	haskell	ocaml	haskell	prolog	ocaml	lisp	prolog	lisp	prolog	ocaml
introduce a programming language paradigms like functional or logical with a demo of prolog lisp ocaml or haskell

2144516
punctuation	words
but what are words and punctuation marks all together in general

2144520
portrait	screens
i assumed that if i return a yes only for portrait mode the screens should show up only in portrait

2144531
malloc	free
however i have free all malloc ed memory

2144532
punctuation	words
a common term comprising the two sub-categories words and punctuation often used .when talking about parsing is tokens

2144541
punctuation	words
.so words punctuation and white-space are all tokens

2144542
python	c++
no c++ libs into python .so that i can call it from python scripting

2144553
malloc	free
if you are sure that you have free all malloc ed memory then no there s nothing wrong

2144577
any	set
i ve found that on any big project these are the most important as they set the foundation to get devs working productively in parallels

2144583
selected	cell	highlight	selected	highlight	cell	selection	cell	selection	highlight
i use ib and uncheck the show selection on touch but it still show blue highlight on cell that is selected

2144598
ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby
you run code perhaps in .net java ruby php python etc... on a server with potentially javascript flash etc.

2144598
ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby
it could mean writing a google-chrome extension which would again likely mean running .net java ruby python php or some other language of your choice on the server and javascript in the google-chrome extension

2144607
stderr	stdout
okay option 4 have a wrapper scripting that redirects stderr stdout from your unmodified c++ program to a java program that translation the output into log entries would not be very complex

2144646
function-calls	main
it s easy enough if the code structure is essentially functional the main function-calls sub-functions which process data then return a result but it isn t trivial if several treads or several different object shared a piece of memory

2144649
bundler	gem
i just started using bundler for gem packaging in vendor

2144661
submitchanges	datacontext
is there a way to insert an entity without using the submitchanges function of the datacontext

2144661
submitchanges	datacontext
i want to do this because i have other changes done on my datacontext which i do not want to submit yet if i call the submitchanges function it will submit all changes including the ones i do not want to save yet

2144667
value	field
no it s not possible - you can t sort or grouping on a field if you can t compare the field value for equality less than greater than operations

2144669
linux	unix	linux	osx
pthreads are available on just about everything from osx linux unix windows

2144675
deep-copy	object
be aware though that if address would also have internal object you would have to make sure address makes a deep-copy of itself on cloning as per my second example of this .post by defining __clone in address

2144677
highlight	selected
i have a qlistwidget contains items which have iconss and .when the items are selected the icons is just highlight out

2144685
linux	unix
this is the standards file util found on most linux unix distributions

2144685
gnome	kde
i think both gnome and kde have their own ways to determine this and also to set the icons and the standards application for it

2144709
implements	abstract
this base controllers following the templates design pattern would contains an abstract protected methods that controllers subclassing would implements

2144732
data-structures	linked-list
for staters you use them in your data-structures like linked-list etc

2144737
linked-list	heap
.when i need to transfer ownership of an object from one thing to another without actually copying it like in a linked-list heap whatever of really big expensive struct

2144751
contains	elements
could i selected only those elements that contains both the classes for instances

2144753
for-loop	arrays
now i need to read the arrays to get the value one-by-one using a for-loop like

2144786
linkedhashmap	treemap
if you need consistent order you can use linkedhashmap for insert access order or treemap for comparision order

2144803
any	set
with it set to 0 on the 8.04 box i m doing loose reverse path checked which means that a packets may come in from any destination i can route to on any interface

2144813
margins	padding
this considers margins padding and borders

2144813
margins	padding
notice how the positioning value are the same as the css value and offset considers the positioning of the parent the border of the parent and the elements s p margins and padding

2144818
uibinder	gwt
i m using it with gwt 2.0 and uibinder

2144826
skip-lists	hashmap
a skip-lists allows you to traversal the entries in key order and also look them in random order but not as fast as a hashmap

2144828
xsd	xml
if you have a xsd file you can easily deserialize your xml file into an object graphing

2144829
constructor	object
note that i surrounded the function being passed to the bucketlist constructor as part of the options object

2144854
registration	login
in this user registration a user s login must be unique

2144855
value	field
if you want to specify the value for particular field to insert put them in the value clause

2144878
dhtmlx	webix
webix spun off from dhtmlx touch a project with 8 years of development behind it - see below and went on to become a standalone user-interface components framework

2144878
filtering	sorting
these libs don t implements complex widget such as tables with sorting filtering autocomplete or tree

2144881
constructor	private
for this rea.son i might choose to make the constructor private and use a static factory-method named constructor idiom .so that clients have to make an explicit makeconnection call

2144884
ia-32	x86
x86 ia-32 or the i386-architecture

2144886
markup	xhtml
anyway originally it was all horrible html4.0 markup and the new design is xhtml

2144893
32-bit	x86
it s not entirely accurate but the 80386 is the original implementation of the 32-bit x86 instruction set and the common denominator for all following cpus of that arch

2144916
vb.net	vb6
vb.net and vb6

2144941
webserver	upload
i also know that if i want to upload an application document to a webserver i must first save the document to my computer and then go to an upload page click a file open button find my saved file and upload it

2144941
webserver	upload
but is it possible to save a document to a website location or url effectively skipping the first save step and upload the file to the webserver through the save dialog of the application directly

2144949
export	report
.when i try export to excel on the report server it gives me this

2144962
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

2144968
output	cat
i ve seen that snowfall 1.70 has sfcat but it doesn t seem to cat output to the master r session

2145035
put	get
i tried playing around with eval but i m not sure where to put it or how to get javascript to actually interpreter the data

2145038
any	set
regardless you can use any numbers of http url libs to set a user-agent in the header of the request

2145064
ciimage	nsimage
the main thing to be careful of is that the conversion from nsimage to ciimage can be expensive performance-wise .so you should ensure you caching the ciimage if possible and don t recreate it during each drawing operation

2145090
scala	java
i m going to give a talk about using java and scala together and i want to investigate some project large and small which contains java and scala code

2145097
python	perl
i need to have a python cgi scripting do some stuff a little bit of security checked and then end up calling a perl cgi scripting passing anything it received .post info onto the perl scripting

2145097
python	perl
essentially i believe the simplest solution would just be to protect access to the swish.cgi perl scripting with a variant of the standards mailman cgi-bin private python scripting

2145097
python	perl
here s what i did to test the answer using os.execv to replace the python scripting with the perl scripting .so that the perl scripting will inherited the python scripting s environment

2145101
default-value	default
what if you specified the default-value to return instead of using default t

2145114
javascript	dom
i have used this in an instances where i was returning some html via an xmlhttprequest request and i wanted it to execute some javascript but the dom had to be finished loading before i could execute it

2145115
directory	folder
you don t need to add the folder separately in fact mercurial doesn t handle plain folder directory at all

2145135
configuration	environment
force the git_configuration environment variables to a shared readonly file on linux accessed through samba from windows-users to force all configuration settings to be read from there

2145139
linux	bsd
would guess that an extremely stripped-down versioning of linux or bsd is best from that standpoint

2145144
memcached	apc
it also comes with prebuilt xdebug apc and memcached modules which are for me the usual pecl compiled extensions

2145155
testng	junit
they all have some integration with junit or testng

2145166
malloc	free
if you must use the cfdictionary approach you have to find a place to free those malloc -ed memory .when the value are not needed

2145170
alpha	rgba
the first uses max for rgba while the second uses standards addition for rgb and max for alpha

2145170
opacity	shadow
in other words its opacity is changed and with max blend and a standards opaque background it s now painted onto the background .so .when you draw the next shadow it will do max as 1 which is 1 because the background is opaque

2145176
solaris	unix	solaris	linux	linux	unix
i come from unix world i m quite familiar with linux solaris cygwin

2145176
solaris	linux
i don t have any such issues under mingw or cygwin with gcc open solaris with sun studio or linux with gcc or intel compilers

2145176
solaris	linux
under msvc building .when everything works absolutely fine under solaris linux cygwin mingw using gcc from 3.4 up to 4.4

2145176
solaris	linux
for example .when moving from linux to solaris make sure you compile code with -mt or

2145192
conditional	operators
if you count the operators as an operators then temporary pointerss can be lvalues but the same conditional applies its not the temp pointers that would be changed but the thing that it points to

2145231
g++	gcc
in a webserver if gcc and g++ are not provided by the hosting service to the user.can we downloading it and compile through it in rhel5 os

2145234
abstract-class	superclass	abstract-class	subclassing	subclassing	superclass
i have an abstract-class the superclass class super and 5 subclassing which should use the proprieties from the class super and add a new propriety a new column

2145234
extends	super
should i extends the class super from java or it s enough to join the classes using a jpa annotations

2145246
ruby-on-rails	django
days ago i read something like ruby-on-rails is for web-applications django is for standards webpage

2145246
ruby-on-rails	django
i have to decide in the next weeks if i go with ruby-on-rails or django for an university project

2145254
python	php
unlike php python primary purpose is a general-purpose tool for running on the desktop server not necessarily as a web application

2145256
temporary	rvalue
but you can make rvalue thus a temporary into an lvalue by dereference it

2145257
loadrunner	qtp	traffic	packets
i cannot find the basic information about loadrunner does it recording browser actions like qtp or network traffic i mean packets sniffering

2145265
extends	super
on each subclassing extends the super and add the annotations discriminatorvalue with different value for each of the subclassinging

2145288
digits	zero
nevertheless there may occasionally be a requirement to remove trailing zero while retaining all significant digits

2145291
value	field
all said if you don t plan doing any serious sutff at least milion of recording in mytable or more than 50 value in one multival field you can keep doing what you ve been doing for now

2145302
push	pull
each developer should have their own remote public repository which they can push pull to from

2145302
push	pull
then a will pull b s work to his local clone try things out merge commit and push to his own a s public repo for release

2145310
dump	temp
i use a modified versioning to dump the constraint definitions into a temp table then do the truncated magic and then recreate the constraints from the temp table

2145311
python	php
in that case prepare for a shock because python doesn t do things like php does at all

2145317
contains	elements
if you don t really want actual words but path elements to match even if they contains non-word characters then

2145318
myspace	twitter	windows-live	hotmail	windows-live	myspace
twitter myspace aol windows-live msn hotmail or any other openid provider

2145328
stderr	stdout
you can use os.execv to replace it with another process the perl cgi and the new process will inherited the current process environment stdin stdout and stderr

2145329
open-session-in-view	interceptor
the daos don t create close a session for each call they are not responsible for this and this is usually done using the open-session-in-view pattern spring provide a filtering or an interceptor for this

2145336
web-hosting	hosting
a web-hosting provider is unlikely to give you compilers on the hosting box for your use

2145336
put	get
that s if they even allow arbitrary code running on their machines at all - they may if you get your own viewmodel but if you re sharing resources with any of their other customers i ll guarantee you ll be restrict in what you re allowed to put on their machine and unless you re in your own little viewmodel it s rightly still their machine - all you do is pay for the ability to use their server infrastructure

2145342
defined	declare
you must defined the static instances not just declare it

2145348
development-environment	platform
in summary if you are new to symbian qt is the application development-environment to learn and doing .so has the additional benefit that you can al.so develop qt applications on other platform since it is a cross-platform toolkit

2145349
freebsd	linux
ratproxy is currently believed to support linux freebsd macos x and windows cygwin environment

2145350
value	field
a piece of code below show the way to obtain a .post get field value

2145351
decimal-point	zero
one way to get rid of trailing zero after decimal-point would be eliminating them in the decimal

2145383
python	ruby
therefore your decision is really python or ruby

2145383
python	ruby
both ruby and python are object-oriented languages and are easy to get into.

2145411
wamp	php
there are many quirks across platform with php and i don t recommend switching between lamp bamp samp and wamp wimp

2145411
linux	unix
for one thing permissions are completely different - usually being a lot harder to work with in unix linux as windows doesn t seem to care all that much about permissions as far as i have ever seen

2145430
windows-mobile	windows-ce
as you have found out by now windows-mobile apps have a little less screens estate than windows-ce

2145430
checkbox	button
if you can t do that without making changes to the form like in most of my cases you can try to utilise the soft key and get rid of any button checkbox etc

2145432
double-quotes	single-quotes
always put html in single-quotes .so that the double-quotes wont break it

2145454
google-earth	google-maps
the tile used in google-earth are unprojected while google-maps tile are served in a roughly-mercator projection

2145454
google-earth	google-maps
although theoretically you could unproject google-maps tile .so that they would align properly with google-earth tile this is strictly prohibited by the google-maps terms of service and or the google-maps earth api terms of service

2145460
temporary	copy
the copy operation can be omitted by constructing the temporary object directly into the target of the omitted copy

2145486
splash-screen	about-box
mention somewhere that your product uses that libs anywhere in the about-box in the splash-screen in the manual.

2145506
triggers	insert
you could maybe do it using a triggers s you issue one sql-insert statement and subsequent insert are carried out in the database as long as

2145506
triggers	insert
you don t mind living with the problems that such an approach might give rise to unclear error messages .when a triggers fails silent insert failures performance issues etc.etc.

python	ruby
both frameworks are great for what you re trying to do and ruby and python are similar in a lot of ways

2145542
rollback	commit
it is a good idea to commit or rollback a transactional

2145551
sequences	unique
footnote using shuffling to get a unique sequences of pseudo-random numbers

2145571
subtract	formula
i m assuming it s saying this because you cannot subtract pointss from each other but each value in the formula is either an x or y value not a points

2145576
boolean	double
the primitive-types are boolean byte sbyte int16 uint16 int32 uint32 int64 uint64 intptr uintptr char double and single

2145585
double	int
this may not meet your requirements but it does give you the ability to specify the input types you are expecting which could be any one of string int double date or currency

2145587
return-value	arguments
task_postrun task_id task arguments kwarguments return-value

2145594
constructor	private
i have a doubt that a static-class can contains a private constructor

2145607
constructor	private	instances	private	protected	public
a static-class cannot have any instances constructor see cs0710 whether it be public private protected or internal

2145607
static-classes	class-members
static-classes and static class-members c# programming guide

2145617
constructor	private
a static-class can only have a static constructor and public private does not apply since your code can never call this constructor the clr does

2145617
constructor	private
.so you may not use a access modifiers public private ... on a static constructor

2145636
any	set
.so the result set would be all the distinct-value + empty string if any value were null or an empty string

2145657
.war	jar
they are of types jar or .war

2145664
radio-button	selected
i have following code in jsp used with struts2 radio-button i want to know which radio-button is selected in my action class .so can anyone give me .solution on this

2145687
cucumber	selenium
something like cucumber but for crud operations... or even selenium

2145699
any	set
is there any way to restore the datadb from the backup set

2145708
for-loop	loops
either way this does not explain why the gmarker properties is not available inside that for-loop that can not even be a race conditional since loops starts immediately after that points where the object is still ok

2145715
double	int	primitive	int
the only exception-handling are string it s allowed to add string object and the primitive wrapper like int and double in java 1.5+ autoboxing converts them back to primitive

2145739
primitive-types	reference-type
according to your question you want to treat primitive-types as reference-type which is not possible only via the ref keyword

2145750
contains	elements
note that the desiredsize isn t necessarily what the contains elements will allow it have but i suspect it will give you the information you are after

2145794
attributes	properties
the nearest is the propertieschange event which fires in response to a change in an attributes or css properties of an elements

2145799
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning of firefox the issue is fixed in 3.6

2145805
base-class	inherited
far better to have a relationship whereby both child and parent inherited from a single base-class person

2145811
text-editor	editor
vms editor is just a text-editor and it would be nice to have syntax-highlighting etc

2145821
constructor	object
family must be a java object that has an appropriate constructor

2145821
annotations	mapping
the import is optional if the object is a normals mapped entity either using using annotations or in a hibernate mapping xml

2145823
backslash	regex
1 backslash is used for unescaping in the regex engine

2145823
backslash	regex
1 backslash is used for unescaping in the regex engine

2145824
temporary	rvalue
it doesn t say anywhere in the language standards that all temporary object are rvalue

2145824
temporary	rvalue
among other things this actually means that a temporary object can be accessed as an rvalue as well as an lvalue depending on the specific form of expression that is used to perform the access

2145824
temporary	rvalue
for example the result-of literals 2 + 3 expression is obviously an rvalue a temporary of types int

2145824
temporary	rvalue
for a given class types t expression t is an rvalue as explicit stated in the language standards yet the temporary object accessed through expression with the obvious implementation of t get_this is an lvalue

2145824
temporary	rvalue
.so once again the very same temporary object might easily be seen as an rvalue or as an lvalue depending on what kind of expression what kind of access path you use to look at that object

2145833
contains	set
use your current workflow and set the batch-file init_message to something contains the nodes id

2145836
selected	listbox
.so what i need to know is how can i delete a selected item out of the listbox

2145853
double	int
i iterate through the map using int key and the functions firstentry and higherentry and modify the double value

2145853
double	int
those int key are important to me and because the double value are not unique i cannot have a double key

2145862
unicode	wstring
but after several tests i found the bottleneck is the conversion between mulitbyte string and unicode wstring

2145871
python	java	python	c++
i would look at google s protocol-buffers they are available for a wide range of languages c++ java python and .net c#

2145885
sftp	ftp
some editor such as bbedit on the mac support directly opening saving files via ftp sftp etc

2145903
xsd	xml
for typed xml to linq process do i need to downloading linq to xsd alpha install or is it available in vs 2008

2145907
constructor	private	virtual-functions	member-functions
you need to hide the size of your internal structures from users and that means jumping through hoops pimpl private constructor virtual-functions .when apis are member-functions

2145924
contains	elements
i m making a silverlight behavior to enable dragging an elements by a contains drag handle elements rather than the whole elements being draggable

2145946
compatibility	licensing
you are looking for info such as cost community adoption maturity features licensing issues compatibility with your existing software

2145952
downcasting	upcasting
the assignments you are performing are called downcasting and upcasting

2145959
double	int
however the only way in which i see this happening with another data structure is keeping a wrapper over the int and the double and writing two comparator - one which compares the int and one which compares first by the double and then by the int

2145969
memcached	ehcache
it s a convenience but at some points yes you are better off using something like memcached or terracotta or ehcache to persistent data between request or between users

2145976
value	field
i guess it would be something along the line of just ignoring the value which is in col_c and just sending this to a temp variables rather than a field

2145983
widget	button
in main.cpp showmaximized is used to show my widget as i also want the menu button in the bottom

2145985
expression	evaluation
there s some code for evaluation matlab expression from java whitehouse matlab javamatlab.html

2145995
javascript	dom
table layout results in more html more html results in more code to write and maintain and less clarity for dom manipulations via javascript

2146006
value	field
the value of form field

2146026
bundler	gem
bundler will also dump gem executable in your rails.root bin directory

2146047
put	get
i use gnarf s methods though i fallback on document.writeln ing a tag for ie 7 as i couldn t get dom creation to work reliably in ie6 and tbh didn t care enough to put much effort into it

2146056
updating	updates
what i needed it for was to updates a timer for a pop-up it display something like reconnecting in time seconds and i was updating the time .when the timer fired

2146069
exponent	modulo
choosing a small modulo or a small exponent both have their own drawbacks

2146071
binary	hex
mongodb uses 12-byte binary value an objectid -- it can be converted to 24-byte hex string

2146079
python	ruby
do you prefer or feel more comfortable or know better python or ruby

2146082
memcheck	valgrind
zsun nel6005001 valgrind --tool memcheck . fl.out

2146093
private-members	private
this just makes plain sense if it was allowed by the language it might just forget about the private keyword at all after all any code that intended on accessing the private-members could just use that trick

2146095
copy-constructor	deep-copy
i think you should use deep-copy and defined your own assingment operators and copy-constructor

2146097
in-app	app-id
is possible to create only one app-id for example xdfgye6tr4.com.company.coolapp and use it for all three versioning of coolapp with enabled push notifications and in-app purchases

2146113
beautifulsoup	lxml
use beautifulsoup or lxml

2146123
authentication	login
at the moment we have two separate login authentication â the php and the sql-server report service one which i believe uses something similar to asp.net authentication

2146129
getter	setter
is there any easy way to do this or do i have to do it manually by checked every attributes by its getter and setter

2146140
value	field
you d obviously need some sort of mapping between types or even field named and required default value but this can be done quite easily in a loops

2146140
value	field
with modern java you can use annotations to set the default value for field on a per class basis

2146167
insert-into	prepare
stmt mysqli- prepare insert-into tags title value

2146186
linux	unix
run the following unix linux cmd in the directory contains the code

2146192
json	xml
of course i could write a bunch of utility code in c++ to do this kind of thing and maybe leverage a libs for the text side of things xml or json or whatever but this is a task pattern that keeps cropping up in my work and it seems to me that there probably ought to exist already some kind of general purpose tool for this kind of job

2146192
boolean	int
obviously there would need to be some way of describing the binary file-format - a schema or some such - this would need to support all the obvious data types strings int of various sizes boolean etc floats would be nice too and things like count field length field padding alignment etc to handle all the typical stuff that you find in a data file

2146197
internet-explorer	firefox
i found this was caused by the file associations for .url filetype was set to microsoft browser rather than internet-explorer firefox

2146200
constructor	private
you can make the constructor private

2146216
decrement	increment
copying a shared_ptr now costs 32 bytes in stack copy and extra refcount increment decrement

2146255
python	ruby
do you prefer python or ruby

2146264
beyondcompare	winmerge
i have tried both winmerge beyondcompare and kdiff and they are not good enough if i have functions with the same named but placed in different areas of the file they show it as difference

2146267
text-align	width
the text-align left may not make a difference eg if there s no width specified and nothing inside has an inherent width like an image.

2146268
boolean	int
__eq__ returns a boolean which determines if two object are equals __cmp__ returns an int which determines if the two object are greater or less than each other and .so is called unless you have specific __eq__ __ne__ __le__ __ge__ __lt__ and __gt__ methods

2146282
bitblt	gdi
i am trying to use the gdi gradientfill function to draw on a offscreens bitmap then bitblt that to the screens

2146288
getter	setter
no more getter or setter every field has to be defined by the constructor

2146295
protected	public
private and protected variables are for internal use while public members are for public use

2146315
contains	any
each time the application starts it checked all those files and if any file contains the numbers representing the threshold limit it simply exit by saying that the threshold limit has been reached

2146316
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
be extra careful with dynamic-sql like this as you open yourself up to sql-injection

2146325
python	java
finally since you solicit other language recommendations forget java forget matlab forget python forget r use mathematica it s way more fun and very powerful

2146343
jndi	jdbc
the application needs to access a stored procedure in a db2 data base therefore a jdbc datasource is configure and accessed by its jndi named

2146358
directx	gdi
i draw the circle in c# using directx.i like to draw the circle with same dimension in c# using gdi.it means i like to convert that circle from directx to gdi

2146358
directx	gdi
and also i give the input for centering of the circle is x y in this points format.but in gdi it is pixels format .so how can i convert the directx pointss to gdi+ pixelss

2146386
value	field
because author programmer wants to sort results by value of gender field

2146390
worksheet	excel
excel 2003 worksheet can have a maximum of 65 536 rows by 256 columns

it doesn t do ssl validation but this isn t required to connect over http

2146416
display	height
i want to display a page with no scrollbar height 100

2146457
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
.when you add a s view to the windows it becomes the active uiviewcontroller and only a will receive the viewdidappear messages while e won t actually be getting any uiviewcontoller related methods viewdidappear viewwillappear etc.

2146457
subclassing	nsobject
my suggestion for you is that if you create controllers for views that are subviews don t subclassing uiviewcontroller but rather nsobject it will reduce your confusion level as you won t expect to get your uiviewcontroller methods called which they won t anyway

2146467
http	ssl
note http support is only available if the socket module was compiled with ssl support

2146467
http	ssl
note http support is only available if python was compiled with ssl support through the ssl module

2146472
http-get	get
.so you should use the http-get methods and not .post .post should be used .when you intend to create modify data and get should be used .when you intend to fetch .some data

2146479
overlapping	margins
actually that div will have 100px top margins to avoid top div overlapping on your content

2146489
contains	set
if you checked this set it will contains the user s language preferences the same list that is in tools - internet options - languages in ie

2146515
perl	php	perl	c++	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	c++	python	ruby	python	perl
chartdirector is the best and it has a lot of flavors thus has versioning for php asp com vb .net jsp java coldfusion perl python ruby c++

2146520
shell	bash
the post-commit hook could be any program of any types a bash scripting a c program a python scripting...what happens is that the shell launchd this program with the two parameters

2146521
margins	padding
a problem appears because of the fact that the total width of div is sum of inner width + padding + margins

2146538
decrement	increment
note in general a const iterator is an iterator that cannot be increment decrement but can change the value it points to

2146538
decrement	increment
where as a const_iterator is a different class that can be increment decrement but the value it points to cannot be changed

2146544
formatting	import	export	csv
edit i m export a database to a spreadsheet formatting it and import it into a new systemd through a csv

2146551
push	pull
often it s enough to simply ask whether a subsystem can pull the information it needs from a simple interface instead of having to push the data in

2146551
ruby-on-rails	django
if you take web development then there are really just a small numbers of established paradigms the one templates code file per uri of something like php or maybe the model view-templates controllers approach of ruby-on-rails django plus a couple of others

2146571
display	width
unless you are doing something like floating it of fiddling with its display which you shouldn t given what you are trying to achieve that will cause the width to use the remaining spaces

2146577
button	popup
then you could do some javascript hackery to insert your own button which then call something similar to existing rte_insertimage function to call a popup windows and do whatever you need you ll find this function in 12 templates layout 1033 form.js

2146590
required	checked
this required checked currently running process

2146594
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari 3 on mac but

2146594
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari 3

2146595
scripting	shebang
as for how to resolve this call it in your shell scripting with just home daily scriptinging per_node_hr gettotal.pl instead of perl home daily scriptinging per_node_hr gettotal.pl and it will get passed to opt perl bin perl-w as specified in the shebang #

2146596
contains	any
assuming that there won t be any stray hyphens - in the string and that the branding named etc would contains only alphanumerical characters and spaces - to allow other symbols add them to the character classes you can use following regex

2146616
content-disposition	content-type	content-disposition	content-length	content-length	content-type
remember to pass at least content-type content-length and content-disposition along

2146695
ext.net	extjs
for business and other web-applications extjs with ext.net wrapper is a great user-interface javascript-framework

2146696
virtualbox	vmware	virtual-machine	virtualbox	virtual-machine	vmware
i came to think though .when the application is install on a virtual-machine ms virtual-pc vmware virtualbox etc. and licensed on that - would it is possible to clone the virtual-pc and then start multiple-instances of the virtual-pc on the same physical pc and still distinguesh the virtual-pc s hardware or other different information from eachother

2146708
instances	private
i have some private instances on the class for example

2146711
contains	any
or using c# - is there any function to test the string contains html to see whether it actually contains anything other than tags

2146728
value	field
this key is hidden in a field nammed with a non suggestive named and the value encripted

2146762
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
there are only likely to be a few different types of event that need to be recorded - button click keyboard input on any textfield keyboard shortcuts and mouse input on any mouse-input field .so it s not an enormously taxing task although of course working out how to store and bind macros and how to facilitate import and export if you were inclined to do .so is time consuming but not technically challenging

2146768
python	perl
is there any tool or utility or perl python scripting that can find longest repeated substring in a large text file and printing those patterns and the numbers of time each pattern occurs

2146787
macros	vba
this webpage details how to resolve the issue in excel through the user-interface and i ve recorded this as a macros below but that s vba .

2146789
webserver	security
they would like a form which allows users to send them a cv but from a security points of view would like the cv s sent to an email address rather than stored on a webserver

2146796
export	report
edit forgot to add .when export the report to pdf the images are show ok

2146806
click	mouse
this works quite well .when it is triggers by a button click because the slight delay is not noticeable however .when it is run automatically say every few seconds the user can easily notice their mouse lock up for a few seconds

2146808
mersenne-twister	generator
boost-random has a mersenne-twister generator

2146816
webserver	upload
let the upload proceed as normals into a temp folder on the webserver then email that file where it needs to go and then delete it

2146817
ruby-on-rails	django
this is mainly because of their heritage - ruby-on-rails was originally used for web-applications like basecamp while django was used to building newspaper magazine sites

2146825
unsigned	bigint
i would at least look at varbinary field since you will have lots of these kinds of issues with unsigned signed into a bigint

2146863
http	ssl
does the browser intervene see that i want http initiate a ssl session with secretplace.com without passing the path in plain text and only after the ssl session is set up pass the path

2146866
python	ruby
python is popular there is a ruby runtime you can use the web runtime.

2146866
python	java
if you re looking for good guides i suggest looking at the symbian press books particularly the java python and quick recipes books

2146877
selected	listbox
i have an application where .when a person types or selected a listbox there s a portion of the screens that dynamically updates to a new view

2146891
reflection	runtime
however in recent years runtime reflection meta-data based storage retrieval mechanisms such as hibernate datanucleus have become popular

2146904
constructor	object
object deserialization uses a backdoor the unsafe.allocateinstance methods to create object without invoking their constructor

2146906
reflection	runtime
marking class methods and field in various ways for later process at compile-time using the annotations process tool apt or at runtime using reflection is what annotationss were created for

2146909
getter	setter
imagine i have this two entities suppose getter and setter exists too

2146921
http	ssl
because ssl operates below http and has no knowledge of higher-level protocols ssl servers can only strictly present one certificate for a particular ip ports combinations

2146921
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	opera
support for sni is available since firefox 2 opera 8 and internet-explorer 7 on windows-vista

as i have worked on c++ and on java dont know how to work on vb vbscript vba can any body tell me how to hide this button and also how to send mail from custom button how to access the field of mail ie. the to field subject field messages body attachment etc

2146951
colorbox	jquery
you don need to include jquery and colorbox in child page

2146952
uisearchbar	uitableview
related to pop-up search keyboard and resizing a uitableview between static uisearchbar and dynamically added uitabbar table view is embedded into one of the tabs

2146996
overwrite	preserve
to preserve a client side value write the value into an asp hidden-field using javascript and don t rendering the javascript if ispostback is true .so that it doesn t get overwrite on postback

2147006
xsd	xml
if you reference the xsd file from inside thet xml file then you can get strongly typed linq iirc

2147029
defined	declare
why wouldn t the macros have been defined to declare and initializer the variables in one statement to avoid the issue

2147039
google-chrome	firefox
it works with google-chrome or firefox

2147056
.when	ready
i have a domain mattpotts.com and have set up a sub-domain dev.mattpotts.com for me to develop on and will then copy the files to the normals domain .when they re ready to go

they do not contains any data or functional code

2147081
e-commerce	product
i m building an e-commerce website and the client insists that he ll be able to edit product with excel spreadsheet

2147114
constructor	object
.when the object is within the main program the constructor isn t called hence the program doesn t properly initializer the object and it crash after some cmd specifically tstartgamebutton inherited from gui_canvas inherited from gui_element and anything that is not defined in gui_element crash the program with an eaccessviolation

2147133
derived-class	base-class
.when you derive a base-class using protected or private then your derived-class is not treated as base-class and compiler will not perform implicit type-conversion in that case

2147133
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
derived-class in not base-class in case of private or protected inherited

2147133
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
whereas in case of public inherited every derived-class is a base-class

2147178
zipfile	archive
well if you use sharpziplib to inflate the zipfile there is a testarchive methods on the zipfile object that will do an integrity checked of the archive and tell you if it s valid

2147198
export	report
i can totally see where your client is coming from and if they simply wanted to export sales data into excel and generator report etc they would have my complete support

2147198
sql-server	mysql
if you are deploying on a modern versioning of sql-server and using sharepoint for integration excel as a front-end would be easier to handle than java and mysql or whatever

2147256
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle
do you know any tools for postgresql like db2 design advisor in db2 database-tuning advisor in microsoft sql-server or sql access advisor in oracle

2147259
entitymanager	entities
i must say that i had a lot of entities managed by entitymanager

2147260
google-earth	google-maps
however it should be noted that google-earth has several historical maps including a world map from 1790 a 1833 us map a 1680 map of tokyo and a 1716 map of paris .so chances are they will add this functionality to google-maps at .some points in the future

2147265
logout	login
i wouldn t suggest blocking new people trying to login because users don t want to have to go back to another computer they have possibly miles away just because they forgot to logout

2147276
logout	login
and there is no bad blood with users unable to login because they forgot to logout at work etc

2147284
revision	updates
now this could well be ok if you use revision and nodes 2587 itself or some older nodes has been updates once already - otherwise it might be a problem as without any revision ever created both should be the same

2147287
logout	login
independently from the lm logic per-se remember to keep a log of all the lm-related events login logout inactive session kills refused login...

2147314
font-size	width
in java there s cobra a java web renderinging which is able to rendering a webpage and query attributes like width font-size etc

2147394
base-class	inherited
as mentioned by steven compiler adds a hidden pointers to the base-class which is set .when a class instances is created such that it points to the virtual table for that class this-pointers is also inherited by derived classes

2147394
derived-class	base-class
.when an object of the derived-class is assign to the base-class pointers the hidden pointers in the base-class is replace with the address of the derived-class s vtable

2147406
c-preprocessor	macros
they make sense in languages like c++ because the source code of your application is 1st preporcessed by c-preprocessor that converts macros into code than the code is compiled in a monolithic stand alone working application with .exe extension

2147409
default-value	default
the default-value properties can be non- null in vb parameters which already supports default value

2147421
updatepanel	gridview
assuming that you have this information you could simply wrap the gridview in an updatepanel that triggers on a timer control which post back every n seconds

2147422

gethashcode	equals
the thing is that dictionary uses two things to access the value by a specific key equals and gethashcode in the following manner

2149259
key-value	key	gethashcode	equals
get all key that match requested key-value by gethashcode value gethashcode value must be equals for equals object and should be different for different object

2149259
gethashcode	equals
taking this into account default gethashcode must be consistent with how the default equals implementation works - if a b a.gethashcode b.gethashcode - either way there would be really no points in providing default implementation if it wouldn t even meet the required minimum

ruby	php	python	php	python	c++	python	ruby
i think a much better way to learn practical oo as opposed to oo as a religion is to learn a multiparadigm language like d python or ruby or stick with c++ and php though the oo features of these languages are very bolted on read up on design-patterns to understand the why of oo and gradually try to integrated more oo design into your programs with the ability to compare the results to what you would have written procedurally in the same language

arguments	default
there is no problem in using a derived instances as default arguments for a base reference

2149835
temporary	rvalue
now you cannot bind a non-constant reference to a temporary rvalue which can be one reason for the compiler to complain about your code but i would expect a better diagnose messages cannot bind temporary to reference or something alike

2149835
arguments	default
if the function must modify the received arguments consider refactoring to a pointers and provide a default null value not a default dynamically allocated object

2149841

multiplication	division
also try to factors out division as multiplication by a reciprocal

2149885
contains	elements
if what you want is to specify the import xml file named outside applicationcontext.xml .so that you could replace applicationcontext.xml without losing the configuration of the import xml filepath you can just add an intermediate spring beans xml file say confselector.xml .so that applicationcontext.xml import confselector.xml and confselector.xml only contains an import elements that refers to the suitable custom beans xml file

.when document is ready hide it with jquery function slow effect

2150233
gethashcode	equals
implements equals and gethashcode properly using the ones from the supplied strings and take care with null references in your struct and possibly to make it even nicer

2150233
gethashcode	equals
you should always implements equals and gethashcode as pair and this is even more obvious since the valuetype.equals is terribly inefficient and unreliable using reflection unknown methods of equality comparison

2150247
erlang	python
if you re considering learning python for addressing this problem i might suggest taking a look at erlang instead

2150249

subtraction	division	subtraction	addition	addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	addition
the 754 standards specifies what result you should get from certain basic operations notably addition subtraction multiplication division square root and negation

2150365
numeric	zero
in most cases the numeric result is specified precisely the result must be the representable numbers that is closest to the exact mathematical result in the directions specified by the rounding mode to nearest toward infinite toward zero or toward negative infinite

2150365
processor	cpu
if for example the processor has registers capable of holding extended-precision floating-point numbers and doing arithmetic with extended-precision does not take any more cpu time than doing arithmetic with double-precision a compiler is likely to generator code using extended-precision

2150365
cosine	sine
.when you move beyond the basic arithmetic operations to things like sine and cosine you are very dependent on the libs you use

2150367
dlopen	dlsym
i m thinking this would be based on a similar set of functionality that pthreads provides to load and call dll s ie dlopen dlsym and dlclose

2150367
base-class	inherited	protected	public
how does inherited from a dll work - does every call to the base-class have to be to an exposed member function i.e private protected public is simply ignore

2150369
rollback	commit
secondly i havent actually tried this yet as im still writing .soem other pieces that fit in - .so perhaps zend_db simply ignore begintransaction commit and rollback if not supported on the table in question

2150465
digits	zero
matches runs of zero or more digits

2150483
getter	setter
if you ever need to do anything else in the setter or getter though the automatic properties won t work -- you ll need the private field to manipulate

i then destroy the qcoreapplication instances as the very last thing in the destructor

2150500
midl	idl

2150550
nsstring	nsurl
returns an arrays of nsurl object which you treat as nsstring object

2150550
instances	private
for instances the private nspathstore2 class is part of the nsstring cluster and you can do everything nsstring supports on nspathstore2 object

2150551
value	field
of course placing the value in a field between uses would save some lookup time but you should only pay the deserialization cost once

2150559
subtract	time
i guess this will usually be good enough unless its important for you to subtract any time spent waiting for an available thread to become available

2150559
subtract	time
and subtract it from the end time at

2150562
mapping	unique
at a minimum the com registry contains the mapping between the unique guid for a com object and the libs dll that contains it s code

i could be misjudging your question but i think what you re actually asking is how to remove the locked flag from a content-type in eclipse-pdt instead of getting a code-folding error

2150780
removeclass	addclass
you can figure out the other one although i would generally advise to addclass and removeclass instead of messing with css styles directly

2150784
show	next
leave everything as is and just show a please wait image on form submission - it will automatically disappear .when the next page is opened

2150784
swfupload	uploadify
also for file upload you may want to look into flash based uploaders like swfupload or uploadify that enable you to display a real progress-bar among other things

2150789
stderr	stdout
this will work even if stderr is redirected as well as stdout

2150789
buffering	streaming
note the way that the with the two streaming being buffering independently the relative order if they are outputting to the same device is not necessarily preserve

2150793
click	mouse
i m capturing _enter as above and it actually does work if i tab into the textbox but if i mouse-click into the textbox the cursor appears wherever the mouse click was performed indicating that it is handled after the _enter event effectively overwriting what i did

2150799
getter	setter
getter and setter are the public interface that other classes interact with

and that s ok but the problem is that then my child nodes are in a somewhat random order well what i picked from the first file followed by what i picked from the 2nd and the schema file the .xsd defined these children as a sequences or xs sequences if you prefer

2150825
triggers	insert
the triggers is passing back null which indicates to the insert that no action is to be performed

2150828
dlopen	dlsym
i m thinking this would be based on a similar set of functionality that pthreads provides to load and call dll s ie dlopen dlsym and dlclose

2150828
dlopen	dlsym
the com runtime provides a lot of extra service that apply to the windows environment but arn t really needed .when implements mini com in a single application as a means to dynamically link to a more oo interface than traditionally allowed by dlopen dlsym etc

2150828
dlopen	dlsym
ole com then loads dlopen the dll call its dllgetclassobject dlsym methods passing in the guid again presuming that succeeds ole com then call the createinstance and returns the resulting interface to .app

2150828
base-class	inherited	protected	public
how does inherited from a dll work - does every call to the base-class have to be to an exposed member function i.e private protected public is simply ignore

2150834
rar	zip
just package it as a compressed file such as a zip or rar for example

2150841
handler	service
see the url handler service specifications r4 osgi core specifications

linux	unix
pthread.h is a header for the unix linux pthreads api for threads

2150966
qapplication	qthread
at some points i had changed qcoreapplication processevents for qapplication processevents but that caused the gui to freeze im pretty sure thats what was fereezing it because since i put qcoreapplication processevents back it hasnt frozen again am i right to think that calling qapplication processevents from both the main thread and qthread can freeze the gui

2150973
put	get
now he wants it .so .when you try and put in a special character it simply will not get entered into the textbox

2150982
ruby	php
still i think it is safe to say that php developers are easier to find than say pythonists or ruby developers

2150992
32-bit	64bit
i m using 64bit linux 2.6.18 with a 32-bit java jdk redhat enterprise linux 5.3 if it matters

2150995
firefox	opera
in both opera and firefox my facebook connect application successfully loads xd_receiver and everything works

firefox	opera
the url the pop-up is visiting is the correct xd_receiver page as is hinted by the fact that everything works in firefox and opera

2151006
contains	any
encrypting a file that contains user data on a user machine is not a mitigation of any attack

2151166
securitymanager	classloader
i am hoping there is a simple way around this that does not required jumping through complex hoops using a custom securitymanager classloader etc

2151169
stderr	stdout
from my experience it s better to consume stdout and stderr of child-process until they eof and then block in waitfor

2151169
stderr	stdout
however whether the child program will terminate crash .when it s stdout or stderr pipe is closed at the other end is totally up to that child s implementation

2151173
hash	md5
what you must do is a server-side validation let s say you will validation against a md5 hash md5 1 c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b

2151177
value	field
the idea is to make the static field sys_paths null .so that it would construct the paths from the changed value

2151188
value	field
a few weeks later i get a new requirement from the business .when viewing a non-editable readonly versioning of a form certain field value should be merged together and other contrived calculated field should are added

2151193
directory	folder
i usually keep bpls in the same shared directory delphi uses because it is already in the path and avoids to litter the system32 folder

2151193
folder	dir
- no separate folder for dcus dcu d11 dcus are left in the source dir no good .when sharing a libs across differend delphi versioning

2151200
value	field
try right click on the numbers and unchecking the hexidecimal display field and it should go back to non-hex value

2151228
ftp	ssh
ubuntu allows you to create and bookmark connections to other servers via either public ftp or ssh

2151239
hash	md5
it may be sufficient to append a md5 hash generator from the file contents and some secret only known to your application note that this could be circumvented easily by reverse-engineering the application

2151258
keyboard	mouse
various events i quote because i what the c++ concept of events is for things like keyboard and mouse events

2151307
xhtml	tidy
tidy tidy.sourceforge.net can format your html validation produce xhtml from html and other things

2151312
sigaction	signals
if it s not set then the child can happily call sigaction to change the signals handler without affecting the parent

your question isn t very clear b c it sounds like you can both specify the coupon via a selected box or in just a free form textbox

2151412
order	add
as for order orderdetail in general we expect order orderdetail represents a compositional scenario - you either insert an order with details or updates an order to add delete updates order details

2151419
any	set
sparse-matrix columns don t take up any recording spaces .when not set

2151422
32-bit	64bit
please not that in case the user is running x64 os your module also needs to be 64bit which generally means that .when you distribute your utility there has to be both 32-bit and 64bit versioning of it

2151424
contains	any
if the bitmap is contains inside the containers any transformation applied to the containers should also be applied to the things contains within it

2151435
version-control	git
use a version-control solution like subversion or git and or a building tool

2151442

compression	streaming
you could save a lot of spaces by compression the tokens as your read them from the source streaming presumably a text file

2151497
constructor	object
usually i create a new object invocating his constructor the usual way

2151501
arguments	default
you probably need to enable assert with the -ea jvm arguments since they re off by default

parentheses	keyword
the basic introduces the new keyword but all examples have parentheses and no mention is made of their optionality

2151504
json	xml
sending textual data xml json etc. is more intuitive and easier to develop in many circumstances if performance is not critical

2151505
printf	scanf
with printf scanf and related functions the size of a floating-point numbers can be specified by modifying the format types specifier

2151505
decimal-point	digits
where refers to the minimum numbers of digits to display for the numbers there will be no truncation if it goes over and specifies the exact numbers of digits to display after the decimal-point

2151525
base-class	inherited
your controllers inherited from controllers .so your base-class will need to do the same

2151526
malloc	free
in c you allocate memory with malloc or another similar function and delete it with free

2151549
highlight	selected
.when the item is selected both the text and the icons are highlight

2151550
json	xml
you will need to return a xml or json object from the request which will the be used to fill in only the relevant parts

2151552
value	field
locating the value you need to change should not be too hard but you will need to change at least one probably several field lengths to cater for the change

2151566
shell	bash
modifying the shell foreground and background colors via ps1 in bash will be the easiest as pointed out by others here

2151569
decimal-point	digits
add 5 digits for the exponent 1 for the sign 1 for a leading 0 1 for the decimal-point and you get

2151582
sql-server	mysql
i ll be running a mysql database sql-server is out of the question

2151615
javascript	dom
if i switched the mime-type to application xhtml+xml i would see a pretty big performance improvement because the javascript could use the get____ns functions instead of what it s doing now slowly iterator through the entire dom tree every time it needs to selected an elements

2151615
web-inspector	webkit
i noticed that .when i inspected the elements either in firebug or in the webkit nightly web-inspector the points of failure were .classname and #id css selectors on elements in the xforms namespace

2151615
attributes	properties
i also noticed that in the listed dom properties for those elements they were lacking both id and classname attributes

2151615
firefox	safari
doesn t work in either firefox 3.5 or safari 4 webkit nightly

2151616
shell	bash
assuming bash shell

2151633
python	c++
you basically embed straight python code inside your c++ code and run through cheetah preprocessor.it allows to do pretty complex computations much easier than using templates or c++ preprocessor plus you get all python libs and extensions

2151633
python	c++
variables in c++ code which start with are replace by python variables

2151634
compatibility	platform
you might be able to use the approach taken in osxadaptor the dynamic implementation of which will only be triggers on platform that actually support the apple apis java 1.4 or later on mac os x avoiding any compatibility concerns. a sample application and the adaptor itself are available as mentioned in this article

2151704
silverlight	wpf
if you need to do this for a large numbers of textbox in silverlight or wpf then you can use the technique used in the blog .post

2151709
any	set
i don t think it s an issue with the fonts not being available otherwise it wouldn t show up .when it is set to dynamic without any embedded characters

2151728
contains	elements
creates a jquery object holding a single elements and that elements contains two elementss as children

2151758

show	next
now the next thing i want to do is .when the user click on a specific order i want to go to a page which show all the entries for that order

2151805
managed-code	c++-cli
managed-c++ and c++-cli allow you to easily write managed-code that interacts with native c++

2151807
managed-code	native-code
managed-c++ allows to more easily interop between native-code and managed-code

2151811
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i ve tested it only on ubuntu 9.10 though with google-chrome firefox epiphany and opera and it seems to work reliably in those which implies reliability in their windows counterparts

2151821
perl	php
in perl 5.10 or php 5 i d use k

2151822
arrays	loops
this will then return an arrays you can loops through

2151824
order	join
the order of join makes a difference only if you specify option force order

2151825
order	join
now if you dont want to expose your order ids in the url you could come up with some sort of other params to selected the order itself although this would required a join query in your view order controllers like customer username order date or what have you simialr to how you might see a blog permalinks as a date a title slug

2151830
selected	checkbox
.so if the top and bottom checkbox were selected in the example above _post deletemessage would contains 367 405

2151841
compare-and-swap	atomicity
sure if you have an atomicity compare-and-swap instruction

2151849
perl	php
php can cope with both perl and pthreads regexes .so you ll need to use the function for the flavour that you know

2151849
perl	php
there s a php perl regex based test site here

2151857
callback	methods
the solution was to set the background-color in the callback methods

2151865
execution	jobs
if the project was not well designed it might have problems .when it is built with multiple jobs execution in parallels

2151869
defined	declare
you need it to be defined once for the linker which is the purpose of myconstants.cpp but declare everywhere you use it which is the purpose of myconstants.h

2151901
internationalization	localization
if you want unicode characters for localization internationalization you shouldn t embed the strings in the source code

2151920
disconnect	transfer
feed it bad data use it in an illogical way disconnect the network cable during data transfer run it alongside conflicting applications

2151925

ubuntu	linux
building operating systemd linux 2.6.24-23-server i686 ubuntu

2151944
execution	exit	required	checked
on the server-side you could exit or whatever term you d required to kill the scripting by constantly checked global-variables acting as flags like cookies or sessions again assuming these would change during the execution of the scripting

2151965
font-size	width
a width of 30 - 35 em is a width that permit read comfortably and you have a fixed width fixed to the font-size

2151968
selected	checkbox
go to and selected the checkbox that says show shortcut key in screentips

2151968
contains	set
if you go to there is a very handy search feature show cmd contains .so you can find a specific cmd and then set or change the key binding if desired

2151981
superclass	inherited
you can read each of these but it wouldn t really make sense for these two to inherited from a common superclass

2151981
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
the points is that the object contains by a variables that is an interface types is guaranteed to have a specific set of methods on it even if the possible classes of the object are not related in any other way

2151989
margins	padding
should i defined width height margins padding line-height in em also if i m using em for text sizing

2152017
mcrypt	ecb
i assume it s ecb since the php docs for mcrypt tells me that ecb doesn t need an iv

2152021
font-size	width	margins	padding
for width padding margins of a text containers where it s constrained by other layout elements you might choose to have them sized independently of the font-size for aesthetics reason

2152040
contains	any
in practice this means you ll need to url encode any dynamic query-string value that have a chance of contains such characters

2152040
contains	any
therefore you need to html encode any value outputted into the markup that might contains such characters

2152044
global-asax	web-config
like modifying the web-config global-asax or machine.config

2152054
associativity	operands
if they are associativity value from the left operands will be preferred if key collider

2152063
dictionary	arrays
generally dictionary are really just a fancy wrapper around an arrays of linked lists

2152063
dictionary	arrays	linked-list	arrays	linked-list	dictionary	linked-list	tree
if a tree is implements as linked-list rather than an arrays the tree is usually more spaces efficient than a dictionary

2152063
dictionary	arrays
dictionary do not adapt well to immutability since you need to copy the entire internal arrays for every operation actually i have seen some arrays-based implementation of immutable finger tree a kind of general purpose dictionary data structure but the implementation is very complex

2152063
hashtable	sorted
you can traversal all the elements in a tree in sorted order in constants spaces and o n time whereas you d need to dump a hashtable into an arrays and sort it to get the same effect

2152076
double-quotes	single-quotes
you can with the double-quotes but not with the single-quotes

2152081
callback	methods
as i thought more about it i realized that a callback in the oop paradigms required binding an object and a methods together - enter the callback object

2152084
getter	setter
in java an immutable class is generally means that it doesn t have setter and any field that can be accessed with a getter should also be immutable

2152086
c-strings	c++
just use simple c-strings or c++ std string if you feel like compiling objective-c++

2152086
unsigned	short
as arrays of unsigned short

2152092
xmpp	irc
this is what we want to do and this too makes it real easy. irc would be great but thinking about it there s nothing inherently wrong with xmpp either

2152094
fluentvalidation	xval
it s also possible to use another validation methods fluentvalidation since these can be made to work smoothly with xval

2152099
contains	elements
i m trying to submit a form which contains dynamic elements that were added to the dom by jq after the page has completed loading

2152111
python	php
you either have to give them different namedd or depending on what you use on the server you could give them a named like to aggregate them php and i believe python deal with this

2152130
value	field
you could have all of your setter flip this to true in the event a different value is assign to one of the underlying field

2152148
joomla	drupal
many php content-management systemd such as drupal and joomla do the same sort of thing for all their links

2152155
lightbox	colorbox	fancybox	colorbox	fancybox	lightbox
you could also use some php to spit out the markup iteratively and then wrap everything into a div and employ a lightbox plugins like colorbox or fancybox

2152156
python	java
the only thing that make appengine possible is that both the python and java environment are controlled by google .so that performance scability and security issues are minimize

2152156
python	java
they don t even allow to use all the standards java python classes .so imagine the problems that could arise if they let people run any executable file

2152162
pygtk	gtk
it s probably worth noting this is more of a gtk question than a pygtk as i believe the pygtk api reflects the gtk one closely on this issue

2152166
linux	osx
i m mainly operating on mac osx 10.6 snow leopard but i also have access to linux and windows

2152179
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
in firefox google-chrome and opera there is a scrollbar that appears .when my gridpanel has an overflow of properties

2152193
interop	tlbimp
the best case is if you get a runtime callable wrapper rcw for the com object either by running tlbimp yourself on the com libs or getting a primary interop assembly pia for it usually from the com libs author

2152199
callback	methods
callback and activerecord dirty methods are definitely the way to go for this types of situation

2152234
parentheses	braces
you can place the cursor on any of the braces or parentheses and press kbd v kbd kbd kbd kbd kbd kbd s abc xyz g kbd and your search replace will have a defined scoping in which the action will occur

2152265
arrays	loops
since i assume you want to have data just defined an arrays with the size hours and the types jtextarea or whatever the data is returned as and then loops through the arrays to get the data back out

2152293
xsd	xml
also xsd has to checked whether the xml has fonts with a named that is specified in replaced_with

2152306
row	col
however i would just add a public methods getpiece int row int col that returns the piece on that square or null if there s no piece there

2152307
callback	methods
.when i submit a form using methods .post and full canvas callback url.action inside facebook iframe canvas i cannot get the form elements in the request

2152312
click	mouse
is there a delegation methods that will tell me .when the user has click the mouse in or otherwise selected my nstextfield

2152322
32-bit	64bit
the problem was that in snow leopard compilers try always to built-in 64bit while libs shipped with octave are 32-bit

2152323
getter-setter	getter
i remember having a similar problem due to using all caps in the named of the getter field or like your case ftqs have you tried changing item.ftqs to item.ftqs or even renaming your getter-setter to ftqs instead and using item.ftqs

2152326
space-complexity	time-complexity
the algorithm will have o n time-complexity and o n space-complexity

2152343
value	field
also in the valuechanged event set the from and to field to the value of the dtps you have to set both .when either dtp changes because the user will see the other one as set to today but the search value will still be min or max

2152360
directory	folder
if you dont need the default apps that come with tomcat then just go to your webapps directory where myapp is probably located and look for another folder called root in my tomcat 6

2152373
constructor	object
throw an exception-handling in the constructor therefore the object will never be created

2152395
nsscanner	nsstring
i haven t used them for a while but i think you can do this with nsstring nscharacterset and nsscanner

2152405
packets	lan
it s slow even .when synchronized relatively small tables across a lan scale terribly and required a lot of work to manually handle error conditional it ll happy produce larger packets than wcf can handle by default -- and is only able to split updates into batch-file .when syncing one way not the other. and it only works with a few selected databases the client must use ms sql compact edition as i recall unless you re willing to write your own syncadapter

2152421
any	set
you can set this on a httpwebrequest it will collect any cookies received in the response

2152421
httpwebrequest	webclient
you can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but inorder to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and overrides the protected getwebrequest methods

2152465
versioning	migrate
checked the prefixes of the migrations under database_migrations migrate and make sure you haven t copy-paste multiple versioning or created migrations out of sync with the repository

2152476
stdin	eof
i checked to see that fd_isset stdin_fileno readset is true try to read .some data from stdin recv returns 0 eof and .so i exit the process

2152491
triggers	insert
some triggers on insert and updates on the table which produces some side-effect such as adding the corresponding row id into a separate table

windows-server	windows-xp
what i am noticing is that at the points where the xml-parsing fails on windows-xp the process size on windows-server 2008 is only about 1gb iow approximately half the process size as on windows-xp

2152492
32-bit	64bit
why would a 32-bit application running in 32-bit mode consume half the amount of memory on a 64bit operating systemd

2152492
windows-server	windows-xp
acknowledging that my application seems to be using half the amount of memory on windows-server 2008 does anyone have any ideas as to why the xml-parsing would be failing on windows-xp

if i understand correctly i encapsulate a pointers within a stack object and .when auto_ptr becomes out of scoping it automatically call delete on the pointed object

2152501
exception-handling	error-handling
b error-handling exception-handling framework - to assist in distinguishing messages that can be show to user versus handled within the code and logged

2152505
32-bit	64bit
you can t load 32-bit components in a 64bit application but you can wrap the component in its own process and use ipc to leverage the features of the component

2152517
value	field
.so the user fills in the field with the appropriate value and .when he click on add the constructor is called

2152520

also .when i tried to use show function after hide it gives 2-3 of a same error applies .when the windows either active and inactive

2152602
pointers	stack
auto_ptr and shared_ptr simply keep an instances of the pointers and because they are local stack object they get deallocated .when they go out of scoping

2152603
ubuntu	linux
that extension is install by default for security reasons on some linux distributions -- ubuntu provides it by default for example if i remember correctly

as it turns out the real problem was a misconfiguration in the urls.py file that wasn t sending the .post from the login form to the correct handler which is why it kept trying to use another authentication methods

2153225
constructor	object
.when i m coding oo i have the constructor do just enough work to get the object in a consistent state

2153225
constructor	object

temporary	rvalue
in your code you are insisting on supplying a temporary rvalue object of types vector2f on the right-hand side of assignment

2153313
temporary	rvalue
this means that the reference parameter of the is initializer with a temporary rvalue of class types

2153313
temporary	copy
according to he language specifications 8.5.3 5 the compiler is allowed to copy that temporary object as many time as it wants before actually attaching the reference

2153313
temporary	rvalue
you are still supplying the right-hand side in form of a temporary rvalue

2153327
instance-variables	class-variables
note only the instance-variables of b will be accessible from object a not class b s class-variables

2153330
difference	zero
note that the problem is not due to difference in floating-point exception-handling between platform nor is due to the delightful way that powerpc allows divide-by-zero int just returning zero as these areas have already been audited and addressed thanks hugely to pc-lint

2153330
64bit	x86
one possibility is that the powerpc has a large numbers of temporary registers that can store 64bit intermediate value whereas the x86 code may have to unload and reload the fpu truncation to 4 bytes and losing precision

linux	bsd
i ve gone .so far to try to compile the bsd comm.c .source code on the linux box but i got

2153374
constructor	object
basically reserve the object using malloc instead of new thereby bypassing the constructor then call the overloaded new-operator .when you truly want to construct the object via placement-new

2153374
constructor	object
the base constructor should perform the bare minimum to get your object into a serviceable state whilst other overloaded constructor may perform more work as needed

2153389

this would allow you to bind those sub controls to your user-controls s properties while still allowing any users of your control to set it s data context to their viewmodel and bind to the properties as well

2153832
perl	c++
this would be a suitable task for a scripting-language like perl but you can also easily do it in c or c++

2153852
http	ssl
i expect that this problem happens .when your application is establishing an ssl http connection

2153860
sql-server	mysql
in sql-server you d do this with include columns but i think in mysql you d need to just include the others too

constructor	object
then you can force x to have only one non-copy constructor that takes an xparams as its sole arguments and checked that each necessary parameter has been set inside that xparams object

2153941
value	field
this works wonderfully if you don t really have to do anything with the object before it is completely populate perhaps other than trivial stuff like get the field value back

2153945
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
.when you have less homogeneous hierarchy this advice hasn t much sense how would anyone apply it to cases .when derived-class introduces new functions or inherited them from another base-class

2153989
arrays	loops
php is loosely typed .so you can use a foreach loops on as.sociativity and mixed arrays not only pure numeric arrays

2154064
specifications	w3c
from the w3c encoding specifications

2154070
constructor	object	value	field
if by value-object you mean object that can only be created by passing value to constructor not by binding to field i think you have these solutions

2154070

arrays	loops
for instances it is easy to add a checked to the inner loops to see if any swaps have been made if not then the arrays is sorted and you can finish perhaps saving most of the work

2154396
subclassing	superclass
the reason a non-final methods is dangerous in initialization is because the instances initialization of the superclass execute before the subclassing is initializer

2154396
subclassing	superclass
therefore if the non-final methods is overrides in the subclassinging and is execute during the initialization of the superclass it may be accessing uninitialized field of the subclassing giving erroneous results

2154398

2154423
sql-server	oracle
on a slight aside i rather suspecificationst that the jdbc specifications was written to conform closely to the sybase and by associations sql-server way of doing things because the way stored-procedures are handled in jdbc is a remarkably good fit for those systemd and a poor fit for oracle s

2154460

you should be able to view the ajax response in firebug and see what is gtting posted back to you - you can get a 200 error but still get an error in the postback

2154945
boolean	int
since the types is determined automatically by the build-system boolean int floats and strings i wondered if there is any way to force the datatypes to string

panels	grid
because i can just attach them as child controls to the parent and the grid dock panels just make life easier

2155012
controllers	routes
fyi i wrote an article on testing your routes and that would be a very good idea because it would catch router errors early before they interfere with controllers

2155040
beautifulsoup	lxml
you re better off using the tried-and-true 3rd party modules out there like lxml or beautifulsoup that are not only more resilient to errors but will also give you exactly what you are looking for with little trouble

2155046
json	xml
you can add a datasource which can be a json file or an xml file or and rss feed

2155103
scala	java	primitive	int
the error arises from the different boxing of primitive int in scala and java

2155103
primitive	int
is it a primitive int

2155103
scala	java
anyway the comparator methods is defined on both java.lang.integer and scala.runtime.richint java and scala s boxed int respectively

2155104
apache-fop	batik
you can use apache-fop s free batik svg toolkit which has a transcoder api to transform svg to pdf

2155107
contains	set
i have a layout with a set of divs each contains three field in different fonts display as

2155141
ref	out
.when you get to the part of interpreting methods parameters it gets really messy ref and out keyword for example

2155141
reflection	runtime
alternatively you could first feed the code to the compiler at runtime and then use reflection on the newly created assembly

2155152
.when	ready
to do this i am imposing a content freeze on the existing versioning copying the site to a new location updating it we are making a lot of changes then .when ready moving the new site to the old site location

2155157
ip-address	hostname
you can setup a duplicates iis containers on a different ip-address hostname

2155174
triggers	insert
a triggers will allow you to execute a bit of programming logic stored directly in the triggers or in an external database object whenever the recording changes insert updates delete

2155179
value	field
instead of assign the value to the zone area create an hidden form field with a different named that will hold that value for you

2155195
arrays	loops
i m writing some arm inline-assembly code that works on a huge arrays of c struct in a loops and stores some data into another arrays

grid.filtering.clearfiltering will clear the filtering on page-refresh i.e it will uncheck the checkbox and all the recording are display but the text in the textbox is not cleared

2155271
dictionary	arrays
.so this involves .some simple grouping of your dictionary into arrays

2155273
temporary	copy
f takes a structure by value a temporary copy is made of it typically on stack and f also returns a different structure which is copy-paste into mybar

2155293
subclassing	inherited
if not then instead of trying to add it to 500 classes you might want to spend the time refactoring and subclassing the base object into your own then have all the classes inherited from that

2155321
svnadmin	dump
well im assuming youve already actually migrate the repository via svnadmin dump svnadmin load .so in that case you could try svn switching --relocate if you get the same error you might actually have to just do a new svn co

2155322
cos	sin
y sin x cos x

2155334
subclassing	base-class
i have a base-class order with a set of subclassing productorder specialorder partsorder etc

2155340
aggregate	grouping
using max min or any of the other aggregate can only handle one duplicates row per grouping

2155350
value	field
most of the field need to be converted to decimal or int value to do any calculation .so is it best to just ignore the data types and use strings in the database

2155350
value	field
one other alternative i have considered is to have two columns for every field one to hold the string value and one to hold the actual parsing value-type

2155353
value	field
as you can see i named the first one value and the second one field

2155355
configuration	environment
.when you checkout your git-repo on a prod environment the smudge process will produce a prod-like configuration file in the resulting working tree

2155390
kerberos	ssl
edit 2 another well known tool qaload de microfocus and for java applets jmeter but you have to make sure that these tools supports all of the features such web-services ssl kerberos soap xml etc

2155392
constructor	object
constructor and destructor are called .when object is created and destroy respectively they do not get invoked in case of reference and pointers

2155395
contains	set
note that i bound the itemscontrol to a collectionviewsource that its source is set the compositecollection it s view becomes a compositecollectionview it s an internal types if i explicit set its types to listcollectionview it only contains the collectioncontainers as its items

2155395
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
desired solution is a workaround to enable sorting filtering and grouping on a compositecollections i don t care to overrides and create my own compositecollection i just don t know how i can overrides this and enable its functionality in xaml

2155406
pygtk	gtk
if your versioning of gtk pygtk is recent enough key-events have a attributes

2155406
pygtk	gdk
it s not documented in the pygtk reference but it s in the gdk api documentation and is exposed through pygtk

2155432
shell	bash
writing java building scripting in bash or any other shell language has a numbers of problems

2155441
diagram	erd
i think you should create an erd diagram and map it to the tables in the following way

2155449
contains	any
however it s perfectly possible and quite common at least in small swing programs and applets to have the class that contains the main be an otherwise normals class that is initializer and used like any other class

2155452
directory	folder
i have this scripting to display all the files within the directory the scripting is in but i will have a directory that will contains multiple folder with document in each

2155452
directory	folder
i want to do this because this directory will have additional folder and files added to it

2155477
versioning	upgrade
this means that the next versioning s install doing a windows-install major upgrade will fail because it is unable to first remove the previous versioning

2155484
implements	abstract
make it virtual if it has a suitable default implementsation return no details or null or abstract if it makes sense that all order types must implements it

2155491
function-overloading	implicit	defined	declare
i use templatess to achieve function-overloading without the mess of implicit types conversions declare the function templates defined desired specialization overloads

2155497
enumerator	any
but the enumerator titleelement does not return any result

2155499
any	set
the set of strings which are legal methods declarations is not a regular-language in any versioning of c#

2155499
abstract	sealed
unsafe extern new overrides virtual abstract sealed methods

2155502
hide	show
toggle hide or show elements

2155505
click	mouse
in fact you might think about collecting the coordinates of the mouse click in whatever arbitrary coordinate systemd you want and then mapping those coordinates to opengl coordinates

2155510
implements	final
i m trying to implements a lazy-evaluation paginator mechanism where a div s content will be updates onscroll but i d like the handle on the scrollbar to show the final size

2155516
identifier	temporary
to enforce having a valid function named you could use a macros that gets the function pointers does some dummy operation with it assign it to a compatible function types temporary variables to checked that it s indeed a valid function identifier and then stringifies with # the function named before being used as a key

2155527
selected	button
.when you click the button you will somehow need to navigate from the selected item in the combobox to a picturebox

2155532
firefox	opera
perhaps this does the trick in ie and firefox not in opera

2155539
selected	listbox
the best solution is to use some javascript to change the selectedindex of the listbox whenever one of the dashes is selected

2155555
contains	elements
it is useful in situations .when the specifications string contains more than one elements eg.

2155572
revision	svn
think about it this way your new repository s head revision is x your old repository s revision is y .so what is svn supposed to do with the working copy s base revision

2155583
grails	spock
using grails 1.2.0 and the latest spock 0.4-snapshot as of 01 28 2010 10 18 est i m getting compilation errors that the groovy compiler is unable to find

2155622
selected	checkbox
i want to get a list of named of checkbox that are selected in a div with certain id

2155625
queue	fifo
there s a single-linked list here recipe 17.14 in the python cookbook 1st ed but it s hardly mature or rich -- it s just doing a fifo queue .so it s pretty minimal

2155648
hash	md5
md5 hash

2155671
google-chrome	firefox
- with keydown or keypress is working fine for firefox and google-chrome

2155689
drupal	modx
for a long time for me modx and drupal were the only viable options to use as a cms on a project unless it was something 100 custom - and 90 of the time modx won that arguments

2155705
key-value	key
if you mean that your table has composite primary key comprised of more than one field in that table then subsonic doesn t support it - see updates a primary key-value using subsonic 2.2

2155742
return-value	arguments
the address of the caller s data return-value is actually passed as a hidden arguments to the function and the createdata function simply writes into the caller s stack frame

2155744
keyboard	mouse
i use the mouse sometimes in concert with my left hand on the keyboard

2155758
contains	any
a static-class can only contains static-methods and can never be initializer whereas the instances of a singleton may be used in the same way as any other object

2155765
multiplication	polynomials
defined a multiplication operators on polynomials

2155792
postback	ajax
in the ajax javascript pageload function that is called on every partials postback i re-bind events because they are lost in the asp.net partials postback

2155798
keyboard	mouse
the more i used the keyboard movement in vim the less i wanted to use the mouse

2155798
keyboard	mouse
it doesn t help that extended periods of time where i m constantly moving from keyboard to mouse can take a toll on my wrist

2155818
click	mouse
instead of detectionion the blur detection the document.body or windows click and grab the mouse points

2155820
datetime-format	utc
if you want datetime-format to interpreter the string as a date-and-time given in the utc time zone append an explicit time zone to the parsing string

2155821
javascript	dom
you could write an onpaste function in javascript which chops up the paste string in to 4character blocks and them writes them to the appropriate textbox s via the dom

2155844
put	get
the existing code uses a wrapper around a xercesdomparsingr to parsing the xml as it comes in and after using setdonamespaces and setdoxinclude to true it is attempting to parsing the xinclude but i get a persistent fatal include failed and no fallback elements found in document 0 error no matter where in the directory-structure i put testguioutput.xml

2155854
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works just fine in firefox 3.6 safari windows and google-chrome windows

2155860
ip-address	hostname
try connecting to the ip-address instead of the dns hostname

2155862
highlight	selected
the selectedindex is changed and highlight gray but if i click on it the selected index is blue

2155881
scala	java
although development stalled for a while because i m busy with other duties it already contains some examples of scala - java integration

2155881
scala	java
while working on gimd i found that using java from scala is mostly easy and seamless the contrary is not always true

2155881
scala	java
it s not really a fault of scala as it s simple manifestation that java is a less expressive language

2155894
contains	elements
how do i get the coordinates of the left side of the contains elements

2155896
keyboard	mouse
the mouse seems fast but in reality it isn t precise .so you lose time in addition to the constants back and forth with the keyboard

2155903
default-value	default
if you need to do that you are usually better off changing the default-value to some kind of sentinal value null often works well in db stored-procedures and putting some logic in the procedure to set the value to you old default 15 in this case if null is received

2155906
any	set
there is a rubylib environment variables that can be set to any folder on the systemd

2155918
32-bit	64bit
the problem is that you cannot export any 32-bit servicedcomponent from com+ applications properly on windows 2008 64bit because of the way the registry and catalog have changed

2155920
constructor	object
i definitely like suggestion numbers 2 but i think that it misses something important that is found in 3 namely that if a child object cannot exist without a parent it should take a parent object in its constructor

2155931
push	pull
devs with required ssh-keys can push local changes to the code on github backup to github .so any bug fixed or new features that would be of benefit to all project using the plugins module can pull them down too

2155955
asp.net-mvc	webforms
use asp.net-mvc if you don t want to deal with viewstate theform and other webforms related issues

2155955
webforms	asp.net
the short answer is that you need all this if you want to properly use asp.net webforms

2155961
asp.net-mvc	webforms
which mentality is better for that classic webforms or asp.net-mvc

2155971
object-reference	instances
every way i try to checked i always get the error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2155986
32-bit	64bit
i can t get scipy to function in 32-bit mode .when compiled as a i386 x86_64 universal binary and execute on my 64bit 10.6.2 macpro1 1

2155995
32-bit	x86
if you can live with 32-bit complile all of your assemblies as x86

2156004
javascript	dom
storing it in the javascript itself will should always be more performant as you won t have to go through the dom to retrieve the value

2156031
implements	abstract
-- implements a high-level seemingly abstract data structure like a linked-list in assembly isn t as hard as it sounds

2156031
queue	fifo
.so linked lists are a nice way to implements an arbitrarily long fifo queue of large object

2156031
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	heap
another thing to be careful about is that for small object or where you allocate object from a conventional heap instead of a custom free pool arrays can be faster because copying isn t really that slow if it s not done that often and the repeated allocation from the heap that a linked-list would required every time a new elements is added is slow

2156031
arrays	loops
i like to run loops a few million time with linked lists and arrays with small and large object and time how long each takes in real time

2156064
derived-class	base-class
the pointers of derived-class returned by new can be types cast to the pointers of its base-class

2156064
derived-class	base-class
generally how to cast a pointers of derived-class to a pointers of its base-class

2156069
octal	hex
is there a function or libs that can convert any default octal hex ... int in c given as a into an unsigned long-long int

2156071
derived-class	base-class
conversion from a pointers to a derived-class to a pointers to a base-class is implicit

2156078
derived-class	base-class
this is the whole points of polymorphism an instances of a derived-class should always be safely usable as an instances of the base-class

2156092
genshi	mako	jinja2	genshi	jinja2	mako
consider genshi mako jinja2 django-templates or more

2156110
associations	model
another approach might be to updates your ef model to include the lookup tables add associations between the tables add include s in the auto-gen d metadata class and let ef and ria do it for you

2156112
derived-class	inherited
that s true if derived-class inherited publicly and non-virtually from base

2156114
value	field
i have a django admin interface and in the model listing i want a custom column that will be a hyperlink using one of the field value

2156120
cglib	bcel
javassit bcel or cglib might be use to generator a dedicated cloner as fast as one hand writed

2156127
32-bit	64bit	any	set
you can set it to any cpu and it will run on 32-bit or 64bit depending on your .app pool settings and as long as your other dependent dlls are also compiled with any cpu

2156127
32-bit	64bit
if you are using unmanaged code or reference assemblies you need to get the specific 32-bit and 64bit versioning of that assembly.if you have 32-bit assemblies and if you enable 32-bit .applications in your .app pool they would be run in wow64 mode

2156127
32-bit	64bit
regardless of your pe header pe32 or pe32+ if your 32-bit is set to 0 you can run it on a 64bit .app pool.even if it is set to 1 and if it is not signed you can set it to 0 but might not be worth taking the risk and run it on 64bit .app pool

2156128
versioning	upgrade
.when i say that it doesn t work i mean that using the resulting install does not attempt to do an upgrade like it would if i manually increased the versioning string in the product properties table from inside installshield

2156145
decimal	octal
other than that you need want to pass 0 as the conversion base in which case it implements the usual c conventions that a leading 0 signalss octal 0x signalss hexadecimal and 1-9 signals decimal

2156155
stderr	stdout
if i m doing something stupid in the java code not clearing my stdout stderr buffering why is it only an issue on this machine

2156161
put	get
...i get undefined .when i put this variables in an alert within the success function

2156162
principles	srp
but if you follow the srp single responsability principles then i think that order methods is in most of the circumstances a non-issue

2156168
constructor	private
since visual-studio has tools for navigating quickly to methods by named i prefer to put private member variables and constructor close to the top and grouping methods by functionality ie helpers methods are close by to the methods that call them

2156175
put	get
or will there be any need to itake the help of php to process one loops and based on the value that i get i put some conditional to apply rules that the client wants

2156183
children	nodes
match elements where numbers of words below would exceed total copy the current nodes but not its children and continue process at first child

2156188
postgresql	mysql
if you are doing tests on mysql you should store the results in a different database such as postgresql this way you won t increase the load with your operations

2156216
put	get
getting data from directly database wit security issues getting specified text from php value that are put in special divs or getting all content of php and styling into sidebar with without get .post methods or whatever it is

2156220
invalidoperationexception	nullreferenceexception
edit by 280z28 changed nullreferenceexception to invalidoperationexception which is what throw .when hasvalue is false

2156222
derived-class	base-class
on the one hand a pointers to derived-class can be converted to a pointers to a base-class assuming the base is accessible

2156222
derived-class	base-class
but downcasting are casts in the opposite directions from a pointers to a base-class to a pointers to derived-class

2156222
required	checked
downcasting can be performed by both dynamic_cast and static_cast depending on what you need and what amount of runtime checked you required

2156231
lookup	any
are there any other bits of information available either in javascript or php short of grabbing the ip-address and doing a lookup to determine this

2156241

2156296
json	xml
this is of limited usefulness for service you control as it s usually better to pass back all information in the json or xml of the response body but it could be useful for talking to service whose interfaces you don t have control over that put useful information in the headers

2156298
key-value	key
an arrays can t have more than one key-value pair with the same key

2156306

2156339
user-controls	ascx
can you set a javascript breakpoints in a user-controls ascx page

2156344
webforms	asp.net
while you can place controls on the page that will emit javascript control validation and there are a variety of ways in which javascript is employed to simplify webforms development asp.net it isn t really about client-side programming in the same way that jquery is

2156345
attributes	properties
if you named a properties id but do not put an validation attributes on it but isvalid says it is required

2156385
contains	any
the include-path must not contains any upward relativity such as ..

match any single character not within the specified range for example a - f or set for example abcdef

2156553
wordpress	blogs
instead of using the thumbnail images from the wordpress gallery as in the page above i want to have thumbnails of actual blogs

2156568
selected	cell
commenters helpfully pointed out that you can toggle relative addressing for a formula in the currently selected cell with these keyboard shortcuts

2156581
implements	final
updates final got it working and implements a smallest windows first heuristics to improve process time .

2156585
value	field
how can i arrange it .so that any access to colour either returns the value stored in the field or if the field is blank null then it returns red

2156590
while-loop	loops
then a while-loop can be insert in the c# code to checked that this hidden properties exists loops break only .when the properties value is loaded correctly then put the rest of your code after the while-loop

2156605
memory-access	numa
one issue with nehalem is the fact that even though there is a very fast interconnect between the cores they have non-uniform memory-access numa which can lead to lower performance and less predictable results

2156609
instrumentation	debugging
you might want to vote for this related connect item - getting call stack information can be really useful to be able to instrumentation code and debugging situations

2156612
background-image	width
there s no need to do separate img elements for each star only thing you need is two spans which have the stars as an background-image and then just apply a proper width to those spans

2156618
highlight	cell
the easiest way to defined a named is to highlight the cell or range then click on the named box in the formula bar

2156628
perl	php
most probably some smart php or perl scripting generator some standards heading content for all the pages in the site

2156662
function-overloading	function-parameter
named-mangling incorporates information about the function-parameter and return types into a function named that s what makes function-overloading possible

2156669
colorbox	jquery
in reference to another question i found how can i dynamically resize the jquery colorbox plugins

2156688
numeric	zero
0 is just the syntax for saying this function is pure virtual. it has nothing to do with initialization or null pointers or the numeric value zero although the similarity to those things may have mnemonic value

2156691
reserved-words	keyword
c++ has always shied away from introducing new keyword since new reserved-words break old programs which use these words for identifier

2156693
unique	words
.when your done you have a total count to determine the unique wordss .sort the list and in a loops see if the current words is different from the previous one...if .so then increment your unique words count

2156737
constructor	private
you could make your class have a private constructor and a public function called getinstance

2156747
assign	add
assign a unique id to each row and for each row that is expanded add the row s id into an arrays

2156749
derived-class	inherited
constructor are not inherited you have to write them explicit for the derived-class

2156760
.net	wcf
depending on you wcf endpoint binding wshttpcontextbinding for instances you can keep that soap format to exchange messages with .net service

2156783
shutdown	restart
what about whether to have a device class with a pair of shutdown restart methods vs

2156787
scala	java
unfortunately i don t know any open source project but i have worked on very large project over the last few years that have java and scala integration and my experience has been mostly very positive

2156787
scala	java
in general i find the integration between scala and java very close to using one language

2156827
any	set
but i don t see any option to set the id on the rendering ul tag

2156830
value	field
you could use a function that returns the value of a query-string parameter and then set the form field accordingly

2156830
value	field
then set the form field value using jquery

2156851
contains	elements
if we want to create an elements containss both simple content thus one of the built-in datatypess and attributes then instead of using elements we instead must declare complex types and specify that this complex types will contains simple content

2156851
contains	elements
b do we use instead of elements due to the fact that derived-class will be of complex types even if it contains simple content

2156852
.when	ready
.when i m ready to handle the form-submit i do this

2156852
value	field
in my systemd i often have to place several field on the page to collect value for one testing item the systemd here comes from a fitness testing page

2156862
udp	osc
i want to send osc messages from iphone to another programme max msp by creating and connecting to a udp socket

2156873
any	set
i posted on my blog about how i ve set this up after i didn t have much luck finding any online examples working through this scenario either

2156879
any	set
are there any set rules or best practices that i should know about

2156892
python	java
i m new to python coming from java and c

2156892
arrays	loops
in java or c chars and int are practically interchangeable and in certain loops it s very useful to me to be able to do increment chars and index arrays by chars

2156913
derived-class	inherited	protected	public
1 in protected inherited the public and protected members become protected members in the derived-class

2156913
derived-class	base-class
however the derived-class can never access the private-members of the base-class is that right

2156913
protected	public
the derived-class can access the public and protected members in both cases

2156913
derived-class	base-class
2 i noticed that the private-members of the base-class will never be touch by the derived-class

2156920
implements	extends
can anybody please points me to a example or a simple c++ class that implements this .so i can study it and extends from there

2156936
attributes	properties
note that the if and unless attributes take properties named not expression

2156961
private-members	data-members	private-members	object
2 they re inherited in the sense that an object of types derived .when stored in memory include all of the data-members of derived and base including private-members of base

2156961
private-members	object
the private-members can t just go away since .when methods of base run on that object they will need to access base s private-members

2156963
protected	public
1a protected inherited means the child can access everything it could in public inherited but others using that object can only see the public interface to the child anything in it s parent is hidden

2156963
base-class	inherited
2 private-members are inherited because methods in the base-class might need them to operate on

2156966
compatibility	platform
the advantage of doing this on the client side is that you won t have to worry about what the backend platform supports only browser compatibility

2156968
protected	public
public and protected members become

2156968
protected	public
access the public and protected

2156968
derived-class	base-class
because they are part of the base-class and you need the base-class which is a part of your derived-class

2156968
member-functions	base-class	protected	public
note you can still manipulate some state if any maintained in the base-class using non-overriden public protected member-functions

2156982
derived-class	base-class	protected	public
derived-classes can access protected and public members of it s base-class and the derived-class can not access the private-members of it s base-class

2156982
private-members	private	base-class	inherited	protected	public
the private-members are inherited for the following reason the base-class can defined a protected or public function that modifies the base-class s private member

2156985
constructor	object
the explicit keyword means that a single-arguments constructor cannot be used to implicit convert a variables of the arguments types to an object of the construct types

2156985
constructor	object
for example your constructor from is explicit .so the compiler will never implicit convert a to a new object of types exception-handling without you writing out exception-handling .some string here

2156985
copy-constructor	constructor
.so by taking the constructor that would otherwise be the copy-constructor and marking it with the explicit keyword you have completely eliminated its ability to make copies

2156996
derived-class	base-class	protected	public
specifying private protected or public .when inheriting from a base-class does not change anything access-wise on the derived-class itself

2156996
derived-class	base-class
those access specifiers tell the compiler how to treat the base-class members .when instances of the derived-class are used elsewhere or if the derived-class happens to be used as a base-class for other classes

2157000
http-request	httpresponse
the page .source is the the raw html that is returned from the webserver .so you can get this text by simply submission an http-request to google and reading the httpresponse

2157010
oracle	mysql
for mysql oracle use concat column string

2157046
ruby-on-rails	django
i am a fan of big agile methodology and love to develop webpage using django and ruby-on-rails

2157046
ruby-on-rails	django
however it creates a big constrain as there are really very few django or ruby-on-rails developers to hire

2157046
stripes	spring	stripes	wicket	wicket	spring
i can think of spring hibernate stripes struts and wicket for java

2157051
required	checked
if there is data in the tables that is critical to controlling program flow data-as-code and not just data that is process by the program you might consider trimming your data to the bare minimum required and checked in just the resulting stubs tables by adding them manually to the repo

2157072
mouseleave	mouseout
try using the mouseleave event rather than the mouseout according to the api

2157105
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
if any query contains a set based operation it required all the recording before it could output the results i.e an order by clause within your statement. but if you have no set based iterator you could expect the rows to be streamed to you as they become available

2157112
updating	updates
the best way to batch-file an updates like this is to walk the clustered index. i m not sure if that term makes sense in the dbms you re using but essentially it means to choose the chunks you updates during each loops based on the order they will be found in the table object that you re updating

2157141
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am a asp.net-mvc c# developer primarily but had the opportunity of doing some ruby-on-rails development before i move from traditional asp.net webforms to asp.net-mvc

2157146
network-interface	packets
inaddr_any is only for listening server to tell the ip stack that it wants to listen on any network-interface versus a specific interface on a multi-homed machine. the client needs explicit server address of the server to send packets to

2157179
radio-button	selected
if i selected second radio-button 4 5 6 will be added t dropdownlistbox

2157179
radio-button	selected
all these are created using java script.here my problem is ididt selected the drpdownlist value .when i selected any radio-button

2157191
put	get
.when i run this query in sql-server 2008 management studio it returns me id 1 but .when i put this query into report query designer - i get the next error

2157192
constructor	object
this is useful if you ve a numbers of constructor or want to call a pure-virtual function but it doesn t much help other than to allow you to structure your code in stages you could avoid calling init if early checked fail and mark the object as invalid

2157202
optgroup	selected
the genuine bug is that selected with optgroup is pretty much broken in the django development versioning right now at least for use with a model form

2157202
optgroup	selected
the second bug or misunderstanding is that with ordinary not optgroup selected blank false default a36 doesn t work if the field is disabled as by javascript and no selection is made

2157246
administration	account
if the elevation happens on central administration then it s a farm admin account

2157247
selected	listbox
the bug occurs if you .post a listbox which has nothing selected

2157247
listbox	textbox
i have a report that accepts two dates from textbox and one or more selection from a listbox

2157247
selected	listbox
everything works except for validation if the listbox is left with nothing selected

2157270
show	next
without the order by clause the server will normally send each recording as its found .so the first recording will often show up .sooner but you may see a long pause between one recording and the next

2157289
document	editing
- each document types has different form-for editing document

2157289
contains	elements
some may contains bullet auto-numbering of some elements borders indentation different font-styles line breaks... some may not

2157289
document	editing
- to create generator for editing forms and generator for view forms for each document types the systemd which we have now

2157310
value	field
i also needed a list of all the possible value for the field types

2157319
loading	gif
then run your ajax function and on success replace the loading gif with the loaded content

2157327
value	field
a form field value like 45 234 is to be insert into the db as 45234

2157327
value	field
.so how do insert the 45234 .when the form field costofshares contains a value with comma

2157365
authentication	impersonation
disable impersonation should you have enabled it most likely not and set the authentication in iis to anonymous with the account you wish to run under

2157389
jquery	.post
i understand i have to use jquery .post and i ve had several attempts but for some reason my webpage keeps reload

2157405
locale	french
or if french standards is already your systemd standards systemd default locale just use

2157427
authentication	login
it seems redundant to send an already authentication user to the login page .when they don t have permission

2157436
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox a break a line but in google-chrome the line continue

2157443
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
another parsing javascript-engine like ie 6 7 8 safari or google-chrome might execute this code even though firefox s parsing and javascript-engine don t

2157443
sniffing	packets
use packets sniffing software wireshark to detection the attack string rather than charles

2157457
constructor	private	constructor	object
another option we have is to make the primary object constructor private and use a companion-object s apply methods as a builder

2157460
required	checked
cf like php or ruby-on-rails are all scripting languages and as such required no build-process checked out the source into production is very straightforward

2157462
scala	java
or rather let s consider it from a java points of view since scala is compatible with java at the jvm level and it surely must obey jvm rules

2157471
any	set
for example any set methods will obviously need to set variables .so it s not the case that you should put const everywhere

2157496
log4net	nlog
it has it s own logging api and we also have adaptor for log4net nlog and the object guy s logging framework postsharp too

2157506
deep-copy	object
how can i get a deep-copy of this object without using serialization

2157511
value	field
the jquery part is nothing special just put some textual representation of the value in the field and later read it from the field

2157511
value	field
you either have to turn the field into a server control using change it for a hidden-field control or read the value from request.form or request.querystring and put the value in the field that is put in the new page

2157517
slidedown	slideup
personally i like to use slideup and slidedown rather than slidetoggle

2157526
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari are still acting as they used to

2157526
google-chrome	safari
naturally google-chrome and safari still work as expected and only give the viewable size

2157527
value	field
however if you really want to do it and you re in a full trust environment then of course you can do some dirty stuff using formatterservices.getuninitializedobject and then using reflection to copy the field value from one object to the other

2157588
display	width
although both flipping and rotating appear to work at first if i flip while in landscape mode the flipped view is sort of cropped to portrait width although actually display in landscape rotation then doesnt fix it u have to flip back rotate back to portrait then flip back again

2157591
linked-list	nodes	binary-tree	nodes	binary-tree	linked-list
this is like a regular binary-tree but each leaf nodes points to next previous subtree .so it can be iterated through as efficiently as a linked-list

2157605
contains	any
decoupling the classes allows the viewmodel to contains only the properties from the domain model that are needed plus any additional properties

2157636
linux	unix
as i understand it different linux distributions and other unix like systemd have different conventions for binary formats

2157640
communication	messages
generally the best communication technology between flash flex and a server is the adobe messages format

2157643
derived-class	base-class
normally there couldn t be more than one methods with a single string parameter but it can happen if you re looking at a derived-class which hide a base-class methods with exactly the right parameter list and named

2157654
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2157658
any	set
using this approach you could easily set aside certain key for n sets of serial work while round robining over the remaining key for the work that can go in any old order or alternatively you can keep certain pipe threads hot by judicious key selection

2157702
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.1.7 gecko 20091221 firefox 3.5.7

2157702
firefox	safari
i ve been researching and it looks like the problem is that firefox is attempting to preflight the request because of the custom headers while safari isn t and is instead just sending the custom headers without first checked if they re valid

2157703
literals	hardcode
i changed the query parameter to a hardcode int literals for this test.

2157705
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of hudson hudson ver

2157739
value	field
.when the form is submitted however the value assign to the form field does not have the line break

2157745
reflection	runtime
.when you mark something with an annotations the compiler and runtime arrange for an object of that class to be visible at runtime via java reflection

2157749
.net	wcf
i have a .net wcf service hosted on an iis 2008 server

2157769
textarea	textbox
textbox doesn t holds n only textarea does

2157769
value	field
what you can do is .post the data yourself to the controllers or store the value in hidden field and submit the form and read the hidden field in the server if you don t have much control there match the named to the hidden field

2157779
checkbox	button
edit originally i mentioned radio button this is wrong - checkbox is correct

2157784
data-structures	tree
it is essential for understanding and proving the properties of algorithms on tree and other inductively defined data-structures

sql-server	ms-access
see here for details about creating linked-server instances on sql-server 2005 to ms-access

2157827
haskell	lisp	haskell	erlang	erlang	lisp
indeed most functional languages like lisp haskell and erlang are derived from mathematics

2157827
lambda-calculus	type-systems
haskell is actually a result-of proving that lambda-calculus can be used to implements type-systems

2157827
haskell	lisp
.so haskell like lisp was born out of pure mathematics

2157827
haskell	lisp
you can certainly explain lisp and haskell syntax to mathematicians and they would treat it as a game

2157827
haskell	lisp	haskell	scheme	haskell	erlang	erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme	scheme	lisp
.so have a look at lisp scheme erlang and haskell if you want

2157850
contains	elements
also i ve tried save for web and devices.. but .when saving it creates a .html file and a single image which contains every elements

2157868
value	field
set the commandname and commandargument field in the gridview then you can access those value in the code-behind

2157868
selected	button
.so say you have an image button in every row and .when a user selected the button you want to access the cmd named and parameter for that row

2157875
base-class	inherited
the problem seems to be that it doesn t recognize the base-class from the inherited tag

2157900
salt	md5
.when passing data to another php scripting using get or .post should i encrypt it with a md5 with salt

2157910
processor	cpu
consequently it s pretty perverse really to seriously consider this as an option for shaving a few machine cycles .when we re multiple generations of processor beyond the points .when it was considered to be a good trade-off of cpu vs complexity to aid clean maintainable code

2157932
http	ssl
if you re transmitting critical data credit-card bank account or social security numbers you should use a secure ssl connection http

2157937
silverlight	wpf
simple think in wpf world should be the same in silverlight

2157980
mouseenter	mouseover
the mouseenter event is usually a better choice than mouseover

2157980
event-bubbling	mouseover	event-bubbling	mouseenter	mouseenter	mouseover
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles event-bubbling

2157988
contains	any
i ve poked around all the other properties of ixmlhttprequest and i can t find any that contains the response s actual status text

2157988
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
internet-explorer google-chrome and firefox manage to read the actual status text

2157992
document	editing
as for the editing of the xml document i think it will be even trickier

2157997
mips	x86	powerpc	arm
and seeing as on my laptop i have compilers for x86 x86_64 two kinds of mips powerpc arm and avr.

2158014
variables	boolean
sometimes a simple well named boolean variables does the trick

2158022
cucumber	webrat
in terms of using cucumber with ruby-on-rails webrat is considered the standards way of faking a request through the web stack - it is pretty powerful and results in nice readable step definitions

2158023
authentication	impersonation
we are currently able to authentication the client using windows-authentication but with impersonation

2158056
exception-handling	error-handling
error-handling you should close reader in finally section or use usings clause which guarantees freeing resources in case of exception-handling

2158090
ssas	olap
if you re using olap as in analysis service then i m not experienced enough with that to help you but i would think there d be ways to choose the database to connect to just like in ssrs and that queries don t have to live in the database but could live in the ssas application

2158091
json	xml
json would be better suited for this purpose than xml imho

2158106
.net	wcf
we re using the .net 3.5 framework and we re not ready to move to wcf

2158106
.net	wcf
if you re using .net 3.5 and not wcf yet and you still want to do basic web-services do you still go the service reference route and just not use the wcf framework

2158160
contains	set
if i have a class that contains for example a list string and i want other classes to be able to see the list but not set it i can declare

2158165
keydown	keyup
although the silverlight textbox class does not support a keypress event it does have a keydown and a keyup event that can be used to retrieve character information .when a key is entered into the textbox

2158168
virtual-functions	base-class	base-class	inherited
both private and protected inherited allow overrides virtual-functions in the private protected base-class and neither claims the derived is a kind-of its base

2158168
derived-class	base-class
privately inheriting from the base-class in your derived-class destroy all conceptual ties between the derived and base-class

2158168
derived-class	base-class
the derived-class is just implements in terms of the base-class nothing more

2158177
hide	show
rita if you re happy to have the html present on the page and you only want to hide show the divs then here is the code for that

2158177
hide	show
based on the amount of html you have to hide show i don t think a jquery postback is required

2158180
implements	abstract
making class abstract forces all the subclassing to implements the class and its abstract functions etc. but if you want a function to have a base functionality with the possibility to overrides the function then i ll suggest not making the class abstract and making the specific function virtual instead thus .when the virtual function is not being overwrite and base function will be called

2158215
versioning	upgrade
i had a couple of user scripting that worked in versioning 3.5 by adding command-line option --enable-user-scripting after i upgrade to versioning 4.0 all those scriptinging stop working

2158247
.net	wcf
to add a .net 2.0 web service reference instead of a wcf service reference right-click on your project and click add service reference.

2158252
arrays	loops
you shouldn t use the for...in loops over an arrays or in this case nodelist

2158267
attributes	properties
the validation properties aren t rendering as attributes unfortunately .so i don t know a good way to selected them directly

2158268
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome this runs fast

2158270
.when	ready
since you re not ready to move to wcf you can also still add the old-style web reference if you really must .when you do a add service reference on the dialog that comes up click on the advanced button in the button left corner

2158272
value	field
the only problem with this solution is that if the default value change it s impossible to tell which database field should have updates default and which are just accidentally the same colour as the old default

2158328
mouseleave	mouseenter
i almost always find that it s better to use the hover methods or the hoverintent plugins rather than separate mouseenter mouseleave handler if you are planning to do things both .when the mouseenter and leaves an elements

2158328
mouseleave	mouseenter
both of these seem to handle the range of possible mouse movement events rather than just mapping onto mouseenter mouseleave

2158345
masstransit	nservicebus
an esb or even a lightweight option like masstransit or nservicebus is really not designed for client server-communication

2158382
implements	extends
for validation that occur multiple time just extends the interface argumentvalidation with your own and create the implements class that extendss from the class argumentvalidationimpl

2158393
javascript	dom	jquery	.post
if you run a full form .post the page will refresh back to its initial state it will not maintain any modifications to the dom made via javascript jquery

2158421
restructuredtext	asciidoc	restructuredtext	textile	asciidoc	textile
markdown asciidoc restructuredtext textile

2158425
webserver	upload
.when i do publishing and upload everything to webserver i get this

2158428
constructor	object	contains	set
tobjectlist has an own.sobject parameters which is true but there is an overloaded constructor which takes a parameter which can be set to false .so that contains object are not owned by the list

2158435
reflection	runtime
for example you can building loosely coupled layer that depend on abstraction and use reflection to control behavior specific to instances at runtime

2158462
removeclass	addclass
second you can chaining addclass and removeclass to save looking up the elements twice

2158464
sql-server	oracle
i am not sure if this works in oracle but in sql-server i would create a triggers that on the supervisors table that fires on updates and delete

2158476
cross-compiling	binutils
binutils 2.17 as referenced in the cross-compiling instructions you linked to does not understand etc

2158503
buildpath	libs
once done that eclipse will just automagically include the server s libs in the buildpath of the project read the ide-managed classpath which is used in both compile- and runtime including the javax.el ones

2158505
arguments	default
the arguments goes like this if you re savvy enough to be using svn then most likely you will either be happy with what osx has by default command-line

2158517
django-haystack	pysolr
you may want to checkout django-haystack which uses pysolr and can use other engines and neatly abstracts the job of creating search index entries and shipping them off to solr for indexing

2158539
any	set
i per.sonally use autofixtures as a fixtures object and have it set up as an auto-mocking containers to boot .so i don t have to write any mock code unless i need to explicit defined .some behavior

2158539
rhino-mocks	moq
in this case repmock is created by moq but i could have set it up to use rhino-mocks instead

2158540
default	reset
this will reset to vs s default settings .so you ll likely want to backup your settings first tools import and export settings export

2158558
ip-address	proxy
multiple people may come in from the same ip-address behind a proxy

2158559
contains	set
to clear this points up for cleaner tests you can create a base test class that contains the helpers methods and other set up code

2158572
fflush	gets
alternatively try and make sure you modify the header and add the cookies before it gets fflush

2158574
sql-server	oracle
is there a parallels in microsoft sql-server 2005 preferably for the oracle functionality of setting a column to be unused

2158618
conditional	parentheses
one last quick note - i often write my conditional with nested parentheses like this

2158632
latex	tex
tex and latex set the bar high

2158637
functional-programming	imperative
imperative functional-programming by peyton jones and wadler is a must read if you are interested in functional io

2158642
contains	elements
contains only one inmost elements

2158643
export	report
what s really odd is that no matter how long the report is .when i export it to pdf it s always one page long

2158646
conditional	operators
just for completeness the || and are the conditional versioning of the | and operators

2158650
updating	updates
this field could be updates with the named of that sprint jira is great in multiple issue editing updating

2158651
put	get
the reality is that you re likely going to get people trying to put javascript in their profiling submission weird stuff to your site out of both curiosity and malice

2158651
webserver	nginx
for this you can configure your webserver to stop a user making too many request you can set this up with nginx really easily and impose rate limiting in your application code

2158656
functional-programming	imperative
its faults are enumerated nicely in the paper that introduced monadic i o imperative functional-programming by wadler and peyton jones

2158659
hide	show	fadein	hide	fadein	show
why not just show hide the div with fadein and .fadeout

2158660
protected	public
there are a numbers of keyword applied to ivars members that control their scoping private public protected

2158668
python	ruby	ruby-on-rails	django
if you have no language preferences and you don t have a preferences for their different design-patterns django is nearly not as strict asp.net-mvc as ruby-on-rails then think about the different python and ruby libs apis out there that could be useful for your project

2158677
any	set
any help pointers to somewhere that will explain how to set the context would be greatly appreciated

2158681
value	field
i need to updates a field in table a with the value from a field in table b .when two other field match

2158708
wamp	php
unfortunately i m now required to spend a good deal of time working in php in windows using wamp

2158708
wamp	php
last year it actually delayed a project .when we realized that wamp used an earlier versioning of php this has been fixed by the ports of 5.3 to windows

2158713
uilabel	uiview
i m creating some uilabel in my uiview filling them with data adding them to view and releasing them

2158717
value	field
sql-server doesn t support table alias on the table being updates but the above is a correlated query - those field without the table alias b attached will serve value from table_a because it doesn t have an alias

2158732
instances	private
another class hasprivate has a private instances methods also called dosomething

2158732
contains	any
you create an arrays contains any numbers of instances of both allpublic and hasprivate

2158739
division	modulo
modulo returns the remainder .so .when you match the 0 you get the 3rd 6th 9th etc because 0 is left in the division

2158744
alfresco	liferay
questions which tool --drupal organic-groups liferay social alfresco shared other -- would you recommend and why

2158748
value	field
i want to change the value of the field newprodavail in the existing document by means of lotusscript

2158748
value	field
however the value of the field newprodaval stays the same 3 in my case not 0

2158771
scala	java
scala beautiful mix of oo and fp could possibly overtake java as premier language on the jvm in a decade or 2

2158772
getter	setter
i tried to implements my own setter and getter methodss that align with the kvc standards but the getter methods i have is not getting called

2158789
contains	elements
according to the w3c and this site the elements in xhtml 1.1 may only contains block level elementss and

2158789
contains	elements
i believe that the reason that form may only contains block-level elementss is because it is not considered an elements in itself but rather a wrapper around other elementss

2158799
contains	lookup
if the switching contains more than five items it s implements using a lookup table or hashtable otherwise it s implemeneted using an if..else

2158807
derived-class	base-class
if the derived-class overrides f the base-class operations end up calling the derived versioning of f

2158807
derived-class	base-class
both derived-classes call the same base-class operation but the behavior is different for each derived-class

2158828
contains	elements
a the complex types would contains all properties of the extended xsd and the additional elements properties of the simplecontent nodes you add

2158828
contains	elements
they cannot contains other xsd elements

2158828
contains	elements
as you control the xsd you can determine if there is a base messages object that contains the base attributes and elements you want all xsds to have

2158851
punctuation	words
in fact they are the same string what differs is formatting punctuation and a few words

2158888
selected	listbox
how could i determine who was selected in the listbox where only their first and last named is show

2158894
associations	model
in general manytomanyfield afaik is only a django shortcut to enable easy fetching of all related object classification in your case with the associations table being transparency to the model

2158895
reflection	runtime
as noted in other answers the message-passing semantics -- and their reliance on runtime reflection -- would make handling private messages non-trivial

2158896
static-code-analysis	stylecop
if writing my own static-code-analysis rules for c# code what are the pros and cons of using stylecop vs fxcop

2158897
value	field
say i have a field on a datawindow that is the value of a database column insert column

2158897
value	field
is there some sort of syntax i can use in the expression field for the column s background colour that references the protect value of the column

2158905
contains	set
the join construct allows one to get a result set that contains recording which are made from the columns in the first table and the columns made in the second table

2158910
callback	methods
yes you can do both onlongclick is the methods and onlongclicklistener is the callback for that methods

2158921
hide	show
i m using jquery to show hide the child div whenever a mouse hovers over the parent div parent div spans the entire bottom of the page

2158921
google-chrome	firefox
i can hover over the empty parent div in both google-chrome and firefox and everything works fine

2158923
contains	any
for instances if i types in a letter w in the search bar all phrases that contains a letter w in any character positioning within the phrase are returned immediately

2158940
shell	bash
or just with the shell bash

2158958
.net	wcf
after talking to microsoft support they said it is not possible in .net 2.0 either we have to use wcf or create a monilithic wsdl with all the types inside it

2158960
base-class	inherited
if you really want to cross-execute you should derive from a common base-class and inherited that base-class by u and t virtually virtual public or use dynamic_cast instead of reinterpret_cast

2158962
processor	cpu
out of order execution is a strategy employed by most modern cpu pipelines that allows them to re-order instructions on-the-fly to typically minimize read write stalls which is the most common bottleneck on modern hardware due to the disparity between cpu execution speeds and memory latency i.e how fast my processor can fetch and process compared to how fast i can updates the result back to ram

2158974
associations	model
this will allow the entity-framework to realize the entity associations that should be created in the model and provide the proper object mapping

2158975
nested-class	inherited
is it possible for a class to inherited from a nested-class or to implements a nested interface in c#

2158994
contains	elements
the problem is that one often tests whether a collections contains an elements then does something to the collections based on the result

2158999
any	set	contains	any	contains	set	contains	elements
what we re doing is seeing if there is a set-intersection where a contains some shared elements with the set of desired quantities then testing to see if there were any of those elements

2159010
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari it says no which is expected

2159016
web-services	api
essentially the new api s are there to help client side code run interesting code without having to use the web-services

2159022
authentication	login
if the user is not authentication send back a login form prompt

2159027
dynamic-dispatch	implementation
there s no reason to suppose that the implementor of a class would not want to use all of the objective-c feature set in the implementation and that means that dynamic-dispatch must happen

2159041
.net	wcf
i would recommend wcf as the first thing to consider for all communication on windows if using .net as its built for this kind of thing and its relatively easy to use

2159045
innodb	myisam
if yes is innodb slower than the common myisam but i shouldn t worry about that

2159071
private	self
if you wanted a â private foo â methods you would do and call it as a c function like myclass_foo self arg

2159086
checkboxlist	databound	sqldatasource	databound
you already have your states in a datatable populate a checkboxlist with a databound selection from a sqldatasource or datatable of your own choosing

2159091
interpreter	lexer
i don t need a full-on lexer parsing thingy or language interpreter i don t think it s necessary to go after something like m

2159128
mime	rfc
i know that that is the rfc mime types but i ve seen a few others floating around in my time such as text x-json as has been mentioned here in a previous question

2159148
sql-server-express	sql-server
sql-server-express databases are sql-server databases and vice-versa

2159175
frame-rate	fps
you d get 45 fps but the systemd is slowing it down to 30 fps to achieve a smooth frame-rate on 60hz 60 redraw per second monitor

2159181
cursor	row
it would be best if at all possible to join to the table but if you must do something with each row individually a fast-forward readonly cursor is actually faster than looping yourself

2159197
system.diagnostics	.net	debugging	trace
the trace and debugging classes which are part of the .net within the system.diagnostics namespace are probably your best bet

2159224
google-chrome	firefox
here is what i have now works in the latest versioning of ie firefox and google-chrome - test.cultureconquest.com

2159232
contains	set
but clearly a b and b a in this case will return the same hash .so i would expect that i could not add b a to a set already contains a b

2159252
.when	ready
you don t give any details about either but it could be possible to generator the display in the background bringing in the data one splice at a time and then display .when it s ready

2159282
exception-handling	try-catch
my question is how can i automate the creation of a try-catch block for which the catch is specifically populate with the possible exception-handling from the try block

2159288
data-structures	linked-list
linked-lists are one of the most elementary data-structures for a reason they have properties that the other major data-structures lack and if you need those properties you need a linked-list or one of its close relatives

2159288
data-structures	binary-tree
if you don t understand why linked lists are an important data structure that can t always be replace with a deque or a binary-tree you should never have passed your intro to data-structures class

2159302
contains	elements
jquery has a methods to test whether an elements contains a class hasclass

2159332
trackpad	mouse
in my windows application while registering for raw input-devices i wish to register only mouse but the trackpad which is also a points device also gets registered

2159334
environment	restart
this might take a little bit of work to make a wrapper scripting to set up the web environment but it ends up being much easier since you don t need to mess with restart the server etc to reset the environment

2159334
profiling	debugging
you have your debugging code list memory profiling for the stuff you suspect and look for jumps in memory sizes

2159339
controllers	routes
which will make the route only applicable for those controllers related routes

2159346
double	int
then the c++ compiler will compile a versioning of sum for int and a versioning of sum for double

2159362
trackpad	mouse
in short it sounds like the mouse drivers in the case of usb is a hid device unfortunately subclassing of the mouse drivers could get registered also as you have found out have you tried changing the mouse drivers to some generics or perhaps disable the trackpad

2159362
trackpad	mouse
but then again you mentioned trackpad which i suspect is the laptop in which you are running the drivers off on have you tried it on a desktop pc with a standalone usb mouse

2159385
margins	padding
the extra padding margins to the top and or bottom is introduced by the elements

2159385
margins	padding
this is due to the uncollapsing margins for empty-content padding border areas in this case the contentframe

2159385
margins	padding
below is another hack by manipulating the margins padding of the elements within the content div

2159394
selected	button
.so i click on the choose data store button as instructed which allows me to selected a a provider

2159395
jquery	.post
i stumbled upon this .when doing an ajax .post via jquery of content-types application json to a static .net pagemethodss and saw that the methods which had a single parameter of types object magically received this dictionary

2159405
defined	declare
a forward-declaration is only really useful for telling the compiler that a class with that named does exist and will be declare and defined elsewhere

2159424
sql-server	mysql
it s not worth trying to make them all use sql-server no matter how much mysql expertise would like that

2159426
perl	ruby
i am learning ruby perl has this very convenient module called data-dumper which allows you to recursively analyze a data structure like hash allow you to printing it

2159427
subclassing	inherited
i m trying to use nhibernate to map a table per subclassing inherited structure that looks something like this

2159455
subtract	add
the solution in this case is to either do the calculation manually or if your application will allow for it add a very small buffering around the subtract points to make it occupy spaces

2159493
processor	cpu
at the cpu level yes every processor will eventually see the change to the memory-address

2159498
typedef	struct
i m a bit uncertain of how the typedef struct and pointers play together

2159506
binary-search-tree	data-structures
a non-balanced binary-search-tree is actually useful for little more than educating students about data-structures

2159506
linked-list	tree
that s because unless the data is coming in in a relatively random order the tree can easily degenerate into its worst-case form which is a linked-list since simple binary tree are not balanced

2159506
binary-tree	nodes	binary-tree	tree
that means that each nodes holds more than one item technically they hold n items and n+1 pointers a binary-tree being a special case of a 1-way multi-way tree with 1 item and 2 pointers

2159514
php-gettext	gettext
apparently php-gettext isn t thread safe ugh i hate php .so perhaps look at .something like zent translation with the gettext adaptor which is thread safe

2159524
subclassing	base-class
edit ok this has been bugging me here is the solution for full double dispatcher between a base-class and two subclassing

2159526
colorbox	thickbox
i use colorbox it is because it is recommended alternative in non-maintained thickbox

2159549
void	main
void main

2159555
data-structures	linked-list	data-structures	binary-tree	binary-tree	linked-list
which libs do you guys use for generics data-structures like linked-list binary-tree etc

2159586
keystore	jks
keystore types is jks

2159591
derived-class	base-class
if you have a pointers or reference to an instances of the base-class a in this case then it can t be implicit converted to a derived-class because in general not all instancess of the base-class are instancess of the derived-class all bs are as but not all as are bs

2159598
delphi	c++
not sure about c++ builder but in delphi vcl input parameters shall be marked with and not with

2159608
spaces	output
.when two spaces appear the output is xc2 xa0 first spaces is kept and the second spaces is replace

2159608
spaces	output
.when three spacess appear the output is xc2 xa0 xc2 xa0 first spaces is kept and the second and third spaces is replace

2159623
firefox3.6	firefox
but i don t want to clone both firefox main and firefox3.6 twice

2159630
checkbox	listbox
but you may want to consider using a checked listbox of 50 entries rather than 50 discreet checkbox

2159645
python	php
maybe read this thread and ports your php scripting to python

2159662
contains	elements
form must not contains other form elements

2159666
arrays	loops
then you just need one arrays or list of clients which you loops over

2159672
environment	execution
the c startup code which prepares the execution environment sets up argv argv and .so on then call your main or equivalent

2159672
dynamic-linking	static-linking
whatever object-files need to be dragged in from libs dynamic-linking is a special case of linking that happens at runtime and i won t cover that here since you asked specifically about static-linking

2159673
static-variables	extern
the static-variables are block scoping identifier for object and they are not declare extern

2159682
linked-list	nodes
you should consider getting a ready made linked-list of buffering then traversal the linked-list as you read the buffering in each nodes of the linked-list

2159686
uitableview	uilabel
i have a view that contains a uitableview and a uilabel which works perfectly as far as i can tell

2159686
uitableview	uiview
i really don t want to manage the uiview and uitableview with the same controllers as the uitableviewcontrollers handles a lot of housekeeping and according to the documentation

2159690
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
also i m using linux mint 8 - the rough equivalent of ubuntu 9.10

2159696
directory-structure	subdirectories
that being said create a subdirectories to store your .java files keeping your directory-structure coherent with the package structure of your classes

2159706
windows-server	windows-vista
info on windows-server 2003 windows-vista and above the

2159710
elementtree	lxml
try from lxml import elementtree and you should be able to use elementtree fully

2159711
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the server uses iframe if it looks like an internet-explorer user-agent and object for everything else including firefox google-chrome and wget

2159748
google-chrome	firefox
i m using the bing-maps virtual earth control and it appears to be working however firebug in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome are report an uncaught-exception in microsoft s mapcontrol.ashx file

2159763
streamreader	streamwriter
i m already using a .net streamreader to read the compressed input files and i m wondering if i need to use a streamwriter to write the output files as well

2159765
getter	setter
you can replace this with your own setter and getter methods but only do that if you need to as the built-in ones have some features that you would otherwise have to code yourself

2159765
getter	setter
the synthesize just creates simple getter and setter for you to go with your properties but you can also just code those getter and setter yourself like any other methods

2159768
any	set
i can t imagine why you had ansi_nulls set off for all your sps but if any of them were count on comparisons to null in any way and there can be a lot of different ways that could happen your results will different .when you change that setting

2159769
getter	setter
this means that the compiler expects to see setter and getter accessor methods for the properties

2159769
getter	setter
.when you use the synthesize keyword you are asking the compiler to automatically generator setter and getter accessor methods for you

2159769
getter	setter
neither synthesize nor properties are actually required you can create your own getter and setter methods and as long as you create them using key-value coding-compliant syntax the properties will still be usable

2159788
installation	building
on os x python interpreter instances are typically install as so-called framework building which means that there is a bin directory within the framework which is typically but not always the installation destination for python scripting such as easy_install

2159789
getter	setter
since methodss are public in objective-c the answer is to write an accessor getter methods that returns avar and a mutators setter methods that sets avar

2159796
short	base
in short the idea is to building a certain measure of partials replaceability into the base templates -- whether by using content styles templatess or a combinations of these

2159846
hide	show
better do this in a thread from viewdidload and call your methods in a thread before calling the thread show your labels and .when the data is loaded through the thread hide the labels

2159871
display	width
passing it a few w s will ignore the display width

2159878
actionscript	mxml
mxml is also a tag based language and is used in conjunction with actionscript - but i compiles to flash .swf

2159905
bundler	gem
i use katz s bundler to manage gem dependencies

2159911
implements	abstract
in particular you have an abstract-class with an abstract methods and any numbers of derived classes which implements the methods

2159941
put	get
i don t know the specifics but i m sure you could get statistics about the behavior of player that cheat this way--in other words find things that the cheaters have in common length of turns consistency etc and have your application automatically find those and put a red flag on player that look suspicious

2159941
put	get
whatever barrier you put up determined cheaters will get around them

2159943
getelementbyid	next
the next object being accessed is whatever is returned by getelementbyid for the onclientclick slot

2159968
runas	cmd
i think you re looking for the runas cmd with the netonly switching

2159969
administration	account
i m doing this for an administration account .so that the admin information cannot be found on a database

2159994
security	owasp

buffering	streaming
just to head off one suggestion before it s made you could keep a reference to the underlying streaming you pass into xmlreader and make a note of its positioning - but that will give you the wrong results as the reader will almost certainly be buffering its input it ll read the first 1024 characters or whatever - .so your first nodes might appear to be at character 1024

platform	anycpu
if your platform is non-specific platform anycpu this won t arise assuming no referenced dependencies are of the wrong bitness

2160932
32-bit	64bit
another reason for a badimageformatexception-handling under an x64 install is that in visual-studio 2010 the default .vdproj install project types generator a 32-bit installutillib shim even on an x64 systemd search for 64bit managed custom actions throw a systemd.badimageformatexception-handling exception-handling on the page

2163257
search-engine	web-crawler
although i m a strong supporter or sql and would recommend it as the full-text search component of a search-engine you will also need a web-crawler html parsing component inorder to create a full functional search-engine and you are going to have to carefully design your lucene.net indexes to maximize the performance of the queries that you want searching by language locale

2163258
contains	elements
there is a good practice to checked if list already contains this elements

2163259

i blame awt and swing for why java never caught on for the desktop

2163612
swing	awt
i have been with java since the beginning .so from my points of view the fame of being slow was created by non-responsive and slow gui frontends awt and then swing and in applets probably because of the additional slow startup time of the viewmodel s

2163612
scala	java	groovy	scala	groovy	java	python	java	python	ruby
however there are many other languages for the java viewmodel nowadays python ruby javascript groovy scala etc. which may be an alternative

2163809
numeric	digits
the advantage of starting userid from 1000 even .when you will have fewer than 9 000 ids is that they will all have the same numbers of digits .so that files for example suffixed with the userid will .sort in numeric order automatically even if the .sorter only uses alphabetic numbersing

2163809
digits	zero	uniform	points
a uniform numbers of digits has some advantages and that is why a value other than zero or one is often used as the starting points

contains	any
you have 123 you are saying i want all strings which begin with anything then have 123 and then end with anything. this will match any string which contains 123 at any points

2163914
google-chrome	firefox
note it is no longer possible to set secure cookies over insecure http origins on firefox and google-chrome after they implements the strict secure cookies specifications

2163919
revision	svn
note however that for this to really work the targeted svn revision has to actually building an egg with that named and versioning

2163919
revision	svn
.so this really only works if the package you re depending on uses svn revision tags in their default building versioning numbers.

2163925
scala	java
i m having trouble converting a java sortedmap into a scala treemap

2163932
visitor-pattern	visitor
however this visitor-pattern implementation does not allow to exchange the visitor class

2163959
row	col
asveikau is right but i found another option by searching through some ncurses documentation - i could always just mvprintw col row v

2163960
instances	private
although each tab control is its own instances of the same user-controls and all variables used within the tab control are private to that control and should be specific to that control

2164001
installation	environment
the thing is that the installation instructions for sdl indicate that on a win32 environment using mingw i would need to use msys to run . configure and make make install to install sdl like one would do on linux

2164001
directory	folder
i noticed that .when i unzipped the sdl-dev package forgot the exact named sorry there were folder there that corresponded to a folder in the mingw directory sdl include - mingw include

2164011
.when	ready
the problem i m having with this is that .when i call the fdmslibrary.addinitializationcallback function it would appear that the bridge is not ready

2164020

2164074
engineyard	heroku
paying after process power engineyard or paying for machine configuration heroku

2164083
value	field
it pickles the data and stores it in the next forms as hidden value you get all forms field after completion

2164085
importerror	traceback
the issue here is that a python importerror doesn t tell you what module the error actually occurred in unless you carefully inspect the traceback -- which the unittest module doesn t do

2164089
pkg-config	autotools	build-system	pkg-config	build-system	autotools
how would i use pkg-config in the autotools realm to checked for the existence of cppunit on the build-system then add the include link line

2164091
environment	building
in most case configure and make will discover the compiler environment of your machine and building the suitable binary respectively

2164102
authentication	login
is there a way to simulate a login programmatically or some way to provide a authentication subject such that the call is done

2164122
binaries	install
make install copies the created binaries the headers and the other files that belong to the libs to the appropriate places

2164122
contains	any
you can t just copy the files from the .source archive because the .source archive does not contains the binary files or any other files that are created during the make step .so all you d copy would be the headers which aren t enough to use the libs

2164123
knapsack-problem	subset-sum	partition-problem	subset-sum	partition-problem	knapsack-problem
this is a variation of partition-problem which is a special case of the subset-sum problem which itself a special case of the knapsack-problem

use a scripting-language like ruby or python to load the database from source or extraction the objective-c code out and use that

2164179
margins	padding
intro same as above but for #tagline and #about otherwise i have to defined say padding or margins for tagline and about individually

2164210
base-class	inherited
personally i would have preferred a keyword to explicit make classes available for inherited since that would prevent people from using a class as a base-class unless it was explicit marked as such

2164216
value	field
since you can t read the field anyways and good practice is to not remember or autofill masked field passwd in this case you should manually set the field value to nothing in the view

2164216
value	field
this will ensure that even though the value in the data arrays is hash that that hash value will not be display in your field

2164226
push	pull
the idea is that for central repositories that you just push and pull from there s no need to have the files

2164229
sqrt	sin
now each row of prisms is displaced from the next by a multiple of sqrt 3 2 because the dimension of one prism are 1 sqrt 3 because sin 120 2â sqrt 3 2

sql-server	oracle
i am looking to modify a .net application that has a sql-server backend to make it work with oracle

2164236
fortran	ada
compared to the languages that are normally compiled to pure machine-code and have often large teams of people working on nothing but improving their optimizers c++ fortran ada java does pretty well at a few things but overall tends to be at least somewhat slower

2164240
database-table	mysql
i have a mysql database-table c with a field called phone

2164240
value	field
the phonefixed field will use the following statement to get its value

2164243
contains	any
if you are pushing to a remote repo where it only seems to contains a large pack file no actual source code as you detail in the comments that should mean bare repo which is good for it allows you to push without any risk of difference between a working tree and the git data

2164267
emacs	vim
i may use it in addition to or alongside vim or emacs but refactoring is now an integral part of my development styles and having automated-refactoring tools is essential

i use textmate or vim for small project while i reserve ides for larger more complex project or ones with underlying apis i am not familiar with

2164300
perl	php
i am not a php person but from my probably similar perl perspective i find that the following functions of ide are useful not as far as what i perceive to be ide functions at least

2164301
value	field
you can compare the value in these tables to see if your field value was actually changed

2164304
python	c++
you might want to take a look at the c++ sql browser demo shipped with qt and perhaps ports it to python

2164344
triggers	insert
for consistency you can create on insert triggers or just use the sequence.nextval in your insert statement

2164362
loading	gif
to give the user some feedback i want to display a animated loading gif

2164368
factors	primes
without getting into technical details the whole idea of public key cryptography like rsa is that the public key can be used to encrypt data but cannot be used to decrypt what it just encrypted without breaking the encryption of course -- in the case of rsa that normally means factors the product of two large primes

2164371
buildpath	libs
.so right click on your project on the left go to properties java buildpath libs tab and scroll down the list until you see jre systemd libs

2164373
directory	folder
putting the .h files under an include folder and the .c .cpp files under a source directory

2164383
default-arguments	arguments
if your signature differ only in the numbers of arguments using default-arguments is the right way to do it

2164402
linux	osx
if .someone knows how to do this with a similar systemd linux and xterm it could help me figure it out with osx and terminal - or is there .some other technique to prevent opening .so many terminals instances

triggers	insert
2 use a triggers to count up the numbers of insert that have occurred and lookup the numbers of insert using this meta-data table

2164543
calayer	uiview
if this is to be draw to the screens you ll need to locate your drawing code within the -drawrect methods of a uiview or â drawincontext of a calayer

2164543
calayer	uiview
to updates its contents you d need to call -setneedsdisplay on the uiview or calayer

if youre not stuck on php ruby-on-rails ruby and django python suport much of the same feature set on their respective languages

2164592
value	field
meaning one kind of recording that would be searched for is where the string field is present in the recording and contains a value the other kind is where it contains no value

2164592
value	field
other considerations there is a very low likelihood that in the future the index could be partition into a third partition making boolean unsuitable and negative queries unsuitable and making a field with enumerated value a consideration

2164593
reflection	runtime
.when you mark something with an annotations the compiler and runtime arrange for an object of that class to be visible at runtime via java reflection

dlopen	dlsym
however it is possible to use dll functions without either of these things by using the loadlibrary and getprocaddress functions equivalent to pthreads dlopen and dlsym

2164615
fwrite	fopen
if concatenation two mp3 files is as simple as stringing the bits together then you should be able to use fopen don t forget the b flag for binary and fwrite to read in the data from one file and append it to the other

2164710
build-process	ant
moving my project from ant to leiningen went .so smoothly that i am looking at new things to include in the build-process

2165202
python	java
i wonder if there s a python equivalent to java s kill -3 signals that at least printing the current stack-trace

2165203
arrays	map
the value in the arrays does not change...it might be worth it to dump the arrays contents to disk and use memory-mapping technique instead and you can then load a portion of the dumped arrays into a memory map for reading...otherwise it will not do if the data and elements in the arrays changes.

2165204
implements	extends
the question is why do they need both extends hashset and implements set .when hashset already is the set

2165230
keyboard	mouse
i m working on a c++ directx 2d game and i need keyboard and mouse input

2165258
push	pull	git-clone	git-svn
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with a less-capable systemd svn it is recommended that all git-svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git-clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

2165265
sql-server	oracle
im using sql-server 2000 as frontside server and oracle 10g on backend server .when i was using 9i i never had problems like this

2165291
keyboard	mouse
problem is that by default keyboard mouse messages are routed only to the windows currently in focus and typically in games you want to be able to switching focus to a hi-score view enemies on radar view or whatever and still maintain interactivity

2165291
keyboard	mouse
the easy solution would be for every module which required keyboard mouse input to query for it directly and not rely on messages forwarding - hence directinput

2165310
environment	building
other types of frameworks currently do not building .so well under desktop web environment

2165316

2165447
fadeout	show
have you tried setting a speed on the fadeout -- the documentation which isn t always accurate show it as a required parameter and it just might be if you specify a callback -- it may be evaluation the function as the speed if you don t supply one explicit

2165447
return-value	arguments
edit after looking through the code it appears in 1.3.2 at least that if you supply a function as the first arguments it will evaluate it and use the return-value as the speed

2165452
base-class	inherited
a better way is to make your content pages derive from a common base-class that inherited from page

2165457
.net	wcf
windows-server 2000 does not support .net 3.5 .so its not supporting wcf

what you can do however is dump the data using bulk copy into a temporary table with the right structure and then afterwards call your sproc that move that data into the real tables possibly by modifying existing data instead of insert it or whatnot

2165663
attributes	properties
in that case it takes the properties of the object and turns them into attributes on the elements

click	mouse
.when i click with the mouse i get a systemd ding

2165931
superclass	inherited
hence if we wanted to create a dynamic-proxy which implements all interfaces for an object which has implicit interface inherited then the only way to do it generically would be to walk the superclass all the way back to java.lang.object as well as walking all the implements interfaces and their superclass remember java supports multiple interface inherited which doesn t sound very efficient while it is much easier and faster to explicit named interfaces as i suppose they are set in at compile-time

2165942
any	set
i was under the impression that with key-value coding i could set any undefined attributes on a nsmanagedobject at runtime and no exception-handling would be throw but it wouldbe a way to hold object attached to the model that are not in the datamodel

2165962

since you pretty much have to run a messages pump inorder to have a windows you might as well use that pump to handle keyboard and mouse input as well

2166350
variables	boolean
ok .so most of the dwm stuff is handled by a dll called dwmapi.dll it is all in c++ com because that is how micro.soft writes it s apis you may have noticed that to call the methods in the api you have to use .some unmarshalled boolean types etc this is because it has to reach unmanaged code .some of the operations that need to take place are too dangerous for .net to watch over without interfering you may al.so notice that all the return types aren t actually returns you put in variables as out types .so the code can modify them in memory and then that information can be read back into your managed .net code

2166359
revision	svn
how if it is possible would you use visualsvn to retrieve source code from an open source project such as on codeplex but also have your own svn repository locally such that you could keep a revision history for your own customizations but still once and a while checked the codeplex project for changes that i might want to apply to my code

avoiding overuse of properties getter and setter

2166449
getter	setter
most people don t realize that properties getter and setter are similar to methods .when it comes to overhead

a non-virtual properties getter or setter that contains no instructions other than the field access will be inline by the compiler but in many other cases this isn t possible

2166449
value	field
from inside a class access field directly if possible and never blindly call properties repeatedly without storing the value in a variables

2166461

javascript	dom
a comprehensive summary of javascript libs that standardize javascript and dom across browsers

2166757
value	field
you can defined a regular properties as a readonly properties by just defining the get - however even if the requirement for both get and set for automatic properties didn t exist - the readonly properties couldn t be automatically definedd because you have to know the backing field to be able to set it s value internally through the constructor

2166759
low-level	hardware
opengl is an api not a engine -- it intends to provide low-level interface to the graphics harware yet enough high level to be an abstraction to different hardware -- c is a lot more low-level than c++ oop is not low-level

for example on an unix systemd you could create grouping for special types of privileges and checked if the current user has the required privileges else just return 0 or something

2170979
expression	evaluation
it sounds like el expression evaluation might be turned off

2171011
hide	show
the issue in question arises .when i show a div and want to hide it .when someone presses esc

2171024
text-editor	editor
if you did this you would no longer have a text-editor but instead you would have created some sort of binary file editor

2171025
pascal	basic
other third generator languages such as pascal and even basic managed it at least to some degree

2171025
compatibility	platform
because of this .when c compilers were written for other platform runtime libs hacks were needed to achieve compatibility with existing source code and books

2171025
standard-library	iostream	implements	abstract
the c++ standard-library whatever platform its implements on avoids this issue using iostream which abstract away line ends

2171033
javascript	dom
the dom may be modified by javascript but i just want the final result

2171061
constructor	object
in c++ .when you declare an object the constructor is called automatically you don t need to new it

2171061
pointers	stack
if you want to have a pointers and construct an object in the heap and no stack you need to do

2171103
postgresql	mysql
if you are using mysql sqlite or postgresql and then the problem is solved

2171109
xsd	xml
i currently have built a schema by hand based on things that i need but i m afraid there would be elements that will come up during development time later on that will cause the upstream process that fills an xml file based on the xsd

2171124
imap	nntp
smtp pop imap nntp etc

2171130
ruby	php	text-mining	extraction
is there a libs for ruby or php that is able to parsing html pages and extraction unique data by comparing it with other similar pages....should use some sort of text-mining to identify which texts are more likely noise and repetivie while other texts are more unique and useful.

2171134
arguments	default
if you re concerned about reusability rather than using login_required you could use a decorator which required login if a particular arguments is passed to the view which might default to a value of true

2171154
seam	jsf
one of the biggest advantages is that seam functions as a glue between jsf and jpa front-end and back-end solidifying and streamlining business-logic between the two ends

2171154
spring	seam
of course similarly to spring there are many other valuable features seam has to offer

2171227
32-bit	64bit
also if you have an 64bit os which can execute 32-bit binaries you will have different abis for 32- and 64bit code

2171261
modifiers	final
in some circumstances final modifiers is even really annoying if i want to refactor safely see the programming by difference term

2171261
modifiers	final
here wrong extension can be a big problem and the final modifiers is a safe way to avoid such programming mistakes

2171287
python	java
i used it from java with success .so i expect it will work even better in python linux

2171300

here is a little example on how to write a custom class with one member function calling the other and accessing a private data-members note that inside a member function you can refer to any other member directly

2171335
32-bit	16-bit
my old utility ran both on 32 and 16-bit by compression the 16-bit versioning to the 32-bit and applying the stubs switching in visual-studio 2008 stubs -ms-dos stubs file named

2171342
32-bit	64bit
the dos stubs of windows executable uses the mz section whereas both 32-bit and 64bit executable use the pe section

2171352
include-path	qmake
first you have to tell qmake in your .pro where is located your header-files using the include-path variables please correct the path to points the location of your qjson folder

margins	padding
don t use margins to simulate padding - it can cause cross browser issues .when you re just trying to do some positioning tricks as we are here

2171360
32-bit	64bit
you should pack your 32 and 64bit util in resources of another exe let s call it launchd 32-bit

2171366
versioning	packaging
unfortunately you will have to include the qt libs you need into your own bundle as you cannot expect your users to have qt install on mac whereas on linux packaging systemd allow you to required at least a given versioning of qt

2171372
pagespeed	yslow
not a problem and will help with the yslow pagespeed scores assuming cookieless domain etc.

2171378

qtcore	qtgui	qtnetwork	qtcore
one of my project uses qtgui qtnetwork qtcore and qtxml and the resulting bundle is about 16 mb in size

2171439
windows-vista	windows
however the only long-term .solution is to change your program .so that it is properly compatible with windows-vista and probably windows 7 as well

2171460
web-services	security
i would like to develop some web-services and checked the security loopholes in them means to stimulate some attacks in soa such as coercive parsing attack dos attack etc.. which one either java or .net will be better for programming the web-services for beginners

mergesort	in-place
two in-place variants of the classical mergesort algorithm are analysed in detail

2171525
mergesort	heapsort	mergesort	in-place	in-place	heapsort
in practice due to the overhead in the index manipulation our fastest in-place mergesort behaves still about 50 per cent slower than the bottom-up heapsort

2171525
mergesort	in-place
however our implementation are practical compared to mergesort algorithms based on in-place merging

2171525
mergesort	in-place
jyrki katajainen tomi pasanen jukka teuhola practical in-place mergesort 1996

2171537
databound	formview
either explicit call databind or place your code in the databound event of the formview

2171541
stable-sort	in-place
additionally unlike the standards merge sort in-place merge sort is not a stable-sort

2171543
ruby	php
i m a php guy no idea about ruby but i think that what you want is trivial to archive

2171549
wordpress	shortcode
apparently the following simple code break the shortcode api of wordpress

2171552
contains	elements
note that containsers like linked-list should contains only elements that have been dynamically allocated or ones that are not

2171554
linked-list	heap
given i assume that you are allocation new listelementss on the heap in the linked-list class you should ensure that in the linked-list destructor every listelements is deleted in the destructor by walking down the list and calling delete on every listelements after you have retrieved the address of the next list elements from it of course

2171555
assign	add
i have also tried to add columns manually as a button but i did not find way to assign it action methods onclientclick

2171586
abstract-class	subclassing
one cannot initializer abstract-class .so you have to subclassing them inorder to use it

2171587
value	field
a customer can selected a product from a dropdownlistfor and the corresponding field such as price quantity etc are automatically filled with the appropriate value

2171587
value	field
this strategy works fine in my local development-environment but .when the page is upload to the server the corresponding field are not getting appropriate value

2171596
bufferedwriter	bufferedreader
wrap the inputstreamreader and stringwriter with bufferedreader and bufferedwriter respectively for better performance

2171622
put	get
in the case of httpservlet the points is that servlet programmers typically don t want their servlet to support all 4 oft the main http methods .post get put delete .so it would be annoying to make the doget do.post etc

2171622
implements	abstract
methods abstract since programmers would be forced to implements methods that they don t need

2171644
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have a variables that i am calculating the length of and in all browsers except firefox ie google-chrome safari the value is 0

2171647

i m looking for a full-text-search algorithm that will allow to find similar program named for example mozilla firefox and firefox 3.5 or adobe-reader and adobe acrobat reader v10

2171660
constructor	object
.when you construct an objectinputstreaming the constructor reads the first two bytes from the streaming expecting them to be the magic value that should be present in an object streaming

2171665
value	field
there is a table that is named custom_field profileid moduleid fieldid fieldlabel there you defined the field eg phone dob dogs children then in another table custom_field_value contactid fieldid value you set the value for each client custom field

reflection	runtime
meta construct reflection runtime types generator

2171670
haskell	scala
see haskell or scala

2171708
implements	abstract
lastly - a critical-section is an abstract term and can be implements using a mutex or a monitor

you could make a constructor or methods in the derived-class that takes an instances of the base-class and copies all of the properties

2171770
joomla	drupal
i highly recommend silverstripe for the purpose since i started using it i ve recommended clients to do the transfer from drupal and joomla whenever possible

2171784
e-commerce	product
say for display product on an e-commerce website or for display entries on a forum or blog

2171785
python	c++	maya	mel
and you can use the c++ or python via maya api to create complex tasks or heavy duty tasks like creating deformers expanding mel with new cmd

2171785
python	c++
you can easily program scripting with python which is way easier than mel or c++

2171808
python	c++
i recommend that you start with maya python api istead of c++ its way easier and takes less development time

2171808
python	c++
you may read the complete maya programming book its example written in c++ but if you know some python you can write them in pyton

2171830
put	get
if i don t put the cast it says that it cannot bind an object to a jpanel .when i do system.out.print me.get.source it printing a line saying that it s a jpanel .so i don t get what the problem is

2171834

hello i have an excel file and i wanna look for the duplicates value in a certain field like a list of email account

2171836
constructor	object
we have created these basic object within a dto namespace these object are basic object that represent basic or specific versioning of business-object but have no features except constructor that accept either a datarow or business object to populate the dto object

2171836
constructor	object
2 rather than having constructor to provide the data and set the object properties should this population code be in a different class some kind of helpers class

2171849
duplicates	contains
you can find duplicates in a column by using making another column contains the formula assuming you re checked column q countif q q q2

2171873
debugging	exit	execution	exit
for example you made yourself a logging class that output some tracing info like .when function is run and .when it exit can be especially useful sometimes .when debugging multithreading issues then you just ask emacs to highlight some of them green and other red and then you can see how did the execution go

2171878
constructor	object
having a common superclass makes it slightly easier because you can have the new object add its own class to a global class collections if not already present in the superclass constructor

2171878
subclassing	superclass
keeping tracking of superclass subclassing relations for a known subset of classes is easy enough

2171885
javascript	dom
the javascript itself is often not the issue it s .when you modify the dom you end up in trouble for example animation adding and removing elements

2171886
markup	xhtml
why are there two competing implementation for the future of web markup - xhtml 2 and html 5 particularly given that html 5 appears to have an xml-compliant counterpart xhtml5

2171892
callback	methods
more specifically how can i wrap a c struct with a class .so that i can pass class pointerss to methods that required struct pointers and cast back .when i receive the pointers in callback

2171921
base-class	inherited
if only single inherited is involved the class s address should be the same as the struct s which acts as a base-class

2171932
webrequest	webclient
is there a reason you re not using webclient or webrequest inside silverlight to do this posting

2171950
content-disposition	content-type	content-disposition	content-length	content-length	content-type

but whenever i am entering any value in quantity and rate field other respective field always showing 0 value only which is not expected

2172081
pascal	ada
although design-patterns describe object-oriented designs they are based on practical solutions that have been implements in mainstream object-oriented programming languages like smalltalk and c++ rather than procedural languages pascal c ada or more dynamic object-oriented languages clos dylan self

2172086
value	field
since your field aren t actually bound to your bal class object you ll need to perform the assignment during each postback unless you re using either a viewstate properties or session to hold an existing one that already has all of these value set

2172088
value	field
if you leave either out then you will get the null value on an empty field

2172100
hide	show
you can use jquery to show hide divs

2172105
value	field
one field is description and it store the html code as the value eg

2172161
object-reference	instances
i can get exception-handling object-reference not set to an instances of an

2172168
arrays	loops
no need to loops through the _post arrays for short

2172205
checkbox	button
use radio button over checkbox and dropdown selection where possible

2172205
checkbox	button
use radio button to flatten combinations instead of checkbox a and b that can t be on at once offer a b none radio button

2172211
setinterval	settimeout
i prefer re-scheduling on each iterator via settimeout as above to using setinterval but it s totally your call

2172211
javascript	dom
the above is raw dom javascript

2172224
queue	fifo
use collections.deque instead of list it s faster for fifo queue

2172227
configuration	installation
i saw a few applications that have just an exe file utorrent media player classic - i can use them without any installation but they store their configuration somewhere else

2172262
mime	rfc
unlike what many other people said there is a standards on forwarded email rfc 2046 multipurpose internet mail extensions mime part two media types more than ten years old

2172262
mime	rfc
the basic idea behind rfc 2046 is to encapsulate one messages into the mime part of another of types named unfortunately messages rfc822 never forget that mime is recursive

2172283
implements	abstract
wouldn t a better solution be to create an abstract methods on a that b would have to implements and call that instead

2172283
getter	setter
in general if you are attempting to give access to a parent class the correct and future proof way to do this is to create abstract-methods that are getter or setter or even more complex if necessary and then have the children honor those or not and respond as appropriate

2172286
increment	reset
hat is fixed no increment anywhere and star is not being reset each time in the loop...i have highlight the problematic lines.

warning ftp_login expects parameter 1 to be resource boolean given in variables www ftp_test.php on line 28

2172311
data-members	instances
.when you defined a data-members as static it means there is only one single instances of it

2172312
highlight	selected
likewise if i have selected sections in vim found by how do i change one of the highlight section .so that i can repeat

2172323
windows-server	windows-xp
no more than 100 kb of text from the desktop multi platform client application running on windows-xp vista 7 and mac os x to a server windows-server 2008 iis 7 wcf restful service to save in a database sql-server

2172323
sql-server-express	sql-server
it s my understanding there are large licensing fees tied to sql-server .so i may need to go with sql-server-express for now

2172324
arrays	loops
as i loops through the arrays i know i need to keep a variables that is always equals to the previous merge_id and if there is a match between previous and current then merge

2172326
while-loop	loops	while-loop	infinite
.when you have an infinite while-loop then checked your loops for this pattern

2172372
hidden-field	checkbox
numbers the checkbox sequentially 1 to 100 and add a hidden-field connecting the row numbers to a real database id

2172389
firefox	safari
only safari seems affected but i m suspecting firefox just masks the problem due to more tolerant parsing

2172395
stderr	stdout
some applications write to dev console instead of dev stdout or dev stderr

2172399
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the code works perfectly fine in google-chrome but in internet-explorer and firefox it just redirects to a page with the text block

2172420
python	perl
how could i achieve this using bash perl or python scripting

2172421
hide	show
if you need to show an elements .when javascript is enabled you can first hide the elements with css and enable it with javascript jquery

2172422
associations	model
first thing i would checked is the associations organizerdbentities.assignments in your ef conceptual model

2172423
selected	button	highlight	selected
it would be a quick and easy toggle button but i ve taken to screenshotting a highlight button and using that for the background-image of a selected button

matplotlib - which is used by networkx to visualize graphing

2172437
oracle	mysql
i have a few questions about using mysql and oracle in a php .app

2172437
oracle	mysql
use mysql for a year and then easily switching a db file and it will run on oracle

2172437
oracle	mysql
in general would one expect to see a performance gain in switching from mysql to oracle in a high traffic environment

2172438
lookup	any
updates i just created a project that send the user to an area per default without messing with any of the code or lookup paths

2172455
cpu-architecture	mips
again more people here will be familiar with 8086 assembly programming than with mips .so it may be a good idea to use 8086 even though the cpu-architecture is not very nice

2172461
short-circuiting	equivalent
that is because 99||44 returns true only 99 which is non-zero is evaluated due to the short-circuiting action of || whose equivalent is 1 hence printf printing 1

2172463
hide	show
and apart from some crazy redirect scenario your best bet may be to use css + javascript to show hide what you need

2172463
hide	show
what i normally do and your mileage may vary depending on what you need to show hide is this

2172463
hide	show
then you can use css to hide show based on if javascript is enabled disabled

2172485
highlight	selected
searching for a string with does not selected it - it only highlight it

2172485
click	mouse
to selected a region of text click and drag the mouse over it or use the v v or ctrl-v key in normals mode to selected a normals region by line or rectangular region respectively then navigate with the usual movement key to extends the selectedion

2172485
selection	highlight
once you have some text highlight and are in visual selection mode you can use the normals editing cmd to change the highlight text c will delete the text and put you into insert mode y will yank the text gu will change the text uppercase g

2172492
xquery	xslt
altova offers its xslt and xpath 2.0 and xquery 1.0 processor as a downloading for windows see

2172500

i am not sure but is the windows of the richedit recreate .when geing from hide to show

2172507
getdate	dateadd
if i run the query selected dateadd d -500 getdate

2172508

you don t need to -- just send frame show #f to hide it

2172511
getdate	dateadd
lose the quotes around dateadd d -500 getdate

2172514
dictionary	arrays
i get the count of the arrays and the dictionary but not the value of the string

2172517
dictionary	arrays
i recommended using an arrays instead of a dictionary as your top level containers because it will make numberofrows simpler but to use it you need to replace not encapsulate the dictionary

2172517
dictionary	arrays
you should change numbersofsections to count the numbers of items in the dictionary rather than the listofitems arrays

2172517
dictionary	arrays
where sectionnamearrays is an arrays of strings you use for dictionary key they don t have to be the actual section named

2172517
if-statement	arrays
for this reason it might be better to start with an empty arrays and add a letter .when you get to that if-statement if charaarrays count 0 for example

2172517
any	set
the reason you are only seeing the last value is because you keep changing the text of your labels if charaarray has any object it overwrite the value charspecicalarray set

2172525
cairo	gtk
i think i must be missing some basic gtk cairo concept because it seems to be running too slowly stutteringly for what i am doing

2172531
textbox	button
i currently have a windows form application composed of a textbox and two button previous and next the textbox is bound to the named of a person on a list

2172531
decrement	increment
previous and next button changes the positioning of the bindingmanager by 1 either increment or decrement

2172531
textbox	button
i also can t checked for the textbox since the previous and next button manipulate it also which i do not want to prompt the user for

2172538
codeigniter	symfony
please don t tell me about considering to use some existing framework cake codeigniter symfony etc. - i have already had a look at them and decided to write one for myself

2172552
cakephp	symfony	codeigniter	symfony	codeigniter	cakephp
none in particular are better to look at but try cakephp symfony codeigniter or agavi

2172569
ubuntu	mint
did a new install of postgresql 8.4 on mint ubuntu

2172574
double	int
however the swing jslider only works with int value whereas i need something that can support double for 1 decimal-point

2172583
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
the standards control types already contains very obvious information about functionaltiy of a control - a checkbox to enable disable a grouping of features or for a boolean option an edit or drop down to enter selected a value a button to open a sub dialog a static control for the labels etc

2172588
sql-server	postgresql
this normally means inorder to login as postgresql which is the postgresqlql equivalent of sql-server s sa you have to have write-access to the underlying data files

2172623
json	xml
my suggestion is to create a controllers action that checked for an ajax request and returns something in your format of choice xml json rather than rendering an html templates

2172650
google-chrome	safari
an example is the html5 versioning of youtube recently introduced as beta for safari google-chrome users see here

2172651
google-chrome	firefox
latest versioning of safary and google-chrome firefox 3.6 too can play tag in a html5 page directly

2172670
document-ready	.when
the control works perfectly but .when i am using my fieldset inside an updatepanel afer a postback i loose my jquery logic because of the document-ready

2172682
google-chrome	opera
google-chrome opera 10 opera 9

2172689

one thing i did to make my python extension very easy to use while buildinging the libs and testing was to building boost-python and python myself in my building environment

2172699
debugging	trace
i like the idea of adding a trace debugging it

postgresql	firebird	postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	firebird	oracle	firebird	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	firebird	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
pdo has drivers for sqlite mysql postgresql firebird db2 microsoft s sql-server oracle odbc devices and probably some more that i m forgetting about

2172711
oracle	mysql
mysql and oracle don t speak the same dialect of sql

2172711
oracle	mysql
particularly with mysql and oracle which are almost as different as two databases can get

2172718
for-loop	arrays
i tried using a for-loop .so it d be a bit neater and out of curiosity to see if it could be done but it doesn t compile .when i do it this way because it doesn t recognize an item in an arrays as a methods i think

2172722
oracle	mysql
if your mysql scheme and queries are somewhat optimized it might take some doing to reach an equals performance in oracle and vice versa

2172729
clutter	cairo
i d probably try the cairo mailing list or look at clutter or pygame for drawing a large numbers of items on the screens

2172777
firefox	safari
firefox and safari are already supporting the feature

2172792
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
i then use jquery to go to next or previous step - in other words hide or show a specific div

2172792
implements	final
.so i ve implements xval but currently the validation only occurs .when the form is submitted on the final step of the wizard

2172793
linux	unix
for unix linux use nm or objdump

2172825
children	nodes
i implements the nodes as an object having a data field and a list of nodess which are the children of that nodes

2172833
promise	future
because html holds the promise to also address some of the shortcoming of the flash platform there is a potential that it can replace flash in this spaces in the future

2172836
selected	button
this function once called by click the button should get the value set by the selected city option then load the weather in a div below

2172845
contains	any
the data contains within a block isn t represented in any way similar to say instance-variables

2172849
selected	checkbox
a checkbox value is only returned if the checkbox is selected

2172849
selected	checkbox
therefore if the passwd checkbox is not selected the key passwd does not exist in the arrays

2172853
cassini	iis
since you did not specify either home or professional if you are they do not have iis install nor does it come with xp home you could try cassini webserver which can be found here

2172856
persian	farsi
in typical persian fonts which are true types there is a historical problem with yeh and kafs since these fonts are created for windows 98 which didn t include full persian support and now we have 2 kind of kafs keheh 0x6a9 ú and arabic kaf 0x643 ùƒ and 2 kind of yehs farsi yeh 0x6cc ûœ and arabic yeh 0x64a ùš

2172863
administration	credentials
administration send credentials

2172867
expression	evaluation
short-circuiting evaluation means that in the expression

2172867
perl	lua	scheme	lua
the perl versioning is quite popular in dynamic-languages icons lua scheme

2172876
vba	vb6
i have no personal experience doing this although i have used vba vb6 and have written vb6 dlls that are add-ins for other 3rd party software although not office

2172876
vba	vb6
the easiest way would be to convert your vba code to a vb6 com add-in

2172876
vba	vb6
then you shouldn t have to change the guts of your code since vba is 99 identical to vb6 and you can code against the same office object-model

2172876
vb.net	vba
alternatively you could migrate your vba to vb.net as a vsto add-in

2172876
vb.net	vb6
vb.net is fully supported whereas only the vb6 runtime is now supported

2172905
constructor	object
the first way creates an object while the second only declare a constructor that can be used to create object

2172918
contains	elements
#background_right is the elements that contains the background-image

2172922
any	set
in any case you can manually set the ids easily

2172936
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
the dblinq project supports all of linq-to-sql s features over mysql postgresql oracle and sqlite as well as some unique features

2172966
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
if you want start a new project that is not sql-server and you want to use a microsoft orm i recommend you to start using entity-framework which supports mysql and oracle and .

2173024
arrays	loops
.so do jump in with multithreading insert loops commit every 1000 row or more and possibly use arrays insert

2173037
imageview	textview
here is the contents of my personal view to display my main application just to demonstrate how i can switching view s your view would be different including a textview and an imageview

2173037
callback	methods
with corresponds to that layout .so whenever i want to change anything to my xml file i would reference mylist use methods and callback to meet my needs

2173038
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it s supported by google-chrome and firefox on the pc and safari on mac os and iphone to the best of my knowledge

2173043
arrays	map
you wouldn t be able to use mysql syntax without a plugins if one exists but you can just use jquery-selectors then use map to turn it into a javascript arrays of the cities

2173056
value	field
sorry to say that but there is no way to restore the old field value without a backup

2173061
directory	folder
to be prepare if anything comes up here you should stop your mysql server and make a copy of the physical directory contains the database .so nothing can get overwrite further a simple copy-paste of the data folder to a different location should do

2173062
value	field
edit these prefixes can be arbitrary but there is a conventions to use a value of the field in the tag libs definition file it s where c for jstl core comes from

2173088
button	popup
i have view a .when the user click a button i popup view b

2173115
reflection	runtime
at runtime you can use reflection to bind types arguments to unspecified types parameters of unbound generics typess with the types.makegenericstypes methods

2173137
scala	java
i am seeing a problem with some scala 2.7.7 code i m working on that should not happen if it the equivalent was written in java

2173148
display	width
how does one given a variables width fonts figure out how high a uitextfield or something needs to be inorder to display all of the text contains in it without reducing the points size of the fonts

2173153
put	get
at the time the application read the socket data or .when the underlying layer get the data and put it in the buffering

2173159
gnome	kde
now lets suppose that 50 of all desktop environment are kde the other half is gnome

2173170
updating	updates
in this methods you might updates a labels s state or do anything else that involves updating the application-state

2173201
value	field
i have indexed all searchable information into solr and my plan is to query solr and then get the id s of the query-results of all recording that is each has an id field value which i then use to query mysql and fetch the rest of the information

2173207
positioning	slider
the dropdown ul is positioning absolutely with a z-index of 10 and the slider is positioning relative to its parent with a z-index of 1

2173209
malloc	free
if size is 0 then malloc returns either null or a unique pointers value that can later be successfully passed to free

2173216
python	php
granted php is quite stupid with its notices and warnings instead of exception-handling a points python has over php and your custom implementation may more easily allow you to e

2173224
order	add
q2 performance and .sorting well .sorting represents an extra task to perform on your data .so it is bound to add a bit of work for the database this can of course be minimize if you have an index on your order by column s

2173227
hide	show
hey i wan t to make a cool effect on my page and i m thinking how about to hide everything while loading and show each div with effect one by one

2173242
realloc	free
if realloc ever has to move the data inorder to resize it it call free internally you do not need to worry about that

2173242
realloc	malloc
realloc will work just like malloc the first time

2173255
contains	any
if the columns you would normally be selected are covered by an index and the table contains any significant amount of data it will be an order of magnitude slower maybe worse

2173255
difference	factors
before you start going out and testing things you need to shake off the common misconception that the exact order in which you write your query statements or irrelevant factors like views selected from other views actually makes any appreciable difference if your database is even remotely optimized

2173255
adventureworks	northwind
if you are simply experimenting trying to understand performance difference between different types of queries in an abstract sense then i would have to say that you ll be better off just grabbing a copy of the northwind or adventureworks database and banging around on that one - it s already normalize and indexed and you ll be able to glean meaningful information about query performance in an actual production database

2173255
order	join
other factors including .sort order selectivity join types cur.sor types plan caching and .so on

2173257
hide	show
just hide the divs you want to show using css s display none

2173280
malloc	free
all of the above points out the obvious thing for every malloc there is a free if not you have a memory leak .so it is imperative that you free the memory .when you are finished with your pointsers variables that is malloc d

2173313
devkit	gem
in my case some gem namely hpricot and ruby-debug19 would not install on my systemd even with the devkit install properly because of an error creating the makefile

2173321
attributes	properties	put	get
if you want the descriptor properties to triggers .when you get an attributes from object x then you must put the descriptor in types x

2173356
emacs	vim
i ve been using emacs for few weeks and it s been great .so far - coming from vim was easier than i expected actually - emacs keyboard shortcuts feel more.

2173387
spaces	output
in binary files to input and output data with the extraction and insert operators and and functions like getline is not efficient since we do not need to format any data and data may not use the separation codes used by text files to separate elements like spaces newline etc...

2173414
for-loop	arrays
i aim to beat the speeds of sequenceequal or a hand-coded for-loop over every item by avoiding the repetitive bound checked for both arrays

2173420
typedef	struct
sockaddr is a struct not just a typedef for a character arrays

2173420
nsstring	nsdata
also you don t need an nsdata at all to go from a character arrays to an nsstring

2173441
factors	numeric
to improve the coolness factors you can convert the date to a numeric form and format it in hex .when building the url -

2173452
selected	button
selected your templates then click the edit css button on the top right

2173454
revision	updates
i personally use the subversion revision numbers of my files but you could use anything meaningful to you even the last updates timestamp of the file

2173454
revision	svn
stackoverflow uses the svn revision numbers

2173460
realloc	malloc
the reason you should use the second one is because with realloc failure is bad but is quite recoverable in many situations unlike malloc where failure usually means stop everything and die.

2173460
realloc	malloc
this is a more contentious issue but it is questionable whether or not you should cast the return-value of malloc and realloc like you do

2173460
python	c++	python	ruby
if you don t need to compile c code with c++ compilers which is similar to having to run ruby code in a python interpreter continue to the points below which are why i think you shouldn t cast

2173467
asterisk	pbx
i m looking for ways to use this methodology in configuration of an existing system.in this case the asterisk soft pbx

2173487
callback	methods
perhaps i can hook up the logger to a callback methods to look for redirects

2173495
capture	player
if it doesn t capture the output to a file-rename to .xspf and feed to the player again

2173508
base-class	inherited
a class inherited all data-members from its base-class including the vtable

2173509
emacs	vim
just use viper-mode vimpulse or vim mode emacs key-bindings are just not as ergonomic

2173514
postdata	request
the difference here is that you need to add your request body data as putdata instead of postdata

2173521
stderr	stdout
just for debugging purposes redirect stderr to stdout and use passthru to display the complete output possibly including error messages

2173524
cos	sin
w r abs sin r h + abs cos r w

2173524
cos	sin
h r abs sin r w + abs cos r h

2173524
cos	sin
let c represent abs cos r and s represent abs sin r

2173536
selected	button
this will selected all radio button with the attributes

2173540
buffering	streaming
with the amount of information you gave us we can only give global hints like did you make sure your socket streaming is not buffering and that you fflush after the information is written

2173541
children	nodes
descend into this nodes and get the last children saving the text content to a temporary string

2173564
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox

2173570
delphi	c++
in delphi the offset size between int value in a arrays is different than c++

2173576
signals	aio
if you want to integrated pthreads aio with epoll then you need to translation the signals into an event on a dummy fd a pipe maybe and listen for it with epoll while catching the signals either in a classic manner or with ppoll selected

2173581
value	field
.so i could compose a recording from a row and rowview and a field from each column value and columnview

2173582
webserver	upload
i am going to upload all of my photos to an apache webserver - they re all in folder sub-folder

2173582
perl	php
is there some php perl ruby-on-rails scripting .app that i can configure by points to a folder and telling it to generator a decent looking photo gallery automatically

2173582
configuration	installation
as long as it s a one-time configuration on installation

2173586
project-management	project
i do not want it to have to take the whole project the file came from into context or provide any project-management or integrated debugging features

2173586
kate	vim
for example under linux i would use kate or vim .so .something similar is preferred

2173588
instances	private
class instances declare as private

2173590
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i tried the following sscce and it works flawlessly in ie firefox safari opera and google-chrome all of the most recent versioning

2173599
rollback	commit
the only way to signals the completion of the transactional to database is by using either a commit or rollback statement per ansi-92 which sadly did not include syntax for creating beginning a transactional .so it is vendor specific

2173599
innodb	myisam
in mysql autocommit is on by default for innodb - myisam doesn t support transactional

2173599
rollback	commit
it also required an explicit made commit or rollback statement at the end of the transactional

2173599
rollback	commit
however like explicit transactional they required a commit or rollback statement to be supplied

2173599
rollback	commit
explicit transactionalal are the most ideal solution - they required a statement commit or rollback to finalize the transactional and what is happening is clearly stated for others to read should there be a need

2173604
python	java
on the other hand there is application and other less performance critical programming where it s much easier to move up a layer or more of abstraction and forget about pointers altogether which results in things like java c# python and others

2173608
notepad++	textpad
for windows i use notepad++ or textpad

2173609
getter	setter
properties declarations are nothing more than compiler-generated getter and setter methods

2173609
getter	setter
obviously you have to be getting and setting .something .so we create the ivar that goes along with the getter and setter

2173609
getter	setter
the getter returns the value in the receiveddata instances variables and the setter changes the value in the receiveddata instances variables

2173609
instance-variables	superclass	protected	public
inside your own class you have direct access to all your own instance-variables and any protected and public ivars of your superclass

2173612
getter	setter
this happens because the compiler automatically synthesizes the setter and getter and then call them for accesses through the dot-operator

2173612
getter	setter
one final note is that these setter and getter are automatically protected by a synchronized block that ensures that the operations happen atomically and that a second thread couldn t disrupt the activity midway through

2173615
division	modulo
we have to translation the offset by which the tile extends beyond the screens not the total cameraposx offset .so we re using the modulo instead of division

2173616
numeric	digits
each student s four digits identification numbers their numeric

2173619
declarative	imperative
imperative runtime code trumps declarative settings

2173649
logout	login
i want .when the user have logged in on facebook my login button title to change to logout

2173661
stderr	stdout
this will redirect file-descriptor #2 stderr into file-descriptor #1 stdout which you ve already directed to the named file

2173661
stderr	stdout
which should direct both stdout and stderr

2173673
put	get
in onrestoreinstancestate for your activity get the hour out of the bundle and put it in the timepicker

2173677
hotmail	gmail
the email has a background-image that is not showing .when i test it with gmail hotmail or yahoo mail

2173678
widget	button
here is a sample .app widget project with a button on the .app widget itself that routes you back to the configuration activity

2173680
value	field
i have figured out how to set default value for all of the other field address additional address city state zip country but can t figure out how to set the actual location default

2173685
libavcodec	ffmpeg
for encoding a video use libavcodec from ffmpeg

2173721
put	get
in a perfect world client browsers would all support get .post put and delete for request operations

2173721
put	get
however only get and .post are supported which means we re stuck trying to identify operations that should be put and delete by using common action verbs in the url like view create edit and delete

2173727
put	get
that because you put the parameter in the url which is kind of a get way

2173733
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it works fine in safari firefox and google-chrome

2173735
hide	show
i have a link and would like to show hide one form

2173754
textures	fbo
once .when they are blended into the fbo textures and again .when the fbo textures is blended over the scene

2173754
alpha	rgba
.when you draw into an rgba surface with blend off the current alpha is simply written directly into the fbo overlay s alpha channel

2173754
textures	fbo
then later .when you blend the whole fbo textures over the scene that alpha makes your line translucent

2173754
contains	elements
another related problem .when you blend one line over another in standards blend mode src alpha 1 - src alpha in the fbo the alpha channel of the blended part is going to contains a blend of the alphas of the two overlay elements

2173754
vertex-buffer	vbo
.so one option would be instead of blend line into an fbo write the line geometry into a vertex-buffer object vbo

2173755
arrays	loops
you should be able to structure the code as a single loops whereby you iterate using an index i comparing the elements of the two arrays

2173802
input-field	selected
is there a way to display those characters correctly in my input-field .when i selected a recording from jquery s autocomplete

2173803
assign	add
.so the thing to do is simply to add the logarithm of the probabilities assign to the observed events

2173804
unsigned	short
total_length is a unsigned short

2173829
importerror	traceback
i have these errors importerror at cannot import named useropenidassociation i could make any sense out of the traceback

2173831
versioning	upgrade
i m guessing the problem does not occur in later versioning but an upgrade is not an option at the moment

2173834
any	set
therefore you should also eliminate or delay any output in session.php till after the cookies are set

2173835
any	set
you need to ensure that you ve set cookies and any other headers before you send any output to the browser

2173852
background-image	width
decrease the width of to fit the background-image s width

2173852
background-image	width
the width of is 1050px .so your background-image should be at least that wide

2173860
firefox	opera
this seems to be a phenomenon happening with firefox and opera

2173865
viewdidappear	viewdidload
this works with viewdidappear not viewdidload

2173875
margins	padding
you want to remove or at least lessen the margins padding

2173877
output	mode
trying to output _post mode gives me an empty result even though i can see the data using firebug

2173901
widget	button
this allows you to do tricks like the following you have a button let s call it button that is supposed to hide another widget let s call it textview .when pressed

2173917
webforms	asp.net
prior to that i was very familiar and very comfortable with asp.net webforms but i was still frustrated with the development-process as a whole

2173917
environment	building
while webforms allows you to building things faster you are basically held hostage by microsoft s implementation rather than allowing you to more easily digest established standards such as javascript css and ajax in environment that don t involve microsoft

2173917
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if my 11-year-old son expressed interest in learning web development tomorrow given the choice of webforms or asp.net-mvc my choice would be asp.net-mvc

2173929
children	nodes
i d like to get all the children of an elements including text nodes

2173938
key-value	key
calayer s have the ability to store arbitrary key as part of their key-value coding machinery

2173966
contains	any
to do that you need a labeled block usually a div to contains any data to change

2173974
configuration	environment
consider that each of your clients could have its own environment allowing you to specify their various configuration individually

2173982
google-chrome	firefox
this is quite easy to do in firefox and google-chrome and would give you a good temporary option for users of those browsers

2173986
subtract	add
saving dates as strings could open a world of trouble .when you maybe parsing them from xml where the gmt is specified separately or try to add and subtract nstimeintervals

2173994
firefox	safari
it works well in firefox and safari but not ie8

2174000
for-loop	arrays
vectorising in cython shaves about 25 off the for-loop on my computer however more than half the time is spent building the python string the return statement - i don t think the extra copy can be avoided legally as the arrays may contains null bytes

2174019
deployment	install
if you are testing for instances a deployment scripting to make sure everything gets install in the right place it will work

2174044
selected	cell
to change just the one header cell you need to selected the column you want from the datagridview columns collections

2174067
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
safari and firefox still work but opera and google-chrome send the user to java installation page as if the plugins was not found

2174084
nvidia	ati
all i need is a list of the most common problems between ati nvidia cards with solutions

2174090
floor	ceil
it is good to user ceil or floor .when you know what you want to round up or down

2174103
approximation	integral
instead use an integral value for loops counter and scale that to get a better approximation to the value

2174112
database-table	mysql
i have a mysql database-table that i want to partition by date particularly by month year

2174117
decimal-point	digits
start by accumulating the digits as an int value ignoring the decimal-point and the exponent

2174117
decimal-point	digits
then scale this value by the exponent taking into account the location of the decimal-point that you ignore while accumulating digits

2174122
configuration	environment	contains	set
basically we have a separate file which contains all configurationurtion info for each environment different deployment location the build-process uses this this info to set value in the configuration file local database

2174123
linux	unix
if you are running on a linux or unix box you can use a shell scripting that periodically runs under crontab to sync a folder to a master folder

2174124
tuples	set
tupless have no methods compared to a list or set and if i must convert a tuples to a set or list to be able to sort them what s the points of using a tuples in the first place

2174143
environment	building
as far as i m aware all currently existing implementation of c# building to cil and run in the .net clr or compatible environment and the only alternative to the .net clr i am aware of is mono

2174148
configuration	environment
i m guessing the reason you are switching the app-configuration is to replace the configuration with one that has the right value for the environment you are publishing too

2174163
windows	wow64	32-bit	16-bit	wow64	win64
windows 32-bit runs 16-bit applications by wowexec.exe and win64 runs 32-bit application by wow64

2174163
windows	wow64
.so without wow64 it s impossible for your program to create a universal launchd on windows

2174168
hotmail	gmail
and gmail hotmail and yahoo would display ur image

2174170
python	java
this is presumably why strings are also immutable in java developed quite separately but about the same time as python and just about everything is immutable in truly-functional languages

2174172
tuples	set
if i must convert a tuples to a set or list to be able to sort them what s the points of using a tuples in the first place

2174178
base-class	inherited
since all of my forms inherited from a base-class i can use the same methods to bring forms to the front send them to the back destroy them start them etc

2174191
integrated	manual
should integrated with database or manual

2174198
ftp	scp
one nice feature is that you can set it up to automatically ftp or scp changed files to the remote site

2174199
sftp	ssh
you d be best off to use another protocols like webdav or ssh sftp

2174205
zend-debugger	xdebug
yes eclipse supports remote-debugging with xdebug as well as the one from zend-debugger checkout justin s links as well as this one for zend-debugger

2174217
spring	grails
we do this with grails and with spring in general that way we don t have to go back and do compatibility testing each time we upgrade

2174221
registration	login
ok i m making a login and registration panels with jquery and php

2174234
hashtable	sorted
hashtable on the other hand can not be sorted at least not directly

2174250
apache-config	.htaccess
something like the following in a location or directory section of your apache-config or in a .htaccess should work

2174283
dictionary	arrays	data-structures	dictionary
as others have pointed out this allows using arrays as key to dictionary and other data-structures that need immutability

2174285
double-quotes	spaces	double-quotes	single-quotes
your spaces character should be in single-quotes not double-quotes

2174285
unsigned	short
returns a types unichar which is an unsigned short .so you should be able to compare this directly to a spaces character if that s what you want to do

2174285
contains	any
note that nil and empty string are not useful here-- neither are actually characters and in any case your string will never contains these

2174297
boolean	double
in fact the only time that i could think of that it would be legitimate to use the double not-operator is if you wanted to do a strict compari.son to another boolean value .so maybe in return-value that expects true or false explicit

2174301
filtering	sorting
but there are considerable limitations to this .when it comes to sorting inorder to get bigtable to accept a filtering like you have to order the list by geohash as well which makes it impossible to sort it by other criterion especially if you want to use paginator

2174302
any	set
i would set the cookies for the explicit domain as you have there because that maintains any security information within that specific domain s cookies

2174302
sequences	unique
3 the custom cookies object construct a composite string on a unique split character or sequences and makes it available to the service methods

2174306
logical-operators	operands
in conclusion the boolean logical-operators can return an operands and not a boolean result necessarily

2174306
or-operator	operands
on the other hand the logical or-operator || will return the value of the second operands if the first one is falsy

2174307
project-management	project
there is nothing free in project-management and managing a complex project with software is inevitably complex

2174311
display	height
we tried not using a height at all for app-body but that causes it to overflow without the scrollbar display

2174311
font-size	height
i know we could set the height to a smaller percentage or a fixed numbers of pixels but that will cause problems for us if the font-size changes

2174323
readfile	fread
this can naturally be adapted to use read fread readfile or any other file api

2174329
contains	any
through this code i am checked is there any cookies with cookname and cookpasswd which contains username and passwd

2174331
any	set
we had our server guys set up .something on exchange .so that for a particular email-address any attachment sent to it will be dumped to a location on the fileserver

2174341
defined	declare
how can i make a class defined in project 1 visible .so i can declare object of that types inside project 2 if both project are part of the same .solution

2174348
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
discard any cell with no points contains and use the results as the new working set

2174357
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i need to be able to detection the installation of this existing program using the particular upgrade code and halt the installation if the versioning of this program the one i am trying to detection is equals to or less than 1.3.0.0

2174361
show	next
the next picture show some matte

2174366
shopping-cart	cart
i am not getting the cart information into my index view .so it is display my shopping-cart as empty

2174369
boost	stl
in libs such as boost and gcc s stl an alternative approach is ubiquitous

2174387
constructor	object
.when initializer a class object you essentially create an instances of the class then run the constructor function

2174391
perl	c++
sometimes this is database-specific some drivers under the perl dbd namespace support their rdbms idea of describing statements in ways analogous to the rdbms native c or c++ api

2174391
where-clause	sql
it s a terribly naive approach -- that bwhere b i test is no more correctly identifying a sql where-clause than simple regexes correctly parsing out selected field named -- but it is likely to work

2174432
configuration	upgrade
i am in the unfortunate situation where i need to deploy and upgrade package and configuration files on machines with no root access and no ability to use or install a package manager

2174454
value	field
set the value for all field with initializer

2174456
arrays	loops	subtract	time
if you want to start at the last and then go backwards you simply change your loops to go initializer at the count of the arrays then subtract one each time from your counter

2174461
required	checked
most languages with a static types systemd are designed to required definition before use which means there must be .some .sort of declaration of a function before the call .so that the call can be checked is the function getting the right numbers and typess of arguments

2174475
subtract	add
you can change 3n or do simple add and subtract to it

2174490
boolean	int
in perl it is an int type-agnostic operation which happens to treat the first arguments as a boolean value

2174494
switching	screens
the grid will switching the screens like .so

2174494
checkbox	button
most examples i see use checkbox or radio button .so there is no error in data input

2174497
deployment	install
the correct way is probably to set up deployment scripting and install but being able to just click publishing in visual-studio and skip going in with remote-desktop is a lot more convenient during development

2174502
button	popup
.when the filtering button is click a popup page appears to do the selection

2174544
scons	qmake
i never try it myself because i use scons for big multi-projects application but the qmake subdirectories target may be what you re looking for

2174551
internet-explorer	firefox
.when i declare mac 123 my internet-explorer and firefox will keep refresh non-stop

2174569
python	php
i m thinking about using pinax which is django which is python or elgg php

2174602
display	height	display	width
i d like to create a jquery function that accepts an image url and .when execute display the image full screens matching the height and width of the current page

2174606
contains	elements
that function will unify with all value that evaluates that function to true in this case all elements contains in the list

2174629
inner-classes	static-class
better yet make each static-class of global named inner-classes of the classes they describe .so instead of orderrecnamed.orderid you could types orderrec.named.orderid .so the class s purpose is very obvious

2174643
fadeout	fadein
i couldn t get toggle to work with fadein fadeout

2174649
synonym	term
an android-emulator is a term for a software-based hardware-simulator but in general the two are synonym

2174662
contains	set
.when my javascript code is contains in a head block in my html file it seems i can t set a breakpoints on it to debugging it

2174693
required	checked
and if checked the textbox below it should be required textbox titled numbers of children

2174698
shutdown	restart
once my systemd is shutdown or restart manually means i am getting the above problem

2174704
instances	private
in c++ and in c# subclassing of a base cannot access private and protected members on the instances of the base

2174712
key-value	key
key-value must to be unique .so null cannot be a valid key because null indicate no key

2174713
authentication	login
which is we are using the authentication attributes on a lot of our action methods and .so what is happening is if the user is not logged in and hits a route that they need to be authentication for it show the login page like it is suppose to but obviously this is suppose to be a modal

2174713
authentication	login
anyhow long story short is there a way to create a custom authentication attributes that can triggers the modal instead of the actual view that makes up the login modal

2174725
centering	fixed
i m guessing you want to draw a square with a fixed size that stays in the centering of the panels as the panels is resize

2174731
put	get
naming urls based on nouns makes it natural to create behavior that is consistent with the intended purpose of get put .post and delete

2174748
selected	button
.when i selected value from drop down then click on show button it should show the crystal report for that selectedion

2174773
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i assume you are using asp.net-mvc and not webforms

2174792
shutdown	restart
you need to elaborate on what you mean by my systemd is shutdown or restart manually but i suspect that whatever you are doing to shut down restart is not restart jboss correctly

2174798
data-access	ado.net
simply you ll have to limit yourself to regular code for data-access linq-to-sql etc service ado.net data service etc

2174805
bmp	png
the timagelist component in delphi 2009 and up handles png and bmp files among many others

2174827
button	popup
if the menu items in these popup button are .so unrelated that you need to distinguish one popup button from the other perhaps you should create separate controllers object for them

2174827
button	popup
each controllers would be the target and thus the validation of its popup button s menu items and only that those popup button s

2174827
button	popup
similarly if a controllers uses represented object most probable if it dynamically populate its popup button s it doesn t have to worry about seeing represented object it doesn t recognize

2174833
textbox	button
this is especially annoying .when you have a textbox and a search buttun and click enter causes a dummy postback not a button click

2174839
key-value	key
the dictionary will just replace the key-value with the key you previously selected basically meaning .when you re traversal the dictionary memoryspace pretend this pair does not exist feel free to overwrite it.

2174839
key-value	key
.so instead of having a triple you would have a tuples with the rules being that if key empty_key then it hasn t been initializer - and therefore you may not use empty_key as a valid key-value

2174869
32-bit	64bit
in practice consider a 64bit systemd that you are programming in and a 32-bit systemd that will actually be running the code

2174872
value	field
storing multiple multiple value in one field is going to cause many headaches

2174891
contains	elements
imagine a one-dimensional arrays where each elements contains a pointers

2174901
compact-framework	.net
this solution helped me to fix the issue media player control for .net compact-framework

2174909
simulator	platform
a simulator is a partials implementation of a device platform it does just enough for its own purposes

2174919
traffic	packets
such algorithms are very useful in cases such as network traffic analysis where high-level trends are more important than each individual packets

2174928
linux	unix
on linux and unix in general r and rb are the same

2174949
required	checked
allowing null key required checked for them which makes the implementation slower and more complicated

2174956
shipping	tax
this solution is fine although in the order table i would put in a total price tax and shipping

2174956
order	add
you can al.so take this further to add in the billing and shipping address .so that if the user changes this in the future it wont change for this specific order

2175006
contains	any
it does not contains any error-handling and may leak resources

2175016
google-chrome	firefox
but as i was just working on that can cause issues with firefox google-chrome

2175018
uicontrol	uiwindow
you can try to put your uicontrol on a view which is not disabled the uiwindow for example or any subviews and bring it on top

2175024
input-field	selected
the form has 1 input-field just a file_field that allows the user to selected the file they want to upload

2175038
32-bit	64bit	double	int
i d investigate whether the variables could be cast to a 32-bit int for float or 64bit int for double and see if they re equals to 0x8000.

2175055
expression	brackets
above is my regular expression .when i am passing or brackets symbols it is nt returnig error.

2175066
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
i drilled down into guts of tstringlist.sort and it is sorting using ansicomparestr case-sensitive or ansicomparetext case-insensitive

2175090
google-chrome	firefox	fadeout	fadein
why is the quality of this fadein fadeout demo much smoother .when viewed in firefox google-chrome than .when viewed in ie8

2175130
expression	brackets
i can t tell what you re doing but you can match everything except what s in the brackets of a regular expression by using where abc are the characters you do not want to match

2175136
selected	textbox
.so all you have to do is intercept the onchange event on the client side grab the selected value of the dropdown and place it into the labels textbox that show the rate

2175151
reflection	runtime
without reflection and dynamic class loading based on the string named it would be impossible in this instances to have the same program run on both versioning of the platform without getting a class not found exception-handling at runtime

2175153
any	set
after that you can write any spellchecker and set in the configuration file the actual file named

2175175
any	set
this mecanism is very powerful as any java application truly acts as a set of replaceable components which are all dynamically loaded

2175178
any	set
note that in .net 4.0 you can set properties directly on an expression but the c# compiler doesn t add any extra support for this .so you d need to write your own expression by hand

2175183
python	ruby
object such as ruby or python ones

2175199
constructor	object
the easiest thing that i can think it to defined your onevent methods within your constructor there you will have quick access to the current object instances and you will not have to modify your public api

2175213
constructor	private	constructor	object
if you want to be able to initializer a php object while passing several different combinations of parameters use the factory-pattern with a private constructor

2175231
hash	md5
checkout the md5 hash algorithm

2175238
postgresql	mysql
database_engine sqlite3 # postgresql_psycopg2 postgresql mysql sqlite3 or ado_mssql

2175248
python	java
you have to write your code in python + django-templates or java and although i had never used python or django before i found them amazingly quick and easy to learn the basic

2175272
gnome	kde
i want to create a thumbnail view of a file types similar to thumbnails display in gnome kde

2175272
gnome	kde
wondering if anyone knows which libs gnome kde uses to display thumbnail view of different file types in linux

2175291
.when	ready
a better way is to create a form .when you need it and release it .when you are ready with it

2175296
selected	button
.when a user click the edit button i want to set the selected item on from2 based on form one

2175314
value	field
also you aren t correctly concatenation the form field value into the url parameter of the methods

2175316
directory	folder
if you want to make something available for distribution the easiest way is to create a new folder directory copy all of the files and folder you want to distribute into it and then use either the os x disk utility application in applications utilities or the command-line hdiutil utility to create a new disk image file from the contents of the folder

2175324
processor	cpu
however if you have a multi-core processor and a single-threaded program the cpu usage of your process display in the task manager will always be limited by 100 ncores

2175327
selected	listbox
for each gui control be it listview or listbox etc msdn will tell you what messages to trap and use for knowing which file was dragged or selected

2175330
any	set
in my route configuration i ve set this route below to handle the ajax-request which should be able to come from any view and still be able to go to the route i ve specified

2175331
3des	des
3des is running des three time

2175331
3des	des
.so rc2 des and 3des are in the cypher suite to provide compatibility with business systemd that use those cyphers

2175331
aes	des
it is the official replacement for des termed the advanced encryption standards aes

2175339
websphere	ibm
the ibm websphere application-server v6.1 security handbook chapter 9.6 enlightened me

2175343
webforms	asp.net
since everything that happens in asp.net webforms is part of the form elements viewstate events etc. this would cause the entire lifecycle to be repeated

2175365
ruby	php
this will allow you to isolate php and ruby configuration and you ll avoid conflicts between them

2175367
contains	any
and how could i modify one of those expression to match only links that contains certain words and to ignore any matches that do not contains those words

2175390
defined	declare
the traditional solution is as has been said to declare both copy-constructor and assignment-operator as private and not to defined them

2175390
base-class	inherited
inherited leads to ebo or empty base optimization while an attributes will be addressable and thus will occupy memory in each instances of the class even if it does not actually need it the compiler has the possibility not to add this overhead for a base-class

2175390
defined	declare
you could alternatively declare the operators private and not defined them in your own class but the code would be less self-documenting and you would not be able to automatically search for those class that have this properties then unless you have a full-blown parsing

2175413
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
then you will get only one but if you are pushing viewcontroller you ll get two.so either hide the root navigationcontroller s navigationbar or use presentmodalviewcontroller

2175419
mta	sta
i am new to com and trying to understand the difference between sta and mta

2175420
command-line	cmd
i can do this but it will be a very plain and simple bash scripting simply contains the actual cmd i types at the command-line

2175420
ubuntu	linux
my question what is the best way to scripting this kind of repetitive procedure in bash linux ubuntu for a remote-server

2175435
perl	php	perl	ksh	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	java	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl	shell	bash	bash	zsh
you can do this with the shell bash ksh zsh + ssh + tools or programming languages such as python perl ruby or php or java etc basically a language that supports ssh protocols and operating systemd functions

2175445
double	int
the data can be double int string and could also be an arrays vector etc

2175446
scripting	shebang
put set -e at the top of the scripting after the shebang

2175447
command-line	cmd
there is nothing wrong with a simple bash scripting simply contains the actual cmd you types at the command-line

2175457
oracle	mysql
only because the framework offers specific support for oracle you probably don t want to deploy an oracle datasource as dependency for your mysql project

2175458
python	ruby
however you may want to checkout ruby python or other suggestions from .so contributers

2175487
contains	any
i am guessing you are not looking for an exact match but for any recording where the tags field contains all of the tags

2175513
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
we are ok to use python php ruby ruby-on-rails gruby-on-rails or .net

2175515

2175592
istream	std
i would pass the already opened std istream object to read from

2175596
value	field
you can set the default value for location named street additional country latitude and longitude on the configure page of that field

2175617
.when	ready
you can just append the div at the top of the page with the loading text and .when the document is ready change the text to loaded

2175626
.when	ready
and then change it as per your code above .when the document is ready

2175634
versioning	upgrade
if i recall well the latest versioning of the old telerik ajax is 1.8.7 - i suppose you can upgrade to it free of charge since it is a minor versioning compared to yours

2175647
shell	bash
identifying received signals named in bash shell scripting

2175666
error-logging	logging
once in a while i ll come across a hunk that might be an error-logging statement an extra newline usually from erasing the aforementioned logging statement - something that i d actually rather remove entirely

2175694
hide	show
and that works fine but then i hide some items show some others and want to re-do this styling but only styling every 4th item that is visible

2175700
execution	exit
the fact that the default visual-studio behavior .when execution a drag-and-drop with a toolbox control is to modify the form s designer file could be causing the immediate exit since the file doesn t exist

2175716
telnet	ftp
expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip etc..

2175825
authentication	login
should i switching back to http after user has been authentication over http assuming no sensitive information is sent over after login

2175826
python	java
along with java and gcc python is an excellent way to write native cross-platform applications

2175844
database-agnostic	postgresql
another not database-agnostic way would be to cast format the dates to the right format in the database with postgresql functions or operators and have the database do the matching with the postgresql regexp operators or whatnot

2175856
webserver	upload
what i want is for a file upload via one webserver be immediately available if accessed through the other

2175873
tuples	set
a possible solution could be to defined a variables before the test and set it within the c1 and c2 functions but i would like to find a more functional styles solution maybe something that return a tuples like elements found conditional satisfied

2175877
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
each language was created for different purposes python is strong with string operations perl very powerful in batch-file scripting php a very reliable application webserver c the mother of most popular languages

2175881

then my grouping started to clone push and pull around in this project

2175883
any	set
but on any of the edit form i want to set the selected index of the dropdownlistfor how shall i do that i am pastng my code here

2175890
webforms	asp.net
i realize now that the stronger i got in asp.net webforms the more difficult it became to learn other technologies such as javascript and the non-microsoft implementation of ajax

2175890
webforms	asp.net
microsoft leveraged their asp.net development approach from their winforms development approach which helped with the learning curve if you were coming from webforms development but it s not a good way to develop web-applications if you understand the difference between the two approaches

2175890
ruby	php
if i can t use asp.net-mvc i ll learn ruby or php

2175891
textures	fbo

2175907
webserver	security
it also allows you to use existing security and caching layer on a standards webserver without having to write any bespoke middleware

2175907
put	get
i would suggest that the verbs get .post put and delete are suitable for virtually any need

2175917
put	get
the reason is that a timer event cound be put on the messages que and noge get process brfor the destructor of other components

2175924
where-clause	sql
i suggest you create a parsing that takes your date query and gives you the part of the sql where-clause

2175924
globalization	localization
therefore convert local to some standards in the non-sql code then use it to perform your query basically separate localization globalization and the query execution

2175941
account	api
from my knowledge the analytics api only supports data export it doesn t allow for integration on the account or profiling information add edit delete

2175990
stateless	stateful
click is a stateless framework while wicket is stateful

2175990

perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
python perl ruby

2176007
show	next
my users tell me they are not notified .when i updates my application but that .when they view their my downloading from the market application on their phone it show updates available next to the application

2176038
32-bit	16-bit
to simplify this you could pack both in a 32-bit far pointers or you could asssume a default segmet register and store just the lower 16-bit in a near pointers

2176040
qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview
my assumption is that the best way to handle this is to restructure the qabstractitemmodel - or should i simply throw that model away and assign a newly constructred one to the qtreeview

2176042
updating	updates
updating a lot of applications via the market can be chore due to the interminable prompt .so i .sometimes don t get round to updating applications as .soon as updates are available

2176043
put	get
ideally i want to be able to create a queue on-the-fly which i can put get messages within my test

2176046

sql-server	oracle
what is the best way to import large ammount of data from an oracle to the ms sql-server 2000

2176070
conditional	operators
you can process your locale string on the client side and form a correct conditional for a like rlike or regexp_subsrt operators

2176092
wordpress	magento
magento and wordpress package all themes related files into their own seperate directory

2176097

templating	markup
there is also the approach of having php markup directly in the templates file s like while this is a perfectly valid practice i use myself often i recommend using a templates-engine over using php markup in the code if you want a solid future-proof templating systemd because

2176113
required	checked
other cases where the rectangles only partially overlap will required more logic looking at the max min of value to checked for going out of bounds etc

2176131
ruby	php
ruby-on-rails is a web framework implements in ruby which can be used to develop web apps - as an alternative to php

2176134
ruby	php	ruby-on-rails	cakephp	cakephp	symfony	zend-framework	symfony	zend-framework	cakephp
if you need a comparison ruby-on-rails is for ruby what zend-framework cakephp or symfony are for php

2176134
ruby	php
neither ruby nor ruby-on-rails are real alternatives to php

2176134
ruby	php
ruby offers some low-level cgi libs you can use to interact with webserver but it required much more effort compared to php because again php is a web-focused language

2176205
openfire	ejabberd
there are two servers that are pretty stable and feature rich ejabberd implements in erlang and openfire implements in java

2176220

2176238
rollback	commit
the commit methods writes the changes back to the datastore the rollback methods simply clears it s changes

2176303
icollection	ienumerable
your easiest option would be to expose your list as one of the following ienumerable icollection readonlycollection via a public properties

2176323
data-structures	tree
since the numbers of items in that list is probably likely to be very small linear search does the job and it isn t worth it to bother using binary-search or more advanced data-structures like segment tree

2176377
any	set
here s a kickoff example how page1.jsp is supposed to look like note the meta headers those are the minimum set to disable the browser-cache the crossbrowser-compatible way you should not change them in any way

blend doesnâ t follow the same build-process as vs perhaps it just shell out to msbuild

2176409
innodb	myisam
the former is generally faster in innodb the latter in myisam

2176417

user-controls	tabcontrol
this tabcontrol g has tabpages and in this pages is the describe user-controls h placed

2176426
textbox	button
if you resize the form the textbox with the ... button won t resize but if you resize via the vertical splitcontainer it works

2176428
boolean	int
they are things that you can pass around to functions return from functions just like boolean int or strings

2176428
parentheses	operators
the right in right associativity means that you should interpreter as if there were parentheses around the rightmost operators

2176431
inlining	inline
you ll only see bloat from call that have actually been inline and the compiler will only inline them if its heuristics indicate that it inlining will improve performance

2176434
digits	zero
if you want to generator say a zipcode and don t mind leading zero as long as it s 5 digits you can use

2176440
sql-injection	dynamic-sql

ruby and python are up there

2176575
debugging	trace
4 defined debugging constants is unchecked and defined trace constants is checked

2176578

2176622
scala	java
scala is statically typed but more concise than java

2176654
contains	set
a good idea might be to have one suite contains all the tests and a couple of seperate suites referring to the first one specifying the different set of category you neeed

2176656
contains	any
if a class contains any static field with initializer those initializer are execute in textual order immediately prior to execution the static constructor.

2176664
environment	building
another good ide believe it or not is visual-studio -- it s points and click styles of setting up a building environment is quite granular

2176664
environment	building
i ve learned make and gcc a few time and there is just too much their too remember -- once you have a building environment going you are likely to forget the intricacies

2176670
arrays	map
if i create the following comparator then i get an error in the call to sort function of arrayss i am getting an entry set from the map and then using the set as an arrays

2176749
google-chrome	firefox
unlike firefox google-chrome provides no helpful bonus properties on the event object

2176756
json	xml
since ruby-on-rails favorites a restful .approach you can make your flex .app just call the right uris for data and then work with the result either json or xml

2176762
environment	building
my preferred solution is to run an audited automatic building test environment in the development arena and generator traceable audited building artifacts .jar files to transfer to production

2176765
value	field
for foreignkey i am using raw_id_field as a workaround but for normals field and even filter_horizontal each memberno value is display as member object

but honestly why not just loops through the existing arrays and then do whatever you want to do with loopss to this afterwards

2176802
windows-vista	windows
.net 3.5 sp1 is install by default on windows 7 windows-vista has 3.0 install

2177598
any	set
ad-hoc polymorphism which allows a function to operate on any of a defined set of types in a structurally distinct but hopefully semantics identical manner

2177598
defined	declare
ad-hoc polymorphism is enabled in haskell by types classes which required the class to be defined with all of its associated ad-hoc polymorphism functions and instances to be explicit declare for the typess used by overload-resolution

2177613
pointers	stack
you can also structure this with main allocation the memory using malloc or on stack directly and passing in the pointers for fn to use

2177613
malloc	free
then the malloc free happen in the same place

2177618
environment	execution

the getter and setter of a properties should be a methods of the class or it s parent - or - a field of the class or it s parent

2177654
getter	setter
you might create a getter function and setter procedure that will return this properties of ftimer getter and set this properties of ftimer setter

2177666
vb.net	vb6
problem is perhaps i think that i am writing in vb.net which has different data types than vb6

2177673

furthermore the plumbing required to wire up a real asp.net .app complete with json ajax rest call cross-browser javascript dom management css etc

2177851
javascript	dom
gizmox also employs a proprietary obfuscation algorithm to prevent unauthorized scripting from accessing visual webgui javascript call dom elements

2177869
webserver	upload
if the remote-server is also running as a webserver you could create the upload form and have the submit action go to the other server

2177869
webserver	security
the disadvantage of this is that some browsers will treat this as a potential security hole and warn the user .when the page is display but you can get around this by creating a reverse-proxy entry in your main webserver that points to the fileserver

2177876
perl	ruby
then use ruby or perl or something to cleanup your solution into a prettier form

2177887
contains	set

2177957
internet-explorer	firefox
for instances the key hkey_local_machine software clients startmenuinternet lists both internet-explorer and firefox on my pc

2177968
callback	methods
the problem is that .when the byte arrays is retrived i get an exception-handling .when trying to show the savefiledialog because that action is initiated by the callback methods and not from a user action it seems

2177974
show	next
it has been reported and fixed in r150648 by mike krã¼ger .so it should show up in the next release of monodevelop

2177975
time-complexity	binary-search
i think if searching the insert positioning with binary-search algorithm the insert time-complexity should be o log n .here i treat the arrival order of jobs as a factors of priority

2177975
linked-list	arrays
i assume the list wikipedia refer is not linked-list and it could be arrays

2177976
deployment	install
i have read in one of the post here that the following files which come with dotnetfx35client downloading could be used for deployment for .net 3.5 instead of the full 200 mb install

i want to ask is there any way of making windows-xp program to work under windows-ce

2177988
windows-xp	windows-ce
i got some dlls compiled in windows-xp but they refuse to load in windows-ce

2177989
base-class	inherited
this way you don t create new object of the base-class and try to set the types you just use the model that inherited from the base-class

2177997
priority-queue	heap
it seems that in your quote wikipedia is referring to a priority-queue backed by a sorted list rather than a heap

2178029
constructor	object
if object weren t created by a service call i d put it into the constructor

2178029
handler	service
now right after service response my program searches through datacontract hierarchy gets desired object and adds event handler

2178051
double	int
likewise if you want the arithmetic mean of some int s instead of double s it can handle that as well again without changing the code

2178078
textchanged	textbox
rather than thinking like a windows forms programmer and capturing the specific key event the canonical approach in silverlight is to use the textchanged event to remove undesirable characters from a textbox

2178081
revision	svn
ok .so i know you can put revision in a file and then set the svn keyword properties on that file .so that whenever the file is committed that variables is replace with the last committed versioning numbers

2178081
revision	svn
i plan on using the svn revision numbers as part of the key to lookup from caching

2178092
primitive	int
in objective-c an int is a primitive types whereas an nsnumber or other similar things are object

2178092
getter	setter
primitive-types since they don t support many of the things object do like getter and setter methods can only be declare

2178092
primitive	int
the short versioning primitive like int don t have messages or methods

2178101
primitive	int
if you declare your int as an nsint or a c-style primitive int then what you say is true

double	int	unsigned	short
it is possible to create a nsnumber object from a signed or unsigned char short int int long int long-long int float double or bool

2178112
environment	building
however you don t give details of your environment - if you re building an intranet-based application it is possible to have the server printing directly to a printinger if that printinger is accessible to the server

2178123
revision	svn
instead you can use some scriptinging to retrieve the last revision of your working copy or the last revision on the svn server and replace it in your scripting file contains the get_from_cache function

2178133
for-loop	arrays
i tried to do it with a for-loop but .when the third arrays is going to be operate it always operate the firstarrays 3 - secondarrays 0 .

2178167
ienumerator	ienumerable
i can see no reason for foreach not to be available to any class implements the ienumerable ienumerator interfaces and this is a really useful methods if you need to perform a small action 1 line is more readable than 1 line + 2 boilerplate foreach syntax...

2178169
show	next
3 next the windows should show up in the right place but ie gives the annoying block active content warning

2178178
interop	tlbimp
i used tlbimp to generator a delay signed interop dll

2178190
getter	setter
not just have getter and setter

2178190
subtract	add
it is perfectly common to have methods like add and subtract on an immutable class that return new instances of the immutable class

2178193
revision	svn
if you put the full dump on to a dvd for example you would have the data available if you ever needed it but you could then delete the whole repository and svn load the revision dump leaving you with a small clean repository

2178205
shared-objects	.so
in linux they are called shared-objects .so and in mac os x they are called dynamic libs dylib and bundles bundle

2178213
stderr	stdout
carefully distinguishing stdout from stderr also helps

2178223
minimum	max
however if all you want to do is enforce a minimum size for each dimension you could use the max macros instead

2178226
arrays	loops
however if you want to use the advantage of foreach loops there s a methods called tolist as show below used to convert an arrays back to list

2178228
contains	any
a scripting contains arbitrary sql statements is there any way of finding out what the minimum permissions are required to execute the sql

2178229
shared-objects	.so
shared-objects need those symbols that a calling entity is aware of -- said .so dll s plugins api exported

2178237
hash	md5	value	field
in the past i have done this using an md5 hash of the field ids on the page plus an unknown phrase saved as a hidden-field on the page and a session filtering that generator an expected hash given the field ids that were submitted and compares it against the value in the hidden-field

2178238
callback	methods
inside your callback methods you can implements the logic for writing to a file - first by opening the dialog and then by getting the pointers to the file streaming as show below

2178241
put	get	getter	setter
i am trying to put getter and setter into my inteface but i get the following error1053

2178241
getter	setter
how are you suppose to put getter and setter into a interface

2178251
cryptography	security
it turned out that for proper cryptography security we needed two things a confidential parameter and a variables parameter

2178251
hash	md5	salt	md5
this computes a hash passwd with the hash-function md5 suitable for usage in the etc passwd or etc shadow file for the passwd blah and the salt zap here i choose the salt explicit but under practical conditional it should be selected randomly

2178251
authentication	login
edit in a login-and-passwd user authentication systemd the login could act as a passable salt two distinct users will have distinct login but this does not capture the situation of a given user changing his passwd whether the new passwd is identical to an older passwd will leak

2178258
getter	setter
i believe what the compiler is complaining about is that the getter returns an arrays but the setter takes a targetsystem

2178272
udp	tcp
they would call into your application via some sort of interprocess communication mechanism pipe or shared-memory or over the network udp or tcp as a low-level mechanism or some sort of rpc mechanism like sunrpc soap http rest what have you

2178274
getter	setter
typically a setter takes in the same class that a getter returns

2178276
font-size	height
if the font-size is 10px the height is 15px

2178289
any	set
during creation it creates any adaptor i have set up in my configuration and registers them in this class instances with a named it also looks for a default flag for use with zend_db_table as well as doing some other stuff

2178292
binary-tree	tree	children	tree
specifications a well-formed binary-tree is said to be height-balanced if 1 it is-empty or 2 its left and right children are height-balanced and the height of the left tree is within 1 of the height of the right tree

2178292
tree-balancing	nodes
the points of any tree-balancing algorithm is to ensure that you do not wind up in the situation where you have a million nodes on one side and three on the other

2178301
put	get
p.s. there is one more oddity eventhough i put numbersfirstline false i get the line numbers 1 i get that linenumbers as well without setting numbersfirstline which should default to false it is jsu in there to points out that something is wrong

2178315
value	field
.so to fix this add explicit to the required field with a hard server-side value and thus not or .so where the client bots can control the param.foo

2178320
tokenize	parsing
if you want to do it right the tokenize functions can analyze a file on php parsing level

2178323
environment	execution
your development-environment is resolving a different fonts than your execution environment

2178324
vb.net	vb6
yes the vb.net data types are not compatible with the vb6 ones

2178329
ruby-on-rails	django	pylons	django
the one thing i wish i could do is have the concept of default routes in django like ruby-on-rails does or even pylons

2178352
protected	public
operations on data that will never be accessible to the public private or protected

2178352
protected	public
operations that you might wish to expose protected or public

2178362
contains	any
if a page is bookmarkable and doesn t contains any non-stateless components behavior then the page is automatically stateless and not stored in the session

2178364
decrement	increment
it s not possible to make the positioning decrement instead of increment after each read write

2178407
put	get
if you re going hard-core rest using the full complement of get .post put delete and checked the user-agent s accept headers and all that django will by default have you splitting your logic between url configuration files and view files .so it might not be the cleanest .solution

2178410
contains	lookup
i even put together a small sample found here contains a simple ejb project as well as a gwt project that performs the lookup

2178429
put	get
i tried everything remove the external put static in the .m declaration and always get compilation errors

2178439
sql-server	oracle
i am using mbunit with microdesk but it is not better approach for oracle but sql-server

2178481
revision	svn
i m using the last svn revision of grappelli and rev 11840 of django

2178483
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements
a list may contains duplicates and adding an elements will not generally change the overall order of the list

2178488
put	get
i have already written some code to measure the correct rectangle to put the form to but .when i assign it to the maximisedbounds attributes of the form there are some issures the screens in my 2 screens tests that the form was not on before the click get only one paint ans if you click on the form on the other screens it is like you have click under it onto the next windows beneath

2178489
png	gif
as long as the libs can create png or gif images it should work

2178495
rollback	commit
note that doing a rollback will undo an entire transactional which means every updates insert and delete since the transactional began which is usually since the last commit or rollback

2178515
populate	row
you could use a vbox contains an hbox for each row and simply populate each hbox with 2 items something like

2178536
apache	vhosts
if you have full control of the server best idea since running magento on shared hosts is a bit problematic from a resource points of view add vhosts to apache and set the environment mage_run_code and mage_run_type variables in .htaccess for your site

2178536
any	set
i don t see any easy way to set up the subdomain .when you create the site though

2178539
installation	building
this way visual-studio building directly to the sharepoint server and you do not have to manage 2 installation hosts and viewmodel

2178553
display	width
i ve tried wrapping the listitem contents in a div with a width attributes but it also just display the div tag literally in the listitem text

2178578
rollback	commit
this is a lot more powerful than matching up begin tran and commit rollback statements as the latter rely on a connection-local transactional count whereas the former is actually.

2178582
naming-conventions	conventions
however if you find that this affects your on boarding of new developers or you are having trouble coming up with consistent conventions you can try the hungarian-esque naming-conventions to differentiate types a little

2178596
average	minimum
for touch the recommended minimum control size is 23x23 pixels 13x13 dlus . where a dialog unit dlu is a device-independent metrics where one horizontal dialog unit equals one-fourth of the average character width for the current fonts and one vertical dialog unit equals one-eighth of the character height for the current fonts

2178604
web-applications	enterprise
i m sure we ve all worked on or are aware of web-applications especially in the enterprise that have tightly bound themselves to the server session

2178610
click	mouse	pixels	line
work out the intersection points of your line probably do this .when they are added and store result then see if the mouse is close enough to warrent display the context menu .so you don t need pixels perfect click

2178617
pixels	line
then checked that the intersection points is not beyond the line borders and calculate proximity +- pixels or two

2178628
.when	ready
i have sorted out the issue of detectionion the nested but i can t figure out how to detection the ready state of the dom .when it is an iframe

2178639
nsmanagedobject	ivar
to do this my nsmanagedobject called data had an nsdata attributes and an nsmutabledata ivar

2178656
contains	elements
i have encountered a problem whereby my xml body contents contains several instances of against elements

2178677
selected	cell
if you click on a cell you get to see some details about the selected object done with a navigation controllers

2178691
georss	kml
i can use javascript to activate the methods and i know that the openwindowinfohtml methods is defined .when process the kml georss with the appropriate information

2178708
contains	any
i have some code where the model contains some classes like vb.net pseudocode but could be any oo language

2178725
selected	cell
one way is you can recording the indexpath that the cell was in then use uitableview scrolltorowatindexpath to scroll to the cell that was selected heres a ref

2178733
arrays	loops
i m trying to put an arrays in to getelementbyid for a loops purpose

2178760
constructor	private
if the new is a member function why can it not call the private constructor

2178760
constructor	private	constructor	object	data-members	constructor	data-members	private
i was hoping since new is a data-members it could call the private constructor but since new is not used for stack object you would not be allowed to create the object on stack

2178761
constructor	object
the parameters passed in to the constructor are simply information for the object to initializer itself

2178766
datagrid	listbox
if your data object is part of some kind of items control itemscontrol listbox listview datagrid etc. you can obtain the relevant item containers by using the itemscontrol.itemcontainersgenerator.getcontainersfromitem methods

2178778
children	nodes
i have a problem on how to pass the arrays to recursion function .so continue children from the last nodes i wrote and .so on

2178791
firefox	safari
it looks .so nice in firefox and safari but not in ie8 there is still a thick ugly border above the footer

2178794
sharp-architecture	nhibernate
have a look at sharp-architecture this is best practice for asp.net-mvc with nhibernate

2178800
registration	login
the user registration login and cart functionality will be on client s domain ex abc.com which is an non ssl and the user should be transfer to our eshop domain which is entirely different domain and is on ssl ex during checkout

2178810
click	mouse
mouse click on the table cell contains the jcheckbox are not passed on to the checkbox they are absorbed by the table

2178811
constructor	private
obviously new is not calling the constructor but you will still get a private constructor error messages if you compile it

2178815
constructor	private
constructor are really no different than other member function in this respect if they re marked as private they are inaccessible outside the class such as in main

2178815
constructor	private	constructor	object
and since during initializer a constructor always needs to be called you cannot initializer an object of a class that has only private inaccessible constructor

2178815
constructor	private
and this is exactly where private constructor are useful sometimes you do not want your class to have all of those implicit implementation or you don t want your class to support certain behavior such as copy assignment or copy construction

2178819
versioning	upgrade
i find that active generator makes it much easier to upgrade to newer versioning of csla as well as add functionality without having a strong need for an intermediate class

2178829
exception-handling	try-catch
but in short just throw an exception-handling that will not get caught in a try-catch block

2178832
constructor	private	constructor	object
the problem is that if the constructor is private you cannot initializer an object

2178832
constructor	private
why did you make your constructor private

2178857
arrays	loops
to loops through all the elements in the arrays

2178865
entity	poco
are you wanting a way to map asp.net-mvc model poco to a csla entity

2178888
linux	unix
i found understanding unix linux programming a guide to theory and practice by bruce molay to be an excellent introduction to unix systemd programming

2178889
triggers	insert
the triggers runs on each insert of num1 in test

2178889
triggers	insert
is there anything that can be done with the triggers .so that the updates done to num2 are correct in case of multiple insert

2178890
constructor	object
you would pass the ad object as an arguments to the child s constructor and populate the bo

2178914
constructor	private
is to make the constructor private and offer a factory function as show in some other answers as the one by villintehaspam points out

2178919
shell	bash
it is al.so cross platform .so should work on windows without having to use a third-party shell such as cygwin bash

2178920
authentication	login
the problem is .when an authentication user attempts to access it it redirects them to the login page

2178926
triggers	insert
take a look at insert pseudo table in your triggers as it will contains multiple rows during these operations

2178929
triggers	insert
triggers needs to be rewriteen to handle multiple row insert

2178929
triggers	insert
all triggers must alawys consider that someday someone is going to do a multi-row insert updates delete

2178939
nsstring	nsdata
.so i want to stripes out the without converting to nsstring and then back to nsdata

2178943
authentication	login
you could also just checked the returnurl on login to see if it came from a page and the user is authentication but that to me is a hokey solution

2178973
contains	any
this operation is overkill if your nodes does not contains any match information

2178973
for-loop	arrays
you know the value of your language variables before for-loop .so you can caching the to arrays before the for-loop and use already caching arrays

2178978
associations	model
many_to_many associations in ruby-on-rails may be the right option with an extra column on the bet table to note who owns the model

2178981
python	php
i m not a php guy more python django but i do know some basic php and your code looked fine to me

2178983
object-reference	instances
but i get this error messages object-reference not set to an instances of an object. here s the function

2178997
version-control	git
version-control - look into subversion and git

2179015
textbox	button
now functionality wise the only problem is .when i write something in the textbox other than the normals format and click the updates button it lets me accept the value instead it should not let it write anything else other than the date-format

2179047
traffic	wan
i used to be able sniff traffic on windows-xp and server 2003 on ppp wan interfaces using wireshark

2179056
textbox	button
edit 3 i made a test project with a listview a textbox and a button and added some random items to the listview in form_load

2179057
continuous-integration	teamcity
if you take advantage of tfs fully i d also recommend looking into a continuous-integration tool something along the line of jetbrains s teamcity or cruisecontrol.net etc

2179058
configuration	environment
you can al.so set the perl5lib environment variables .so you wouldn t have to do this kind of configuration in the scripting

2179067
any	set
if it s any help a way i ve seen quite frequently to get the parameters into a .swf file is to use a php scripting to dynamically create the tags and set parameters in this fashion corresponding to query-string parameters database variables etc

2179071
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.1.7 gecko 20091221 firefox 3.5.7

2179076
textbox	button	selected	textbox	selected	button
see what i want is to have a button which i do that a user can click and it show the openfiledialog which i have but then .when they selected a file i want its path to be show in a textbox

2179116
nunit	moq
i have a private methods that should return true.i m using nunit and moq

2179118
any	set
i don t see how encoding an arbitrary set of bits differ from compression encoding any other form of data

2179129
executable	jar
also if you want the jar to be executable you need to include a manifest.mf contains a main-class entry specifying which class should be used as the entry-point this class must defined a

2179154
tcp-ip	tcp
not all .apps will use the mds transport to communication - for example if the .app uses direct tcp or wifi it will bypass your mds server and go directly over the computer s tcp-ip stack .when running in the simulator

2179154
any	set
unfortunately in this case the simulator doesn t use any system-level proxy settings the proxy settings set in ie -- .so it won t know about your proxy-server and probably fail

2179154
fiddler	charles
it would make it .so much easier to debugging with tools such as charles or fiddler

2179157
vb.net	vb6
our semantic designs clonedr is a tool that detection copy-paste-edit blocks of code for many languages c++ java c++ cobol ecmascript php vb6 vb.net .

2179168
reflection	runtime
if you really want to use reflection with runtime code compilation in this way i think you re better off with a language like python

2179170
debugging	trace
checked the content of the loaded php xml file trace it into .some textfield for debugging .so you can checked if the actual content is being loaded correctly

2179176
spacing	layout
you may have to have specific classes or ids for the wrapper_html and fiddle with the css to get your layout and spacing working the way you d like

2179185
any	set
without seeing any of the code i would suspect the content-type header isn t being set correctly and the php scripting is sending as html

2179191
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
consider asp.net webforms applications or asp.net-mvc website yes this is a very basic analysis of the difference

2179197
spaces	output
in fact simple information theory tells us that in some cases any compression algorithm will produce output that takes up more spaces than you started with

2179198
put	get
once the developer can t get his change to prod any other way devs should not have prod rights there is no incentive to not put the change in source control

2179207
value	field
edit i forgot to mention item_1 and .so forth are not simple field value but each is rather an expression such as .so it looks like i have to do a nested-query

2179225
installation	environment
while i know this only works for a windows environment we decided to deploy an active-directory instances and use sso for both our redmine and svn installation via apache

2179243
external	embed
static linkage would embed the wininet code directly into your executable with no need for an external dll

2179256
domain-object	repository
that would mean that each domain-object having a repository should be aware of the current user

2179257
constructor	object
it is in fact a combinations of pimpl and strategy-pattern and the constructor of concrete will call a factory that will be responsible to serve the effective object

2179260
dependency-injection	service-locator
these limitations in my mind relegate the service-locator pattern to a middle ground between big-ball-of-mud and dependency-injection useful if you must use it but by far not the best choice

2179262
build-server	msbuild
the reason a build-server for .net apps no longer required visual-studio to be install as andrew burns mentioned is because msbuild is part of the .net now

2179263
python	java
the guys are very good at programing they are learning python and java at politechnical high school from the first year

2179272
boost	stl
as others have said there is no silver bullet in stl boost to elegantly solve your problem

2179273
export	csv
i am export my list to csv file through servlet

2179290
document	editing
if the op actually means c# then the error is occurring because you are editing a document that is not part of a project solution you currently have open or the file has the building action set to none

2179294
notification-area	system-tray
i have a long-running powershell cmd a building that i would like to be notified .when it completes via a balloon tooltip in the system-tray notification-area

2179307
attributes	properties
normally i would us a enum with a description attributes to give me 3 value choices but the 3rd one in this case needs to be a string al.so and not an int .so i created an interface with those 3 properties and inherited all of the domain object from it

2179313
value	field
my question is this how do i design this .so that .when the form is submitted and there are errors that the dynamically added field the components will remain on the page and display the correct value

2179324
configuration	logging
if you were using wcf you could just turn on logging in the configuration

2179345
boost-function	boost-python
i have a methods exported to python using boost-python that takes a boost-function as an arguments

2179345
boost-function	boost-python
from what i have read boost-python should support boost-function without much fuss but .when i try to call the function with a python methods it gives me this error

2179345
boost-function	boost-python
.so what is the syntax i need to use for boost-python to accept my python functions as a boost-function

2179355
macports	fink
if you re using macports or fink etc. make sure that py2app is using the correct interpreter

2179356
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
but then again that is still probably 30-40 time faster than the equivalent in ruby php or python

2179359
lookup	any
install the target assembly and the companion typelib in a folder to remove any gac lookup issues

2179369
google-chrome	firefox
but i have a strange problem with facebook connect on firefox and google-chrome browsers it just will not allow me to authentication

2179423
associations	model
let s say i have a user model and an invoices model with a belongs_to user associations

2179427
credentials	security
i created my security credentials from this site

2179429
png	gif
i d like to know how to convert png and gif files with alpha channel to jpg with white background with paperclip

2179436
textbox	button	listbox	textbox
such controls consist of textbox listbox and button

2179457
json	xml
xml json or something else

2179475
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
for public facing website i would personally choose asp.net-mvc because i find the development cycle shorter more productive more flexible and more maintainable than an asp.net webforms application

2179529
selected	listbox
.so for example if the user selecteded the caramel preset as.sociated with the candybar listbox it will selected all the candy bars that have caramel.

2179548
variables	boolean
loggedin a boolean variables about whether the user is logged in or not

2179552
json	xml
most folks today use some variant of web service posting xml or json but you can do whatever you want

2179559
databound	gridview
the gridview is not databound .so it doesn t show but there is still a spaces

2179559
callback	methods
if the data is valid and expected use the clientscriptmanager.registerforeventvalidation methods inorder to register the postback or callback data for validation

2179572
margins	padding
make two nested layer with zero margins and padding like .so

2179574
windows-xp	windows
ok the windows dev platform i have is a windows-xp box and a copy of visual-c++ 6.0

2179576
input-field	selected
.so using javascript to merge a selected box with an input-field

2179582
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
but there is one advantage i see in asp.net webforms that asp.net-mvc doesn t have rich client iteraction controls

2179585
codedom	.net
macros provides a code model based on the .net codedom i presume

2179590
triggers	insert
use triggers for insert updates and deletes to put a row into the history table

2179596
administration	account
are they run by a process with the application account id or are they run by some administration user such as root and the connection to the database specifies user named and passwd

2179599
contains	any
where file_name is the templates to rendering and templates_value is a dictionary contains any value to be renderinging

2179601
codeigniter	cakephp
codeigniter cakephp and others i have read about dont focus on this

2179625
gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals
if you write a struct rare you should overrides all the methods like tostring equals gethashcode for exactly this reason

2179649
linux	unix
is that still the case on most modern unix linux systemd

2179665
logout	login
i want change the title of login and logout button

2179665
logout	login
it means if user login the facebook my button title change into logout and .when user is logout title change to login

2179674
app-bundle	info.plist
for mine i got the error .when i tried to change the app-bundle id setting in my info.plist file for the sake of running a test

2179683
reflection	runtime
in this other question about how datacontext works we learn that the constructor for datacontext uses reflection to populate the field at runtime

2179694
arguments	default
in vb6 the arguments that do not otherwise specify are by default passed to functions as byref

2179694
arguments	default
in vb.net if you leave an arguments blank in the function-declaration it automatically insert byval which seems to therefore be the defacto default

2179694
vb.net	vb6
vb.net forces you to specify in other words .so if you are taking a function-declaration from vb6 to vb.net know that the unmarked default in vb6 is byref

2179699
python	php	web-applications	webserver
we want to setup and configure a webserver for our project centering in our university and we want to supply a webserver for student web-applications based on php python and also asp.net

2179770
scala	java
they al.so have large standards libs -- scala rides on the back of java and f# has all of .net .so you can program .something interesting fairly quickly

2179770
haskell	scheme
scheme and haskell are both pure functional languages but unfortunately their standards libs are relatively small .so it s hard-ish to do relatively common things like parsing xml or scanning webpage

2179775
json	xml
most of the time you re requesting snippets of html xml or json

2179797
any	set	hashtable	set
insert all items of the arrays into a hashtable or any fast set data structure

2179805
versioning	upgrade
yes it is a mess.the recomended solution i ve seen is to make the upgrade in a step-by-step intermediate versioning fashion inorder to make the upgrade transitions smooth with small versioning-gaps

2179805
ubuntu	debian
now install the gem ruby versioning manager a no pain in debian ubuntu it can compile latest ruby versioning link text

2179805
rubygems	rvm
you could now use rvm to uninstaller the older versioninging of rubygems in your systemd and only keept the latest ruby versioning

2179805
rubygems	rvm
if you need it for a production systemd rvm is already seen as mature enough to maintain rubygems updates with newer versioning

2179825
version-control	git
that is by design as git is version-control systemd not a backup utility or synchronized tool

2179840
put	get
i get the impression there s been much more work put into the clr side.

2179849
value	field
no two elements have the same value for the field positioning

2179868
jquery	.post	lightbox	jquery
i m trying to .post form-data in a lightbox through jquery and php

2179868
value	field
there are only 3 field value i need to pass

2179869
positioning	slider

value	field
this is most useful in a get request where the field value actually end up in the url but a .post request follows the same rules

2179930
average	min	average	max
while i can t add to the suggestions above you can reduce the average runtime by first finding the min and max value in your dataset both o n and confining your search to that range

2179934

viewdidload	dealloc
don t forget to release your uiactionsheet in your dealloc function since you ll be doing alloc in the init or viewdidload function

2180078
key-value	key
the main advantage of using a hash for the purpose of finding items in the table as opposed to using the original key of the key-value pair which btw it typically stored in the table as well since the hash is not reversible is that

2180078
binary-tree	tree
this o 1 performance gets a bit eroded .when considering the extra time to dealing with collision and such but on the whole the hashtable is very fast for storing and retrieving items as opposed to a systemd based solely on the original key-value which would then typically be o log n with for example a binary-tree although such tree is more efficient space-wise

2180087
dictionary	arrays
is it possible to split a string by and init a dictionary in one go or you have to use a string arrays first

2180094

this is accessible in any httphandler whether it s an asp.net-mvc controllers or view or a webforms page or ashx

2180110
constructor	private	instances	private
specifically the only difference between a singleton and a global variables is that the singleton tries to enforce a single instances by making the constructor private for example

2180110
factory-method	singleton
if you re still too comfortable with the idea of a singleton instead of making the constructor public you can add a public and static factory-method to create instances in a way that can t be used by accident

2180124
execl	fork
rather than using systemd do a fork wait and call execv or execl in the child

execl	fork
it s straight forwarding to use fork execl to run cp to do the work for you

2180347
required	checked
further since systemd required you to cobble together the cmd arguments you are not likely to have a buffering overflow issue due to sloppy printf checked

2180356

the countdownlatch will assure that if the callback occurs before get is called the get methods will return immediately with a result

2180543
user-controls	ascx
if you want to move away from this rather awkward way of buser-interfacelding your web part user-interface you can load an ascx and your web part designing experience will be like any user-controls

2180551
aggregate	grouping
you can remove the cyclecurrentstep column from your grouping by list but then you will have to remove it also from the selected list - that s because you cannot at the same time aggregate all corresponding cycle rows as a grouping and then pick an unaggreagated value and report it

2180566
buffering	streaming
i m thinking about using as a base .some fifo for example boundedfifobuffering from apache commons to organize io tasks in my application i was looking for .something easy to use as a temporary buffering for reading from a streaming and fifo simultaneously .so i will read data from an inputstreaming to it and then consume the data later

2180566
buffering	streaming
the example provided by mcdowell based on bytearray streaming and java.nio buffering are very close to what i want

2180566
buffering	streaming
but bytearray streaming can be only reset to 0 you can t conveniently get some of its data off not all buffering s data and i wanted to remove only those parts i m sure are ready to be process and discarded full packets or garbage before next valid packets in incoming data

2180568
key-value	key
also since the subcontract object is being associated with a companytosubcontract object it knows to updates the foreign key field in the associations entity with the primary key-value it just assign to the subcontract entity

have your worker class use a callback methods to signals that its finished

2180631
contains	set
if .so you can set the line-height of the contains div to that height and then set vertical-align properties of the img tags to middle

2180653
value	field
the idea being to validation the table looking for any matching rows but ignore any hits where the a field has this specific value

2180653
value	field
but .when the form is editing a recording that value needs to be bound to the contents of the data field .when the form was initially populate with data - ie the data value initially read from the test tablerow

2180658
margins	padding
perhaps travis is right if not you can also try to put your margins padding value to 0

2180751
versioning	upgrade
consequently you would either need to upgrade to the full versioning or you could look into using a freely available c++ gui libs such as wxwidgets

2180762
xmlhttprequest	cors
the scripting loaded are not able to communication directly with the foreign domain though xmlhttprequest same-origin except with cors

2180765
build-system	toolchain
the compiler on my machine is at c program files iar systemd embedded workbench 5.4 arm bin i would like the build-system to try to locate the toolchain even if there is another versioning of embedded workbench install or if the user has chosen to install it elsewhere

if we get all the value in a huge string arrays and then concatenation them with comma in between all the value in a string and then send it down to the user does it sound a proper solution

2180841
reportlab	pypdf
i came across a decent one using only reportlab and pypdf .so i thought i d shared

2180857
value	field
it s not that the index already exists but that there are duplicates value of the topicshortname field in the table itself

2180866
constructor	object
a constructor called with new is usually required to create a new object each time it is called

2180866
constructor	object
static factory can return object of any subtyping but creating an object using a constructor will only create object of a specific types

2180867
short-circuiting	equivalent
the count is always equivalent to the count of the original collections .so it could have certainly been retrieved directly by returning a specific object from selected that could be used to short-circuiting evaluation of the count methods

2180870
value	field
it s because you have recording in the table already that are not unique by the sounds of it 2 recording with a blank value in the topicshortname field

2180871
buffering	streaming
you could use this on a network streaming for instances with out having to buffering the whole streaming first or worry about having the code reading from this streaming worry about how it is construct

2180887
binary-tree	nodes
if you have a perfect binary-tree where every single nodes branches exactly twice except for the last row then the first row will have 1 one the second 2 the third 4 the fourth 8 and the fifth 16

2180887
binary-tree	nodes
the worst case on the other hand would be to have the fifth row consist of a single nodes with a full binary-tree above it

2180887
populate	row
.so while this algorithm is really your only choice without modifying your data structure its efficiency relies entirely on how populate the row is compared to higher rows

2180890
ruby-on-rails	django
any real architect should be platform agnostic and should probably have experience with at least 2 platform .net spring-mvc django ruby-on-rails jsf struts etc ... some one with ruby-on-rails and jsf experience that really impressed me for instances could end up being a better fit than the lifetime asp.net developer that never ventures outside of his comfort zone

silverlight	wpf
detection design-time mode in wpf and silverlight

2181077
contains	set
now in vs2008 .when i go to set the backcolor properties of a control on a winform the usual color-picker custom web systemd has been replace with just a simple dropdownlistfor contains the named of the systemd and web colors

2181077
installation	environment
is this just a quirk in my installation or does this happen in all win7-64 environment

callback	methods
you could observe this by adding a __del__ methods to the object or by adding a weakref callback that performs the desired actions

2181079
function-pointers	member-functions
to emulate member-functions you can put function-pointers in struct

2181088

2181116
append	input
i previously said to append to input s parent but the input shared the same parent

2181119
mousedown	mouseup
the mousedown and mouseup methods take an nsevent object as an arguments with information about the click including the clickcount

2181142
base-class	superclass	derived-class	base-class
you probably want virtual destructor where derived-class destructor demotes the object to its superclass and then recursively call the destructor of that and .so on until the base-class destructor is reached and that finally frees the struct

2181170
command-line	cmd
making these env variablesiables for pkg-config --cflags pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0 and combining them to a new env variables gtk_compile and including that in the command-line in the vista cmd shell has worked and the compile completes and the .exe gui windows helloworld runs

click	mouse
it could be any numbers of things but if the other windows is or is not converting the buttondown up to mouse click it could be confusing your code

2181379
put	get
.so you just need to put in enough data to get it up to the 8k for the row making that take up the in-page allocation for the row and the rest goes into row-overflow storage anyway

2181390
svnadmin	dump
otherside is right about svnadmin dump etc

2181399
continuous-integration	teamcity	continuous-integration	build-server	build-server	teamcity
however in my experience i ve found it more flexible to set up a continuous-integration build-server like teamcity or hud.son with a job that checked the svn repository every minute or .so for updates

.net assemblies with x86 as the platform target will run on both 32-bit and 64bit versioning of windows as a 32-bit process in wow64 mode

2184088
32-bit	64bit
on a 64bit os and with the any cpu setting enabled the runtime would execute the assembly in a 64bit process and loading the 32-bit com component into the 64bit process would fail

2184088
32-bit	x86
compiling with the x86 flag causes the .net runtime to execute the assembly in a 32-bit process and thus the com component can safely be loaded

the new object initialization feature of .net 3.0 is more flexible than an overloaded constructor

2184428
constructor	private
if you can i d go for the first option private constructor

2184503
value	field
first parameter is field named second parameter is value for the field and third parameter is boolean true radio selected false not selected

2184517
void	main
you currently have main declare as returning void

2184593
google-maps	bing-maps
as the others already said you can save a lot of research by duplicating the sizes already used by similar project google-maps bing-maps any other mapping systemd not forgetting some of the gigapixel project like gigapan

2184595
contains	elements
just code the html elements with a title attributes contains the text you want

2184599

or you could use dlopen and dlsym or equivalent depending on your execution environment but these aren t standards c .so that might not be an option

2184651
if-statement	arrays
that s about all i ve got other than incredibly non-portable stuffing around with the executable file or designing hideous macros which would most likely boil down to the collections of if-statement show above anyway or a function pointers arrays of some sort

2184653
internet-explorer	firefox
this reminds me of the browser wars where people would say that firefox was rendering .something wrongly because it didn t do it the way that internet-explorer did - mozilla couldn t formulate a specifications for their ie emulation mode that was better than look like ie because nobody outside of micro.soft could possibly know the exact rules ie was using. .so you should try and make sure that your specificationsifications for a feature would make sense to .someone who s never played a game similar to yours and therefore stand alone

2184660
selected	textbox
however if you insert the full named of the types into the selected types textbox it should accept it

2184667
derived-class	inherited
to answer your question you can t inherited from cbase because in virtual inheriteded a derived-class would need to have direct access to the class from which it was inheriteded virtually

2184667
constructor	private
in this case a class that would derive from cbase would need to have direct access to csealed which it can t since the constructor is private

2184670
javascript	dom
jquery will make sure that the javascript block runs .when the fragment is added to the dom

first asp.net-mvc and asp.net webforms are alternative options for architecting a web application in asp.net

2184791
asp.net-mvc	webforms
while asp.net-mvc is getting a lot of attention it is the cool option right now - and for some pretty good reasons don t rules out webforms until you ve had a chance to really compare the two

2184791
.when	ready
while true that isn t really the advantage - the advantage comes down the road .when you are ready to learn and do unit-testing

2184791
asp.net-mvc	webforms
another few notes with respect to webforms these tools are mostly unavailable to asp.net-mvc developers - thus my advice above about the speed of getting started

2185755
32-bit	64bit
big-endian or little-endian 32-bit or 64bit does not matter

2185766
mapping	unique
of course this would prevent you from changing table named .so a more robust .solution would be to have another table mapping unique ids to object types stored as table named

2185781
base-class	inherited
but there are a few time .when i have wanted to do something like this with 10 different classes that all inherited from the same base-class and having a 10 if elseif statements is annoying .when a switching statement is what i should be using

2185793

if you want it to overlay the dom then you could do same thing only using an insanely high z-index and then setting the opacity

2185797
imageview	textview
in short i want to create a single view say uiimageview out of multiple subviews - it consists out of multiple imageview and textview

2185807
z-index	tooltip
i don t think this is a great solution living with the tooltip is better but if you set an absolutely positioning div with a solid background set to very low opacity 1 and a higher z-index then your image you should not get a tooltip

2185811
negative-number	zero
using a-b returns a positive zero or negative-number to do this

2185813
default	reset
you should set the timeout value to the length of inactivity in minutes that you would consider the user is no longer active default 30 mins then the sliding expiration will reset this value if the user keeps calling

2185816
crossover	mutation
if your problem is that peaks remain for over one thousand generations then the problem might not be with the crossover and mutation operators

credentials	security
the server named credentials i m using are definately correct as i ve tested them with an ldap browser and the ad server is using standards security ports 389 etc

2185901
installation	environment
a workaround is to find the location of strict.pm in your perl installation and to add the directory to the perl5lib environment variables or to invoke perl with the

2185903
value	field
some field should not show according to some value in a query

2185903
value	field
if a certain recording does not exist a nice colored very noticeable messages should appear instead of the value that would be there suppose for example that a recording with 03 04 2009 in the date field exists a recording with 03 06 2009 in the date field also exists but no recording with 03 05 2009 exists

2185903
value	field
create a report with no recording source and lots of unbound field and through several events report_open section_format etc. and with the help of dao manually set the value of these field

2185910
revision	svn
where is probably the svn revision numbers

2185930
python	perl
none that i know but it should be possible to implements it in dynamic-languages such as python perl or lisp

2185954
defined	declare
from what i understand templates classes and templates functions for the most part must be declare and defined in the same header file

2185959

virtual-functions	base-class
in addition to the advice about raii remember to make your base-class destructor virtual if there are any virtual-functions

2186102
32-bit	16-bit
as has been stated before by jake you calculate the stride by finding the bytes per pixels 2 for 16-bit 4 for 32-bit and then multiplying it by the width

2186102
32-bit	64bit
unfortunately there is no way around this restrictions unless you always use 32-bit or 64bit imagines which are always multiples of 4

2186105
any	set
one to remove any tooltip that is been set or is being display by a specific control

in glibc2 any modern linux distribution the passwd encryption function can use md5 sha-xxx provoked by a magic salt prefix which then treats as significant all the input characters see man 3 crypt

2186139
arrays	loops
you don t necessarily need three loops - you could combine them together if you wanted and if you re only doing one of the two kinds of output then you wouldn t need the arrays you could just use each bit value as you mask it off

2186141
tablerow	layout
to reiterate the problem i was seeing was that a relative layout within a tablerow would not span the entire row no matter what i set it s width and height to

2186141
tablerow	layout
i have found a solution that forces any layout to span the tablerow entirely horizontally

2186214
double-quotes	single-quotes
however it printing the attributes value with double-quotes around them as opposed to single-quotes

2186214
double-quotes	single-quotes
.so that being said does anyone know of an output properties i could set to tell the transformer to printing single-quotes instead of double-quotes

2186220
revision	updates
if this is the case then you just need to updates the working directory to the previous revision

2186234
tortoisegit	svn
al.so tortoisegit has built-in support for svn repo .so you can checkout an svn repo and get all the benefits of local branches and what have you

2186238

value	field
that will show you the schema for the table and you will see that the field will still have a value of uni in the key column

2186253
entity-framework	nhibernate
.so i m thinking that i ll either use linq-to-sql or entity-framework for now since i have .some experience with it them and then .when i am able swap out for nhibernate

2186253
data-access	nhibernate
given this scenario are there any special considerations i should make .when abstracting data-access or designing the database-schema to prevent big headaches .when moving to nhibernate

i have a web user-controls ascx that exposes an id properties

2186360
contains	set
what i want to do is set this properties .when the selectedindexchanged event fires in a gridview in the contains page

2186364
json	xml
it may not be possible but prefer file-format where you can make encoding unambiguous - things like xml which makes it easy or json which mandates utf-8

2186368
environment	building
re creating a building environment only becomes easier if you do not need a codeigniter tool as an additional component

2186383
fiddler	charles
you can also combine foxyproxy with any numbers of free interactive proxy fiddler paros burp charles

2186406
google-chrome	firefox
the autocomplete attributes works fine in google-chrome and firefox

in debugging mode i like to set my output directory to program files productname because some code will get the exe path for various reasons

2186410
default	reset
then in the click event of your button reset the default

2186418
double	int
primitive-types like int real double extended arrays sets recording they are automatically destroy .when out of scoping

2186419
sequences	unique
often people end up taking on a sequences numbers to insure it s unique anyway and at that points why bother

2186433
getter	setter
getter setter yes it is possible

2186433
getter	setter
the project lombok defined annotations for generator getter setter and more

2186433
getter-setter	getter	getter-setter	setter	getter	setter
will generator getter for named not setter since it is final and getter-setter for age

2186433
tostring	equals
it will also generator equals hashcode tostring and construtor initializing required field named

2186433
protected	public
there are other annotations and parameters giving you control over access rights should your getter be protected or public namedd getnamed or named

2186433
getter	setter
just downloading the jar and use the annotations then the getter setter can be used in your code without actually being spelled out

2186438
put	get
in the debuggers locals watchers tab it show that the qstring output actually does get the right data put in it but after it the read runs out of characters from the output it runs and then hang

2186447
children	nodes
i was hoping that it would be possible to fire a function in the containers component to add the subfolders as children of the selected nodes i could chuck this on the model before the remote object call i guess then fire tree.invalidatelist and tree.validatenow

2186461
jquery	.post
i also tried some of the linked plugins of this .post apple coverflow effect using jquery or other libs

2186462
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in ie but i cannot get it to work in firefox or google-chrome

pointers	stack
i recently ran into a very sneaky bug in which i forget to dereference a pointers to a string char arrays and thus sometimes overwrite one byte on stack

2186464
memcheck	valgrind
i m thinking about moving to valgrind memcheck has anyone used it

2186468
decimal-point	digits
such a numbers can represent numberss from roughly 0 to 1024 with about two decimal digits after the decimal-point

2186468
decimal-point	digits
alternatively you can treat it as signed running from roughly -512 to +512 again with around two digits after the decimal-point

2186468
difference	factors
in this case the scaling factors is fixed .so the smallest difference that can be represented between two numberss is al.so fixed -- the difference between 1024 and the next larger numbers is exactly the same as the difference between 0 and the next larger numbers

2186468
scientific-notation	decimal-point
in scientific-notation you always adjust the significand and exponent .so there s exactly one place before the decimal-point .so for example 140 becomes 1.4e2 20030 becomes 2.003e4 and .so on

2186493
any	set
i m specifically thinking about a collections that fulfills the contract of a set but i think the question can apply to any kind

2186493
any	set
mostly because i can t think of any reason i d ever want to allow null into a set of object

2186506
context-free-grammar	regular-language
in theory regular-language is not able to express a sequences describe by context-free-grammar

2186513
administration	account
i ve tried numerous different ways of impersonating a administration account but nothing seems to work to create the virtual directory

2186518
background-image	transparency
if your textfield absolutely required a transparency background you ll have to fake itâ by using a background-image contains the graphics underneath the textfield

2186518
background-color	transparency
since the background is draw on top of the background-color the textfield will appear transparency and you ll be able to use any background-color you want for the loupe

2186521
value	field
field that have a null value don t seem to crash but if there is a value like 19 in the database note the no decimal places that seems to fail whereas 19.00 does not

constructor	object
in creating and destroying java object part 1 the author suggests one advantage of static factory methods is that unlike constructor they have names. â joshua bloch

2186535
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
the only way i could find involves using bytearrayoutputstream and then creating a new inputstream using tobytearray

2186536
contains	elements
for each elements ll in page.links ll.attributes is a nokogiri xml elements and ll.attributes.attributes is a hash contains the attributes on the link hence the need for ll.attributes.attributes to get at the actual class and the need for the nil checked before comparing the value to l

dereference the pointer-to-pointer to assign memory to it is ok

2186562
jquery	.post
in jquery i create a .post ajax call to the server to get the pdf

2186564

there may be ways of doing it that are server specificationsific to provide shared-libraries for java ee applications but i don t think the java ee specifications contains any such facility

2186567
object-reference	instances
nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

2186575
.when	ready
.when we re ready to release we tag trunk with a tag that include the versioning numbers

2186587
directdraw	direct3d
after disabling the directdraw and direct3d accelerations rad install fine

2186590
getter	setter
if you think that the lack of attributes is a serious problem i highly recommend that you try coding for a while without ever using setter and resisting getter

2186592
webforms	asp.net
is there a free for commercial use date and time picker in asp.net webforms

2186592
webforms	asp.net
i know that there are javascript controls but was wanting to stick with asp.net webforms controls as i am not good with javascript

2186604
managed-code	native-code
impersonation across com boundaries is tricky in native-code and very tricky from managed-code

2186623
content-disposition	content-type	any	set
ofcourse you have to set the content-type and content-disposition headers on the server side as you would for any such downloading

2186634
attributes	properties
the idea is that you get the list of assembly attributess using assembly.getcustomattributess and search for debuggableattributes and then find if such attributes has isjittrackingenabled properties set

2186640
dialog	pop-up
i m working on a web application where we have a modal panels dialog pop-up to collect user data

2186640
button	popup
.when a user wants to save a search result item they can checked one or more items and click a save button - that s .when our modal panels popup

2186641
value	field
unfortunately in 2005 this will required either using varbinary field or base64-encoding encrypted value etc.

2186643
checkbox	button
i have asp.net-mvc view page that has checkbox active and a button activate

2186643
checkbox	button
if the value from the database is true the checkbox should be checked and enabled and .so button al.so should be enabled

2186644
jquery	.post
.post your parameters to your server with jquery

2186646
continuous-integration	nant
look into continuous-integration and scripted building such as with nant or perhaps something more legible like fake

2186646
build-server	teamcity	octopus-deploy	teamcity	octopus-deploy	build-server
to guarantee that use a build-server such as teamcity and possibly a release management tool like octopus-deploy

2186662
response	timeout
you re not disposing of the web response which can lead to timeout while the connection pool wait for a connection

2186664
any	set
edit the jos_plugins table in mysql to set published from 1 to 0 for any extra authentication plugins you are using

2186695
user-controls	ascx
asp.net page lifecycle can be hard to understand especially with ascx user-controls which also have their own lifecycle

2186709
haskell	ocaml
i have done some of my own although nothing too formal and it didn t fair too well in comparison to other functional languages tried haskell and ocaml

2186709
scala	java
but how does it look compared to java or another language on the jvm scala

2186712
value	field
if i hit clear form field gets the right value

2186717
order	join
.so you could just do a join and use the same order by clause

2186731
build-server	workitem
it not only does source code control but it has a workitem tracking systemd codeigniter and build-server and has some really great tools for testing

2186753
error-handling	try-catch
is there a way i can have error-handling in one place or do i need to place try-catch in every call like what is the best workaround for the wcf client using block issue

2186756
entity-framework	ado.net	stored-procedures	ado.net
linq-to-sql and ado.net entity-framework with linq-to-entities are an object relational mapper and can map to your database tables and act like stored-procedures and ado.net dataset do .so that is a very nice alternative than weak dataset datatables and i like it over strongly typed dataset tables too

2186782
version-control	git
the other possibility that you might want to look at is distribute version-control systemd like git or mercurial

2186782
push	pull
with these tools you can have multiple independent repository which can pull push changes from each other

2186786
filtering	sorting
filtering and sorting are pretty much the core of linq

2186791
macros	vba
i ran into a similar issue with a vba macros utilizing 4.1

2186811
value	field
should i create a new class with primary key of types key and initializer and persistent new object that copy the field value from the old ones

2186830
python	c++
they are in c++ but hopefully you can translation what you need to python

2186835
webforms	asp.net
i really would not recommend using asp.net s webforms built-in support for javascript datepicker but that s just me

2186836
aes	rsa	private-key	rsa
i m currently using rsa with 4096-bit key to encrypt a 256-bit randomly generator aes key for each file but performance is somewhat lacking as one required operation is to scan through all the files estimated numbers .when the systemd is in use is around 10 000 and identify which ones can be decrypted using a specific private-key

2186842
controllers	routes
the fix depends on which methods you re using to defined routes for the announcements controllers

2186859
any	set
a query cannot vary the numbers of columns returned at least not in any systemd i m familiar with .so if you have a case c situation and only have named i would return it as lastnamed and set firstnamed to the empty string

2186864
contains	any
in my experience this forces the combinations of adobe-reader and xps document writer for reasons unknown to me to produce xaml code that does not contains any glyphs and thus no references to fonts containss in obfuscation odttf files

2186867
registration	login
once they enter the default passwd they need to be taken to another login screens that will act as a registration page for them

2186885
versioning	upgrade
.when i upgrade to the 2.1.0 versioning it now comes bundled with swfobject 2.2

2186885
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
in firefox safari and google-chrome the file upload and everything works perfectly

2186901
value	field
problem 2 i want to store this information in one database-table with a typeid field that way .when an insert-into the database is done this value becomes the typeid of the row distinguishes whether it is a computer a monitor a phone etc

2186902
aes	rsa
ssl tls although they use rsa etc for encrypting aes etc key do not use aes for the data simply because it is a computationally expensive operation at sufficiently large key sizes for security to be done on a per-packet or in your case per-file basis

2186908
base-class	inherited
if you really really need a fake virtual operators overload you should defined in the root base-class that your object inherited from and have that overload call equals

2186921
boolean	int
arguments is an int boolean flag

2186928
managed-code	c++-cli
the idea with c++-cli is that the managed-code should be able to access unmanaged-code

2186934
hebrew	cjk
we will also have a reqiurement to handle incoming double byte character strings for languages such as hebrew and cjk

2186935
subtract	add
.when subtract angle if the ending angle is less than the starting angle you may also need to add 360 to the result to account for crossing the zero points on the unit circle

2186960
user-input	output
those should have the minimal code required to retrieve user-input validation interact with other classes and provide an output

2186969
attributes	properties
.so i thought that .solution would be to put a modelbinder attributes before the propertyb which of course doesn t work modelbinder attributes is not allowed on a properties

2186994
py2exe	exe
as an example you can package matplotlib into your exe with py2exe see here

2186996
loading	gif
this process might take .some time .so i added .ajaxsend and .ajaxcomplete functions to show .some animation for the waiting process actually a loading data gif inside a div with z-index 999 to be the top of other divs inside the

2186996

nhibernate	ado.net
in this scenario i would also recommend that you consider using straight ado.net instead of nhibernate

2187108
nhibernate	ado.net	data-access	nhibernate	data-access	ado.net
i am not saying that you should switching you whole data-access strategy to ado.net but you might want to consider using ado.net for the batch-file operations and using nhibernate for the other cases

2187113
.when	ready
.when i m finally ready for the real commit i just

2187132
cos	sin
if your circle is centered at a b with radius r and you want it to come out at angle t then the start points are x1 a+r cos t y1 b+r sin t i ve assumed you want the line to start at the circumference which is what your question seems to imply and if you want the line to be of length z your endpoint are x2 x1+z cos t y2 y1+z sin t and you can use the process cmd

creating some custom code that just parsing out the named and value of the cookies isn t too difficult but i d like to also consider other field within the cookies such as the expiration and domain field

2187180
subdirectories	archive
now i move the archive mymath.a into a subdirectories temp

2187188

2187265
duplicates	elements
i ve been struggling to create a function to essentially find all the indic of duplicates elements in a multi-dimensional arrays unsorted in this case a 5x5 arrays and then using the indic found changing the parallels elements in a score arrays

2187265
duplicates	elements
the main problem with this code is that it will find all the duplicates elements but not the originals

2187276
constructor	private
you should explicit create a paramaterless constructor which is private to prevent this

2187294
value	field
clients wishing to maintain a synchronized local store of bookmarks should retain the value of this attributes - its value will change .when any significant field of the bookmark changes

i m using an asp.net webforms regularexpressionvalidator control to validation a textfield to ensure it contains a series of email addresses separated by semicolons

2187364
any	set
in any event the correct technique is to set the result rather than interact with the response directly

2187365
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
on a 16-bit machine the 32-bit int operations might be implements using two registers as 64bit operations are implements on 32-bit machines

2187385

2187478
filtering	grouping
why not use get parameters or django-filtering if all you do is just filtering grouping the results differently

2187480
scp	ssh
assuming you trust both sides of the file transfer you can use scp file transfer over ssh or fstp instead .so all the communication will be encrypted

2187481
response	timeout
not 100 sure i follow you but the purpose of a timeout is to ensure a client does not wait indefinitely for a response that may not come it is part and parcel of working in a stateless environment

2187520
python	java
the building tool that is being used will use the building order and will retreive those files inorder from source control and then pass them to oracle to compile the actual building tool itself is written in python or java or both - i don t have access to the source

2187533
sftp	scp
after trying this a numbers of time i finally got it to work -- with sftp not scp

2187539

2187696
function-call	inline
if the compiler doesn t think it is wise to inline the function you now have the overhead of a function-call

2187703
boost	stl
if you want to use pointers in stl containers consider shared_ptr s from boost to wrap them

2187742
arrays	loops
dereleased s solution will be faster i guess as it uses internal loops mine can also deal with arrays value for object_id key

2187756
contains	elements
if matches the pattern but is undefined because the matched string ended with then grouping will be an arrays of length 1 contains the single elements undef

2187776
buffering	streaming
i have been coding java for a while but i have to admit that i don t get streaming buffering etc

2187777
double	int
you might expect 0.5 in this case but it will often evaluate the int value on the right first before assign and converting the result into a double giving the value 0.0

2187783
entity-framework	nhibernate
while the article focuses on linq-to-sql and entity-framework i d expect no surprises for nhibernate

2187794
pylons	web.py
it should be said i guess that reddit has since abandoned web.py in favor of pylons

2187815
nested	order
you don t need a building order - just building the package with create or replace... on a file-by-file basis and then compile them in a two-level nested loops - each pass in the inner loops compiles everything that is still invalid and the outer loops is used to checked the count of remaining invalid object and set some sort of threshold for maximum execution of the inner loops

2187832
value	field
i have a field in every recording in mysql which contains the value of either private or company

2187836
division	modulo
it is right to points out that is not a true modulo in the mathematical sense but always a remainder from division

python	php	formatting	printing
the python printing statement does a good job of formatting multidimesion arrays without requiring the printing_r available in php

2187866
principles	srp
in keeping with the srp single responsibility principles you might be better served if the validation is separate from the product s domain logic

2187874

you could possibly post-process the xml to replace double-quotes by single-quotes although that would be a risky process as text nodes could also contains double-quotes which you wouldn t want to change

2187971
double-quotes	single-quotes
and attributes value could contains single-quotes which would work fine .when surrounded by double-quotes but which would have to be escaped if surrounded by single-quotes

2187979
json	xml
generally speaking most payment processor have an option of process that supports this basic process often returning easy to parsing data as xml json or plain text instead of html

2187982

2188007
required	checked
i d checked all of your gem and plugins and any other dependencies your application might have i d guess that you re missing something or have the wrong versioning of something and it s failing badly enough that it can t even spit out a can t find required messages

2188010
deterministic	theory
the theory behind these methods is that most software project are not deterministic they are creative like in art and complex as defined by ralph stacey project and we can t predict everything

2188015
selected	button
it could use some further error checked like making sure the user didn t selected cancel or press escape on the file dialog but it should allow you to create a button on 1 file and run the comparison from that file on two user selecteded files

2188025
any	set
a class variables could be set by any function in the class

2188025
boolean	int
that default is basically to fill the field with bits of zero .so you get null for references zero for int false for boolean etc

2188027
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
you can always call the python or perl interpreter from within php

2188027
interpreter	runtime
however i don t think its s a good idea - using two interpreter instead of one double the overall runtime overhead and startup time

2188032
trojan	virus
i m guessing somebody did write a virus trojan in delphi using the default project and form named and the pattern they created made it into the av databases

2188060
value	field
computing the checksum the value of the checksum field is zero.

2188068

apparently you have an older versioning of the jdbc drivers wandering in the classpath or your jdbc drivers needs to be upgrade to match the jdbc api in the jre versioning used

2188080
json	xml
1 the php scripting should be returning a specfic format xml or json the latter is preferred imho

2188080

mkmapview	mapkit
there s an operation pending .so mapkit is retaining the mkmapview and it hasn t actually been deallocated yet

2188155
delegation	dealloc
given arc i suggest this means you should set your map view s delegation to nil in your view controllers s dealloc

2188161
order	join
just join the three tables by user order the rows by the timestamp than display it in your view

2188169
cassini	iis
in .net i can develop asp.net pages without using iis as it has a watered down webserver cassini i think it s called

2188178
administration	account
this is log .when i try to clone with administration account

2188188
literals	hardcode
if i defined the struct as compound literals in a macros and pass them to inline d functions gcc has been smart enough the bypass the pointers in the generator assembly and hardcode the structure member value directly in the code

2188199
curly-braces	parentheses
i am confused by the usage of brackets parentheses curly-braces in bash as well as the difference between their double or single forms

2188209
selected	checkbox
i have links that .when click selected all the checkbox or deselected them

2188209
selected	checkbox
i also have a dropdownlistfor that i want to be made visible only if at least one of the checkbox are selected

the time spent by the formula engine can be determined by subtract the time spent by the storage engine from the total execution-time for the query end event

2188370
put	get	device-driver	hardware
also this makes your code extremely portable you can put wrapper in for the put and get functions to cross networks run your hardware in an hdl simulator and reach into the simulation to read write registers etc with a single chunks of code that doesnt change from simulation to embedded to os device-driver to application layer function

2188413
udp	tcp
if not you should use tcp rather than udp

2188418
jquery	.post
i m building a small google-chrome extension that must send messages through a .post http-request to a server in my company network and i m using jquery 1.4.1 to speed up the development of the javascript part

2188424
value	field
this indexes the field without tokenizing it which is very important and none of the other field.index value will work .when used this way

2188430
contains	any
the drawback that i can see is the inability to edit-and-continue with any methods that contains linq

2188435
json	xml
xml is very wordy yaml or json are much smaller

2188441
expression	evaluation
it s designed to abstract out the language specific details of evaluation an expression

2188447
nsdata	nsurl
you would need to serialization an nsurl to nsdata -- and the default nskeyedunarchivefromdatatransformername transformer will do this for you

2188447
persistent	transient
one transient properties of undefined types for the url and a second persistent properties of string types for the backing store

2188447
attributes	properties
i generally make the properties definition for the string attributes private to remind myself not to use it

2188465
exception-handling	try-catch
now my understanding was that if an exception-handling was raised in the function that insert into tableb .when the try-catch block catches the exception-handling the original insert into the table would be rollback

2188507
hash	md5
i understand md5 is a one-way algorithm and all of the functions that i have come across seem to hash everything together

2188522
database-table	mysql
i m import some data from a .txt file into a mysql database-table using mysqlimport

2188538
authentication	impersonation
it depends on what mechanism you are using to authentication users and what settings you have for impersonation

2188538
account	api
in terms of the api s httprequest.logonuseridentity is calling into the windowsidentity class which will always represent a windows user account while page.user is creating a object which implements iprinciple which allows you to represent a user using a numbers of different backing stores - for example the sql database structure supplied by the membership-provider

2188539
python	php
because php is taking precedence over what python gets to do you are stuck with that wrong libs

2188541
dictionary	arrays	data-structures	dictionary
pprint can help making complex data-structures nested arrays complex dictionary etc... easier to read in this case

2188545
instance-variables	nsobject
if you have your class inherited from nsobject it will have the inheriteded init methods which does nothing to your instance-variables

2188545
subclassing	nsobject
whatever you do with nsobject subclassing at some points you still need to call init after the object is created

2188545
subclassing	inherited	subclassing	nsobject
otherwise if you choose to not inherited from nsobject or any of its subclassing and just inherited from nothing which is clearly a bad idea because of how the nsobject class deals with everything the objective-c runtime needs to do and the requirements are quite high then you ll potentially end up with no init methods at all

2188556
hash	md5
hashing secret using md5 leads to the following hash

2188565
expression	evaluation
the cause of this design is that they have a special fallback code to force el expression evaluation .when containers doesn t evaluate it

2188579
numeric	digits
in the code below i ve used txtnn where nn is the numeric index in the field collections formatted as 2 digits

2188594

2188609
implements	super
you invoke super s doesnotrecognizeselector because you might want to implements your own behavior for unrecognised selectors for your class

2188631
putchar	puts
putchar would put the character out but why is it that after eof it puts all the characters out and where is it remembering all these characters

2188658
versioning	downgrade
if i downgrade my versioning of libhdf5 to 1.6 not a long-term option the code compiles and runs fine

2188658
versioning	upgrade
the last resort would be to downloading a local copy of the hdf5-1.6.5 headers and be done with it but this is not future proof a matlab versioning upgrade is in my future.

2188664
viewdidappear	viewdidload
i tried to add a animation to viewdidload and viewdidappear but it doesn t work

2188668
dictionary	arrays
you could use a plist file however all the work is done for you with a strings file you don t have to write any code to parsing any file or initializer some dictionary or arrays no matter how easy that is anyway

2188670
arrays	loops
if you want to copy it then you would declare elements as a char and pass its address or use references and then inside the methods you would clone the bulks member and also each string in the arrays in a loops

2188681
private-key	rsa
one rsa private-key access which is very expensive

2188681
authentication	login
time to authentication the login lookup metdata evaluate permissions against login token

2188681
kerberos	ssl
dns lookup problem ipsec issued ssl problems kerberos issues it can easily go up into 10-15 seconds per conection

2188700
hash	md5
the keyword you should have been looking for are strong named or strongnamed and or permutation since it seems that with the rpc request they send out the permuatation strong named that md5 hash .so that you can possibly distinguish on the server side from which permutation the request was send

2188700
hash	md5
the core function is util.computestrongname it computes an md5 hash d oh of the provided byte arrays with the added catch

2188705
licensing	gpl
just the fact that your application is running on top of a gpl d kernel in no way affects the licensing of your software

2188707
binaries	install
install hdf5 versioning 1.8.4 you ve already done this i install the source and compiled to ensure it is compatible with my systemd that i get gcc versioninging and that i get the static-libraries - the binaries offered for my systemd are icc specific

2188743
delphi	c++
you may be better off finding making a c++ delphi bridge rather than re-implementing protocol-buffers

2188751
g++	gcc
i use either gcc or g++ both with the same problem the compiler does not find the libs i am trying to import

2188757

subtract	time
edit i think i ve figured it out - gcc 4 is faster on the 0-sized vectors in effect subtract a constants time from both versioning of the code

2188799
updating	updates	required	checked
updating the database and click updates will updates the ssdl but won t necessarily make the required changes automatically to the conceptual model you may need to open up the edmx is the designer and checked the properties on the field

2188802
code-snippets	indentation
in vs 2008 there are xml code-snippets that seem to be pretty awesome however it seems that the snippets we created do not indentation properly

2188817
plugins	add-on
as a first step does it appear in about plugins or in tools - add-on

2188821
javascript-engine	xpcom
especially .when you consider ancillary technologies - for example the elkhound parsing combined with their javascript-engine creates dehydra used to perform static analysis and transform source code used to bring the old xpcom stuff up to more recent standards and updates dependencies on javascript call

2188821
python	perl
then there are the building support and debugging code which can be python perl make scripting and .so on

2188879
double	int
i would think it s just an int but then in the cout statement it s used as a double arrays

2188897
delta	diff
.so in fact although patches seem to be ubiquitous in git user interfaces they are in fact no relation to how the data is stored- the delta that are stored in the pack files are binary-level delta not text-style diff at all

2188897
delta	diff
git will apply delta to get object and then diff them again to produce the patch on demand

2188897
cvs	git
based on what you quoted it appears that git and svn are actually more similar than either is to cvs for example

2188904
value	field
.so you should test that storing an object fails if it has a null value in this field

2188914
contains	any
i need to write a function to determine whether myfile contains any occurrences of mystr

â ssl can use any certificate in this store where the intended purposes list contains server authentication

2189024
groovy	java
i m sorry that this is in java and not groovy but hopefully it ll be easy enough for you to adapt

2189039
gdal	ogr
first you don t specify what versioning of gdal ogr you use .so it may be hard to diagnose where is the problem

2189039
gdal	ogr
this software uses exactly the same c code which is used in gdal ogr to handle shapefile data

2189053

2189066
perl	php
there is perl pecl package to integrated perl into php

2189074

subtract	add
.when the user changes timezones updates every .post that belongs to the user and add subtract to the created_at updatesd_at dates

2189126
quicksort	in-place

2189149
scriptmanager	updatepanel
i have a scriptmanager and an updatepanel in the page

2189170

i want to capture each packets receive by specified network-interface

2189182
contains	any	mouseleave	mouseenter
you do have the option of capturing the mouse .when it enters the scrollviewer though .so it continue to receive all mouse events until the mouse is release however this option would required you to delgate any further mouse events to the controls contains within the scrollviewer if you want a response...the following mouseenter mouseleave event handler will be sufficient

2189190
delete-row	rows
i want to move insert row from table active into table archive and then delete-row from table active every row beyond the initial 500 rows sorted by column k from one table to another

2189198
trojan	virus
compile without changing anything and some antivirus package will report the resulting exe as a potential virus trojan

2189198
trojan	virus
my guess is that someone somewhere once upon a time wrote a virus trojan malware with delphi and the signature heuristics associated with that now sometimes unfortunately collider with other delphi apps

2189206
binary-search-tree	map	binary-search-tree	red-black-tree
map is implements as a balanced binary-search-tree usually a red-black-tree

have you tried changing the bodystyle properties of your webget attributes .so that response aren t wrapped

2189333
google-chrome	safari
we worker are also supported by google-chrome and safari

2189356

is it best practice to use get or even put .when reading or updating information or is .post the most appropriate to use in every case

2189396
lightbox	thickbox
.when the form is submitted a lightbox thickbox windows appears to show the status

2189399
linux	osx
if you don t want to use mamp i d suggest getting a dedicated linux box or use a linux virtual-machine to do this on having been down the osx apache path before

2189414
postgresql	mysql
there is a clever solution here with cte s and rank over date_added in postgresql 8.4 but because you re using mysql the only thing i can think of of involves a very computationally complex query

2189429
required	checked
covering the whole range of db structural checked and being able to selectively test only subset of db structure required either

2189435
temporary	copy
notice that myintermediatestreaming causes the contents of the large streaming of data to be stored in memory temporary .so that the filestreamingresult can later on copy it again into the response output streaming

2189450
arrays	loops
you can use a foreach loops to generator your query clause from your arrays

2189452
margins	padding
.when writing css is there a particular rules or guideline that should be used in deciding .when to use margins and .when to use padding

2189453

the jboss application administration course and the jboss certified application administration jbcaa exam both use jboss enterprise application platform not the community versioning of the application-server and related technologies

2189458
constructor	object
in the constructor for my object i have code that checked for some configuration reg key and prompt the user if they don t exist

2189462
margins	padding
margins is on the outside of block elements while padding is on the inside

2189466
arrays	loops
then scripting in your page would need to loops over all the images in the json arrays and insert each image into the dom of the page

2189483
margins	padding
one thing to note is .when auto collapsing margins annoy you and you are not using background colours on your elements something it s just easier to use padding

2189494
contains	elements
this is perfect for a flexible graphics pipe-line opengl is not required to know what elements are contains with each vertex

2189494
value	field
this methods would need to use reflection to first find the attributes then return the reference to the field value

2189494
contains	any
like what other bytes does an arrays contains if any that would hinder me from passing the vertex struct containss the ielement arrays directly to directx then to the gpu

2189499
selected	cell
if you want the whole row then you can use parent to selected the parent elements of the cell which should be the row

2189502
arrays	loops
in php 5.2 the only way to do this is to loops through the arrays

2189521
ubuntu-server	linux
the linux box is most likely a ubuntu-server but i m not sure which versioning is install

2189521
environment	building
and create a building environment and make

2189527
boolean	int	primitive	boolean	primitive	int
primitive such as int or boolean cannot be null

2189530
arrays	loops
the simplest way is probably your initial thought which is to loops your arrays once and pull out all the dnum key into a separate arrays then call max on that

2189531
linux	unix
i figure someone might have a neat little one liner to insert this into the appropriate file with unix linux somehow.

2189532
solaris	osx
another thing i ve noticed before is that the gc settings that work well on osx x86 often do not work well on sparc solaris and vice versa

2189537
google-chrome	firefox
this code works on firefox and google-chrome

2189541
updating	updates
some things to consider are the horizontal accuracy the time spent updating and the numbers of previous updates you ve received

2189565
linux	unix
and see if there are environment variabless for doing such things like how the linux unix cmd grep uses grep_options environment variables

2189566
xsd	xml
.so i am trying to valdiate a xml against multiple xsd one by one but it seems the xsd gets accumulate at the xml document object

2189570

javascript	dom
is it possible to restrict javascript libs from being able to manipulate the dom

2189660
perl	php
i suspect the person in that example was just copying the jquery pattern or is used to php perl without really understanding that it isn t necessary and has no special meaning

2189662
postgresql	oracle
with postgresql oracle etc. there s no .lastrowid - as someone else said you can use returning for those in which case results are available via result.fetchone although using returning with oracle again not taking advantage of sqlalchemy expression construct required several awkward step or if returning isn t available you can use direct sequences access nextval in postgresql or a .post fetch operation currval in postgresql identity or scope_identity in mssql

2189671
checkbox	textbox	selected	textbox	selected	checkbox
specifically the ischecked properties of the checkbox the selected index of the combo box and the value of the textbox

2189674
rtmp	rtp
works with rtp rtmp http or other protocols and can decode and encode h.264 and most other codecs

2189723
double	int
i am just curious to know what happens behind the scene to convert a double to int say int 5666.1

2189723
double	int
since the representation of the int and double are fundamentally different is there going to be temporaries created during the process and expensive too

2189740
subtract	add
datetime such as add or subtract

2189747
firefox	safari
pkcs#11 only matters with firefox as ie and safari both use native platform certificate stores and apis cryptoapi and cdsa keychain respectively internally

2189779
physics-engine	physx
1. physics-engine - physx or ode for the physics effects like bumtop

double	int
.when you convert a double to int on an x86 systemd the compiler will generator a fist floating-point int conversion instruction and the fpu will do the conversion

2189785
double	int
the mpfr libs is capable of doing double to int conversions and will perform the same conversion on all hardware

2189802
perl	php	python	php	python	perl	cgi-bin	vhosts
i ve never done anything extremely fancy but have had plenty of vhosts regular and reverse proxy php python and perl cgis custom cgi-bin location custom logs etc without issues

2189805
directory	folder
then to list out a directory using regex find all line ending in then parsing up to the xth slash based on the numbers of slashes in the searched folder and do a case in sensitive search based on whether or not you want this to be case-sensitive

2189807
control-characters	linefeed
the long answer is that there are a numbers of control-characters in the standards ansi character set from decimal 1 to decimal 31 inclusive among which are the control codes for linefeed carriage return eof and .so on

2189834
32-bit	64bit
sys.maxint for 32-bit int for 64bit int will tell you which of the two possibilities obtains

2189837
numeric	zero
i am assuming that by numeric string you mean varchar and that alpha-numeric sorting works for you which it should if the format is fixed and you have the leading zero

2189839
postgresql	mysql
mysql does not invalidate the current transactional .when it encounters an error where postgresql throw the error and do not run other query until the current transactional is not aborted

2189877
any	set
however it s really difficult to give any sort of opinion without making a large set of assumptions about how the systemd is going to be used evolve over time - if you re happy with the approach continue with it let us know how it goes

2189883
put	get
but .when i put it in a separate .cpp file i get the following error

2189898
arrays	loops
use foreach to loops into arrays checked if the level is the same with the previous item then grouping it with that arrays

question on retain attributes with properties and synthesize

2189922
margins	padding
.so i generally start off by using padding to get everything packed and then use margins for minor tweak

margins	padding
another thing to be aware of is that padding are more consistent on different browsers and ie doesn t treat negative margins very well

2189924
put	get
you can run the batch-file in hidden mode and also can get the result back if any from out put streaming

2189932

2190006
checkbox	textbox
you can easily databind your checkbox combobox and textbox to properties in your viewmodel

2190011
hash	md5
similar to the recommendation of using md5 or sha1 hash the dustbuster methods largely relies on comparing file size as it primary signals

2190162
user-input	output
while using gets to accept user-input pressing the arrow key output text to the screens presumably the character codes

2190173
required	checked
checked means that the compiler required that you handle the exception-handling in a catch or declare your methods as throw it or one of its superclass

2190175
exception-handling	try-catch
for checked-exception-handlings you either have to put a try-catch block around the code that could potentially throw the exception-handling or add a throw clause to the methods to indicate that the methods might throw this types of exception-handling which must be handled in the calling class or above

2190198
listbox	textbox
i ve seen people use listbox and textbox

2190202
for-loop	arrays
is there a fast and easy way to clone the arrays without using for-loop

gui based web-applications could be building upon a gui component stateful framework like wicket or they could built-in a restful stateless way with gui status only on the client

2190275
grouping	sorting
within each named grouping sorting is by time

2190276
updating	updates
if you are editing each row individually i m afraid there s not other way that updating row by row or you can have a batch-file updates for each grouping of value for example

2190346
http	ssl
failed to fetch url reason http ssl error

2190396
windows-server	windows	udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
and moreover i like to ad an exception-handling in firewall for incoming icmp protocal in windows-server 2003 windows firewall but i can t see anyoption to ad protocols in exception-handling instead there are only options to ad a program or ad a ports of udp or tcp

you use the setlocale standards function with the lc_ctype or lc_all category to set the mapping the libs uses between wchar_t characters and multibyte characters

2190405
any	set
the wide-character wchar_t types is intended to be able to support any character set the systemd supports - the standards doesn t defined the size of a wchar_t types it could be as small as a char or any of the larger int typess

2190429
32-bit	64bit
i noticed that installutil was writing the missing files to c windows syswow64...etc... .so i realized that i was using the 32-bit versioning of installutil to install the service but the service was running as a 64bit process

2190429
32-bit	64bit
the obvious side effect was that code generator .when installutil was running ended up under syswow64 the 32-bit systemd directory while the service was looking for it under the 64bit systemd directory systemd32

2190429
32-bit	x86
next i recompiled the service as x86 and registered it again using the 32-bit versioning of installutil

contains	elements
inline elements can only contains other inline elements and cannot contains block elements

2191089
contains	any
however be aware that neither table-variables nor table-type variables have any statistics associated with them and therefore can lead the query optimiser to make very dubious choices with regard to execution plans because it will always estimate that the table-variable contains 1 row - and therefore usually chooses nested-loops as a join operators

2191231
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as a webforms developer you re likely familiar with dataset however these are usually avoided in an asp.net-mvc application in favour of an orm framework like nhibernate or linq2sql both of which have plenty of resources online for integration with asp.net-mvc

2191252
versioning	staging
thus good practice is still to have a staging environment this could al.so be for acceptance-testing which is treated by developers and testers as if it were production --- only access is to deploy a corrected versioning no direct fixing .so fixed all start in development and .source control

2191261
versioning	upgrade
which defeats the points of being able to use in-app purchase to upgrade an existing lite versioning to the full-blown one

2191270

you could use a framework such as prototype or jquery that give you an each methods to use on the arrays but internally it would likely just use a for-loop anyway .so there s not really much points to it

2191588
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops	arrays	loops
alternatively if this is because you are using the for-loop all over the place and want to have reusable code instead why not attach a buildurl methods to your urls object which loops internally and returns your url arrays

i m just trying to return true false in one my my jquery methods depending on the checked of a certain radio-button and if it s selected or not

2195125
radio-button	selected
if i try this i get false even if i selected the radio-button

2195129
arrays	loops
a simple way of doing it would be to loops through the source arrays with a giant 27 stack deep if else if else if else.

2195155
input-field	selected
your selectedor won t selected the input-field and if it did it would return a jquery object

2195178
uiscrollview	subviews
i am trying to graphing large amounts of data in a uiview as a subviews of a uiscrollview

2195178
minimum	max
inorder to overcome the memory limitations surrounding enormous uiview i plan once the scrollview s offset has reached the maximum or minimum offset to redraw the view with the new data either with a lesser x value if it has reached minimum or visa versa and then increase the view s offset to the opposite of its current positioning ie max-- min and min-- max

2195184
arrays	loops
also you want to create a types called grouping and then create a new grouping in loops and then push it into the arrays

2195195

2195292
selected	checkbox
i have a selected box that witll control a list of checkbox one for each messages

2195311

you are then turning a calculated field into a fixed value field

2195341
any	set
.when you do hijack any methods that set the value besides the initial selection

2195363
any	set
t use guids as pks but can t you set newsequentialid as the default-value then any insert to your datbase will use that

2195369
contains	elements
i want to alias the data contains in the elements

2195385
constructor	object
you also need a parameterless constructor something which gives the string a value .when you initializer an object

2195387
markup	xhtml
to have a good introduction you could give a read to the markup guide which explains to clients every xhtml tags

2195389
constructor	private
in this case you ve defined a constructor which takes 1 arguments and sets it to a private field

2195389
constructor	private
move the initialization of the private field into the constructor

2195406
value	field
you declare a private string field called sqlconnection and you initializer it to contains a value from the configuration file

2195406
constructor	private	value	field
finllaly you defined a constructor taking a string parameter the value of which is assign to the private field

2195406
value	field
this looks quite ok even though it is a bit unnecessary to initializer the field .when you replace the value in the constructor

2195435
selected	button
to place the batch-file in there either drag it into the startup menu or righ click on the windows start button and selected explore go in programs startup and copy the batch-file into there

2195460
binaries	install
i would imagine that the windows-install would install binaries rather than needing to compile everything and it probably is bad to use the install and compile everything yourself

2195470
required	checked
most people would tune out while the automation is running and required as much time to figure out what they re supposed to be checked as they would have to just run the entire test manually

2195471
jquery	.post
here are some additional links which talk about the change jquery.ajax jquery.param and a blog .post jquery 1.4 .param demystified

2195517

2195665
linux	unix
available on windows unix and linux platform

2195675
put	get
.when you get the 204 it just show you that there is nothing to return usually you expect if you make a .post or put call that does not need to return anything

2195684
any	set
normally i would expect that a thread execution in the background that hasn t exited and wasn t set as a background-thread would cause this behavior but i am not creating any threads at this points

2195692
expression	evaluation
also note that short-circuiting evaluation is also used with and-ed expression but of course in the reverse at the first false conditional the evalation stops hence suggesting to write the expression with the most likely conditionalal to fail first

2195703
mouseover	mouseout
i think that every time #bd1 crosses your mouse pointers which is presumably hovering over the image it is calling the mouseout then calling mouseover .when it gets past

2195704
first-responder	nstextfield
i did find suggestions to subclassing nstextfield and then use mousedown or first-responder but it s beyond my skill for now

2195706
sql-server	mysql
this refers to sql-server but the concept is the same also lookup mysql documentation on this

2195761
msbuild-task	nant
you could use nant which has a msbuild-task in it that will just do it for you

2195782
boolean	int
bitwise-operators only work against integral types like int and boolean but enum is not directly cast-able to int

2195801

you can use eof on the filehandle

2195801
filehandle	eof
eof will return 1 if the next read on filehandle is an eof

2195821

i ve personally done this for solaris sparc x86 aix hp-ux and linux x86 x64 .

2195882
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i could imagine a ton of rea.sons why it would called rspec reading its configuration file ruby-on-rails reading its configuration file s cucumber reading its configuration file the debugger creating a temporary file .something else creating a temporary file and .so on

2195886
dependency-injection	inject
to inject or building either use dependency-injection framework spring or building the object somewhere in bootstrap factory code yourself

2195896
attributes	properties
if you re using those id attributes properly then test2 must be the only tag with that id on the page then the .checked boolean properties will tell you if it s checked or not

2195896
selected	button	any	set
you ve al.so not set any value for those radio button .so no matter which button you selected you ll just get a blank testgroup submitted to the server

2195902
buffering	streaming
this is advantageous because i am not buffering the entire file in memory before i start streaming

2195914
reflection	runtime
the idea of inspector a class methods function during runtime in my opinion points to a flaw in design - i think most problems reflection tries to solve could be used with either polymorphism or proper use of inherited

2195925
callback	methods
use a callback methods from your worker thread to reset the timer

2195926
variables	boolean
go back to koders and examine the complete code for the libs assuming it s not obfuscation and figure out the role of the boolean variables config_crypto and config_framework_1_2 what code sets them

2195930
constructor	object
this can be as simple as providing a mechanism to pass in a functor or even a plain old function pointers that will be called to deallocate the object preferably in the same function constructor that passes in the pointers itself

2195950
actionscript	mxml
how does one initializer a collections instances from mxml in flex actionscript

2195959
constructor	object
seeing as the constructor has no idea where it is to be throw then it only makes sense that the throw methods inject those details into the object at the points the throw is

2195964
unique	words
i learned somewhere that python has unique copies if that s the right words for small int

2195971
ssl-certificate	ssl
i would like specific areas of www.domain.com and app.domain.com to utilize ssl and thus must somehow rewrite the paths using the subdomain with the install ssl-certificate

2195973
reflection	runtime
in more recent versioning of java reflection is what makes annotations useful - you can write tools and do metaprogramming using these entities that exist in the source code but can be accessible at runtime

2195975
push	pull
edit you might try performing a pull from a linux machine or viewmodel if you have it and then renaming the file without the weird characters then commit and push back to the repository

2196083
click	mouse
i know that to prevent all mouse click i can write something like

2196102
configuration	environment
then as you move from environment to environment you would simply change the configuration file

2196104
handlebars.js	templating
i would instead encourage you to use a templating tool like handlebars.js

2196107
clearinterval	settimeout
the last thing i remember doing is adding a clearinterval methods to clear some settimeout intervals variables

2196125
right-join	union-all
luckily there is a workaround by combining a left join and a right-join using union-all

2196135
selected	listbox
a listbox tracking and selected the current item for you you dont need to do it in code

2196138
python	ruby
is slicing allowed like in python or ruby

2196141
scala	ocaml
some languages like ocaml and scala support statically-checked duck-typing called structural-typing but sometimes you just don t have compile-time knowledge of an object interface

2196169
traceroute	ping
traceroute and ping are both icmp-based protocols and cannot be created controlled from flash or javascript

2196169
packets	ping
this is why ping is an suid program on unix systemd as raw packets access required root privileges

2196169
traceroute	ping
you d have to execute the systemd ping and or traceroute and redirect the output back to the browser

2196187
python	java
interested in the main languages c# or java python but i would love any other input from esoteric language experts

2196201

postgresql	oracle
read up on oracle to postgresql conversion

2196233
postgresql	oracle
specifically the porting from oracle pl sql section of the postgresql manual

2196239
reflection	runtime
in fact c++ programmers often use an interface description language to expose interfaces at runtime providing a form of reflection

2196239
maintainability	conventions
judicious use of reflection and annotations combined with well defined coding conventions can avoids rampant code repetition and increase maintainability

2196278
google-chrome	firefox
my tabs work flawlessly in firefox and google-chrome on windows and os x...but not in ie

2196282
selected	checkbox
if you just selected employees from a list you could just loops around all the employees in the model and create a checkbox for them you may have to manually rendering as below - html.checkbox doesnt seem to work for multiple checkbox of same named

2196289
attributes	properties
with established conventions in your project you can perform common functions based on the presence of certain properties attributes etc

2196289
attributes	properties
or a more simple example within a domain where you want to transform data from the database to data object without needing to modify the transformation code .when properties change .so long as conventions are maintained in this case matching properties named and a specific attributes

2196299
google-chrome	firefox
i realize that declaring a variablesiables with the named event is bad code but i am curious about the technical difirefoxerence here that the use of variables in ie reinitializes the variablesiables to null whereas google-chrome will not overwrite with a variables declaration unless a value is explicit assign and maybe firefox holds the event object outside of the windows s variables declaration scoping altogether

2196300
any	set
any lighting you might shed on the set up process would be great

2196304
environment	building
you probably want to do this from your building machine as it sounds like the embedded shell environment is pretty broken

2196317
javascript	dom
.so flash triggers the function for the javascript to do the dom html manipulation

2196323
annotations	mapping
a better way as teja suggested is probably to annotations the mapping in your controllers and do away with the xml-configuration

2196325
execute	prepare	pdostatement	prepare
see pdo prepare and pdostatement execute

2196349
configuration	logging
i originally thought it could be achieved by creating a custom webproxy that would configure the logging and loading it into the main application using the defaultproxy configuration elements

2196356
contains	any
and the event parameter overrides any event declare in a contains scoping whereas in ie it s

2196361
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
there aren t any special requirements on the server side although only certain browsers safari google-chrome and in some cases firefox support html5 streaming

2196372
associations	model
thinking-sphinx relies on associations in model

2196372
associations	model
with acts_as_taggable_on plugins you don t have tag-related associations in model file and .when you write

2196372
associations	model
to get things working just add tag-related associations in your model before you rebuild index

2196401
directory	folder
i m using portableapps.com s portable java and i ve got it to store the home folder stuf using -j-duser.home data but how do i change the web caching preferrably to a folder called caching in the same directory

2196424
macros	vba
i know you can write vba macros for both excel and words but i have doubts that you could control a words document from excel

2196432
python	ruby
unfortunately ruby doesn t have an equivalent of python which i think would be nicer

2196451
simulator	platform
a crash on device but not the simulator and vice versa is usually caused by a compiled libs framework that is complied for one hardware platform but not the other

2196463
pixels	line
the height of the title div on the left is 53.9 pixels which fully accomodates the two line of 17.6 and 14.3 plus margins

2196465
boolean	int
the non nullable include int and boolean

2196473
constructor	object
.when an object throw an exception-handling at the end of the constructor is the object valid or is this one of those depends on the construction technique

2196500
rar	zip
if python is not a must and you can use systemd utilities tools like zip or rar provides passwd encrypted compression

2196500
rar	zip
zip with -e option and rar with -p

2196507
versioning	upgrade
however it s a bit old and i m not sure if they upgrade the versioning etc

2196513
constructor	object
if you throw an error in a constructor that is equivalent to saying constructing this object didn t work or object couldn t be created and as such you then need to handle that fact - i d only do this for fatal errors for which the object can t be used otherwise such as couldn t open a file we expected to be able to open in mysettingsreader class

2196516
buffering	streaming
the streaming classes do very little and really aren t supposed to have any functionality besides calling an underlying buffering of types basic_streamingbuf

2196520
constructor	object
whether or not the object in that memory contains valid data would be dependent on your constructor

2196520
constructor	object
throw an exception-handling in a constructor call generally signifies that the object wasn t properly construct and shouldn t be used

2196527
constructor	object
the only thing that would give away that the object existed would be if its destructor ran - but it does not run if the constructor did not complete

2196536
any	set
you can set any line styles to nil

2196550
constructor	object
throw in constructor construction failed -- object unusable

options value he selected are returned steve s code does not show exactly how the properties exposed as public are set but i m going to assume that the op probably intended to mean that the user interacted with some controls on the show form and that the options value he refers to are properties of controls on the form like the end-user typing some text in a textbox or the selected indexes in a listbox with its selectionmode set to allow one of two choices of multiple selection

2199783

any	set	contains	any	contains	set	environment	restart
i understand that this could be related to the fact that in the environment of the service manager it s failing to locate the appropriate dlls or registry entries - i d appreciate any thoughts on how i can fix the environment of the service manager to pickup the appropriate registry entries dlls and i believe the box has been restart after installing the com component - this could be also down to the fact that the path for the user contains the appropriate directory and not sure what the path for the service manager could be or how to set it.
