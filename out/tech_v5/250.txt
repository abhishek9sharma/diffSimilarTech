this question is similar to gwt table that supports sorting scrolling and filtering

2500623
order	add	order	join
you may be able to change the order of the join add criterion or provide hints to make it faster but without the explain plan you do not know why it is slow .so you don t even know if you can make it faster

2500625
any	set
our dockpanel s documentstyle is set to dockingwindow .so tabs are always show for any windows docked into the document area

2500659

2500667
spaces	output
there are parameters that such as trimspacess that alter the output to save spaces

2500668
entity-framework	ado.net
i use and would recommend ado.net entity-framework

2500678

what this means is that the compiler checked the class of the reference variables for the presence of methods and other members for example say that you have a dog subclassing which extends animal base-class

2500704
any	set
at a points inside this it has no relation with the c# gui for the user .so it isn t derived from any c# class i need to see if a flag is set or not

2500730
arrays	loops
once you have the points along the perimeter in an arrays you can loops through them using the same loops for any arbitrary division

2500738

asp.net-mvc	webforms
unfortunately ignoreroute does not work for router webforms though because it is not an asp.net-mvc application

2500767
hashtable	set	hashtable	sorted
now for the set of sets you can choose a sorted vector that you might need to resize from time to time while insert elements or an hashtable

2500779
setcontentview	oncreate
yeah either setcontentview hasn t been called in oncreate of the activity or else the view you are trying to get isn t an edittext

2500837
required	checked
linq required the developer to know and understand how it works with respect to checked for null value

2500838
google-chrome	firefox
i really recommend browsing with google-chrome .when you re looking to debugging javascripting it s error console is very useful for not just determining errors like this but also for pinpointing the location in the scripting that is throw the error which might be an advantage beyond firebug in firefox

2500840
xsd	xml
i am just learning xml xsd and am struggling with the implementation of an xml-schema which model a folder structure

2500852
domcontentloaded	onload
you could use an onload event instead as that will work in all browsers and is usually only a fractions of a second after the domcontentloaded event

2500853
sorted	lookup
you could also building a sorted arrays for each set and lookup the value with bsearch although the performance may suffer during the insert

2500869
implements	abstract	subclassing	base-class
and again since you don t implements any of the abstract-methods from the base-class in the subclassing you must mark the subclassing as abstract as well

2500873
google-chrome	firefox
this layout works well on firefox ie8 google-chrome and other browsers but on ie7 and ie6 the div does not float over the other divs messing my layout

2500883

your page can contains any numbers of the following structure

2500918
linux	osx
note that this only seemed to happen on linux not osx and i fixed it by replacing the line at the top of the jgem scripting from

2500921
constructor	object
here s the code it s in the constructor for my synthesizer object

2500954
bimap	map
if you want a bidirectional map with unique key and unique value as asked in your title also called a key-key map have a look at guava bimap

2500962
alpha-transparency	alpha
also alpha-transparency is needed but not essential because alpha channel could be taken from separate image

2500968
qmainwindow	qdialog
i have a qmainwindow display a qdialog

2501010
communication	messages
the presence of data on the channel is de-facto evidence that the communication channel is alive .so no specific heartbeat messages should be required

2501015
any	set
general security advice you should probably set strict permissions on any files that you don t want random people looking at

2501042

put the predicates in the join conditional instead then it will get evaluated before the missing rows are added back in.

2501100
32-bit	64bit
not sure about 64bit but i recently had to install the vb 6 ide on windows 7 32-bit and couldn t get the install to run

2501106
order	join
the .solutions provided .so far should work move the conditional into the left join but i d like to suggest an alternative you can use a subquery to specify the order in which things should be done

2501126
hide	show
unless the amount of data needed to updates is really large likely to change often or your intended client is really limited in bandwidth or computing power like mobile-devices you may allso embed all the data needed on the page and selectively hide and show the data based on the selection without using a server call

2501130
imageview	textview
in the table cell i have an imageview the images are display via url and a textview webview

2501150

2501240
any	set
does setting the maxreceivedmessagesize to a very height numbers have any negative impact or would it be useful to set it just above the size i actually want to send receive

2501272
windows-vista	windows
i know how to compile such .app for windows not as swf but as .app from pure c++ and you can see how here but be worned thay use hxcpp 0 4 the problem is - i do not want to compile .app for windows-vista or 7 or xp i want to get pure c++ code better in one place as one project for for example compiling that code on windows-mobile or where ever i want to

2501276
defined	declare
this is because you declare it in your header but didn t actually defined it anywhere

2501276
constructor	object
second you shouldn t explicit call location location - you don t need to scoping the constructor to the class like this and you are not assign the result to any object

2501287
default	reset
the string can reset it s formatting to default by using a defined set of characters

2501288
32-bit	64bit
basically you need to have xpsp2 or better if you re using 32-bit windows-xp but both 32-bit and 64bit xp are supported fully

2501296
margins	padding
edit alternately you could add 20px padding to a wrapper div then set your containers to height 100 with no margins and it should fill up to the padding of its wrapper

2501298
copy-constructor	constructor
if you do anything non-trivial in a destructor or constructor you must ensure that the copy-constructor and copy assignment-operator preserver the equivalence semantics

2501328
push	pull
you can clone a part of svn repository locally to an hg repository and work with hg locally and svn remotely push and pull do what you would expect of them

2501329
google-chrome	firefox
here s a blog comparing subpixel rendering in google-chrome and firefox

2501353
background-image	background-color
if left needs a background-color or background-image you ll want to give that background-image to the wrapper instead

2501373
highlight	selected
to add a-star just use a uibarbuttonitem with the default image of a unhighlight star and a selected image of a highlight star

2501384
windows-vista	windows-xp
you only have to make simple .app that will display paths for you and run it under windows-xp and windows-vista

2501386
selected	cell
i want to keep a cell selecteded and only change .when i selected another cell

2501386
selected	cell
in tableview cellforrowatindexpath i have set a selected cell with cell setselected yes

2501386
selected	cell
i know the cell is selected but it is not show

2501386
selected	cell
.when i call tableview reloaddata the selected cell flashes

2501400
shell	bash
to make it formally equivalent using bash or korn shell

2501436
selected	cell
with javascript parsing value of selected cell into csv structure

2501438
defined	declare
as you have it now you declare two nontemplate functions in the header which are never defined

2501445
spatialite	gdal
i built spatialite libs then gdal libs with spatialite support

2501445
mapserver	gdal
also built mapserver which depends on gdal with success

2501461
arguments	default
xargs by default batch-file as many arguments as it thinks it can into each invocation of the cmd it s supposed to run but if there are too many files it will run the cmd multiple time on subset of the files

2501461
perl	awk
the other is to use an awk or perl scripting to process the output of your find xargs combo skip total line and sum up the total yourself

2501466
attributes	properties
i have a base-class with a properties called named which has an xmltext attributes

2501475
google-chrome	safari
you can also transfer the purchase to a free typekit account which will cover google-chrome + safari too

2501487
16-bit	8bit
i know that the client ado will convert 8bit strings to 16-bit unicode strings using the current culture

2501487
numeric	digits
will sql-server interpreter numbers using the active or per-login specified locale or must all numeric value be specifid with latin numeral digits

2501497
boolean	int
it s not very good practise to use yes no for your you re better off using an int or boolean value

2501503
radio-button	selected
i ve got 2 radio-button grouping showed differently depending on the value selected on another radio-button

2501503
radio-button	selected
the thing is that i would like to set the default-value of the grouping to the first elements in the radio-button grouping but .when i change from the other radio-button it preserve the value previously selected .when i want it to be reset to the default-value

2501532
getter	setter
the error preverifying class is throw on a very simple class 4 private field with getter setter implements serialization that s all

2501551
stdin	pipe	flac	mp3
this cmd converts an input mp3 file i didn t find other audio files on my pc to flac and send it to stdout which goes to stdin of oggenc2 by using pipe |

2501569
lookup	any
is it to merge the two sites .so that i can use the standards lookup feature or is there any workaround for this

2501586
selected	cell
use mouse events to detection the first cell the user selected and the most recent cell entered and apply selection-like styling to the rectangle of cell with those cell as opposite corners

2501586
selected	cell	selection	cell
what you could do is copy the selected cell into a table hidden off-screen using a large negative value for css left for example .when the selection changes and have the real selection always surrounding the off-screen table

2501596
contains	any
you might avoid exception-handling by first checkeded if the resulting dataset contains any errors dataset.haserrors or even go .so far as to checked every table datatable.haserrors and every row datarow.haserrors

2501607
profiling	trace
to find out for sure use the sql profiling to trace for deadlock graphing events which will show you the detail of the deadlock itself

2501612
callback	methods
if your accelerometer callback methods is not being called there s a good chance your application delegation or other custom class is not supporting the uiaccelerometerdelegation class

2501614
typedef	struct
you ll want typedef struct .

2501634
contains	elements
should contains your elements nothing but should contains

2501637
contains	elements
basically text in tables must be contains within cell td or th which in turn must be contains by rows tr which in turn should be contains by tbody thead or tfoot elements which then can be contains by table

2501647
instances	destroy
my only issue with it in the current beta is they have some cleanup issues though these issues are easy enough to remedy look through their source and any time you completely remove a component from the stage you ll have to play the profiling game and make sure everything is getting cleaned up --- we had to create temp functions to remove the changewatchers and destroy display list bean instances until they get that stuff fixed

2501650
numeric	digits
neither isnumeric nor cast can successfully test these digits .so a numeric constants using those characters would not work either

2501650
numeric	digits
allowing a client to pass non-latin digits sounds dangerously promiscuous i m not sure what path your data travels but there seems to be a potential for sql-injection if user s localized input isn t being tested to be numeric

2501665
typedef	struct
typedef your struct first like

2501665
boolean	int
in that case your function would return a boolean to indicate success or failure and take two pointers to int as parameters

2501673
contains	set
if you set the .object filename to say .obj _file__c.o then the generator _file_.d will still contains _file_.o not .obj _file_c.o

2501687
output	mode
running in debugging mode checked for binding errors in the output windows

2501691
httpd.conf	.htaccess
the only way in apache that comes to mind is putting the rewritebase directive into a tag but that is only available in httpd.conf itself not in .htaccess files

2501701
contains	elements
if we are making ajax request we probably don t want to rendering create.aspx which is by default and instead rather rendering tab-createeditform because it contains only the form tag and field and no page directives head title and all the other elements that are in create.aspx

2501704
postgresql	mysql
the above works in postgresql mysql needs as defined here for full list of functions that are influenced with this server mode see in this ref

2501711
instances	self
.when you have your own class without defining __get__ it just returns your instances without implicit passing self

2501715
contains	set

2501787
sql-server	oracle
i am not too sure about the oracle case but for sql-server assign null to a parameter will lead to that parameter not being sent .when execution the procedure which will lead to the procedure complaining about the numbers of parameters

2501795
webforms	asp.net
i think the mere fact that you are using asp.net webforms your road to tdd will be challenged

2501795
webforms	asp.net
another promising option for the webforms paradigms is asp.net webforms mvp but that project is really not fully mature yet

2501801
implements	extends
you could extends a say interface b extendss a and extends aimpl and implements b class bimpl extendss aimpl implementss b .

2501805
subdirectories	archive
i didn t see a question on this subject in the archive .so here goes for those of you experienced mercurial users is this a correct hgignore file to tell vb.net express to ignore files subdirectories .when adding items in a new repository

cursor	row
the easiest way would be to use pl sql to open a cursor that selected unprocess rows process them and then updates the row as process

2501831
seam	jsf
i thought the hidden parameter would work because that is how i would do it with straight html and i m a little surprised that its not working for jsf seam

2501849
google-maps	gps
i m am curently doing an application with google-maps where i am checkeded the positioning of the user with the javascript api but i would like to know if there is a way to checked the gps variables in a php file

2501954
scrollable	panels
now i found that i can spare myself a lot of trouble in my javascript project if i insert a scrollable iframe into each panels

2501954
google-chrome	firefox
all of this works a treat in firefox and google-chrome but ie6 is doing .something rather cute .so long as i do not afirefoxect the width of the browser windows but only change its height only the panels div changes in height

2501957
python	c++
ps. i coudn t use the python implementation because i ll have to do it in c++

azure itself is imo paas and not iaas

2502032
value	field
i m trying to updates a field in the database to the sum of its joined value

contains	set
this will set the available capacity to be the same as the numbers of items contains .so there will be no reserved spaces

2502039
getter	setter
the properties call defined the properties and the synthesize call will create setter and getter for you methods to set and retrieve the value of itemid

2502068
scala	java
what i do know is that most higher-level languages such as java scala and ruby have a simple safe direct conversion for that

2502078
subclassing	nsobject
as to the question of filling up your .app delegation with all kinds of conditional you might want to write a separate pushnotificationscontroller not a uiviewcontroller just a nsobject subclassing that will handle all push-related stuff

2502084
postgresql	oracle
i don t have oracle or postgresql handy to test

2502086
difference	factors
btw .when calculating complexity of an algorithm we usually end up dropping factors and constants because they do not affect the speed difference by much .so it should be simplify as a n n and b n n 2 which gives you a clear answer

2502099
execution	exit
the memory is deallocated right after the destructor function exit and before execution returns to the delete call or points where an object instances goes out of scoping

2502100
radix-sort	in-place
this is o sqrt n 2 o n . now use an in-place radix-sort on the rest where each digits is log sqrt n log n 2 bits and we use the first partition to store the digits count

2502121
worksheet	excel
i m assuming you have the excel workbook on the server and just want to send a single worksheet to the client

2502133
tcp-ip	udp
most commonly at the bottom of the application layer you will be choosing between tcp-ip or udp

2502133
udp	tcp
if you need inorder delivery of messages you need to use tcp as opposed to udp

2502144
base-class	superclass	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	subclassing	subclassing	base-class	subclassing	superclass
you need to change the base-class superclass to have a virtual-method with the same signature as the derived-class subclassing

2502189
z-index	overlay
you can set the z-index properties of the overlay div to a greater value than the one of the transparency div to put it on top

2502191
background-image	transparency
if you want a transparency div with non-transparency text one option is to use a semi-transparency background-image instead of using css opacity

2502198
jquery	.post
with the excellent xval by steve sanderson it is possible to tell the client side validation to .post the value being validation to the server using jquery

2502198
jquery	.post
i should note that using the xval methods a custom validation to say if an email-address is in use or not can be run from the client via a jquery .post which accesses the server side validation logic

2502204
google-chrome	firefox
it looks correct in firefox google-chrome ie8 but not ie6 7 the footer s background is white and inside the box

2502221
sql-server	oracle
what i mean by this is that it is truly a real pain if your application wants to talk to different databases sql-server and oracle and you want to only have one set of generator dal object

2502221
configuration	environment
perhaps this isn t a huge concern for most of you but i m currently writing a commercial .app that touts one of its main features as being able to run on various database engines just by changing its configuration and i chose subsonic because i thought it could handle the job pretty easily but i m honestly having second thoughts now because of all the hoops i may have to jump through just to get this to work correctly under different environment

2502244
value	field
.so .when you actually have the value in the _charset_ field the value of the field contains merkblã tter is already decode incorrectly by .net

value	field
if you do this you can read the value of the field contains merkblã tter as usual no matter what charset the client send the value in

2502279
keyboard	mouse
however there is an authentication systemd which prevents unauthorized programs from access an x server the place where the keyboard screens and mouse are

you would get the same error if you put a system.out.println in the first methods after the return statement in it

2502332
web-services	api
it acts as an interface to amazon s web-services api

2502347
for-loop	arrays
your second line does not even access the arrays - make sure that it s not the first line of the body of the for-loop that throw the exception-handling

2502363
windows-xp	windows
wia would be the best solution for windows-xp and newer twain might be better if you need to support windows 2000 or 9x i think twain is also supposed to be cross-platform even though i don t have any evidence to that right now

2502367
firefox	safari
it does not work in safari 4 but does work in firefox 3.5.9

2502368

looking at google s browser security document the following browsers translation non-reserved nn sequences in the address bar msie7 msie8 ff3 opera google-chrome

2502424
contains	elements
where a vector contains all elements of the time column is named time the vector with wave height is called waveheights and the vector with distance is called distance you could use plotyy in this way

2502438
value	field
the main value of reflection would be to write a general purpose object comparator that could take two instances of any kind of object and compare their public field and properties

2502439
gearman	worker
you could send this into a gearman queue and then have a gearman worker with the appropriate sleep call

2502443
dialog	pop-up
in a long-running operation i m showing a pop-up dialog created from progressdialog to prevent other operations from happening

2502463

2502615
any	set
but if iphone region format is set to us but language to french german any other nsdateformatter returns english strings mon tue ...

2502622
return-value	return-type
if that is a return-value from the stored procedure then the return-type should be set to parameterdirection.returnvalue

2502639
subtract	time
sum all your break that occur during the time and then subtract to the result-of the timediff time_to_sec function

2502645
contains	any
my ultimate goal is to grouping a bunch of the day controls within a month control which is then contains in a year control as i m trying to make a long calendar bar that lets you navigate through the months and years while click on a day would display any information saved on that date

2502660
constructor	object
is there a shorter way to assign value to the instance-variables of an object in the arrays of objacts than this without writing any special constructor

2502663
seam	jsf
which means seam jsf was treating my form-submit as a non-faces request

2502671

i have committed to learning c now i m good with python php bash but i ve decided i m limited by not being fluent in c

2502685
http-headers	content-type
to verify this you can install live http-headers for firefox and checked the content-type header of the webserver response

2502694
hash	md5
an md5 hash is often used to verify the integrity of a file or document

2502694
hash	md5
here s a good article on generator an md5 hash in javascript

2502696
constructor	object
the xamlreader sees this string and tries to create a string but can t find an empty constructor in the string object to use .so it throw a parserexception

2502745
instances	private
if you set your s3 bucket to private then startup an ec2 instances you could serve your files on s3 via ec2 using the ec2 instances to verify permissions based on your application s rules

2502752
primitive	int
in functional languages pattern-matching can be used for matching on standards primitive value such as int

2502763
hash	md5
for example checkout the pseudo code or an actual javascript implementation for computing the md5 hash of a string

2502765
mouseleave	mouseenter
i thought i was missing something too but i do know that the jquery validation plugins doesn t react to mouseenter mouseleave

2502765
value	field
before a field is marked as invalid the validation is lazy-evaluation before submission the form-for the first time the user can tab through field without getting annoying messages - he won t get bugged before he had the chance to actually enter a correct value

2502765
versioning	upgrade
i also found the need to upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery.validate.js from the developer s page because we are using a later versioning of jquery 1.4 here

2502773
children	tree	hide	show
i want to hide all the descendents of the ul for my tree menu .when the page loads up then as each main li link is click display the direct child and if the direct child has children grandchild .when the the child is click i want it to show the grandchild elements

2502773
children	tree
what i really want to happen is to hide all the descendents except the main top-level headings and as i walk down the tree display the children as needed

2502784
value	field
if you don t need the whole messages recording value but only some field within it then you can match and destruct like this

2502820
culture	french
for instances if date is aug-2009 and culture is french then would display as aoã t-2009

2502820
culture	french
all this without switching the current thread culture to french

2502836
global-variables	call
defining package with pragma serially_reusable causes oracle to re-initialize the global-variables with every call to the server

2502872
stderr	stdout
this worked for me for redirecting stdout stderr can be handled similarly

2502888
required	checked
it is not required by the c standards but some compilers checked and make sure that value assign to a variables of enumerated types correspond to one of the enumerated constants

2502905
comma	words
i have a string which is basically a list of words delimited by comma

2502921
python	c++
but i used the boost libs for python in c++ to allow python to access a function called something like loadimageintomainwindow string filepath

2502921
python	c++
i will updates as soon as i get home with the c++ the command-line compilation line the jamroot and the python files

2502924
ref	out
as it was already said here dynamicobject doesn t support ref and out parameters in tryinvokemember

2502924
ref	out
at this points information about ref and out parameters is still preserve

2502924
ref	out
if it can t find such a methods it call tryinvokemember methods and simply throw out information about ref and out keyword and starts treating everyting as by value

2502924
ref	out
true information about ref and out is now missing from documentation

2502948
required	checked
checked the required statements at the top of the file - you ll see that there are only 3 possible sources given that color_puts is not a ruby standards

2502957
duplicates	contains
if it is possible for the string that you want to search to contains duplicates items you can use this altered versioning of the function indexof only returns the first index .so a loops is needed to find all of them

2502963
wxpython	pygtk
also pygtk is lighter than wxpython but i ended up bitting the bullet and using wxpython for the same purpose recently it is heavy but it didn t have any affect on the scripting performance

2502966
attributes	properties
.when a product is release every file in the tip will have these attributes properties set

2502972
type-parameter	return-type
can be used just as - the only place where the type-parameter appears is the return-type from the next methods .so it can be safely up-cast to t

2502988
mongodb	mysql
i was looking at moving the api i have for sure with stack overflow iphone .app i wrote a while back to mongodb from where it currently sits in a mysql database

2503003
return-type	arguments
a non-broken implementation of interface-implementation variance would have to be covariant in the return-type and contravariance in the arguments types

2503025
children	tree	children	nodes	traversal	parent
but .when traversal the tree i cannot manage to determine the actual numbers of children without iterator over the parent nodes

2503028
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade rubygems as normals if it messes up just downloading the last versioning and run sudo ruby setup.rb

2503034
python	c++	python	ruby
as of q2 2009 the majority of smart-phones run symbian os and applications are developed using either a specialized versioning of c++ or a variety of other languages including python java-me flash lite ruby .net web runtime wrt widget and standards c++

2503034
compact-framework	.net
many other smart-phones run windows-mobile and applications would typically be developed using either c++ or languages on the .net compact-framework which include c# and vb.net

2503046
malloc	free
if not for example it intends to use free you ll need to use malloc instead

2503057
32-bit	64bit
the legacy quicktime framework did not make the transitions to 64bit .so you ll need to make sure you re compiling as 32-bit

2503081
configuration	installation
i have a set of default configuration which are altered at the moment of installation custom install class

2503085
rhino-mocks	moq
you can easily mock your httpcontext with a mocking framework like rhino-mocks or google moq

2503111
installation	upgrade
i haven t actually tried this myself but you should be able to use an installation disc for rhel 5.4 to upgrade even if you are offline although you ll need to get on-line somewhere to downloading the disk image

2503124
annotations	mapping
reverse-engineering the most powerful feature of hibernate tools is a database reverse-engineering tool that can generator domain model classes and hibernate mapping files annotations ejb3 entity beans html documentation or even an entire jboss-seam application in seconds

2503131
value	field
basically users will enter a numbers into this field and the keyrelease event checked that the input fits a few parameters and then assign the value to a data storage elements in the program

2503132
publish-subscribe	observer-pattern
i think a standards publish-subscribe or observer-pattern is probably what you need - but it s hard to tell without understanding the subtleties of the problem that you are trying to solve

2503144
scheme	let
if you re using plt scheme the comprehensions libs will let you do this rather neatly

2503152
revision	updates
anyway i updates my local repo to the new revision

2503168
fxcop	nant
nant is able to do the building and execute other tools like fxcop using nantcontrib libs

2503170
python	java	python	c++
a variety of devices run symbian apps are typically written in c++ although other options like java and python exist

2503172

i put the resulting .libs in opt local .lib and i still get the same error messages

2503183
jnaerator	jna
i m trying to get jnaerator to generator some jna backed java code from a c shared libs and everything is fine except that it failed to generator an unnamed union nested inside a structure

2503197
buildpath	libs
i m guessing that the buildpath for that project is lacking a core libs

2503197
buildpath	libs
for a java project checked this properties java buildpath libs this may differ depending on the versioning of eclipse i m using 3.2.1 at the moment

2503257
arrays	loops
in addition to using key you al.so need to dereference the references-to-arrays this is why you re seeing each value output as arrays with an address---you re printinging the references not the value of the dereference arrays .when you printing .so your loops becomes .something like

2503306
3d-engine	rendering
i am working with the trinigy 3d-engine and it report model to have twice as many triangles during rendering than it does in the model display let s say 4000 instead of 2000

2503323
any	set
otherwise you d never be able to set any properties on any object from anywhere

2503325
contains	set
they d both be set to overflow scroll and have a set width but the top one would simply contains a div that you can set to be the same width as your table

2503349
hamcrest	lambdaj
in his last release lambdaj implements it with a smart use of closure and hamcrest matcher

2503351
fxcop	nant
nant can be used as a building scripting which will building your project and then execute nunit and fxcop

2503351
ncover	fxcop
inside there it building the project runs nunit ncover fxcop stylecop etc

2503351
teamcity	nant
i haven t used teamcity but there should be a way to pull down the source and then run an msbuilding or nant building scripting which will then handle the building step

2503354
attributes	properties
anonymous-methods as well as other object such as auto-implemented properties etc will have this attributes added

2503358
jtextfield	jlabel	jtabbedpane	jtextfield	jtabbedpane	jlabel
unlike many basic components jtextfield jlabel etc the jtabbedpane ignore the foreground and background colors .when setting up to paint

2503358
user-interface	look-and-feel
instead it allows the user-interface delegation as determined by the current look-and-feel to choose the colors

2503358
substance	nimbus
some look and feels allow for color themes substance comes to mind but nimbus seems to have those color value hardcode into the paint delegation

2503365
freebsd	linux
many appliances are based off of stripped down linux or freebsd kernel running apache or a lightweight httpd

2503380
order	add
order of events that lead to certain state logging can seldom be always on as the impact on performance is significant not only on performance but most importantly on concurrency as most existing logging infrastructures add contention

2503385
python	c++
well the easiest way to create python plugins is to use c++ and boost-python

2503388
simplemodal	jquery
the simplemodal jquery plugins gives you the option to autoposition your modal windows

2503397
subtract	time
i take the current time where i am in est and using nstimezone end up subtract the 3 hours necessary to represent the time in pst

2503397
subtract	time
but all i ve done is subtract 3 hours from the time which is still represented relative to my time zone

2503406
web-config	app-config
1 go in to your test run configuration and add the app-config or web-config that contains your configuration strings as a deployment item

2503407
put	get
i would hesitate to put code that call user_default c functions in production code .so you might want to look at the .source for the function and replicate it in your own code .so you don t get bitten by a behavior change in a future erlang release

2503415
versioning	upgrade
i would continue with the practice of export the site as upgrade are needed but have a symbolic link to a directory outside of the versioning controlled directory with the user upload content

2503430
visualvm	jvm
no matter what i startup visualvm just gives me unknown application and not supported for this jvm on my mac

2503430

2503442
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i recently started reading about asp.net-asp.net-mvc and after getting excited about the concept i started to migrate all my webforms project to asp.net-mvc but i am having a hard time keeping my controllers skinny even after following all the good advices out there or maybe i just don t get it .

2503456
radio	click
i m working on a ruby-on-rails application where i have some a set of two radio button where users can click yes or no

2503475

for instances if you want a day to display differently if it has information you might add a hasinformation properties to the day class and implements a data triggers to change its background-color or fonts weight if it s true

2503529
radio-button	selected
since null is essentially a third possible state i added a third hidden radio-button that is selected by default

2503529
contains	set
.when my response contains the null radio-button response i manually set it

2503540
updating	updates
if you plan on mostly reads with little updating and the updates are quick and infrequent a thread safe singleton would work just fine

2503546
selected	button
if you don t want the user selected a response and then re-selected no response you can selectively choose to display the button on your form based on its current value

2503548
value	field
the list that was populating the combobox was int64 and i was trying to store the value in an int32 field

2503573
spring	guice
you don t necessarily have to use a di framework like spring or guice but you really want to avoid littering your code with singleton

2503577
svnadmin	dump
if you are using powershell to backup your svn repositories using svnadmin dump then be aware that piping to a file will silently corrupt your backup

2503581
oracle	mysql
obviously you are really after a mysql .solution .so this probably won t help you much but oracle has a feature called total recall more formally flashback archive which automates the process you are currently hand-rolling

2503595
uniform	points
since there doesn t seem to be a uniform standards you ll probably get some confused users if you rely solely on an icons to get the points across

2503621
updating	updates
.when appledatepreferenceschangednotification was delivered the locale hadn t updates .so no matter what i tried cocoa was updating the field using the old locale information

2503623
firefox	opera
i ve tested on firefox 3.5.8 and opera 10.10 on ubuntu

2503638
menuitem	button
my problem is that i want to access from a page to the properties of a control button textblock labels or a menuitem of the windows.... placed in a windows

2503642
getter	setter
inorder for custom properties to be de serialization properly you need both a getter and a setter

2503647
children	nodes
1 .when you realloc the nodes list you actually move in memory the nodes object .so the parent pointers in their children must me updates as well

2503659
any	set
.when i use jframe.setbounds to set the bounds to any location that s half off the screens it actually sets the location of the frame to be as close as possible to the bounds specified while still staying completely on the screens

i am making a project-management tool that among other things assign a user to a project and assign hours to that project on a weekly basis per user sometimes for weeks many weeks into the future

2503682
unique	words
in other words each object really is unique

2503687
contains	set
click properties and set the native .libs option to points to the same .lib folder that should also contains four .jni.lib files

2503688
contains	any
you re under a wrong impression - the datacontract that the server exposes can and should only contains data - never any behavior

2503688
contains	elements
also all the types involved in the calculation - most definitely calculationnode and calculationresult - must be exposed as datacontract elements contains a numbers of data-members field or properties

2504194
selected	listbox	selected	button
the pseudo-listbox has some of the same disadvantages as a multi-select listbox namely it s hard to tell what s selected if the list is long enough to scroll. the dream solution would be a drag-and-drop types thing but at this points even button would be ok

2504198

you need to use jquery .post function and specify the data to send see here jquery.post

2505059
dependency-injection	service-locator
or in pattern speak it would eventually degrade the dependency-injection pattern to the service-locator pattern

2505070
.doc	xls
we ve implements a policy that all .doc files must have the svn needs-lock properties set to prevent parallels access on files that are hard to merge we ve also done this for xls powerpoint pdf etc.

2505070
any	set
we ve also set up a pre-commit hook that checked that all added files of these types have the needs-lock properties set if they forget are too lazy-evaluation to updates their svn configuration file they won t be able to add any docs to the repo

2505077
instances	self
.so in the example above each instances of statemachineexample has process_hook alias to process_state_1 but note how in the latter it can redefine process_hook for self only not affecting other statemachineexample instancess to process_state_2

2505096
push	pull
until now i had only worked on my home desktop but i just bought a laptop and am trying to set it up .so that i can work on the project from either computer and push pull changes

2505121
web-applications	security
web-applications need to be designed with security in mind

2505127
beautifulsoup	lxml	lxml	tidy
if it is not well formed you need a fault tolerant parsing such as beautifulsoup elements tidy or lxml s html parsing

2505127
beautifulsoup	lxml
lxml and elementree use a mostly compatible api that is more of a standards than beautifulsoup

2505127
elementtree	lxml
in my opinion lxml is the best module for working with xml document but the elementtree include with python is still pretty good

2505127
beautifulsoup	elementtree
in the past i have used beautifulsoup to convert html to xml and construct elementtree for process the data

2505192
arguments	default	instances	self
by default in c# methods are instances methods and they receive the implicit self arguments

2505192
instances	private
private are ok a static methods can then be called from anywhere without having to previously initializer a instances of the class

2505194
itextsharp	itext	apache-fop	itext
in this case directly converting from xhtml to pdf a would be an ideal solution either using itext directly the example uses itextsharp a .net ports of itext but it s the same for java or by using apache-fop as others have suggested which also uses itext internally .when outputting to pdf and although it is more bloated inefficient and complicated to setup than using itext directly it might produce better results than the itext example -- only one way to settle that you have to try it out on a few of your xhtml files as samples

2505203
versioning	upgrade
what you want to do is set you install up in such a way that the new versioning of your software sees the file deletions as upgrade to a prior versioning

2505203
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade guid always stays the same within your product family of different versioning

2505203
versioning	upgrade
in general if you follow this pattern and then specify file deletions in your new versioning the install should interpreter the file deletions as upgrade and you should not get any errors on subsequent execution of the newly-installed versioning

2505216
required	checked
delete your eclipse install and reinstall run updates until it doesn t find anything new then install the android plugins checked the box that says to search all sites for required package

2505225
udp	tcp
both in tcp and udp

2505227
c-standard-library	standard-library
however if you want to printing numeric value then the most flexible methods will be to use the printingf function from the c-standard-library you mention that you re calling your assembler rountines from c .so you are probably linking to the standard-library anyway

2505247
function-call	inline
the reason you won t see it in release is because the function-call is likely inline

2505257
exception-handling	try-catch
if i don t make that assumption meaning that i add some try-catch block to catch bad_alloc of class b and class c then if the allocation exception-handling occurs should i do clean up in the constructor of a

2505324
revision	svn
i m not a hg-subversion user but that output says that in the process of doing the push you requested it s pulling the changes from the svn repo finding a new revision and then doing a git-rebase of your changeset 10c1 after descendent of the newly pulled revision

2505324
push	pull
if they re only created in mercurial then one work-around would be to set up a svn-gateway repo on the remote systemd and do the push from there and never pull from that repo back into mercurial

2505358
return-value	arguments
.when a program call another program that means it execute another executable and any communication between the two process is either in the form of command-line arguments to the callee coupled with an int return-value to the caller or via some sort of ipc

postgresql	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle
i have written that in the postgresql but it doesn t works in oracle and sql-server

2505395
32-bit	64bit	installation	building
as noted by paul if you want to building 32-bit binaries on a 64bit systemd you need to use the -m32 flag which may not be available by default on your installation some 64bit linux distros don t include 32-bit compiler linker .lib support by default

2505396
exception-handling	try-catch
i would like to somehow apply a try-catch statement to all actions as a backstop for any uncaught exception-handling

formally dfs is an uninformed search that progresses by expanding the first child nodes of the search tree that appears and thus going deeper and deeper until a goal nodes is found or until it hits a nodes that has no children

2505448
put	get
i al.so like a create a top-level .application grouping into which i put the .app delegation main xib file if any pch file info.plist .app icons default.png and other things related just to the .application .so they are all easy to find - after you add a numbers of files each of those things can get lost in giant lists of stuff

2505462
private-members	private	getter	setter
if we can access the private-members through setter and getter then what is the use of private

2505472
contains	any
now pick has enough spaces to store fifteen but you never actually put any pointsers inside that would points to memory that should contains the read characters

2505477
getter	setter
because the getter and setter can act as a proxy

2505485
getter	setter
no one forces you to put in getter and setter for every variables

2505485
private-members	object	getter	setter
indeed blindly using private-members + dummy getter setter for every variables is pointless even though many object oriented encapsulation tutorials do this all the time for some reason

2505503
getter	setter
there is somewhat of a debate right now as to using protected vs private or to use concepts akin to properties in some languages delphi c# rather than getter and setter as in java

2505522
deflatestream	lzw
it does not seem to be the lzw algorithm used by the .net deflatestream and gzipstream classes .so you can skip at least one

2505544
getter	setter
as you mentioned using accessor makes private variables a bit pointless and in some environment performance consequence of using getter and setter just makes it worthless

2505544
getter	setter
on the other hand if you don t have such concerns i think using getter isn t .so bad but you should think twice before using setter

2505549
google-chrome	firefox
the table object-model works in the couple of browsers i tested it in google-chrome and firefox on the mac .so it may not be a bad idea to familiarize yourself with it

express-checkout	paypal
i ve done successful integration for both google-checkout and paypal express-checkout in django

2505708
silverlight	wpf
the title of your .post mentions wpf rather than silverlight .so you are in luck because you can use the bennedik validation control to handle the display of validation errors in the user-interface for you automatically

hash	md5
now if i use say a java program that implements the same hashing alogorithm md5 can i expect the hash value to be the equals to the value generator in c#

2505758
hash	md5
my suggestion would be to use a common accepted hashing algorithm like md5 to achieve the same hash value

2505764
hash	md5
what you really want to know is whether a hashing algorithm such as md5 will produce the same hash value for identical files on different operating systemd platform

2505764
hash	md5
in the case of text files transcoding between different character encoding or changing line termination sequences will make the files different at the byte level and result in different md5 hash value

2505805
binary-search-tree	tree
if you have a binary-search-tree implements you have tree traversal algorithms to do this

2505836
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	oracle

i m just wondering if i have an asp.net web application either webforms or asp.net-mvc is there any situation where doing stuff asynchronously would make sense

2505946

put	get
but after i put the controllers out i got the above error .so i commented out all the code but i still get the same error

2506111
hash	md5
while i don t know for what purpose you want to use a hash algorithm i d like to say that .some collision have been found for md5 .so it might be less secure well we probably can t say broken since those collision are hard to compute

2506127
controllers	routes
what would be the best way to organize routes for this controllers

2506134
textchanged	textbox
create a filterchanged event in user-controls which will be raised on textchanged event of inner textbox

and since you ve implements inotifypropertychanged any time you set activecollection its current value will be rendering with the appropriate templates

2506149
32-bit	64bit
windows 64bit have different configuration for 32-bit apps and 64bit apps just look for odbc.ini string in registry

2506149
python	java
i think java is not the best language to change something in windows registry but with java you can create .reg text file that can be import by regedit.exe or you can use other language like python with win32 extensions active python has it by default

2506156
postgresql	mysql
i don t remember which versioning of sqlite it was but i learned the lesson that if you want to have reliable concurrent writes to sqlite then you better use some other database like mysql or postgresql

2506402
linux	bsd
a large numbers of linux programs can be compiled on bsd systemdd however they are not the same operating systemd

2506402
linux	bsd
linux and bsd are technically not binary compatible

2506402
linux	bsd
these days bsd ships with an abi application binary interface for linux which will translation linux sys-calls on-the-fly much how wine operates

2506402
linux	bsd
this will allow you to run linux elf binaries on bsd systemd with a small performance penalty

2506403
stax	sax
you could take a look at the somewhat simpler pull api called stax instead of using sax event based

2506421

as for the directory-structure you may find this wikipedia entry on the filesystems hierarchy standards useful

2508762
wicket	spring
i used the wicket + spring + jpa archetypes

2508785
filtering	sorting
the advantage of the list would be that you get sorting and filtering out of the box

2508791
any	set
this is usually caused by a fatal-error ie syntax-error that causes the scripting to abort before any of the code is execute before display_errors can be set through ini_set at runtime

2508795
libjpeg	libpng	libtiff	libpng	libtiff	libjpeg
there are open-source libs for the main formats that you can look at for guidance libpng libjpeg libtiff

2508804
contains	set	contains	elements
this alone would cause the dots to flow under the text .so to nullify that effect the text itself is then wrapped in a span where the background-color is set to match the color of the background of the contains elements

2508807
tiff	png
but you ll hit the wall on a compressed format like png tiff or jpeg

2508807
libjpeg	libpng	libtiff	libpng	libtiff	libjpeg
google libpng libtiff and libjpeg to find them

2508809
output	mode
this will force python in to unbuffered mode which will cause all output to be printed instantaneously

2508818
debugging	trace
is it possible to make some debugging trace like with printf with glsl

2508823
firefox	safari
most browsers safari firefox have good traffic analyzer tools

2508838
instances	private
as josh pointed out if these variables are only used inside a single instances of the class then you should just make them private or protected members of that class and be done with it

2508854
getter	setter
you should generally use accessor methods getter and setter and keep your internal variables private

2508864
value	field
after an edit during submit the templates field will call extractionvaluesfromcell and recover an ibindabletemplates from which it will extraction a dictionary and then pull the value s out of it adding them to it s own dictionary which eventually gets turned into the upload data

2508878
msdeploy	msbuild
you are probably going to have a hard time getting msbuild itself to do this but the ideal tool to use in your situation is the web-deployment tool aka msdeploy

2508911
double	int
the intel fpu is 80bits internally floats are 32 and double 64 .so converting to float double to reload as an int will lose .some bits of precision

2508913
exception-handling	error-handling
.so you d need to explicit catch the exception-handling and generally clutter your code with error-handling

2508914
sql-server	oracle
any jdbc db web servce flat-file pojos via a scripted datasource xml native db drivers oracle sql-server etc...

2508923
global-assembly-cache	gac
just a general points perhaps off the topic of your question about copying dlls though the global-assembly-cache gac comes with different challenges .

2508933
reference-type	generics
it s fine with int but not okay with int - java generics only work with reference-type basically

2508952
average	median
during our pilot and initial rollout each of our thousands of mobile-devices were sending back timing and usage data and we used the average median and standard-deviations of the time taken to fine-tune the configuration of our tasks .when the task was allowed to run how long it was allowed to run what value were used in the progress-bar display etc

2508961
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
you don t need to do anything special in your itemscontrol itemtemplate itemcontainerstyle other than use this panels as itemshost

2508969
put	get
i have .some height and weight data i want to train my nn .so that if i put in .some weight then i should get correct height as a output

2508970
put	get
my final goal is to collect data returned by selected query into an csv file and put csv file at an ftp location from where client can get it

2508979
any	set
css3 has a proposed writing-mode attributes that can be set to tb-lr write text from top to bottom write line from left to right but i don t know if any browsers support it yet .so its not .something to rely on

2508995
implements	abstract
note that if you don t like the idea of the jobdoerattribute you can also implements it as abstract properties on the abstract jobdoer class

2509003
.net	wcf
in .net this can be handled using wcf or .net-remoting

2509012
entity-framework	ado.net
the ado.net team promise that persistent ignorant object will be supported in the .net 4.0 versioning of entity-framework

2509025
primitive-types	reference-type
in which case should you use primitive-types int or reference-type int

2509046
primitive	int
since java does something called autoboxing and auto-unboxing you should use the primitive types int in most cases because of less overhead

2509049
primitive	int
i would choose the types over primitive int over int .when i write methods signature maps collections data object that get passed around

2509051
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
is there a good database-design tool can generator sql scripting to create database tables in major database oracle mysql sql-server sybase without any changes

2509066
directory	folder
basically i have a file directory code-snippets that lets me browse through my htmltemplates folder and am able to selected an html document

2509076
contains	any
from a usability points of view good browsers will flag any http page contains http components as insecure

2509077
data-members	instances
data-members field can t be readonly because wcf dont serialization object as-is and every time befor deserialization starts creates new object instances using default-constructor

2509077
value	field
dispatchers use setter to set field value after deserialization

2509077
value	field
to make them realy readonly make the server logic validation thiss field value

2509079
configuration	environment
if what you need are just some configuration parameters you might want to include them as environment variables in erlang terms in one of your erlang applications

2509079
getter	setter
if what you need is something more complex you might want to create a gen_server process that answer to all configuration request getter and setter methods

2509080
double	int
rather than calling them complex types you d be best served thinking int double etc

2509080
double	int
as classes and int double etc

2509080
double	int	primitive	int
if you re doing any types of sophisticated math the class-based numeric representation like int and double will be cumbersome and slow you down - many math operations can only be done with primitive

2509080
double	int
on the other hand if you re trying to put your numbers into collections like lists and maps those collections can only contains object - and thus you must use or convert to classes like int and double

2509080
primitive	int
personally i use primitive .whenever i can get away with it and only convert to the class representations like int .when it s time to do input or output and the transport required those representations

2509084
hierarchicaldatatemplate	binding
change your itemsource binding from binding to binding children and change your hierarchicaldatatemplate to just a datatemplate

2509101
postgresql	mysql

im trying to fadeout the li elements depending on the current page numbers this numbers is stored in the attributes actualpage of the parent ul and after fadein those li elements whose page matches with the actualpage attributes of the parent ul

2509119
value	field
from reading their api it sounded like specifying a flex value in the layoutconfig was akin to a default but since setting it and my layout work correctly i ve come to believe that it is a required field against which children s flex value are at some points compared to with

2509128
display	width
.when this drop down box is display the width is 100 not 30px can anyone explain why and how to fix this

2509130
value	field
we use logic that required some field value to be the same allows some field value to differ and allows a range to be specified for how different certain field value can be

2509165
versioning	migrate
barring that if you have access to the original code it should be possible to migrate the application to a newer versioning of pb although as terry notes pb8 is out of support and i m not sure if there would be difficulties migrating

2509173
boolean	int
if you want to setattribute to session you have to use object like int boolean string in servlets

2509174
value	field
.when all of the field are 8 bytes wide cancomparebits mistakenly returns true resulting in a bitwise comparison of two different but semantics identical value

2509174
value	field
.when at least one field is not 8 bytes wide cancomparebits returns false and the code proceeds to use reflection to loops over the field and call equalss for each value which correctly treats -0.0 as equals to 0.0

2509179
any	set
be aware however that any environment variables that you set in .profile will only take effect within your terminal session and will not affect any gui applications

2509179
any	set
if you use apache maven2 to building your artifact you can have it automatically downloading as well as bundle any thirdparty dependencies and set the classpath appropriately for your artifact

2509206
contains	any
you can use absolutely any file to add assembly-level attributes but assemblyinfo seems to be the best choice since it already contains several assembly-level attributes

2509244
wsdualhttpbinding	basichttpbinding
the service that works uses a basichttpbinding with streaming and the two which don t work use wsdualhttpbinding

2509269
children	nodes
because the specific templates matches only nodes that are children of the top elements

2509280
reflection	runtime
they are ignore at runtime unless reflection is used to explicit query for the attributes

2509305
switching	screens	portrait	screens
all my .app is in landscape mode .in some points i switching to a screens with tab bar controllers but it s been placed like in portrait mode.i subclassing the uitabbarcontrollers and overrides the methods shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation to return yes always but because the .app is already in landscape this methods is not being called

2509314
textbox	button
even though the sendtoback isn t really required here it is insurance that your user-controls with the okay button and textbox for an error messages are placed behind the individual controls you have assign to each tabpage

2509336
profiling	trace
i ve used the sql profiling to generator a trace file and tuning advisor to take that trace file and provide some recommendations on db updates

2509349
.when	ready
i just want to show text please wait while .app is searching for satellite and show ready .when we found and connect to satellite

2509376
bots	api
the search api does allow specifying a -to parameter in the search and replies to all bots could be aggregate in a search such as -to bot1 or -to bot2...

2509376
bots	api
this could possibly work by creating a daemons process that connect to the streaming api and tracking all references to the bots s named

2509408
return-type	arguments
either return-type or arguments

2509408
attributes	properties
.so most likely what you really want is just add the attributes to your items properties

.when dealing with a collections of key-value pairs is there any difference between using its add methods and directly assign it

2509415
selected	textbox
this is actually being stored in an asp.net textbox and being used as a control parameter for a selected on the gridview

2509430
attributes	properties
there are two parts to attributes their code and their constructor arguments and properties data

2509430
attributes	properties
and the constructor and the properties setter are called using the attributes data in the metadata

2509439
children	tree
the program meanders around the tree taking all sorts of complex paths following links to parent and children

2509439
children	tree	children	nodes
the program will also grow the tree add new nodes and modify the parent children links of other nodes accordingly the tree never shrinks

2509439
children	nodes
but then i have a problem- if i m adding a new nodes then i may want to lock the nodes s parent .so that i can adjust its list of children

2509450
multiplication	addition
this is not a join set multiplication this is a union set addition

2509477
python	perl
.so if any of my scripting gets to messy i know i have to use perl or python

2509477
shell	bash
otoh bash or any other unix shell for that matter suck on doing simple complex math and are really hard to debugging

2509478
primitive	int
as a rules of thumb i will use a primitive such as int unless i have to use a class that wrap a primitive

2509482
sql-server	oracle
obvious answers are oracle sql-server etc but it might just be your database structure isn t right

2509483
arrays	loops
i have a foreach loops waiting to iterate through it but it coughs up an invalid arguments error as if the page doesn t know the value it s working with is an arrays despite printing showing simply arrays

2509499
constructor	object
to get a pointers to a newly allocated t object and used alloc_.construct to call the constructor

2509526

2509555
gethashcode	equals
first overrides the equals and gethashcode methods in your entity object

2509569
administration	credentials

contains	set
for example if i have the set which contains a super representation of others

2509631
any	set
i am interested to use any technique which would allow me to extraction the words animal which has the most meaningful and accurate representation of the other wordss inside this set

2509650
show	next
if the first grid 13 recording is paged to the second page and then i go down to the second grid 14 recording and page to the next page and the first grid adds a bunch of empty rows to the grid .so it is full to show 10

2509665
populate	row
to return the proper rows for each section you have to checked the indexpath.section attributes to see which logical section the logical row belongs to before you populate the cell

2509673
scriptaculous	jquery
jquery is running in no-conflict due to scriptaculous and cufon is initalising correctly generator ready tags in the markup though still no fonts transformation occur

2509674
debugging	trace
the difference in reliability is debatable but in general i avoid assignments and function-calls in conditional to make it easier to trace through the execution .when necessary even if i never need to debugging it someone else may need to modify the code later

2509689
click	mouse
the user click on the image drag the mouse while the line between the start points and the mouse points is dynamically draw on mouse drag

32-bit	64bit
unfortunately trying to building failed at this points for me because i run a 64bit server and google only release 32-bit tools

2509773
arrays	loops
the last iterator of that loops will assign to which does not exist because defined an arrays of floats from to

2509798
contains	elements
this is because in c++ arrayss are indexed from 0 thus an arrays of 20 elements contains elements indexed from 0 to 19

2509807
show	next
but .when i click on another nav link it does show the next div as expected

2509808
administration	credentials
the credentials i m passing are local administration in the same domain as the machine that hosts the service wrapping the utility

2509832
solaris	linux	solaris	bsd	linux	bsd
if you are looking for reference material you could checkout the vfs layer in linux bsd open solaris ..

2509852
contains	any	contains	sorted
i can see an undocumented configuration option in the tablesorter source code - appender - which allows you to specify a function which takes the table being sorted and a data structure contains the sorted rows to be append to it to achieve the desired reordering but i can t see any options which let you configurationure which rows it looks at .when it s doing the sorting

2509868
children	tree	children	nodes
i have object in a tree i would like to aggregate status information from children nodess and updates parent nodes with aggregate status

2509868

lets say nodes a has children b1 b2 and b1 has c1 c2 c3 as children

2509873
hide	show
then upon every click hide the appropriate div and show what you need

2509880
push	pull	required	checked
you do some work during the day checked it in then pull that work to your home repository or push but that required more work

2509895
children	nodes
you need postorder traversal - first visit the children of a nodes then mark the nodes itself recursively

2509900
hide	next
keep tracking of the last one opened and hide it before showing the next

2509920
exception-handling	try-catch
i know that i ve done the above nested try-catch recently to handle decoding data where two third party libs throw exception-handling on failure to decode try json decode then try base64 decode but my preferences is to have functions return a value which can be checked

2509920
exception-handling	try-catch
it seems like the main risk in nested try-catch is that you also end up catching all the other maybe important exception-handling that might occur

2509929
rhino-mocks	nunit
what would a simple unit test look like to confirm that a certain controllers exists if i am using rhino-mocks nunit and asp.net-mvc 2

2509937
output	cat
this will output cat as ruby allows me to directly access the anonymous arrays created

2510013
any	set
i looked into using a colormatrix or colormap but i couldn t find any way to set all pixels to a specific given color with either approach

2510047
double	int
i am looking for a way to ensure that my textfield jtextfield jformattedtextfield is returning a double or int rather than a string .when i call .gettext

2510050
pixels	line
the best in terms of perf at least option is to use bitmap.lockbits and loops through the pixels data in the scan line setting the rgb value

2510053
void	main
first of all void main should be int main and it should return 0

2510053
void	main
void main there too but honestly you should use int main for standards compliance

2510061
linked-list	arrays
this is even more true for .when you have a family of classes again most likely containers and you want to provide your users with a uniform iterator traversal interface for all of them even if their implementation are very different linked-list versus an arrays

2510077
benchmarking	profiling
these types of benchmarking are very easy to perform using the sql profiling

2510096
subtract	add	subtract	time
of course i could just add a timer on the client and subtract the server process time but that wouldn t be very elegant

2510097
sql-server	mysql
i do not know how to do it with mysql but in sql-server it would be to checked the numbers of rows updatess which is result-of this updates query execution and run the updates again until no rows are updatess

2510114
directory	folder
thatâ s .when a database was considered a directory and each dbase file place inside the directory would appear as a table that exists in a given database thus a database was essentially a folder with files for each table

2510143
any	set
do you know any ideas how to set a default access for the entire model

2510159
order	add
.when i set the gridlayout to the jpanel and then add something it is added subsequently in the text order from left to right from top to bottom

2510210
difference	count
i suggest that if loopss count really is 10 000 as in the original .post that it will make little difference which you use as the whole loops won t even take a fractions of millisecond anyway on a modern cpu

2510211
any	set
the good thing is that in our application there will never be any kind of set get or get next .so no need for snmp walk there are .some very good rea.sons for this that supersede the need for network management elegance

2510211
snmp	mib
i think this is a valid snmp mib definitions but wanted to get some feedback

2510212
arrays	map
transformation is simply replacing the column indexes with compacted indexes .so the idea is to .somehow map arrays to .when process row 5

2510216
scala	java
it s for java but i think it applies to scala as well

2510237
ebnf	bnf
i ve got a bnf and ebnf for a grammar

2510238
sql-server	mysql
using sql-server you need to use a .some funky xml syntax to join the rows back together .so i won t show that code as it doesn t matter but using mysql s group_concat you should be able to concatenation the words rows back together into phrase rows

2510240
textbox	button
outside the grid there is an ok button to save the content of all the textbox

2510240
textbox	button
if user changes text in any one or more of the textbox and without click on the ok button tries to move to a different page numbers of the grid by click on the page numbers he should be prompt for confirmation of save or cancel the changes

2510240
gridview	radgrid
i am using radgrid but i guess this should be applicable to gridview as well

2510244
callback	methods
generally whichever class actually implements the async callback methods is going to be the owner and .so that class should be managing the lifetime

2510262
packets	ping
basically if an assessment is good enough then a ping test icmp echo should be enough to figure out the round-trip time for data packets between a client and a server

2510271
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
also it was necessary to use objectinputstream instead of datainputstream in the getnewmessages methods since the messages was sent by objectoutputstream

2510274
selected	textbox
i m trying to programmatically selected the text in a textbox and focus on it too .so that .when the form is launchd the user only has to start typing and it will replace what is already there

2510289
dictionary	arrays
in others you have to pass an arrays and in others still you can pass an associativity arrays or dictionary and use named value in your query

2510315
duplicates	contains	contains	any
out will contains the duplicates row indic if any

2510339
click	mouse
this becomes an issue .when the user needs to put focus back on that windows requiring a mouse click

firewatir	watir
.when i use watir not firewatir ie.button id ok .click_no_wait

2510360
multiplication	division
in your example using gcc the division with the options -o3 -ffast-math yield the same code as the multiplication without -ffast-math

2510373
selected	checkbox
it should also be noted that i have a selected all checkbox at the top that checked unchecked all of the items in the first clb

2510373
selected	checkbox
the following code partially works until the selected all checkbox is click at which points if other value have been selecteded before selected all is checked the second clb is filled with the correct numbers of corresponding value but only those of the most recently selecteded item of the first clb instead of all of corresponding value of all of the items that were not already selecteded

2510374
value	field
the database has to checked which field are in the table and match against the value anyway

2510379
document	editing
the numbers of users editing the document is small and closed but it needs to be editable by non-technical users

2510379
wordpress	blogs
right now my best guess is wordpress but that seems a lot more geared towards blogging with just a handful of pages than having several pages and probably no blogs

2510390
.when	ready
.when you are ready to release a combined product just pull from the desired tag for each repository and you ll get the full product release

2510414
subtract	formula
use the formula for calculating easter then shift to the previous friday or subtract 2 days details up to you

store it in the session but also put it in the get parameters for the page

2510492
button	popup
if you are just trying to use the microphone and relying on flash to popup the dialog to ask the user for permission flash will open a dialog with two button allow and deny

2510492
radio	click
if you are manually opening the settings panels via security.showsettings you get the panels with allow and deny radio button and the event will fire .when the user click on the radio button not .when they close the panels which is probably of less help to you

2510494
streamwriter	gzipstream
just create a streamwriter wrapping your gzipstream and write text to it

2510499
margins	padding
in the example above both button would be the width necessary to hold save as... plus the margins and padding

2510517
for-loop	arrays
just use a simple for-loop for arrays and nodelist

2510521
constructor	object
i have object which create other child object within their constructor passing this .so the child can save a pointers back to its parent

2510523
for-loop	arrays	constructor	object	arguments	default
you can create a default tant object by calling the constructor with no input arguments and replicate it with repmat to initializer your arrays before entering your for-loop

2510523
arrays	loops
then you can loops over the arrays overwriting each default object with a new one

2510536
checkbox	textbox
i would need to remove ## value textbox and also updates them with different value if needed be in the textbox checkbox selectbox

2510545
dialog	pop-up
start the change-password dialog enter some information close the pop-up

2510568

.when	ready
i have created a second quicksearch function which is called .when the page is loaded and changed the bind to something else but it won t work on load or ready

2510617
.net	wcf	authentication	login
if you use web-service instead wcf service you can still use standards .net membership to enforce authentication and login session behavior

2510617
logout	login
this also simulates a login session and calling formsauthentication.signout in a web methods like this logout authcookie would

2510622
hash	tie
you can either implements a more complex data structure that handles some of the order for you or put some more sorting logic in your display instead of just looping or load up a module to support order hash such as tie hash indexed

2510622
hash	tie
i would expect the tie hash indexed implementation to look like .so

an alternative to inherited is for class test to contains a private pointers to an instances of class student as long as class student is not an abstract-class

2511823
arrays	map
normally i d suggest a map or lookup arrays or maybe even some hybrid lookup monster assuming that you re optimizing for speed or code-size rather than reliability of course but it is worth noting that the new versioning of gcc are smart enough to replace switching case assignments like this to lookup tables

2511825
continuous-integration	teamcity

children	nodes
.some nodes don t have children .so you re passing a null invalid arguments to the foreach just like the warning says

2511847
children	nodes
to avoid the warnings you need to checked if the current nodes has any children

shell	bash
history from within vim you restart a new bash shell that has its own history which is-empty which is why you just see the screens as it looked .when you started vim it s outputting all the line in its history which is a grand total of zero

2512434
shell	bash
note that if you read in the line from .bash_history you re only getting the history from bash shell which have completed ie you typed exit and the terminal windows closed

2512461
google-chrome	firefox
i did a test in google-chrome and firefox google-chrome with no extension firefox with a dozen

2512461
google-chrome	firefox
.so i wonder the benchmarking is al.so influenced by the install extensions or google-chrome is really .so much higher than firefox in performance

2512465
versioning	upgrade
if you do that you won t have to get the gem or the plugins again unless you want to upgrade it to a newer versioning

2512480
jnaerator	jna
there is a project called jnaerator which should be able to generator the jna source from igraph s header-files but i have never tried it and chances are that the results will still need some manual tweak

2512484
contains	elements
you really should be using an elements that is a block level elements like div or p one that is designed to contains multiple line of text or inline elementss

2512484
margins	padding
as you ll have noticed you can use a br tag inside a span and it will cause a line break however inline elements don t play well with margins padding etc

2512486
.war	jar
second running package will invoke jar jar or .war .war etc depending on the value of the project checked the introduction to the lifecycle for more details on this

2512486
.war	jar
that s one of the big strength of maven you don t need to know if the project is a jar a .war an ejb etc and to run the appropriate goal to package it

2512497
flash-cs4	swc
i am trying to understand what is going on in a swc that i am import from flash-cs4 into flex builder 3

2512507
double	int
you ll need to subclassing .so you can implements the validation function and possibly the fixup function for your particular case since the two validation include with qt only cover int and double

2512534
double-quotes	single-quotes
also in php single-quotes are faster then double-quotes as php doesn t have to process the contents of thr string looking for varname etc

2512550
click	mouse
i am using the following code to show a jquery-ui-dialog .when the mouse is click on the map

2512552
base-class	inherited
the way i implements this was on a base-class that every page inherited

2512552
mvcsitemapprovider	sitemap
i have looked at the mvcsitemapprovider but that does not work off a database it needs a sitemap file

2512585
rar	zip	buffering	streaming
or perhaps not a whole streaming class perhaps just an interface you design which reads data from a streaming zip rar into a specified buffering and page can specify its internal vector as the buffering

2512614
subclassing	nsobject
defined your utility methods in a category on nsobject or related subclassing of nsobject

2512640
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
raphael.js is a lightweight rendering tool for javascript mit licensed which works in firefox safari google-chrome and ie6+

2512640
svg	vml
it uses svg for the first 3 and vml for ie but the api is identical across browsers and very sweet

2512642
maya	mel
nothing more advanced exists which is just as well because mel is just a terrible terrible language it really isnt good for anything other than quick hacks in maya s scripting editor

2512649
openoffice-calc	spreadsheet
if you don t need want to read it back in via python you could also just manually format it as tab delimited or something and load that file into the spreadsheet .app of your choice openoffice-calc is fantastic

2512672
java-3d	jogl
if you want really smooth correct antialiasing preview i would suggest using a 3d libs like java-3d o jogl

2512686
buffering	capture
and after your output ends close the output buffering capture its contents and write them to a file

2512698
environment	building
thus they re designed for potential copy and paste situations and i don t want people who might end up using this as part of the building blocks of their environment to feel like the license would prohibit that derivative work ie

2512740
perl	c++
of late i have been getting opportunities that required perl unix with knowledge of c++ shell scripting expertise

2512768
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome developer-tools and firebug in firefox it seems like webpage has a cs and rf tags before the first table

2512768
attributes	properties
i usually do that entering manually cmd in a watch windows and navigating using the treeview to see properties attributes and childs

2512788
any	set
regarding changing of stack it definitely helps you long term in your career both from extra experience available to offer to next employer to expanded job set you can qualify for to increased programming iq due to knowing different pointss of view perl for all its scripting origins .when used properly has both oo and very nice functional paradigms available but this points applies to any new technology

2512788
perl	c++
however you must be willing to put extra effort in to actually learn new stack environment language and to learn to do things new way don t write c++ code in perl - especially for that last benefit to kick in

2512788
perl	c++
please note environment there - the jump involves for example learning new debuggers and debugging techniques for me the hardest thing about c++ development after switching from perl .so far is probably doing effective gdb debugging after being used to flexibility power of perl debugger

2512788
perl	c++
personally i had to make this jump twice - from c developer to perl and 10 years later perl to c++

2512788
perl	c++
while the absolute # of jobs is likely less than that of java or c++ ones a high quality developer will always be in demand and there s plenty of companies including or may be especially in financial industry heavily using serious perl development as opposed to simple administration scripting

2512811
implements	extends
to make life simpler you could extends the tuples class .so you don t have to implements your own __getitem__

2512840
unsafe	out
you cannot even write silverlight assemblies with c++ and no silverlight code can be marked unsafe i admit there might be a hack way around this limitation out there

2512840
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
my team chose silverlight since it runs on firefox ie and soon google-chrome and unofficially opera on windows and firefox and safari on mac

2512841
required	checked
i m almost positive it doesn t required any built code libs .so just checked in all of the headers that get include seems like the way to go

2512842

signals	sigint
i have a signals that blocks sigint and basically says sorry you can t quit. n

2512853
printf	scanf
.when this occurs during a scanf scanf takes in the printf as input

2512853
printf	scanf
how can i do a printf that will cause scanf to basically hit the enter key automatically

2512853
printf	scanf
i just want to programatically finish that scanf with a printf or something else

2512869
vbscript	jscript
classic asp uses vbscript or jscript

2512875
libcrypto	openssl
you can however statically link openssl and libcrypto

2512878
http	ssl
if you are transporting sensitive data and need to protect it you should use http over ssl also known as http

2512879
compatibility	platform
the latter is much faster for any substantial subset of boost but it will likely include many files you don t need compatibility headers for platform your program doesn t support

2512927
value	field
it looks like the form is sending zero-length value for unanswered field and the database is rejecting those value

2512931
exception-handling	try-catch
i m a student in my first c++ programming class and i m working on a project where we have to create multiple custom exception-handling classes and then in one of our event handler use a try-catch block to handle them appropriately

2512937
updating	updates
the service required that i provide the original entity along with the updates entity .when updating data

2512937
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in webforms i would have used viewstate but from what i have read that is out for asp.net-mvc

2512960
perl	c++
i myself move from a c++ environment into a mostly perl one with strong unix all the while i actually know next to no windows api programming .net vb-basic etc

2512962
value	field
last but not least initialization of a readonly field can be deferred until the execution of a constructor which means that it even though it can only be written to once it does not always have to be initializer with the exact same value

2512975
stripes	spring
currently spring web asp.net-mvc struts2 and stripes seem to be fairly popular

2512978
duplicates	elements
i want to delete not duplicates elements of each vector but any vectors that are the exact same as another

2512987
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
int in particular is particularly prone to that old 8bit and 16-bit architectures invariably had 16-bit int s while today s 32-bit and 64bit ones invariably use 32-bit int s

2512991
button	popup
in last three months this voting function performed .so ugly that i got only less than 8 000 votes from more than 4 50 000 vistors.i think the problem is .when the users try to close their browsers the onbeforeunload properties popup a comfirm box which covered my voting box while most users click the ok button which means close comfirming is done as a habit..so my question is how can i control the comfirming box made by onbeforeunload myself

2513005
double	int
i finally found the problem with the date-difference .when i was saving it to a db i used timeintervalsince1970 with an double value but .when populating it and setting it to a datepicker i was using a int column types

2513006
value	field
my suggestion would be to enclose all field value in quotes

2513006
value	field
bulk insert might then allow the carriage returns within a field value

2513020
attributes	properties
if i want to add functionality to all the classes say i want to add an attributes to all the properties

2513024
xsd	xml
here is my first attempt at validation xml with xsd

2513024
xsd	xml
the xsd located in schema config.xsd relative to the xml file to be validation

2513042
httpd.conf	.htaccess
the plan is to do this in apache httpd.conf or .htaccess using something like this

2513050
signals	sigint
i have a signals that blocks sigint and basically says sorry you can t quit. n

2513050
signals	sigint
what you might have is a signals handler that is set to respond to sigint

2513050
sigaction	signals
further you might be using the signals function to set the handler - but you should be aiming to use the pthreads standards sigaction function to set the handler instead

2513050
printf	scanf
.when this occurs during a scanf scanf takes in the printf as input

2513050
printf	scanf
this is confused...you are presumably implying that the output from a printf statement presumably the one that says you can t quit is then being seen as input to the scanf

2513050
printf	scanf
how can i do a printf that will cause scanf to basically hit the enter key automatically

2513050
printf	scanf
i just want to programatically finish that scanf with a printf or something else

2513050
sigaction	signals
this is what indicates that you are using signals to set your signals handler and not sigaction

2513050
signals	sigint
by default the received signals sigint is blocked for the duraction and the signals handler remains in effect

2513066
java.util.date	date-format
if you are just trying to parsing a string into a java.util.date look at date-format fastdate-format apache thread safe or joda time

2513070
textbox	button
now in my asp.net website there is a textbox and a button

2513070
textbox	button
i filled a telephone numbers in the textbox and on button click i want that a call get connect to the no

2513094
export	csv
export some data from mysql to a csv file using fastercsv

2513114
cout	cin
no this is an explicit way to say cin and cout are declare without actually defining them

2513116
cout	cin
in this case you into your .cpp file and because cin and cout are declare as extern the compiler will let you use them without complaining

2513117
cout	cin	defined	declare
the statements in your example declare rather than defined cin and cout

2513150
wamp	php
i haven t used wamp yet but i ve never had a problem using xampp and it s a pretty easy-install to get a complete php environment using apache

2513155
32-bit	64bit
1 limb 32-bit 2 limbs 64bit 3 limbs 96bits ...so on

2513155
16-bit	8bit
cant we create an int variables of size 8bit or 16-bit

2513156
bazaar	cvs	version-control	cvs	version-control	bazaar
we are planning to use bazaar as a version-control tool over cvs and svn

2513160
webforms	asp.net
lookup the various threads on asp.net webforms vs mcv to see which suits your project needs the best

2513166
controllers	routes
you can run rake routes from the command-line and it will printing a list of all routes generator from routes.rb including named routes the url and http-request types that triggers them and which controllers action they run

2513191
enumerator	any
ienumerator don t defined any field for the size of the enumerator the extension methods count tries to do this for you by iterator through the whole collections and telling you how many items it finds

2513203
fltk	gtk
there are many graphical toolkits for linux such as gtk qt wxwidgets and fltk

2513217
stdin	tail
rm file.txt will remove reference from disk before subshell will open it for write for tail but contents will be still available through opened descriptor which is passed to cat until it will close stdin

2513227
post-increment	pre-increment
i have never seen the usecase for pre-increment and post-increment in actual code

2513244
version-control	bazaar
our most senior developer is a big fan of version-control systemd and he install bazaar .so we could try it for a while before migrating new project to it - unfortunately we had to stop in the middle because the maven-release-plugins doesn t integrated very well with bazaar and the plugins is more important than using bazaar instead of maven now

2513244
.when	ready
one of the major pains that i found .when working in a team are conflicting changes and also the fact that you should not commit a change to the central repository until the change is actually ready to be committed

2513244
.when	ready
with bazaar i can commit my changes locally and then .when i am ready to do .so i can commit all those changes back to the central repository

2513251
radio	click
and .when user click on link button it will create an arrays of radio button

2513252
value	field
a better way to retrieve field value is with fieldcache.for example if the field value is string you can retrieve value as follows

2513252
value	field
you can now lookup this arrays with lucene document id to retrieve value of that field for the given document

2513254
.war	jar
with this addition the mep will treat your project as a normals jar or .war project and generator the expected eclipse configuration for it

2513264
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome etc all will behave the same way

2513275
python	c++
my c++ application embed the python interpreter but seems to be having some trouble .when it shuts down

2513313
radio-button	selected
i m trying to sort recording in the gridview right after a radio-button is selected

2513314
radio	click
i am not sure if i am following a 100 but if you don t want to do a postback then your going to need to write some javascript or use a framework like jquery to generator radio button .when the user click the link button plus you probably don t want to use a link button then as it will try to always cause a postback or you will need to stop the postback from happening

2513320
flash-cs4	away3d
i m using flash-cs4 and the latest stable release from away3d

2513323
directory	folder
you re going to need some sort of server side code to generator a list of files folder within a directory

2513353
uitabbarcontroller	uitabbaritem
i have created a uitabbar and uitabbaritem without uitabbarcontroller on it now i want to know how to place an action onclientclick of the uitabbaritem.what is the methods i should use for action on uitabbaritem

2513429
directory	folder
i have a list box and i want to add a folder directory to that which is at the specified location i have used the code

2513437
mocking	tdd
tdd isn t mocking

2513437
mocking	tdd
sometimes good tdd employs mocks but plenty of tdd can be done without mocks and if you re confronting too much mocking with your tdd perhaps you need to go old school and write simpler tests

2513441
click	mouse
not by click and dragging using mouse

2513447
any	set
i just found out that i loose any reference to the session arrays if i create a new view and try to set a session variables in the controllers

2513461
any	set
if that won t work you should be able to ignore the dovecot files but beware that you ll likely lose information like which messages are read and any flags set on the messages

2513463
tuples	any
the namedtuples should not required any more memory according to the documentation than a regular tuples since they don t have a per instances dictionary

2513464
treeview	listview
or you could use a treeview listview and building your own control that will suite best what you need

2513465
bots	api
the tracking predicates for the streaming api would actually be useful because if you follow your bots s userid you ll get all the messages made by your botss and all the other messages that mention your botss usernames including replies

2513497
directory	folder
ensure that the internet user has read directory browse write permissions to the configure user files folder

2513503
culture	french
it must remain as per en-us format even if the culture is set to fr-ca i.e .when rest of the contents are in french the date-format should still be in english en-us

2513505
linux	aix
methods has to be platform independent as its going to be used on windows os x linux and aix

2513532
xcopy	cmd
it dint work.though separate programs i.e g xcopy h d y e and g cmd c cd d d d winzip32.exe -min -a d a works

2513567
progress-bar	progress
i have used progress-bar in my application..my application is working fine but the progress-bar is blank..it does not show the working progress what is wrong

2513578
imageview	textview
but it will recognize it if it is ontop of textview s or imageview s

2513585
dictionary	arrays
it allows the persistent of primitive-types dictionary hash object arrays etc across the wire

2513597
constructor	object
the situation can be fixed by using static factory methods first construct the plain object then register the listener instead of public constructor doing all the work

2513597
constructor	object
publishinging an object from within its constructor can publishing an incompletely construct object

2513598
restart	reload
hup reload without restart

2513624
constructor	object
before the object s constructor is

2513624
value	field
in other words your listener could end up seeing final field with their default value if it examines the object in another thread

2513633
e-commerce	product
if you don t need to calculate shipping costs or taxes based on where the person lives and you don t need to be able to have thousands of product i d just skip the whole e-commerce thing and use paypal it s free

2513633
postdata	request
if you really want to use a full featured e-commerce systemd you can definitely connect to them through http request to get postdata but that will be a long-term undertaking

2513637
.when	ready
.when we are ready to roll some changes out we just merge appropriate revision into release trunk and deploy

2513641
contains	any
this must work because i can t see how delphi would streaming this any other way itself it can t possibly read the string contents - it s just working on the basis that the stringlist is possibly broken into line and each line is delimited in the dfm with an opening and closing and the whole stringlist contents themselves are contains within a pair of brackets

2513657
put	get
if anyone still cares i ve put together a little command-line util based on the answers here which you can get at

2513662
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i ve tried adding both a crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml to the service library-project but it doesn t help

2513710
bazaar	cvs	version-control	cvs	version-control	bazaar
the major difference with cvs or svn is that bazaar is a dvcs distribute version-control systemd not a vcs

2513758
web-inf	maven
you will have to make sure that main.jar ends up in web-inf .lib if you re not using maven you can do this in eclipse by marking you webapp as dependent on the project that creates the main.jar via the project properties

2513763
constructor	object
in terms of performance c++ call a constructor for each object in the arrays

2513766
stderr	stdout
a simple way to redirect stdout and stderr using the logging module is here

2513775
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
the collectionviewsource provides sorting grouping and filtering

2513783
realloc	alloca	realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free	alloca	free	alloca	malloc
you can use the c family of memory allocation functions in c++ too both the standards malloc and free realloc to enlarge shring arrays and alloca to allocate memory on stack

2513798
triggers	insert
does triggers in mysql for audit log slows down the main updates insert or delete process

2513799
virtual-memory	paging
if you re getting close to the physical memory limit on the machines you re running the monte carlo simulation on it s a good way to decrease performance because the disk might well start to thrash .when the virtual-memory systemd needs to start paging a lot

2513817
perl	c++
why not use your c++ expertise .when working with perl where appropriate

2513817
perl	c++
it s quite possible to extends perl with c and c++

2513817
perl	c++
i m not suggesting that you write all your code in c++ just because you know it and than put a thin perl layer on top of course

2513841
constructor	private
updates the essential question is that is this guaranteed to actually call the private constructor above in which case there would be the barrier where intended and everything would be safe or is it possible that the private constructor gets inline into the public one as an optimization to save one memory barrier in which case there wouldn t be a barrier until in the end of the public constructor

2513849
save-as	corrupt
i have tried with save-as d ourtest.pdf and it says the file has been corrupt or incorrectly decode

2513881
multicast	packets
fundementally this works however the multicast packets all have ttl set to 1

2513884
checkbox	textbox
your bl should never bother about n numbers of textbox and checkbox

2513885
principles	srp
such a factory is essentially a service-locator and i consider it an anti-patterns because it obscures your dependencies and make it very easy to violate the single responsibility principles srp

2513886
comma	words
usually a named will only contains words characters and sometimes with a comma and period if they are a jr sr etc and an address will only contains alphanumeric characters unless they abbreviate in which case a period might be include

2513894
constructor	object
an object is considered to be completely initializer .when its constructor finishes

2513897
cos	sin
has anyone seen this weird value while handling sin cos tan acos

2513913
panels	grid
the layout manager arranges the children of a panels but the grid is the child

2513915
directory	folder
perform a full checkout of your root directory and create the tags .lib folder

2513921
constructor	private
edit after the comment that suggested the compiler inlining the private constructor i had not thought of that optimization chances are that the code will be unsafe

2513921
constructor	object
the .solution is fragile in that .some other day you or .some other programmer may need to add another member to the object and may forget that the chaining constructor is a concurrency trick and may decide to initializer the field in the public constructor and in doing .so will add a hard to detection potential data race in your application .so i would try to avoid that construct

2513921
constructor	private
since the constructor is private the compiler does have enough information to know that it is only called from other constructor and that is enough information to determine that the synchronized mechanism is not necessary in the internal constructor.

2513935
instance-variables	local-variables
for me the reason comes down to this this the purpose of local-variables is different than the purpose of instance-variables

2513951
triggers	insert
if the triggers are set on insert and delete operations yes it does it s only a matter of how much

2513958
selected	button	highlight	selected
i am trying to write an add-in to powerpoint that does basically one thing give users a button somewhere to click once they click on it the currently selected textfield should get syntax highlight

2513960

2513984
uninstaller	inno-setup
unfortunately inno-setup will not create such a logfile .when i uninstaller the application

2513984
uninstaller	inno-setup
is there a flag possibility to force inno-setup to also create an uninstaller logfile

2514005
implements	abstract
the class is abstract and implements no methods

2514005
implements	abstract
it is abstract but it does implements all methods in the three interfaces

but realistically iirc most 3rd party vcl components are coded in delphi pascal

2514024
delphi	c++
given that i am slightly more comfortable with c++ is there any compelling reason to choose delphi over bcb or is this just a case of how long my particular piece of string is

2514041
spring-roo	jsr

that s equals to 60 fps frame per second but without depending on the main application frame-rate

2514113
delphi	c++
go c++ or better drop delphi bcb and go c# it s cheaper and easier to market even if arguably not as efficient

2514134
tuples	set
since tuples derive ord using lexicographic comparison they can be insert to the set

2514148

is there any single-sign-on sso or centralized authentication server cas open source project using asp.net c#

2514153
large-files	readfile
as a side note if you are doing any database access and are offering large-files for downloading you must close the database connection before the readfile as the connection will be considered open for the entire duration even if it is a ten minute downloading and it s very easy to hit the max connection limit in this situation

2514161
asp.net-mvc	webforms
achieving this with webforms was straight forwarding as everything was wrapped in updatepanel but what is the best approach to achieve this using asp.net-mvc

2514161
postback	ajax
or how that is going to postback via ajax

2514161
webforms	asp.net
i assume doing this using jquery is more code than asp.net webforms but there is just more code to see doing a view-source on a page

2514175
value	field
the code which takes the field s value is

2514192
silverlight	wpf
i m currently creating an asp.net-mvc application that will likely to expand to include a silverlight wpf and possible windows-phone all using the same data

instances	self
.so within an instances methods self is the instances within a class methods self is the class and within a class definition like in your example self is the class.

2514342
abstract	extends
after reading from different .sources it seems to me that besides what tvanfos.son said the rea.son to have the concrete decorator extends an abstract or more general decorator is .so that we don t repeat the delegation code over and over again

2514342
abstract	extends	implements	extends	implements	abstract
in your case your abstract decorator would extends the decoree and would implements the same interface as the decoree delegation forwarding all methods call to it

2514343

2514411
triggers	insert
defined a triggers on insert that updates the value in the table yuck

2514414
derived-class	base-class
this is an error because although you at runtime have a pointers to a derived-class the compiler at compile-time .when it emits the error messages doesn t know this - it just knows you have a pointers to the base-class and the base-class doesn t have this function

2514415

istream	std
the compiler must know that istream is a types and with the extern keyword you are telling it that std cin exists and is of that types

2514489
treeview	listview
edit just though of something it might be better to create a custom listview treeview by simply deriving the built-in .net ones and then overrides the wndproc routine in the new controls to always exclude wm_mousehover

2514505

the .net does not contains any 3rd party dlls

2514679
contains	any
if you want it to wrap to the next line it ll automatically do this as per the specifications above unless there is a long piece of non-breakable text that doesn t contains any whitespace

2514698
lighting	shading
my guess would be that .when the compiler unrolls loops with your actual lighting shading calculations the compiled shader uses more arithmetic instruction slots than the ps_2_0 .profile supports max 64 instructions

it s always possible for an implementation to contains subtle bugs that ruin all this see openssh key generator bug but i don t think there s any concrete reason to worry about java uuids s randomness

2514778
calloc	malloc
compare against calloc instead but also note that malloc and calloc are both available from c++ in the unlikely event that they do prove measurably faster

2514780

however maybe a better user experience integration is to not highlight the urls inline but to gather them into an arrays behind the scenes and present a disclosure button as the cell s accessory view

2515008
macros	let
you don t say how the actual using code looks like but you should be able to let named and overload-resolution work for you from a logging macros

2515012
rhino-mocks	moq
this article contains a very good explanation on how to test async methods using rhino-mocks - i m sure it can be easily adapted to use moq instead

2515017
keyboard	mouse
after a bit of research it looks like the office-communicator client makes use of a simple audit of keyboard and mouse activity to determine the presence of a user

2515038
input-field	selected	value	field
i want to use the autocomplete plugins for jquery to populate not one but two field .when selected one of the autocomplete value - the named of a band is entered in the #band input-field but the band url if exists should also automatically be added to the #url input-field .when selected the band named

i have a launchd daemons that runs in the login context of a mac osx 10.6 machine

2515314
launchd	daemons
however i need to control the precise arguments to the agent application very carefully which is why i cannot use a launchd agent like i have for the daemons

2515314
daemons	systemd
i m aware that this is not the recommended apple way of doing things but i don t really have a choice in the matter - the design of the daemons application is pretty inflexible it has to run across many different systemd

2515314
carbon	cocoa
i m using c++ carbon cocoa

2515321
value	field
you can also attach to rowdatabound and access the current bound object via e.row.dataitem and then use this to supply the value to a cell via e.row.cells and supply a value to the text properties for a bound field or use findcontrol to supply it to a control

2515353

2515457
delphi	c++
if you like the c++ language then i d use the bcb if you like a language with a larger userbase and where support is easier to find in that language i d choose delphi

2515457
delphi	c++
especially .when the language you know is c++ and in particular .when you have worked with delphi before as well

2515469
python	java
possibly you need parent.key i think it depends whether you re in python or java

windows-mobile	windows-ce
i have not had much success trying to convert windows-mobile project to windows-ce ones even by notepad-level changes to the csprj file

2515475
revision	svn
what we do is that we have a commonassemblyinfo.cs file and we plug the svn revision numbers into that using an msbuild scripting

2515475
revision	svn
every project in our solution has a link to the common file and is then compiled meaning that the assemblies are versioned on compilation with the svn revision numbers it also means all dependent libs we have written are also versioned

2515475
revision	svn
my favourite solution is the way we do it but you can t do that in mercurial as the changeset info is not purely numeric like the svn revision numbers is

2515558
selected	textbox
you click on the textbox the calendar popup you selected a date and that gets display in the textbox

2515561
constructor	object
some suggestions from effective-java idiom#1 providing static factory provides the following advantages over creating object from constructor

2515562
innodb	myisam
will be slightly less efficient in innodb and of same efficiency in myisam if you have an index on flagged id

rijndaelmanaged	aes
in a nutshell viewstate data in your web form is encrypted using the rijndaelmanaged implementation of the aes algorithm which is not fips compliant

2515687
pointers	stack
this will push the 32-bit extended base pointers register on stack stack-pointers esp is subtract by four then the value of ebp is copy-paste to the location that stack-pointers points to

2515687
pointers	stack
the purpose of copying stack-pointers to the base pointers is to create a stack frame an area on stack where a subroutine can store local data

2515689
getter	setter
if not you should bind the value to a variables and use getter and setter like .so

2515700
duplicates	elements
text characters from the last of the floated elements are sometimes duplicates below the last float

2515716
pointers	stack
ebp is the base pointers for your stack frame

2515716
pointers	stack
it s the pointers used by the c runtime to access local-variables and parameters on stack

2515716
g++	gcc
here s some typical function prologue code generator by gcc g++ to be precise first the c++ source

2515717
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
an int is guaranteed to have at least 16-bit and on 32-bit machines it is usually a safe assumption to have 32-bit but your code may fail as soon as you move to a 64bit machine

2515722
selected	button
currently any action on the page such as entering data or selected an item from a dropdownlistfor amongst other things call a single function called processevent - this function handles all logic and either enables or disables the ok button

2515739
contains	set
you can set it to contains browsableattribute.no .so that the properties grid will display all non-browsable members

2515743
attributes	properties
a visual designer typically display in the properties windows those members that either have no browsable attributes or are marked with the browsableattributes constructor s browsable parameter set to true

2515743
design-time	designer
members marked with the browsableattribute constructor s browsable parameter set to false are not appropriate for design-time editing and therefore are not display in a visual designer

2515759
any	set
in cases like that i tend to make it as simple as possible by for example enabling the button by default and if any other conditional is set or not disable it

2515773
arrays	map
will a javascript string arrays not map correct to a string list in c#

2515800

2515814
python	perl
i know python and a bunch of other languages and i think it might be nice to learn perl even if it seems that most of the people is doing it the other way around

2515814
python	perl
because i don t think it ll be worth the effort if i end up programming python in perl

2515814
python	perl
are there many problems application areas where it s actually more convenient to use perl rather than python

2515831
json	xml
i want to suggest you to use json instead of xml as it is lightweight data-interchange

2515846
any	set
as long as it is not going to try to set up any thing that will affect the rest of your program you will be fine

2515867
contains	any
there s spaces allocated for it on stack but the spaces isn t initializer to any value .so it contains anything that happened to be there before

2515883
triggers	insert
i put the code to assemble the key in a triggers which is called whenever a row is insert

2515886
base-class	inherited
nowadays i work more in c# and java where you can only inherited one base-class but implements any numbers of interfaces did i get the terminology right

object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2517913
put	get
httpclient document get .post put delete head etc.

2517917
rollback	commit
we have a caching which i would like to put .some transactional scoping around .so that any process have to explicit commit the changes it wants to do to the caching object and make it possible to rollback any changes .when the process fails halfway as well

asp.net-mvc	webforms
i only worked with webforms but i have time to learn asp.net-mvc if is the best option.

2517929
hash	tie
you can do it with tie hash sorted

2517943
contains	any
just be careful that append does not contains any characters sed might interpreter

2517944
user-interface	splash-screen
i know that multithreading is a no-no on user-interface pieces however seeing how the splash-screen is a fairly autonomous piece of the application is it possible to .somehow mitigate its performance hit by throw it one .some other thread perhaps in the way google-chrome does it .so that the important pieces of the application can actually get going

2517947
any	set
i haven t found any similar function where i can set encoding types

2517960
installshield	uninstaller
you would have to locate the installshield uninstaller registry key which will reside under either hkey_local_machine software windows currentversion uninstaller or hkey_current_user software windows currentversion uninstaller and then execute its uninstallerstring value

2517960
uninstaller	inno-setup
once that is done delete the registry key it is not possible to reuse the same key with inno-setup since it will always append _is1 to your app-id to generator the uninstaller registry key named

2517964
google-chrome	firefox
thus it will always work in firefox i can t test google-chrome at the moment.

2517984
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this article has good arguments why you would want to use asp.net-mvc over webforms

2518001
positioning	slider
the output that i need is an arrays defining the load case numbers the rows and a numbers of loading parameters the itensity and positioning of the loads which are controlled by the slider

2518006
attributes	properties
i have an attributes declare on properties

2518006
attributes	properties
how can i get the properties named inside the attributes

2518010
attributes	properties
the attributes has no meaning of knowing to what properties class it is applied

2518010
attributes	properties
in general attributess alone are useless they are just metadata decorating your classes there must be .something reading them at runtime and inorder to read an attributes you already have a reference to the properties this attributes is applied to .so you already know the properties named

2518025
slideshow	loading
what i plan to do is to make the page look like it had a fancy slideshow going on upon loading and while idle and i wanted to achieve that by capitalizing on the existing hover styling behavior of the main page links instead of using another scripting to create the effect from scratch

2518026
rendering	redraw
the retained mode rendering of wpf makes drawing redraw custom charts and images tricky to make performant especially .when those drawings contains a lot of object

2518028
versioning	upgrade
what you need to think about a bit is versioning the assemblies and how you re going to deal with upgrade to application a .when application b required parts of application a

2518031
put	get
put all declarations at the top then call some function which will get things going and have your functions below

2518047
selected	checkbox
if a checkbox is not selected then the browser doesn t send anything back for that field

2518047
hidden-field	checkbox
ruby-on-rails gets around this by including a hidden-field with the same named as the checkbox

2518050
groovy	java
also since groovy is a superset of java you can write straight up java in its interactive shell as well

2518063
codeigniter	kohana
one of the nice things about codeigniter is the excellent documentation .when compared to kohana

2518063
codeigniter	kohana
then again kohana is an improved fork of codeigniter

2518077
cvs	git
here s the problem though the client is converting from cvs and most of the developers are still getting used to git

2518080
hashmap	arrays
one of the other developers have suggested the use of an in memory database instead of doing it the standards way our other systemd behaves which is to use concurrent hashmap queue arrays and other object to store the graphical object and handling them safely with locks if necessary

2518096
splash-screen	splash
just ensure you load and show the splash form first and then continue to load your .app while the user is looking at the pretty splash-screen

2518096
splash-screen	splash
alternative if you prefer not to pass the splash to the mainform maybe it seems inelegant then subscribe to the mainform s load event and close the splash-screen there

2518107
user-interface	look-and-feel
i ve got a user-interface with a fairly standards look-and-feel

2518115

carbon	cocoa
is there any carbon cocoa c api available on macs that i can use to enumerate process

2518170
32-bit	64bit
something to do with jvm being 32-bit in a 64bit windows

2518181
onkeydown	onkeyup	key-events	onkeyup	key-events	onkeydown
the currently key-events listener provided by android onkeyup onkeydown are as.sociated to an activity .so they are notified of the key-events if the activity s views are focused

2518186
contains	set
but .when it reaches the dropbox selectedindexchange postback event the dropbox contains nodes id s to use to set the rootnodes variables the context contains mostly null properties

2518232
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie 8 google-chrome etc

2518233
radio-button	textbox
i suppose that you want to enable the textbox next to the radio-button also

2518233
radio-button	textbox
you might want to start with one radio-button checked and the other textbox disabled

2518244
put	get
the backslash is an escape character .so after you need to put 2 in a row to get the actual character to show up in your string

2518245
carbon	cocoa
as suggested by dave getbsdprocesslist can be used if you re looking for daemons and not just carbon cocoa process

2518253
sql-server	mysql
i am trying to copy data from my mysql table to sql-server using php

2518254
pointers	stack
i have a piece of c++ code compiled with g++ under a gnu linux environment that load a function pointers how it does that doesn t matter pushes some arguments onto stack with some inline-assembly and then call that function the code is like

2518267
vbscript	jscript
checkout this .post a jscript vbscript regex lookahead bug

2518274
decrement	increment
another form using double parentheses at the beginning of the statement instead of the form allows you to include spaces around the equals sign or do post- or pre- increment or decrement and additional assignment operations

2518274
parentheses	let
if you do help it says that the double parentheses is equivalent to let expression .

2518274
parentheses	operators	double	int
if a variables is declare as an int you don t need to use either form of double parentheses you can omit the dollar-sign from the variables named as in the double-parentheses forms but you can t add spaces around operators

2518274
shell	bash
regarding the use of bc for floating-point arithmetic it or something similar is required .when using bash and many other shell

2518274
perl	awk	python	perl
in addition to bc you can use dc awk python perl and others from within a bash scripting

2518277
google-docs	spreadsheet
currently we re doing a lot of design collaboration on google-docs spreadsheet

2518299
nvidia	ati
more useful with nvidia than ati for example

2518314
required	checked
instead it negotiates a normals ssl connection checked to see if the resource required client certificates and if it does it then initiates a new ssl handshake that request a client certificate

2518341
windows-xp	windows
we run all our tests in windows 7 .so i can t accurately compare it to execution on windows-xp but i would not describe what we are seeing as execution extremely slowly

2518352
contains	any
if you want to work with other numeric types you can use matrix.generics module which contains functionality for working with generics matrix contains any types

2518355
hashtable	set	hashtable	sorted
a hash_set would be implements by a hashtable which has mostly o 1 operations whereas a set is implements by a tree of some sort avl red black etc. which have o log n operations but are in sorted order

2518356
contains	any
that can be difficult to fix if the form contains any nested containers controls like panels user-controls or groupbox

2518358
unordered	iterator
the unordered in the named stresses that iterator it will produce results in no particular order

2518359
streamreader	streamwriter
everything is working fine at the moment but i have been using streamreader and streamwriter to communication between both client and server

2518373
value	field
you can use that together with a bit of reflection code to copy all field value from the source object to the destination

2518399
hashtable	set
the main issue here is that many people use stl set thinking it is a hashtable with lookup of o 1 which it isn t and doesn t have

2518399
data-structures	tree
other then that read about binary tree vs hashtable to get a better idea of the data-structures

2518403
xsd	xml
how to validation in xsd the xml nodes value against itâ s neighbor xml nodes value

2518433
configuration	environment
i can also set the package to get it s configuration path from an environment variables and that approach works as well

2518436
constructor	object
if you have a c++ program it can initializer variables and object through functions and constructor before main is entered

2518440
constructor	object
static object with constructor will get called before main - they can die

2518441
jquery	.post
read this jquery blog .post

2518460
constructor	object
global and static object in a c++ program will have their constructor called before the first statement in main is execute .so a bug in one of the constructor can cause a crash

2518465
google-chrome	firefox
however if i set display none in the .mp_modalpopup css class and then use .blockui to make it visible in ie 8 the dialogue centering itself vertically but aligns left with half of the dialogue off the page and in google-chrome and firefox the dialogue is not visible at all but blockui is working because the page greys out

2518501
putchar	gets
on the other hand since running is visible only to the translational unit being static by the time the compiler gets to the end of the file it should be able to determine that there is no opportunity for putchar to access it assuming that s the case and the compiler could go back and fix up the pessimization in the while-loop

2518537
python	c++
i m trying to make thrift server python and client c++

2518539
border-layout	miglayout
all of my attempts to move the blacknotepanel over by an arbitrary width -- wrapping it a border-layout a miglayout etc

2518546
directory	folder
assuming that a newly create java viewmodel uses the environment variables to get the temporary folder location it is not viewmodel s fault that the directory are coming mangled

2518548
textchanged	textbox
the viewmodel initialization was triggers inotifypropertychanged up to the bound control which in turn caused the textbox s textchanged event to fire

2518553
contains	any
any time you install a correctly designed libs it also contains a packagename.pc file which is copy-paste in a directory where pkg-config can find it

2518553
pkg-config	poppler	pkg-config	cairo	poppler	cairo
have you also install pkg-config as well as poppler and cairo

2518574
python	lua
python and even lua required more resources than the target likely to have

2518576
execute	declare
it depends what you mean by before main but if you mean before any of your code in main is actually execute then i can think of one example if you declare a large arrays as a local variables in main and the size of this arrays exceeds the available stack spaces then you may well get a stack overflow on entry to main before the first line of code execute

2518593
display	height	display	width
basically make .thumbnail not-floated and display inline-block apply width height borders etc. and on #thumbnails_container use white-space nowrap

2518602
any	set
are there any other methods tricks i can use to explicit set the playing positioning of a currently playing song

2518604
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade the versioning to use jquery out of the box with cakephp 1.3 and get rid of prototype javascript libs

2518610
perl	php
stuff like perl php etc. not the stuff you see in the applications directory.

2518617
macros	basic
try to write some excel macros or use any other software with some basic built-in scripting-language to automate certain tasks

2518625
order	add
i would add that you probably want to sort the cursor used for loops which will ensure that the columns are always in the same order

2518632
markup	xhtml
use the xhtml code validation at the w3c markup validation service to look at your site and pages

2518636
google-chrome	opera
i can downloading it with google-chrome and opera .so probably it s a browser related issue

2518644
wordpress	shortcode
the shortcode you add via the wordpress editor is

2518649
parsing	comma
notice how 2 345.67 was truncated down to just 2 - the comma turns your nice numbers into a string and now you re bound by string- int parsing rules which drops everything after the first non-numeric character in the string

2518658
webserver	security
the special configuration may not have been application specific but was required for security settings compatibility with the webserver being used etc

2518694
revision	svn
those developers still have a very file-centric vision instead of a repository-centric approach based on revision for svn or commit for git

2518704
sql-server-express	sql-server
if you switching to odbc oledb ado i suggest you to upgrade to sql-server-express sql-server compact edition or other free database software

2518721
asp.net-mvc	webforms
we are moving from webforms to asp.net-mvc and and using a lot of jquery

2518729
32-bit	64bit	arguments	default
while it shouldn t be much of a problem to call a function pointers with the appropriate arguments in inline-assembly i don t think recoding this naively in x64 will help you because the calling conventions to be used are very probably different default for 32-bit and 64bit linux are definitely different

2518731
carbon	cocoa
i d do a backup of the workspace first because sometimes a different eclipse versioning can mess up your workspace - in this case where you just switching from carbon to cocoa it s not very likely though

2518735
duplicates	contains
edit len a could be incorrect if a contains duplicates

2518745
shadowbox	jquery
how do i bind initializer shadowbox to content loaded by jquery using ajax

2518752
packaging	building
have the building make an packaging artifact dep rpm or something

2518763
textbox	button
no not that one the one you rejected with two editable textbox and no button where entry in one textbox automatically updates whatâ s in the other

2518767
value	field
send the output of the logicalequals to one mapping functoid second input for mapping will be the value of your field and the output of your logicalnot to another same second input

2518777
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc doesn t provide the clientscriptmanager control like webforms does

2518784
jndi	jdbc
this is the mechanism necessary to provide jdbc pool and object over jndi since that required it to be in the tomcat classloader

2518784
.war	jar
it may also be used to allow multiple deployment to shared the same single jar file instead of having it in each .war file

2518790
javascript	dom
you have a javascript variables called pthumb and a dom elements with the id pthumb and ie s javascript engine could be trying to use the wrong one

2518799
any	set
the second one determines what value should be set in the destination if any

2518800
arrays	loops
basically it initializer the beginning of the arrays using a conventional loops and then revert to buffer.blockcopy which should be as fast as you can get using a managed call

2518829
user-controls	ascx
i need to make ajax call from ascx user-controls page

2518829
user-controls	ascx
and as ascx user-controls may not contains pagemethods what other options do i have

2518837
subclassing	inherited
my line of thought is this since class b is nested inside class a and is private and there is no other class inheriting from class b it should be safe to seal it because it can t be inherited outside class a not even by subclassing of a

2518849
pure-virtual	base-class
for example in a class where you might reasonably use the default implementation for any methods but you still don t want people to initializer the base-class you can mark only the destructor as pure-virtual

2518850
contains	elements
the regular expression used validation a proper x12 interchange envelope and assures that all segments within the file contains at least a one character named elements

2518855
pure-virtual	subclassing
the idea is that the pure-virtual function is given an implementation while at the same time forcing subclassing to overrides that implementation

2518855
subclassing	base-class
the subclassing may invoke the base-class function to provide some default behavior

2518875
32-bit	64bit
calling-convention has almost certainly changed from 32-bit to 64bit

2518890
c++	lua
i am currently developing a plugin-based system.in c++ which provides a lua scripting interface for which i chose to use luabind

2518890
defined	declare
the problem i have though is that functions defined in the derived-class which were not declare at all in the parent class cannot be used

2518890
virtual-functions	base-class
virtual-functions defined in the base-class such as start above work fine and calling them from lua on the new object runs the respective redefined code from the pluginexample class

2518901
key-value	key
the most straight forwarding way to do this is to first convent the key-value into a virtual key code

2518904
xsd	xml
i am trying to use dom4j to validation the xml at using the xsd from that same page

2518904
xsd	xml
the xsd and xml file are in the same directory

2518933
put	get
just got to put in a little elbow grease to get what you want my friend

2518934
display	width
i m trying to get the text within a legend tag to wrap using the typical solution of wrapping the text in the legend with a span and setting the width and display block

2518938
selected	button	radio	click
.when every the toolbar item gets show or click on i.e if the user selected on the the radio button the methods updateelements uielements elements map parameters gets called

2518942
right-align	floating
i want the layout .so all the labelss line up on the left with the labels text right-align and the input box all lined up floating to the left

2518961
text-align	width
the easiest way is to float elements and set a width and text-align right for labels

2519003
ostringstream	std
you got it right but you can use std ostringstream to create your char arrays

2519007
qtablewidget	qtableview	qabstractitemmodel	qtableview	qabstractitemmodel	qtablewidget
but qt implements uses asp.net-mvc for a lot of the classes look at qtableview as opposed to qtablewidget qtableview uses qabstractitemmodel as the model class and there is a pretty strict separation between the view and the model

2519019
webforms	asp.net
on my current project i m stuck in an asp.net 2.0 webforms anti-patterns quagmire

2519019
data-access	nhibernate
use linq-to-nhibernate for data-access but perhaps avoid the repository-pattern ayende on his blog indicates that it s an unnecessary layer with nhibernate

2519059
setinterval	settimeout
2 javascript settimeout and setinterval are not very reliable .when it comes to timing

2519059
setinterval	settimeout
you might want to printing out the time that your sound.play call is being made to see whether the irregularities are due to the irregularities in settimeout setinterval

2519077
show	next
i have a photo gallery webpage where a single elements s src is changed on a click with javascript to show the next image mdash

2519117
.when	ready
you should get started by learning the basic of the os s sdk and then .when ready move to the ipad s sdk

2519122
contains	set
my site is set up with next and prev button on the right and left sides respectively and as you roll over either of the hit areas around the button a sprite fade in which contains a textfield that describe the next page

2519132
json	xml
an alternative to json that would also work is the cfwddx tag which can convert the object into xml

2519132
json	xml
but json is probably better because it s not as verbose as the xml generator by cfwddx

2519133
environment	building
java has the advantage that it s pretty easy for the environment to building an entire parsing tree while you are typing

2519134
protected	public
the c++ compiler is not allowed to reorder variables within a visibility block public protected etc

2519136
protected	public
what is the difference between public private protected in ruby

2519166
http	ssl
i m already setup to use facebook s ssl javascript file instead of the http file

2519168
ienumerator	ienumerable
this class is only visible as an ienumerable of t readonly properties and it saves me an additional class that wrap ienumerator of t

2519176
triggers	insert
i simply want to be able to call a methods from a different class file .when a certain step is triggers in the code in that class file inorder to insert a string in the listbox

2519194
repository	entity
you would usually have one repository for every aggregate root a ddd term meaning a parent entity but not in the traditional inherited way of your domain

2519195
protected	public
as for what private protected and public mean

2519196
32-bit	16-bit
endianness is a properties of multibyte variables such as 16-bit and 32-bit int

2519204
value	field
al.so field value are strings .so is_int will fail unless you explicit convert the result field to an int

2519214
.net	wcf
i m having a problem with a wcf .net 3.5 site using elmah on iis 7.5

2519214
httphandler	httpmodule
then i added the elmah stuff to httphandler and httpmodule in system.web yeah i know this is not for 7.5

2519268
svnkit	jgit
checkout svnkit for java and subversion or jgit for java and git

2519276
svnkit	svn
here you have a pure java svn .lib svnkit it can be used by eclipse svn integration .so it should be fairly stable

2519280
stderr	stdout	stderr	stdio	stdout	stdio
in addition standards c programs have already created the stdio files stdin stdout and stderr

2519280
malloc	free
this implies that they are also free ed which implies that they and their buffering were malloc ed which can fail

2519309
spring	seam
i don t want to add all classes in persistence.xml i want seam to scan my jars and auto detection entities as done by spring

2519335
constructor	object
.when i call session.get id the sql runs correctly against the simpleparentobject table and a parentonly object is initializer as i can step through the constructor but only a null comes back rather than the initializer parentonly object

2519352
constructor	object
inorder to create the sort object use the sort sortfield constructor

2519358
strstr	strchr
i present string.h s strstr and strchr as probably the best examples of unnecessary brevity

2519364
private-members	instances
but i can t immediately prove that for instances if airplane fly uses private-members then it required considerable redesign to do it this way and arguably crtp is a bit high-powered for the beginner anyway

2519369
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
i m looking at plain sql search through the searchlogic gem or full-text-search using sphinx and the thinking-sphinx gem

2519369
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
sphinx is very fast and thinking-sphinx is cool but it adds complexity a daemons to maintain crontab to maintain the index

2519376
contains	set
the set is defined in the document fontname ctan info fontname and definitely does contains lighting

2519394
triggers	insert
further doing something in a triggers will only work for insert updates delete

2519402
textbox	button
is there any wysiwyg editor already available where you can add custom button with custom text being added to the textbox as a result

2519404
keyboard	mouse
or how are you starting the program via mouse or keyboard

2519413
arguments	default
ret old_establish_connection arguments # call the default

2519419
maven	sbt
hudson display very helpful information based on the results in the surefire report but i would much prefer using sbt to maven

2519422
postgresql	vertica
vertica is based on postgresql especially language-wise

2519422
postgresql	vertica
i haven t found an instances where a postgresql time function does not work in vertica

2519427
textmate	vim
i ve move from textmate to vim lately and am really liking the switching

2519433
arguments	default
there is no methods available by default in the bcl but it s straight forwarding to write an extension methods which has the same behavior arguments checked omitted for brevity

2519437
any	set
something that would not be a problem if you set the source without any extra options

2519452
32-bit	64bit
porting code from 32-bit to 64bit

2519452
32-bit	64bit
these all generator warnings now because strlen returns size_t which is 64bit and int is still 32-bit

2519467
hide	show
.when you click the login button right now it is just wired to show and hide divs and not actually log anyone in the login panels is hidden and the welcome panels is show but it is right up against the top header until you click the page again

2519467
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
naturally it is only happening in ie and does not occur in firefox google-chrome and safari

2519480
triggers	insert
put a triggers on table_a that does this on insert

2519488
hash	md5
my concern is suppose i generator an md5 hash using a native python string object like this

2519488
hash	md5
then i take a hex versioning of that md5 hash using

2519488
hash	md5
and send the messages md5 hash via a network let s say a jms messages or a http-request

2519488
hash	md5
then i generator an md5 hash using java like this using the commons codec libs

2519489
python	perl
a good interpreted-language like perl or python

2519489
python	perl
i d suggest assembly preferably on a virtualized systemd because bad things happen and python or perl

2519490
value	field
therefore ttttttfftt will be broken out into 10 separate field each with a single bit value

2519498

using document-ready will fire immediately .when include after the document is already ready but is explicit binding to the windows s load event which has already fired

2519505
arrays	loops
one way of doing this would just be to use a simple loops to generator a new arrays overwriting any existing value for a given date as you go along

2519518
formatting	printing
if you want to use the built-in f# formatting engine and avoid implements the same thing yourself you can use f# printing functions such as printfn

2519518
formatting	printing
you can give it a format specifier to printing an entire list using f# formatting or printing just a first few elements which happens .when you call tostring

2519532
python	tcl
elmer enables one to run python code from tcl

2519541

our company has been generator pdfs from php using pdflib for many years but have not upgrade since versioning 5

2519550
python	tcl
you can take a look at python tkinter standards module it is a binding to tk user-interface but that execute tcl code in the background

2519554
append	input
you have a filesources.keys input list and the output appears to be simply append the compute results to aggregateddefinitions

2519554
append	input
in each thread process the input as before but append the output to a local list object not the final shared aggregateddefinitions list

2519554
append	input
thread 1 that received the first half of the input produces list1 and should be append to the master list before the output of thread2 s results

attributes	properties
i ve got a viewmodel for adding a user with properties email passwd confirmpasswd with required attributes on all properties

2519569
32-bit	64bit
a cast to int is nearly safe assuming 32-bit int on your 64bit platform which seems reasonable because a string is unlikely to be more than 2 31 bytes long

2519596
hide	next
you should be able to put a spinner image next to the field with the autocomplete and hide it initially

2519596
hide	show
then use the callback functions to hide show it

2519596
hide	show
then use the search option to show the spinner and open to hide it

2519637

controllers	routes
you ll want to make sure this is near the end of your routes .so it doesn t overrides access to your other controllers

2519769
pthreads	fork
the pthreads fork systemd call has no native equivalent on windows .so cygwin is forced to emulate it in a very inefficient way

2519772
getattr	setattr
note that because myproperties is a properties getattr and setattr will be invoking the properties s __get__ and __set__ methods rather than actually mocking out the properties itself

2519778
csv	xml
i fear that the ipersistentstate interface is too coupled to using xml - if i were to switching to using a database or csv or whatever it would probably be necessary to change it

2519801

2519880
freebsd	linux
i m writing a high-loaded daemons that should be run on the freebsd 8.0 and on linux as well

2519884
triggers	insert
i suppose that it should be possible to use triggers to keep the two tables in sync any insert in table_orig causes an insert in table_new and perhaps vice versa too and same for the deletes

2519900
32-bit	64bit
32-bit and 64bit windows uses virtual-memory which means the address you use in your program is not the same as the address actually sent over the bus to the memory chip

2519900
linux	bsd
instead windows and i should add that other oses such as linux macos bsd etc. do roughly the same sets up some tables that say in essence .when the program uses an address in this range use that range of physical addresses

2519902
value	field
.when i try to persistent an object with this field set to a non-unique value i get an exception-handling as expected .when the transactional managed by the ejb containers commit

2519914
32-bit	64bit
however .when i run it on my 64bit machine it runs in 32-bit

2519914
32-bit	64bit
however any cpu -- which is what i want -- loads in 32-bit even though the machine it s running on perfectly supports 64bit

2519914
32-bit	64bit
i don t mind this because in the code we do not load the 32-bit managed ++ assembly if we re running in 64bit mode

2519914
32-bit	x86
could it be that the building figures that since there is a 32-bit assembly in here it should mark the launchd process in this case a windows service assembly as x86

2519920
contains	any
.so long as the first two rules are met the named may contains any of a-z0-9_

2519984
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
as far as i know most if not all processor will hold results for a words words multiplication in a double words -- meaning an 8bit 8bit is stored in a 16-bit register s on an 8bit processor a 32-bit 32-bit operation is stored in a 64bit register s on a 32-bit machine

2519991

2519996
multiplication	division
numeric stability is no accident it required some care in deciding .when and how to do division and multiplication

2519999
32-bit	16-bit
note that if you do the calculation with two 16-bit short variables on a machine with a 32-bit int then you will generally get the right answer 29297 because the intermediate value is an int and only gets truncated back to short at the end

2520007
widget	button
i am trying to create a button widget for dojox.grid

2520010
multiplication	division
one is to write small muldiv function in assembly that does the multiplication preserving the high words then the division on that and finally returns the value to c .when it s been reduced back into range

2520013
elevated-privileges	windows
on windows 2008 though this operation required elevated-privileges

hide	show
whe i show the tooltip and leave the mouse in the same place the show and hide repeat forever

2520168
macros	let
i could tell you that any macros assembler will let you write code that would rip through your data but seriously are you going to spend months writing assembly just to save a few seconds of cpu time

2520190
credentials	account
as far as i can see you need to use nsworkspace for that but using nsworkspace to launchd programs results in them being launchdd with your account s credentials instead of your command-line program s credentials

or its php equivalent for a b being unsigned-integers you are trying to unsigned-integer add similarly for subtract multiplying divide ..

2520271
silverlight	wpf	put	get
if you are doing this in the silverlight part you should put the xml file in an embedded-resource and access it as a streaming get it with assembly.getmanifestresourcestreaming or as a resource a la wpf not an embedded-resource and access it with the package part syntax

2520272
administration	enterprise
the code-access-security policy tool enables users and administration to modify security policy for the machine policy level the user policy level and the enterprise policy level

#pragma ms_struct reset goes back to the default layout

2520457
fxcop	nant
to make this work i use nant s execute task to delegation to the local non-installed copy of fxcop which does the work

2520469
fxcop	nant
it s a bit simpler to invoke fxcop directly from nant without using the nantcontrib task by using nant s execute task

2520469
fxcop	nant
for implementation details have a look at an article i wrote about integration nant and fxcop

2520474
union-all	union
you can also do a triggers with something like this this is actually overkill - you can make it cleaner by assuming the database is already in a valid state - union instead of union-all etc

2520476
bison	yacc
lex yacc or flex bison spring to mind but personally i would always reach for antlr

2520571
paster	pylons
paster create -t pylons test

2520577
controllers	routes
if you re feeling masochistic you could also write a custom route class that returns false if the controllers exists and handles all routes if not

2520585
revision	svn
replacing folder with svn delete svn copy will keep the revision history

2520585
revision	svn
for files that were newly added during the merge their revision history can be copy-paste over from the branch if you used the svn copy cmd

but if you need to whip up something not too slow and it s ok to take longer perl and python could be ok

2520691
ip-address	hostname
if you are using the hostname and the hostname resolves to an ip-address on your machine it should work

2520691
installation	environment
i m not 100 sure whether you used a virtualenv for your pylons installation but it is generally a good idea since you don t need to alter the server s environment to install new libs

2520698

there is a setting in the file menu option to save data with report and if you export that data you will get the report formatted data ie certain field

2520722
initializer	setter
all i really need is the endpoint string in my refactored class which can be initializer via a setter

2520784
python	java
most modern languages java c# python 3.x have distinct types for byte arrays and string where strings always have the same internal encoding utf-16 or utf-32 and you have to call an encode function if you want to convert it to an arrays of bytes in a specific encoding

2520790
sql-server	oracle
both sql-server and oracle support change-data-capture

2520790
sql-server	oracle
also there are third party product which will do replication between sql-server and oracle

if it knows it doesn t need reentrancy it can pass in the address of a static struct or arrays -- in either case a malloc free pair gets saved and such savings do mount up

2520798
environment	building
environment .when building the

2520799
innodb	myisam
i think this is what you want if using innodb recommended although you can simplify this with myisam

2520828
malloc	free
returning pointers usually leads to memory-leaks as it s easier to forget to free your pointers if you didn t malloc ed them

2520829
put	get
.when your requiremens get more complex or you decide to add features you will be glad that you put time into a relational-database design

2520842
xlsx	xls
is there a cheap 50 free .net libs that would give me better control over the excel file that would allow me to create both xls and xlsx files with out having excel install

2520851
version-control	git
learning a version-control systemd git for the first time would take about a week or two

2520865
operators	keyword
the only difference between operators new and-operators new is that the first is called by usage of keyword new and the other by keyword new

2520868
decrement	increment

google-chrome	firefox
everything is working like charm with google-chrome and firefox but ie is not able detection or recognize the cookies inside the confirmation scripting on step-3

2520925
output	mode
if you have binary-mode output for whatever reason and you want to write a platform-specific line break then i think you might have to do it indirectly write n to a text streaming and then examine it in binary mode to see what you get

2520948
32-bit	64bit
if you use 32-bit and 64bit browsers interchangeably you will need to install both 32-bit and 64bit java inorder to have the java plugins for both browsers

2520955
textures	fbo
if i initializer an fbo without binding a rendering buffering or a textures to it what happens .when i draw to it nothing

2520955
textures	fbo
do i need to associate a rendering target renderbuffer or textures to have an fbo do anything

2520957
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit and 64bit versioning of ie have separate add-on lists because 32-bit add-on cannot be loaded in 64bit ie and vice-versa .so you should make sure that java appears on both lists

2520957
32-bit	64bit
in general you can tell whether a process is 32-bit or 64bit by right-click the application in task manager and click go to process

build-system	cmake
that said i would encourage you to take a look at the cmake build-system since it is much simpler more likely to be portable and harder to shoot yourself in the foot

2521091
build-system	cmake
while it is possible to make very portable makefile it is also very easy to use platform- and even configuration-specific elements to your makefile which makes cmake a better choice of build-system

2521096

does dhcp use arp only as communication-protocol to assign an ip-address

2521109

it s only .when using surrogates like identity or guids or sequences that this becomes an issue since it is tempting to make the identity the pk after all it is unique by definition

2521109
restrict	shared
having the user_id in all tables does allow you to do certain things in views to enhance security defense in depth giving you a little bit of defensive-programming in sql-server you can restrict all access through inline table valued function - essentially parameterized views - which required the .app to specify user_id on every table access and also allows you to easily scale out to multiple databases by forklifting everything on shared key

2521113
panels	grid
since your overlay panels only does a drawrect ... for the grid the mouse is currently over how does the previous grid get reset

2521113
panels	grid
i would guess .when you repaint your overlay panels it is not opaque to the mapgrid would have to repaint the entire grid first before you redraw the grid on your overlay panels

2521183
division	modulo
rsa is a math operation that returns the remainder of a division the modulo

2521183
aes	rsa
we use rsa to encrypt only a short session key and then use that session key in a fast symmetric-keyed block cypher like aes to encrypt the actual data

2521183
aes	rsa
bundle the public key id from the certificate the rsa encrypted session key and the aes encrypted data together

2521183
private-key	rsa
use this private-key in rsa to decrypt the session key

this explains in detail the step that log4j takes to locate the logging configuration

2522240
any	set
the problem is within your .net configuration configuration is placed at many location there is first machine.configuration then there is configuration specific to the user and then there is configuration specific to the application now if your company s domain controllers has set your configuration wrongly or any of your machine.configuration or such configuration have wrong information that can lead to this problem

current versioning of flash can play .mov m4v and m4a provided they are only of types containsers mp4 all quicktime files have litle variation of mp4 but if they contains pure video of types h.264 and audio of aac only then flash can play it

2522382
h.264	mp4
checkout flash-video you will need converter to convert them to correct mp4 format since .mov etc formats can have video as h.264 and audio as mp3 flash will not play it flash only needs video as h.264 and audio as aac only

double	int
you will be performing int math on these value before storing them in your double

2524431
deployment	migrating
migrating data from an existing application of one deployment to the other gets more interesting and i have no experience with that unfortunately but clean deployment of one versus the other should be pretty simple

2524437
constructor	object
my guess is that it is because the constructor would have create the .profile object and .so even though the object is-empty it show me edit button instead of create

2524440
asp.net-mvc	webforms
also these seamlessly integrated with both webforms and asp.net-mvc

2524454
contains	set

2524457
qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview
qabstractitemmodel qabstractitemview for example qlistview qtreeview and .so one

2524459
crypt	hash
1 you can use symmetric encryption instead of hash crypt function is hash - in this way you would have possibility to decrypt it

2524460
deep-copy	object
.so .when the object is first loaded i create a deep-copy using serialization deserialization and save the copy to a separate field

2524514
selected	checkbox
if the checkbox is selected the object behind the corresponding row should be set in the bean

2524541
show	next
your issue will be that the activity indicator will not be display because it will only be show on the next pass-through the run loops - by which time you will have done everything you need to

2524546
.net	wcf
iâ m working on an application which has been designed using n-tire application architecture .the application was developed in the .net platform utilizing c# vb.net framework 3.5 dataset wcf asp.net updatepanel javascript josn 3rd party tools

for manytomany changing entity collections types hashset set won t affect the mapping to bag .it only works for hasmany

2524695
implements	final
other shortcuts that i use often are shift + insert to generator code such as equals and hashcode or a constructor to initializer my final variables ctrl + i and ctrl + o to implements overrides methods alt + enter to fix a compilation error warning a code inspector suggestion

2524705
temporary	copy
it can eliminate reading its value it can eliminate need to create a temporary copy it can eliminate the variables itself this is especially true for the numeric constants

2524706
itextsharp	acrobat
are you certain that .when you retrieve the image in itextsharp it is the exact same image that you retrieve .when you are in acrobat

2524711
account	api
rackspace is the cheapest i ve found 2 month that still offers api access even if you only have a few account .so that s why i m using them but for employees they want .some of the google features and their free up to 50 employees

2524723
any	set
but with extension methods dosomething could be defined anywhere - and worse the definition depends on the set of using statements in the code file and bring in potentially many classes into the mix any one of which could hosts the implementation of dosomething

2524748
selected	checkbox
performing actions on selected rows selected using a checkbox

2524751
value	field
tsv is the timestamp value field

2524754
exception-handling	try-catch
and you ll find the very few cases where your own try-catch blocks might be able to recover from the exception-handling

2524755
triggers	insert
.when the triggers is functioning correctly the updates will get called automatically after an insert .so all you have to do is run

2524760
checkbox	button
i have a checkbox with id terms and a submit button in my form with class registration

2524760
checkbox	button
i would like the submit button to be disabled initially and then to be toggle on and off whenever the user toggle on and off the terms checkbox

2524760
button	popup
i would also like to have a confirmation dialog popup .when the submit button is click and that if it is confirmed the submit button will be disabled again to prevent duplicates click

2524783
firefox	opera
this works for me in firefox and opera the whitespace is all over the place in ie

2524785
value	field
however - i need to generator xml based of the data in mysql and send it to customer - there soap service required the field in question to have 0 or 1 as the value of this field

2524813
tostring	equals
the danger i think microsoft wants to avoid here is people writing a ton of extension methods that redefine equals and tostring

2524819
connection-pooling	pool
if you are using connection-pooling and you use the exact same connection-string the next time you open the connection it should use a connection from the connection pool and be a lot quicker

2524826
decrement	increment
if you leave the methods the stack-pointer is automatically decrement or increment depending on the specific implementation

2524842
depth-buffer	lighting
.so i assume that it s not possible to use lighting correctly without a depth-buffer

2524852
value	field
in my templates i show a list of all the value for a particular field

2524860
default-value	arguments
however .when you call the function normalize with only one arguments the variables indic and index are bound to a default-value of nil .so aref complains that it s getting invalid argumentss

2524860
function-call	inline	inlining	inline
in the second place if you do have a problem with function-call overhead you should declare the functions in question inline instead of using macros to do the inlining

2524864
fontfamily	font-size
the font-size and fontstyle properties are bound to a special user settings class that implements inotifypropertychanged which allows changes to font-size and fontfamily to immediately propogate throughout my application

2524868
tiff	png
you can also use tiff or png png has lots of parameters i think you also can tell it to do uncompressed

2524883
any	set
in the case of join you get in your result set even those author that don t have any books in the case of of the second statement you would get only those author that have books in the books table

2524894
contains	lookup
i m trying to assign value contains in a lookup table to multiple variables by using a single selected having multiple case statements

2524905
revision	updates
if you forget the -u you can always get rid of a repo s working dir with hg updates -r null which updatess to the null revision which predates the adding of any files

2524933
expression	evaluation
in reality float is in fact the ieee-754 single types on most non-embedded platform though the usual caveats about some compilers evaluation expression in a wider format apply

2524936
binary	hex
hex editor vs hex editor- not .so useful for huge binary files - eg

2524937
signals	sigint
what i notice also is that if i want to send sigint from terminal to any scripting that traps it a ctrl-c will be catched correctly but not if i specify the signals via the cmd

2524957
32-bit	64bit
i develop on windows 7 64bit using a 32-bit eclipse and 32-bit java

2524967
value	field
as you can see in the following code i am adding the field namedd as columns i am then looping through my items and at this points i want to create an anonymous types for each item where i am setting a properties called its field named to the field namedd value

2524968
32-bit	64bit
plus if you convert the 64bit bitmap to a 32-bit bitmap the resulting file will take half as long to write .so it could actually be faster

2524973
hash	md5
i would also suggest storing a hash md5 of the file in database

2524983
attributes	properties
jquery.attr refers to html attributes not css properties

2524984
contains	elements
take a look at the html produced by html.createrecaptcha and try referring to the id of the elements created by that extension instead of the id of the contains td

2524986
duplicates	elements
i m trying to simply remove almost duplicates elements in xslt

2525006
any	set
however it is not possible in any way to put an image inside or set a background-image for an option elements

2525015
instances	self
in apple s the objective-c programming language defining a class the section named redefining self recommends that that class methods allocate and return instancess use self only to allocate an instances and then refer only to that instances

2525036
terminate	timeout
each instances of the worker thread attempts to gain an exclusive lock on the file it was initiated with until some timeout elapses if the lock is successful it process the file if it s unsuccessful it either retries as necessary throw an exception-handling and terminate itself

2525050
textbox	button
this code is based on a winform .app in vs2010 there is 1 form with a labels named valuelabels a textbox named newvaluetextbox and a button

2525050
textbox	button
you should be able to run the form types something into the textbox click the button and see the value of the labels change

2525050
textbox	button
we have a textbox and button that you can use to change the value of the properties in myclass

2525050
textbox	button
we ve commented out the code in the button click handler and we have bound both the textbox and the labels to the object value

2525069
32-bit	64bit
i m using win7 64bit and 32-bit eclipse java

2525090
expression	evaluation
it is the delaying of evaluation of dereference expression that is not consistent with claiming it is impossible to have an invalid reference

2525102
any	set
you can set doxygen to extraction non-documented items as well - that may do what you want without adding any comment blocks to the code yet

2525106
32-bit	64bit
also developing on win7 64bit with 32-bit java and 32-bit eclipse

2525146
constructor	object
if i don t use a valid hosts or ports the constructor on the connection object throw an exception-handling

2525151
32-bit	64bit
at first i had 64bit java and 32-bit eclipse which was like cats and dogs

2525156
calloc	free
you allocate it inside the function with calloc but the the caller must free it using free

2525157
fiddler	charles
use a proxy tool like fiddler or charles to inspect the request as it leaves the browser

2525189
calloc	free
and if you allocate an arrays dynamically in a function via calloc and return it it is up to the caller of the function to free it using the pointers that the function returns

2525190
click	mouse
submission a form via jquery is really no different from submission a form via click a button with the mouse

2525190
value	field
if for whatever reason your form field can t match object properties then you can take the manual way and just search the formcollection parameter for the field data you need and do your business-logic to construct a new company with the posted value

2525215
compression	streaming
even if you compress a text-based protocols with gzip a general purpose compression algorithm will never be as efficient as a binary protocols designed around the specific data streaming

2525215
capacity	storage
the reason you are seeing more text-based protocols is because transmission speeds and data storage capacity have indeed grown fast compared to the data size for a wide range of applications

2525226
export	report
our second option would be to export the report to excel

2525238
contains	any	font-size	height	font-size	width
then put the new div wherever you want the preview to appear and styles it however you want it to look shrinking the height and width of the div the font-size of the content and also the height width of any images it contains

2525244
put	get
i put some log cmd into the oncreate function in the tabactivity as you see and they all get written into the log...i have no idea what i m doing wrong here

2525249
contains	any
to any source file that uses the extension methods if your extension methods is contains inside a different package

2525260
delphi	c++
another solution which i will try is the extraction strings tool include in gettext for delphi and c++ builder

2525300
scriptmanager	updatepanel
you can add a little snippet of code using the scriptmanager to execute after the response comes back to the updatepanel

2525302
32-bit	64bit
i have win7 ult 64bit and eclipse 32-bit no current problems

2525313
arrays	map
you could avoid the need for the extra id arrays by doing it as a one-liner using map but it s still doing roughly the same thing under the hood

2525318
codeigniter	joomla
if you are looking for a cms i would suggest you to go for joomla but if you are looking for asp.net-mvc framework i would suggest you to go for codeigniter

2525324
json	xml
link in whatever xml json -parsing libs you want to use find out the structure of the information and snip out the pieces of data you re interested in

2525331
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox or google-chrome but on internet-explorer 7 the conditional is always false because the browser sets the properties this way

2525331
google-chrome	firefox
and the right way is the following firefox google-chrome

2525341
capacity	storage
they too have benefited from increases in bandwidth and storage capacity

2525352
user-input	output
the result is that getline never pauses for user-input therefore the second output is always empty

2525364
hide	show
i need to split somehow some html data a text with html tags into two parts and hide the second one with a show hide link

2525364
hide	show
we don t want t to show long ones .so one of the options is to show a teaser with a show hide link

2525368
google-chrome	firefox
and this has to work in firefox google-chrome and ie6

2525369
libavcodec	avisynth	libavcodec	ffmpeg	libavformat	avisynth	libavformat	libavcodec	libavformat	ffmpeg	avisynth	ffmpeg
i would suggest using something like gstreamer or avisynth since they will abstract away a lot of the ugly details decoding video scaling and translation video syncing audio mixing audio syncing video output encoding that would be required if you just used ffmpeg s libavformat and libavcodec directly

2525388
display	width
i m trying to take a text string the words testing and calculating if the string .when display on screens will exceed a certain width

2525389
.war	jar
packaged file jar .war etc.

2525401
logfile	tail
i used cygwin to tail on the logfile thats created by log4net this seems to do the trick for me

2525408
double	int
for example what happens .when w is int but autoclass get n-1 returns a double or worse something totally incompatible

2525416
put	get
should i put them in different service classes and get a unique url-for each versioning

2525446
stderr	stdout
.communicate read data from stdout and stderr until eof is reached

2525471
packets	ping
out a ping packets and move on to the

2525482
contains	elements
now if you wanted to make the implementation fully functional then i would start by creating a matrix that contains some pz py in the places where you want to add the new list elements to the elements of the matrix and none in all other places

2525492
jtextfield	jlabel
i am using both jlabel s and jtextfield s and need to be able to truncated my double to two decimal places .when they are display by the application

2525519
aggregate-functions	sum
.when you use an aggregate-functions avg sum count min max you need to grouping your query by the other attributes you are selected

2525524
pixels	line
adding 25 pixels to the button s width keeps the button text from wrapping onto a second line

2525527
python	c++
it does exactly that well to c++ and for a subset of python and its modules

2525584
ddms	adb
going back to your original problem checked the logcat output via adb logcat or ddms to see if there are any messages from the garbage collector right before the out-of-memory fired

2525595
grouping	sorting
subquery is more efficient for myisam since it s heap-based and grouping by would required sorting and or materialization

2525621
getter	setter
i m using synchronized in my setter and avoiding it in my getter because in my .app there are a tons of data gettings and very few settings

2525641
where-clause	sql
the best solution is to use a where-clause in your sql query which would then look like this

2525644
xmpp	irc	irc	tcp
im trying to write a program that would be listening for data simple text messages on .some ports say tcp 6666 and then pass them to one or more different protocols - irc xmpp and .so on

2525655
any	set
in addition to the things listed you may also be interested in attributes packed which attempts to lay out data without any padding -- essentially with alignment set to 1

2525658
firefox	safari
this works perfectly in firefox and safari but not in ie..

2525660
show	next
2 and click again will show another next row

2525663
put	get
if map was volatile and you created a new map for every put then that could be made to be safe without synchronized on the get

2525672
for-loop	arrays
you could use a for-loop to iterate over the arrays until you find the first that is greater than the one you re searching

2525672
arrays	loops
loops over the arrays until either its end

2525684
terminal	prompt
you can tell the systemd that your hw.pyo file is executable for example in linux macosx or any other unix-y systemd by execution the cmd chmod +w hw.pyo at the terminal shell prompt

2525697
selected	button
my synchronized view has a mercurial option but .when i selected it the next button is grayed out and the finish button doesn t do anything.

2525697
any	set
any other suggestions from dvcs vets on how best to set up my environment

2525725
rendering	redraw
we ve witnessed much better rendering performance particularly .when resizing windows or redraw controls

2525730
contains	elements
if you add overflow hidden to the div then the elements will be forced to contains the floating elementss and thus have a positive height

2525740
selected	button
.when i selected the second item then click on my downloading button the first item is still listed as the selectededitem.value

2525741
16-bit	8bit
if you are compiling for an avr which has 8bit registers but defined an int to be 16-bit many calculations end up using more registers than you might think that they need because of this promotion and the fact that constants numbers in your code have to be thought of as being int or unsigned int unless the compiler can prove to itself that this won t effect the outcome of the calculations

2525762
freebsd	linux
basically i run this program in linux and maybe freebsd

2525780
attributes	properties
what attributes are you adding to the properties being display in the editor

2525780
attributes	properties
if you only want the properties to be set by the admin in the shared scoping you should include a webpartstorage storage.shared attributes

2525785
directory	folder
my basic question was if it was possible to go up a directory .when using createobject component dot path from index.cfm to mycomponent.cfc if the named of my project folder is not static across all install of the project

2525788
viewmodel	caliburn
you may want to take a look at some alternative mvvm frameworks such as caliburn that take a viewmodel first approach and break this coupling

2525799
value	field
i ve tried simply using the named of the field that contains the url as the iconsfield on the tree control but apparently .when the flex framework sees a string field as the icons field it looks for a properties on the mxml file contains the tree with a named that s the same as the string value for the field on the tree item

2525824
json	xml
many text protocols are implements in such a way that the parsing has no basis upon which to infer how much more data is necessary before a logical unit has been received xml and json can all provide minimum necessary bytes to finish but can t provide meaningful estimates

2525841
windows-vista	windows	windows-server	windows-vista	windows-server	windows
in windows-vista windows-server 2008 or later windows os you can use transactional to govern access to the ntfs

2525842
contains	any
there could be any numbers of reasons why they are not matching from extra spaces in one or the other of the value which you could trim out to your html form contains a bug that causes the parameter never to be sent

2525844
push	pull
.when you are up and running you can push pull to another repository via the team push pull menu item

2525851
json	xml
in the case of async-scripts you could add junk xml or json elements

2525855
signals	sigint
i have tried to send kill -s sigint to the children but they seem they are unable to catch the signals even if trap cleanup sigint being defined on the children scripting

2525872
where-clause	sql
you should put a where-clause into your sql query rather than grabbing the whole table and parsing it in php

2525877
sql-server	mysql
you can store the data in any back-end database engine mysql sql-server etc. though jet ace the default access database engine is likely to be completely adequate unless your dataset gets very very large it s limited to 2gbs but you don t really want to continue using it if your data grows to much over 1gb during regular usage

2525889
installation	upgrade
i had some trouble .when i upgrade to karmic - the plugins installation dialog was only half-functional

2525943
contains	any
the idea is that you have any object that can contains ojbjecs with parameters without checked to see if the branches exist

2525949
arrays	loops
to properly loops through the arrays you would use a function to wait for the form to close before moving on to the next index

2525953
kerberos	ssl
notice how i m setting both secure kerberos authentication and ssl using the bitwise or | operators between the two parameters

2525962
contains	elements
we envision applications of extensible markup xml where a single xml document may contains elements and attributes here referred to as a markup vocabulary that are defined for and used by multiple software modules

2525988
hash	md5
your technique of receiving the passwd in plaintext and storing its md5 hash is not very secure

2525995
value	field
see also how can i retain html form field value in jsp after submission form to servlet

2526014
core-animation	core-graphics
i am new to core-graphics core-animation

2526018
pointers	stack
first what is probably happening is that gcc under linux is using stack-pointers to index your local-variables rather than using stack frame pointers

2526019
google-chrome	firefox
i have firefox google-chrome and ie8 install

2526019
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and ie8 i don t see the after if alert

problem is i m bloody sure my bash shell classpath variables is pointed at the correct .jar file

2526055
specifications	w3c
read about the rules for character set resolution of css files at the w3c specifications for css 2

2526064
np-complete	subset-sum
this is called the set partition and kinda subset-sum problem which are np-complete problems

2526085
binaries	install
i don t know how php was install as it was include with the os .so i don t know whether i should install from .source or downloading binaries

2526125
contains	any
does your queryoverride statement contains any whitespace linebreaks by any chance

2526129
python	php
let s say you re writing a program in another language like python php or asp

2526164
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
any cell contains non-numeric data are set to nan

2526164
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
any cell contains numeric data are set to an empty string

2526164
numeric	nan
i m guessing that part of your problem may result from the fact that the numeric data you are process may have nan value in it in places where there was text in the file and your process step aren t taking this into account

2526185
subtract	add
for each of a b c and d you can either add it to the total subtract it because is exactly the same as or leave it out

2526190
configuration	upgrade
additionally i would recommend installing through macports and doing the configuration necessary to use it instead of apple s php rather than try to upgrade the apple supplied php in-place

2526206
any	set
in the advanced programming languages class i took in college we had what i think is a pretty good definition of programming language a programming language is any formal language capable of expressing all computable functions which the church-turing thesis implies is the set of all turing-computable functions

2526215
user-interface	drawing
prior to 2.0 the only way to display on top of the systemd wallpaper was to use getwallpaper to retrieve the static wallpaper image and take care of drawing it yourself in your user-interface

2526246
value	field
in my table if a recording is deleted i need to add one of its field value a quantity value to a field in another table

2526246
value	field
how can i access the value of a field in a deleted recording

2526252
substitution	replace
you would still need to make two call to replace because your substitution are different for each case

2526253
associations	model
i know how to do basic non-ar model but i m not sure how to defined the associations or if i need to create a gallery model at all

2526289
google-chrome	safari
works in ffs and google-chrome but not in ie8 or safari

2526297
subtract	add	subtract	time
for each time interval for each square for each color channel subtract the two intensities take the square and add it all together if you need to detection clips that might be small parts of other clips it gets a bit trickier but the general principles of calculating feature vectors should work

2526305
stderr	stdout
i have a systemd set up that s been happily running r from a java servlet spawn process hooking into the process s stdin stdout and stderr streaming as in the second andwer to this question

2526315
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i have tested the functionality in ie7 ie8 firefox 2 firefox 3 opera and google-chrome and everything works fine

2526345
value	field
this would mean that two location object would be considered not equals even if the value of all their field are the same

2526360
protected	public
notice the guidelines only specify usage for public and protected field

2526364
one-to-many	entity
with a relationship to an entity called wordcategory one-to-many

2526371
protected	public
as a personal aside i tent to prefix private variables and methods with _ and then camel casing protected variables and methods in camel casing and public variables and methods with pascal casing but that is just me

2526372
google-chrome	firefox
however everything works on firefox google-chrome and ie8

2526375
32-bit	64bit
we are in the process of moving databases from older 32-bit hardware running sql 2005 to newer hardware with sql 2008 64bit

2526375
32-bit	64bit
my question is if the database is automatically converted to 64bit after it is reattached on the new server or if it is running in 32-bit mode on a 64bit instances

2526377
arrays	loops	pointers	stack
to do this in earlier versioning write a function that takes a stack arrays + size allocates a new arrays on the heap loops through stack arrays populating the heap arrays and then returning a pointers to the heap arrays

2526379
32-bit	64bit
yes you can simply detach and attach your database .when upgrading from 32-bit to 64bit windows

2526379
32-bit	64bit
is the same in the 64bit and 32-bit

2526379
32-bit	64bit
across 32-bit and 64bit environment

2526381
instances	private
yes the naming conventions enforced by stylecop which enforces the ms coding rules is no underscore.js camel case for private instances field

2526393
attributes	properties
the exception-handling as john pointed out is if you are using the order properties on your data-members attributes

2526397
python	java
in java you ll use parameter overloading in python i suppose you can use different methods

2526402
contains	elements
i have a elements which contains 3 child

2526405
selected	cell
i want to selected the editing templates for one cell based on the value of another cell on the same row

2526425
settings.settings	app-config
you have to actually open the settings editor at which points it will notice the difference between the app-config file and the settings.settings file and inquire as to whether you d like it to updates your settings.settings file using value from app-config

2526457
shell	bash
bash is the shell not the terminal

2526461
.net	wcf	enterprise	platform
iâ m working on a large and a high volume transactional enterprise application which has been designed using n-tire application architecture .and it was developed in the .net platform utilizing c# vb.net framework 3.5 objectdatasources dataset wcf asp.net updatepanel javascript json 3rd party tools

2526492
latitude-longitude	street-address	latitude-longitude	location
taking your example below even for accessing any information about the actual location i live you needed to downcasting it to either a street-address or a latitude-longitude coordinate

2526512
contains	set
set this to the path contains the executable to get the same behavior

2526515
lwjgl	jogl
opengl rendering via jogl or lwjgl

2526521
contains	lookup
note the above is a slight simplification - inc may also contains subroutine references and object references which load the modules as their custom code specifies instead of performing the lookup in the directory as specified in #2 logic above

2526532
authentication	login
yes there are other things you can do with challenge-response authentication scheme for the login part of it but it sounds like you really want the whole channel protected anyway

2526534
any	set
seeing as how you can easily set up either or a combinations of both in asp.net-mvc are there any considerations that i should be aware of .when using one or the other

2526544
click	mouse
it will consist of area s map image with some river routes for boats that have to be selectable - route have to be made clearer on mouse hover and after user click on a route a pop-up windows should emerge

2526547
web-services	api
one possibility is amazon.com--they have short clips of gazillions of songs and it might be possible to pick play them using amazon s web-services api

2526568
webforms	asp.net
i have a webforms web application asp.net 2.0

2526580
pointers	stack
returning a pointers to a value on stack is a bad idea and probably won t work

2526583
malloc	free	calloc	malloc	calloc	free
you could allocate the memory using malloc or calloc .so it doesn t get free automatically

2526590
.when	ready
because the document is ready .when the html dom is loaded

2526609
downgrade	upgrade
it d be even better if you could downgrade to android v1.5 as one of the popular early android phones the htc hero hasn t officially been upgrade yet

2526615
put	get
first get request shouldn t be used to alter states on the server .so for your vote service i would recommend .post put

2526620
substitution	replace
making string modifications in the database is generally messy .so i think the best way to handle this is to find all the rows contains the words you are interested in selected them make the substitution in the client language of your choice then updates the rows back to the database with the replace string

2526670
ironpython	ironruby
ironpython ironruby jython jruby

2526674
debugging	trace
stack trace and the param named is for the guy debugging - not for programmatic access

2526681
python	java
i would preferably like a python or java solution

2526699
filtering	sorting
thats mostly filtering sorting and paging lists

2526700
.war	jar
looking at the types allowed in the pom.xml i only see things like pom jar .war ear .

2526757
zlib	libz
libz zlib compression

2526762
javascript	dom
jquery is a javascript libs that lets you query the dom of webpage to access different elements in that page

2526767
fireworks	photoshop
the reason i would choose mockapp over all the other solutions is that i would assume most already have either powerpoint or keynote on their computer compared to photoshop or fireworks though i m sure if you have those applications on your computer it may be better to use those

2526770
children	nodes
you move from a father nodes to each one of its children by choosing an elements from the father s alist and

2526770
contains	elements
the leafs have an empty alist and since following different paths from the root to the leafs you have to choose elements from the root s alist in different order the blist of the leafs themselves contains all the various permutation of the root s alist

2526776
macros	vba
you will only get the styles and autotexts defined in the templates and get access to the vba macros defined in that templates

2526777
common-lisp	scheme
i have been writing common-lisp macros .so scheme s r5rs macros are a bit unnatural to me

2526781
ubuntu	debian
on debian and debian deriviatives like ubuntu you can use apt-file to find out what package to install given a filename

2526796
constructor	object
ask what your class depends on and then inject those object via say the constructor

2526809
scripting	shebang
pass it via the first line shebang of your perl scripting

2526813
put	get
you may have heard of restful-architecture which basically uses the http methods get put .post and delete as they were intended

2526817
order	join
i know about setmaxresults and setfirstresult but because of the left join and distinctrootentity that could return less than x order

2526831
speex	mp3	speex	wma	mp3	wma
speex is designed for speech and should perform better than wma mp3 or other audio codecs that are designed to handle music if you are just encoding speech which i assume since you are grabbing from the mic

2526853
shutdown	restart
i d strongly suggest using otp s supervisor if you want sane process tree shutdown and or restart

2526860
actionview	partials
for a little more information you should wrap the call to the partials view in the actionview with a div that has an id

2526869
asp.net-mvc	webforms
note that his example targets webforms instead of asp.net-mvc .so you d need to use instead of but the general idea is the same

2526869
asp.net-mvc	webforms
response.writesubstitution is a webforms-specific extensibility points and its behavior in an asp.net-mvc application is undefined since asp.net-mvc does not run the webforms pipeline in its entirety

2526877
contains	any
i can use this methods to create any kind of widget contains within any kind of html tag

2526880
cassini	iis
i have tested this in a separate project and noticed that they do work .when using the integrated visual-studio developer server cassini but they do not work .when using iis webserver

2526881
linux	osx
i can easily test linux and osx solutions but if you recommend a windows editor i would appreciate if you include descriptions of how the editor handles invisibles other than whitespace line break

2526881
emacs	vim
edit i m beginning to be sure that the behavior i want can be implements in emacs vim via either custom highlight or by messing around with the fonts itself

2526916
variables	boolean
it just seems to make a lot of sense to use is or perhaps has .whenever you can .when naming boolean variables

2526920
display	height
the only idea i have is to put all the text from your popup in one additional scrollbox maybe at the bottom of the page with a height just large enough to display one set of detail information at a time

2526939
toolchain	gnu
it has full toolchain required to building standards pthreads application gnu linux as well

2526945
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this behavior is not the same on a non-mobile device it works fine in firefox safari google-chrome

2526946
value	field
later i have realized that .when click save the value of the field passwd changes well its encrypted versioning

2526974
qhash	qlist
i stumbled about a methods which seems to be present in all data object like qlist qqueue qhash .

2526974
qhash	qlist
but what effect does it have on the qlist qqueue qhash .

2526990
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
the problem is that .when i add the uilabel as a subviews of uiwindow it will not automatically rotate since it is not a subviews of uiviewcontroller uiviewcontroller automatically handles updating subviewss during rotation

2526990
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
this way the labels could be display on top of the uinavigationcontroller s bar while also automatically being rotated since it is a subviews of uiviewcontroller

2526990
uinavigationcontroller	uiview
but since the uinavigationcontroller is being placed inside a uiview which does not overlay on top of the status bar it is incorrectly adding an additional 20 pixels

2527001
exception-handling	try-catch
this ensures that you will log all exception-handling and saves you having to insert try-catch and logging code in every methods that could throw

2527009
python	ruby
other languages like python and ruby work fine this way

2527030
contains	any
the problem is that the textarea cmd can contains anything from a stored procedure with go s statements and any selected cmd that return resultsets just like query analyzer

2527050
hide	show
however i also want to show and hide the control elements .when they aren t relevant

2527050
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
i was noticing it always took one more click than it should to do my show hide .so i dumped scrolltop to screens using the scrollto .post effect callback onafter and found that .when the content has reached either extreme that scrolltop is reported to be off still by x amount and doesn t hit the max min until that next click despite the fact that the content is positioning at it s max min

2527053
dependency-injection	singleton
it should also be noted that dependency-injection is usually used as a solution to the singleton anti-patterns

2527075
python	ruby
.so you are saying python and ruby can t have dependency-injection

2527085
sql-server-express	sql-server
can t you just take a sql-server level backup and have them install sql-server-express on their laptops and restore the database there

2527126
attributes	properties
for each automobile the user-interface sets the types field and the properties associated with the automobile.while form submission the types field is ignore as it is a protected attributes

2527130
boolean	int
and .so on can act on int char etc as there is no boolean types however according to the standards they are guaranteed to return 0 for false and 1 for true

2527132
mouseover	mouseout
the mouseout and mouseover functions will will apply to all elements returned by your selector

2527132
mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout
lastly you should use mouseenter mouseleave in preferences to mouseover mouseout since you don t want your hide event to fire .when you enter the span elements

2527133
tapestry	guice
i prefer tapestry but guice is pretty similar and more widely adopted .so that might be a better choice since it will be easier to find tutorials etc

2527138
mouseover	mouseout
i have a website which uses jquery and lots of mouseover mouseout effect

2527157
export	csv
consider also if your database engine already has a csv export operation

2527191
64bit	x86
i m trying to use a screensaver on a windows-xp 64bit machine which uses a .net .app which makes an interop call which relies on some x86 shockwave dlls some shockwave animation

2527194
cllocationmanager	locationmanager
cllocationmanager locationmanager cllocationmanager alloc init autorelease

2527194
cllocationmanager	locationmanager
- void locationmanager cllocationmanager manager didupdatetolocation cllocation newlocation fromlocation cllocation oldlocation

2527194
cllocationmanager	locationmanager
- void locationmanager cllocationmanager manager didfailwitherror nserror error

2527196
freeswitch	asterisk	freeswitch	pbx	asterisk	pbx
i am trying out some ip pbx systemd asterisk freeswitch and yate to register for events in the pbx and i want to know which of these components is the better one

2527216
c++	lua
if you are using c++ you need to be careful because lua uses setjmp and longjmp for errors which generally must be translation into c++ exception-handling-handling by catching the lua error and throw a suitable exception-handling

2527234
return-value	arguments
in this case the calling methods either checked the arguments prior or the return-value after the choice is up to whoever writes the calling methods

2527254
python	lua	python	c++	python	ruby	c++	lua
i m not opposed to writing some code to handle this but it would be preferable if it were one of bash python ruby lua c or c++

2527259
delphi	c++
i tried gettext for delphi and c++ builder but it does not compile in lazarus for mac os x

2527267
put	get
all that it s doing is put the previous epi.sode .so i get view id 3 if the epi.sode i am watching is 4

2527268
signals	sigint
my hypothesis is that since the scripting is running from a non-interactive shell as a child of a scripting that sigint which is a keyboard signals is ignore

2527268
shell	bash
non-builtin cmd run by bash have signals handler set to the value inherited by the shell from its parent

2527271
put	get
i don t think i should need an ioref just to get a value out but i needed place to put the file contents

2527274
32-bit	x86
in some ubuntu distros on non 32-bit x86 architectures it is misconfigured

2527303
pygtk	pyqt
first off if you can use some other widget systemd like pygtk or pyqt you should seriously consider it

2527306
transient	entity
specifically i would create a new transient properties for your entity that returns a modified date

2527316
python	java	python	php
appcelerator-titanium i don t know the correct named -- the people running the company are morons and don t have a clue which named to use it seems allows you to run php python java anything on desktop mobile ipad very easily

2527322
spring	guice	spring	seam
having said that if you are dead-set against trying spring guice or seam offer nice alternatives

2527325
highlight	selected
i know i can change the selectionstyle of a uitableviewcell to make it highlight blue or grey .when selected but how can i change this .when in editing mode

2527335
javascript	dom
what i m trying to do here is to associate a dom object with an instances of a javascript object which will provide some meaningfol methods later on

2527356
daemons	systemd
from that you can then send messages to the systemd to which you intend to propagate detailing the mst and the bundle to fetch whereby that scripting daemons begins transfer

2527369
access-control	authentication
you re essentially creating an access-control rights privileges list file coupled with a messages authentication code to verify its source you

2527370
hide	show
i have a menu with submenus that can be toggle hide show types deal

2527370
hide	show
i hide show submenu .when click on a header and change a styles of the header .so the background arrow will change up down

2527371
selected	cell
.when i am editing a cell and press enter the next row is automatically selected i want to stay with the current row.

2527381
mouseleave	mouseenter
i d use the jquery-events to prevent your flicker they provide a bit more intelligent firing here mouseenter and mouseleave

2527381
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use hover mouseenter mouseleave like this

2527383
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i have a bunch of list items in an unordered list styled for a navigation menu and in firefox google-chrome safari and opera things work fine

2527385
version-control	git
it s a distribute version-control systemd dvcs just like git

2527385
filesystems	fat
also mercurial has a naming system.in its repository to prevent filename collision if you use it with a case-insensitive filesystems like fat ntfs or hfs+

2527385
matplotlib	scipy
numpy scipy and matplotlib do most of what i need

2527385
pygtk	pyqt
i can integrated it with pygtk pyqt a webserver a pdf generator reportlib and who knows what else

2527385
python	c++
python is easier to extends with c and c++ code

2527388
any	set
just set the cookies .when hiding showing then on load set what s show based on any cookiess set

2527407
python	java
despite the work smalltalk in the title many programmers have found these patterns applicable to languages like java and python as well

2527439
selected	textbox
the xxxxxx cannot be editable if the user selected all the content of the textbox the labels must remain unselected i need to be able to styles the text colour formatting of the labels separately .when there is no text in the textbox but it has focus the caret should flash just after the labels and i need the baselines of the text in the textbox and the labels to line up

2527439
any	set
.so any suggestions on how to set this up

2527446
gridbaglayout	miglayout
for this i suggest on the use of miglayout which is an incredibly powerful layout manager easy to specify layout directly in code or with the netbeans user-interface designer mattise which uses gridbaglayout and writes the .java files automatically with insert points for your own code for responding to user-interface events and such

2527451
strdup	free
oh and if you do use strdup be sure to call free to free temp before you leave the function

2527453
temporary	copy
for other operations such as rescaling or rotating a non-square image by 90 degrees it is quite likely that even .when images are mutable a temporary copy of the entire image is going to be necessary because the dimension change

2527458
ostringstream	std
use std ostringstream with std string

2527458
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream oss

2527468
32-bit	64bit
that s fine if the numbers fits in 32-bit but javascript numberss are 64bit floats which could be much larger than 2147483647

2527488
hash	md5
i usually take a one-way hash like md5 then there are ways to convert that to a key with varying degrees of reliability

2527500
webserver	security
certainly a systemd you use internally at your company or at home on a local webserver doesn t need a security layer to function

2527506
operators	keyword
syntax will describe which are the operators which are primitive-types int float which are the keyword return for while

2527533
contains	elements
a form contains many elements such as labels textbox radio options box etc

2527533
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
do you handle a winform event for .when the mouse click or keyboard key pressed

2527546
linux	unix
if using linux unix what about comm -1 file1 file2 to printing line in file1 that aren t in file2 comm -1 file1 file2 | wc -l to count them and similarly for comm -2 .

2527548
value	field
for example there may be .some field that aren t .so relevant say a different value in a minor drop-down box but .some that are very important the contents of this messagebox

2527549
uploadify	.post
the uploadify .post immediately returns a http 1.1 302 found back to my login page

2527549
uploadify	.post
seems like the uploadify .post is immediately blocked

2527567
display	height	display	width
to resize it it just display a black image with resize width height

2527569
httphandler	httpmodule
you need to create an httphandler instead of an httpmodule

2527611
put	get
and do i put the code for events that get fired in a scene in that scene s class

2527617
perl	ruby	python	java	python	ruby	python	perl
at the time way back .when perl was pretty popular java was getting more popular not too many people were paying attention to python and ruby was just getting started

2527617
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
i d say that perl python and ruby are all completely adequate and up to the task

2527645
keydown	keyup
but i believe that to create an actual system-level keypress event -- to make windows create the keydown keyup messages for you and work correctly even if you change applications while the pedal is held down -- you need to write an input drivers

2527648
command-line	cmd
for many operations you still need to know the command-line cmd and their switches

2527648
put	get
you get several copies of the same file and then you have to delete all the versioning you donâ t need leave visual-studio for that or you get conflict indicators put into your code which make your code uncompilable until you removed them all

2527655
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari the favicon works fine

2527661
pascal	delphi
another option would be to use synapse which is a blocking tcp-ip libs which is very easy to use and supports free pascal as well as delphi

2527666
contains	set
if the field contains the entry date is keyed indexed and is used by the db software to optimize the query that should reduce the set of rows examined to the rows matching that date range

2527681
font-size	height	font-size	width
fixed by resetting to font-size 1em before the height and width em declarations for the roundable-movable-item and roundabout-movable-item img

2527720
xsl-fo	xslt
we often transform that xml using xslt into html or xsl-fo for report purposes

2527737
double	int
.when trying to do math on an big int int64 large numbers in xslt templates i get the wrong result since there is no native 64bit int support in xslt xslt numbers is 64bit double

2527737
double	int
this test returns true due to the inexact representation of the large int in 64bit double i am assuming but actually is false if i could tell the xslt processor somehow to use int64 rather than the default 64bit double for the numbers data since big int is the actual data types for numberss in the xml input

2527738
assign	add
which will execute the delegation specific for the rgb value you insert to assign a delegation you simply add a new entry to the map

2527742
linux	unix
it is important to understand that this is a consequence of the way that unix linux works not of a shortcoming of the java apis

2527742
linux	unix
unix linux say that the scoping of environment variables is an os-level process and that one process cannot read or set the environment variables of another process

2527759
unicode	wstring
std wstring is technically ucs-2 two bytes are used for each character and the code tables mostly map to unicode format

2527760
order	add
sorry i neglected to add the order by clause in the queries to indicate why it all needed to be a subquery in the first place

2527766
arrays	map
there is no built-in function to replace nil in an arrays .so yes map is the way to go

2527768
implements	extends
probably don t need help on this anymore but i noticed that iostream extends datainputstream but .when it comes to actually implements read it s been left blank

2527769
cassini	iis
we use asp.net-mvc controllers that access system.file.io in our application and they work fine in localhost iis 6.0-based cassini

2527769
controllers	routes
now we alternate between getting unauthorizedaccessexception and an iis7 404 page that suggests the routes are being ignore completely for example we serve favicon via a controllers .when the physical file actually lives at content images favicon

2527781
union-all	union
use union-all if you don t have to be concerned with duplicates - it will be faster than union

2527782
background-image	transparency
basically i have a div that with a display of a background-image and i will have another div on top of this with transparency

2527784
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
iphone android and modern web browsers such as firefox opera safari google-chrome have excellent javascript implementation splendid css and reasonable subset of html5 -- but you can t use either fact if you also want to support internet-explorer or other old browsers

2527784
jquery	dojo
fortunately javascript frameworks such as jquery and dojo can compensate in good part for such issues i per.sonally prefer dojo but jquery s more popular and the choice between two such good frameworks is more of a matter of taste -- plus there are advantages with going for the popular choice such as you can probably get better support on .so

2527784
jquery	dojo
client-side pick one of the two most popular frameworks jquery and dojo and go with it -- both have good books if that s your favorite styles of study but also good online resources

2527787
python	c++
this is what allows a com class to be written in c# and invoked from c++ python and many other com-aware languages

2527789
32-bit	64bit
this link and this one suggest that the problem is you re doing a 64bit compile with a 32-bit libs

2527797
32-bit	64bit
during the linking step there are incompatibilities since some of your object-files were compiled for 32-bit and some for 64bit

2527804
object-reference	instances
a nullreferenceexception was unhandled object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

2527806
windows	ms-dos
on windows 7 every single bit of memory in the ms-dos header and stubs is ignore

2527806
windows	ms-dos
i m not sure if windows truly ignore all other value in the ms-dos header and stubs 100 of the time but excluding the two i just mentioned if all other value are set to 0 a valid executable program will function properly

2527806
windows	ms-dos
in windows 2000 and earlier i don t know if what i mentioned above was true but you were at that time allowed to modify the length of the ms-dos stubs or remove it perhaps provided that the pe offset value was still points to the correct place in memory to find the pe header

2527806
windows	ms-dos
on windows 7 if you modify the length of the ms-dos stubs at all even .when pe offset points to the correct modified location windows will not run the exe and claims it is not a valid win32 application

2527806
windows	ms-dos
this is the least the ms-dos portion of a pe file can have on windows 7 while still having a valid functioning executable

2527823
python	java	python	php	python	c++
most weeks i program in java c# python php javascript sql smarty django templating and occasionally c++ and objective-c

2527848
margins	padding
therefore margins padding etc

2527850
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i used many different browsers while i was coding for a new site firefox google-chrome ie8 opera safari mobile-devices etc...

2527857
value	field
that s why usually spammer use to fill up all the field in the page with predefinited value before sending the form.

2527857
value	field
i remember that a plugins for phpbb forum rely on the fact that usually the spam bots selected the first option avaiable with a value in the field

2527862
getter	setter
this creates a dictionary that contains string named of the properties as the key and a tuples with getter delegation and setter delegation for each of the properties

2527862
tuples	set
the code would be more readable if you used your own types with get properties and set properties instead of tuples with properties named item1 and item2

2527865
webserver	upload
for example .when an order comes in my program might compute a new htpasswd from the email s contents upload it to our webserver and reply to the customer with login details

2527867
python	perl
the path of least resistance for these project is beanshell and groovy. i feel a tremendous itch toward language advocacy but i m trying to avoid saying we should use python cause i like it and perl is gross.

2529618
subclassing	superclass
superclass constructor runs before the subclassing constructor .so the

2529618
constructor	private	instances	private
note that the constructor of subclassing is private to ensure that it can only be initializer via createinstance thus instances are always initializer properly

2529622
hide	show
you can hide these panels until all of them are created and in runworkercompleted event handler you can show them

2529623
click	mouse
updates here s another answer with a more detailed example of drawing something in response to where the mouse is click

2529629
progress-bar	progress
.when button b1 gets click start your recursive algo1 in backgroundworker and show the progress in progress-bar p1

2529642
children	tree	children	nodes
i have dynamic tree moreover nodes can have children

2529657
git-status	gitignore
use the gitignore file to keep files you don t want to tracking out of version-control instead of cluttering your git-status messages or overwriting a file that should not be in version-control in the first place db configuration and such

2529661
value	field
a methods invoked in this way always runs before the instances has been initializer .when its declare field still have their default value

2529669
decrement	increment
i think it might be simpler to maintain a nested-refresh count that is increment before each refresh-decorated call and decrement after in a finally block .so that the count doesn t get messed up

2529697
silverlight	wpf
particularly for 2d games and particularly silverlight wpf games

2529704
common-lisp	lisp	common-lisp	smalltalk	smalltalk	lisp
i know common-lisp does since it s probably one of the most common ways to deploy lisp web apps but i suspect it would work pretty much the same in say smalltalk

2529707
32-bit	64bit
.so how to convert 64bit .deb file into 32-bit .deb

2529710
contains	any
if .deb file contains any architecture specific files ie libs or executable binaries then you ll need to obtain 32-bit versioning of those files or rebuild the package yourself from source

2529715
32-bit	x86	packaging	building
you need to rebuilding the application from its sources for a 32-bit target and use the packaging scripting it provides to building a deb for x86

2529723
variables	boolean
if you set the boolean configuration variables diff.mnemonic prefix the a and b will be changed to more descriptive letters like c and w commit and work tree

2529726
backgroundworker	winforms
the .net already has a component for what you want to do backgroundworker which works in both winforms and wpf and almost any other architecture

2529727
python	java	python	c++
the analysis of the problem gives some pointers on how to do this in java and c++ but i can t translation those solutions back to python

2529736
groovy	java
i used java for like 6-7 years then some months ago i discovered groovy and started to save a lot of typing

2529736
scala	java
i mean scala is static typed .so wrapper of java classes should be lighter since many things are checked during compile-time but i m not sure about the real difference of what s going inside

2529747
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux to create packager

2529759
ubuntu	linux
i almost certainly required the software run under linux ubuntu more specifically

2529761
groovy	java
one thing to be aware of java 7 will introduce a new invokedynamic bytecode for the jvm which will make a lot of groovy s metaclass magic unnecessary and should drastically speed up dynamic-languages implementation on the jvm

2529777
arrays	loops
and to get the named of the arrays just loops over the and retrieve the named

2529787
append	input
fscanf automatically append a null-terminated character to the scanned input

2529787
malloc	free
allocation the buffering from the heap by using malloc means that you are responsible for reclaiming the allocated heap memory by subsequently calling free .when you are finished with the buffering

2529795
click	mouse
if you mean .when the mouse is click on my panels i want to display a rectangle then you can do that like this

2529795
mousedown	mouseup
you need to handle the mouseup move and down events tracking the delta between the mousedown points and the current positioning

2529835
required	checked
that required overrides the wndproc methods and checked where the click occurred

2529841
any	set
if i set the html elements s opacity css properties to any value less than 1 the flash object that is actually covered receives mouse events

2529841
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i get this behavior in firefox 3.6 safari 4.0 and google-chrome 5.0 in both mac and windows

2529846
contains	elements
thus decorator is the most primitive elements that can contains another elements

2529849
value	field
i have an object with large numbers of similar field like more than 10 of them and i have to assign them value from an arrays of variables length

2529849
nested	assign
the solution would be either a huge nested bunch of ifs based on checked length of arrays each time and assign each field

2529850
any	set
microsoft msdn site has next remark any grouping assign to a listview control appear whenever the listview.view properties is set to a value other than view.list.

2529857
python	c++
if c++ is ok for you unlike cython and pyrex shed skins is used to convert a subset of python to c++ and compile it with make g++

2529877
accelerometer	magnetometer
gv is a gravity vector i building out of the accelerometer value and hv is an heading vector built out the magnetometer value

2529891
arrays	map
javascript-object are maps .sometimes called as.sociativity arrays but let s use map to avoid confusion with numerically-indexed arrays .so you can do this with plain object quite easily

2529891
arrays	loops
if you need for any reason to loops through all of these since it s not an arrays you can t use a numeric index

2529891
arrays	map
if i need things both numerically and by a key i usually separate things out a bit by making the map aspects a properties of the arrays rather than using the arrays directly

2529891
arrays	map	arrays	loops
that required only a small change to our loops that creates the map after we ve initializer the arrays

2529901
windows-vista	windows
depending on the types of visitor your website is meant for most visitor should have windows-vista or windows 7 and thus have the calibri fonts available for viewing your website

2529908
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
where other languages expose hacks python __add__ methods perl s overload.pm ruby does pure oo in all cases and this can hurt performance if the compiler interpreter is not clever enough

2529916
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
ruby uses garbage-collection though c# which also uses garbage-collection comes out two order of magnitude ahead of ruby python php etc

2529916
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
ruby 1.9 is about as fast as python and php within a 3x performance factors .when compared to c which can be up to 300x faster .so the above with the exception-handling of threading considerations should your application heavily depend on this aspects are largely academic

2529924
value	field
that is to say maintain an arrays of field that corresponds to your arrays of value

2529928
png	gif
image123 can be any length newimage123456 etc and with extension of jpg jpeg gif or png

2529954
value	field
if your field are declare in the same order of the arrays s elements you could use reflection if available in your language to set these value

2530000
ref	out
head is a ref reference to the currently checked out commit

2530000
ref	out
in normals states it s actually a symbolic ref to the branch you have checked out - if you look at the contents of .git head you ll see something like ref refs heads master

2530014
create-table	alter-table
you can specify the unique-index constraint both in create-table cmd or alter-table cmd

2530015
development-environment	continuous-integration
background our development-environment uses a separate continuous-integration server which is wonderful

2530030
configuration	environment
looking at that i guess you don t have a configurationuration block for your current environment n configuration amazon_s3.yml

2530041
spaces	output
note that even white spaces before the or count as output

2530047
rad-controls	telerik
the telerik rad-controls can be won once you reach 10 000 rep in .so

2530070
tuples	any
you then need to write a function that returns a modified tuples moving any field that match one of your fieldnames into a new fieldet along with the collapse class

2530073
default	reset
--mixed is the default git reset means git reset --mixed

2530082
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
the trick most of the time is that you do not have dedicated locks - instead you treat all elements in an arrays or all nodes in a linked-list as a spin-lock

2530096
unix	bsd
.when i tested this code on bsd unix that is mac os x it worked as well

2530126
switching	screens
i am wondering what would be best way to switching between user-interface screens

2530129
any	set
since the foreign key is set up i should have no problem accessing any properties from the users table

2530191
selection-sort	bubble-sort
this is a kind of a hybrid between a classic bubble-sort and a selection-sort - but closer to the classic bubble-sort

2530191
arrays	loops
in the classic bubble-sort the inner loops swaps adjacent pairs as it walks the list arrays

2530191
selection-sort	bubble-sort
it s different from the selection-sort and is similar to the classic bubble-sort in that it performs a swap whenever it finds a value larger than the current first member of the inner loops s sub-list

2530191
selection-sort	bubble-sort
i d labels this more a variation of the classic bubble-sort rather than the selection-sort because the performance characteristics of the sort in the question are the same as the classic bubble-sort o n 2 comparisons and o n 2 swaps while a selection-sort has o n swaps

2530196
updating	updates
please note the default way of updating used by linq-to-sql is called optimistic-concurrency and is a way of preventing conflicting updates from multiple users

2530208
hide	show
.when i hide all but the last one with and show them all again it comes back as inline-block

2530217
value	field
i do something like this where i have one or more field are only required based on the value of another

2530217
selected	checkbox	value	field
this is usually a checkbox or selected where true false or one particular value means that we should show this other set of field

2530224
linux	minix
it all depends on how you want your operating systemd to function if you want a microkernel you should probably study minix 3 or if you want a monolithic kernel the current linux kernel is a good place to start from hint look in arch x86 boot there is some very interesting code in there

2530246
fckeditor	wysiwyg
i know i could use a wysiwyg editor like tinymce or fckeditor that can format the data on the client and then send it to the server most of them add tags by default but i want to know the experience of others in handling raw textarea input and then display it on the front end

2530252
sinatra	gem
using the standards gem for using markaby with sinatra listed at

2530254
ruby-on-rails	django
i plan to start learning a java web framework i love the java-api i have already used ruby-on-rails and django

2530254
groovy	java	spring	grails
grails looks great it uses groovy which is better than java for web application i think.. but it s slower than pure-java based frameworks hibernate strut spring it looks pretty simple to deploy send .war and it s ok

2530254
groovy	java	debugging	trace
it s a bit harder to debugging need to restart the server at each modification and stacktrace contains a mix of java and groovy trace which is not always the easiest to understand

2530255
value	field
a zero or one-to-many relationship in a database is usually represented by declaring the field in your instances the parent_id and then reserving a value for denoting it points to nothing

2530264
dictionary	arrays
i have a mutable arrays that contains mutable dictionary with strings for the key latitude-longitude and id

2530264
any	set
is there any way to remove object from an arrays while enumerating .so i only enumerate the current set of object as the arrays is updates

2530278
textile	bbcode
most of sites converts content from some kind of bbcode textile markdown others format to html just before displaying.

2530280
default-value	default
i ve been trying to have a default-value in a textinput then with jquery .when you onfocus the textbox it makes the text black default a lighting gray and deletes the default-value

2530284
higher-order-functions	flatmap
in scala for is translation to a chaining of call to higher-order-functions foreach map flatmap and withfilter

2530284
double	int
scala 2.8 will specialize function1 for at least double and int and hopefully will also specialize traversable#foreach which will at least remove the boxing cost

2530291
dictionary	arrays
i have a plist which contains an arrays of nsdictionary s which represent a certain event each dictionary contains a few pieces of information about the event and a nsdate with the date of the event

2530312
subclassing	superclass
superclass cannot know about any specific subclassing because there might be several they might even be loaded dynamically at runtime

2530317
contact	submit
i have a php file that contains a form which contains 2 inputbox and a submit button for updating a contact

2530317
contact	submit
i managed to fill the field with the contact s data but i can t detection if the submit button is click

2530318
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 are two popular hash

2530343
contains	set
for the client project added without this checkbox enabled i opened properties page and .net ria service link dropdownlistfor is-empty it contains no project set item

2530361
scala	java
you can transliteration java into scala and end up with bytecode that is almost exactly the same

2530361
scala	java
.so scala is perfectly capable of being as fast as java

2530361
scala	java
that said there are lots of ways to write slower more memory intensive scala code that are shorter and more readable than the java equivalent

2530361
scala	java
scala s extra expressiveness means you can write programs that are shorter than thus less buggier than in java

2530363
background-image	background-color
the show up just fine with the grey background-color but the background-image won t show up at all

2530364
multicast	packets
i haven t done much with multicast but i believe that preparing to receive multicast packets is a two-step process

2530372
directory	folder
i want to disable directory browsing of galerias folder and all subdirectories

2530382
vba	vb6
i m not sure if this is what caused the problem but i remember reading that vb6 vba has a problem with declaring and initializer an object on the same line of code

2530411
implements	extends
if extension implements iextendsable interface it can extends itself with different extension object

2530411
implements	extends
the problem is that i want to allow the extension which implements iextendsable to extends only with extension that implements the same interfaces as the original extension

2530411
implements	extends
and i want to allow this class to extends itself only with extensions that implements the same interfaces or less

2530411
implements	extends
i want to do this because .when updates will be called on some extension which implements iextendable and iupdatesable it will be also called on these extensions which extends this extension

2530421
code-collaborator	review-board
i recommend using a collaborative tool like smartbear s code-collaborator or the free review-board

2530431
fseek	ftell
if you don t use the b to open the file ftell doesn t return the truth just a sort of cookies that s only useful to fseek

2530445
fflush	stdout
you should call fflush stdout after printing the prompt

2530451
contains	any
.so if any older versioning code is used to compile with new javac what happens if that code contains these words as an identifier

2530453
json	xml
i ve never worked with rest but i d have assumed that getting a .profile resource at people userid .profile would yield a document in xml or json or something that include all the field

2530462
constructor	private
instead i have to make the .app class a normals instantiatable class otherwise it complains because the constructor is private

2530482
modifiers	final
in my current project i noticed that all class field and variables inside methods are declare with final modifiers whenever it s possible

2530501
contains	any	defined	declare
in addition to accessing field defined by the contains class local classes can access any local-variables methods parameters or exception-handling parameters that are in the scoping of the local methods definition and declare final

2530516
double-quotes	single-quotes
wrap your double-quotes with single-quotes

2530523
interface-builder	iboutlet
what i ve been doing is putting the iboutlet uicontrol mycontrol variables in my mainview.h or flipsideview.h files and then tying the controls in interface-builder to those variables

2530527
database-table	unique-key
i have a database-table that has a unique-key constraint defined to avoid duplicates recording from occurring

2530527
exception-handling	try-catch
just run the insert statement and try-catch the exception-handling that may be throw due to a unique-key violation

2530530
scala	java
retronym and david have covered the main points regarding scala it is essentially as fast as java and it is that way because it is statically typed thus requiring no extra runtime checked and uses lightweight wrapper that the jvm can usually remove entirely

2530530
scala	java	arrays	map
for example using a java.util.hashmap to implements a map between bytes and bytes is going to be painfully slow in java compared to a primitive arrays lookup table and it will be equally slow in scala

2530530
primitive-types	generics
most of the ease-of-use features are directed towards generics functional-programming which still is pretty fast but not as fast as direct access to primitive-types

2530530
for-loop	arrays
for example scala has an incredibly powerful for-loop but it uses generics types .so primitive must be boxed and hence you can t use it effectively for iterator over primitive arrays

2530541
execute	declare
the problem is two-fold you declare a local variables which you then try to compare and you execute both comparisons even if the first one was process

2530546
value	field
breaking .when a field changes a value is a supported operation in c++ known as data breakpoints but is not supported in the clr

2530546
selected	button
click on the new button and selected break at function

2530562
httpd.conf	hosts
you don t have to write virtual hosts info into httpd.conf

2530573
cassini	iis
why was something acceptable for cassini and not for iis is beyond my ability to understand

2530589
python	ruby
if you have used ruby and python before you will probably enjoy grails better than play

2530591
groovy	java
also grails is written almost completely in java it just lets you use groovy for your domain specific implementation

2530591
groovy	java
if you do run into a performance issue where the groovy pages that you ve created are the bottleneck you can always just switching to a java implementation

2530591
restart	reload
grails supports reload of controllers gsps service domain object etc without restart your server

2530616
constructor	private
the class that gives out references could have a private constructor and a getinstance methods that will return a reference to itself to ensure that only one exists

2530617
midp	cldc
.so i start reading about javafx and that looks really cool but all that i see about mobiles there is applied to cldc midp etc

2530618
show	next
how would i go about having some sort of display which will show just one user at a time giving me the chance to click next and back

2530619
error-handling	try-catch
the try-catch removes the frankly erratic error-handling in earlier versioning

2530627
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the ads show on all other browsers i tried google-chrome firefox safari opeara but internet-explorer

2530654
selected	cell
if you don t care which cell was selected but just want to scroll the view back to where it was before the fill you can use the firstdisplayedcell properties instead

2530664
32-bit	64bit
you could still theoretically use something like my original code combining two 32-bit int into one 64bit int and switching on that although there would be 2 33 case statements covering the last conditional

2530673
artoolkit	opencv
i have read that if i downloading the ndk i might be able to import use the c opencv and artoolkit libs but i am wondering if this is possible or if there is a better and easier way of using these tools

2530673
artoolkit	opencv
android apps are programmed in java yet opencv artoolkit use c++

2530675
params-keyword	out
out of interest is there any way to use the params-keyword with action

2530700
artoolkit	opencv
i am still looking if there is any available information on the web ex linking opencv or artoolkit to the android sdk

2530708
version-control	git
others believe in distribute version-control like git or hg

2530709
base-class	inherited
an alternative approach is since all of my pages inherited from a base page class i could create a function in the base-class that determines what path to serve the files from based off the web-config variables

2530719
value	field
we have to keep tracking of any changes occurs in the database in others words all previous current value of any field should be saved

2530729
google-chrome	firefox
whenever i want to open a link in a new tab i add target _blank works fine in google-chrome and firefox

2530730
abstract-class	derived-class	virtual-functions	abstract-class	virtual-functions	derived-class
abstract-class doesn t imply you don t have an instances it implies that the runtime types of the instances is actually some derived-class that provides implementation for the pure virtual-functions in the abstract-base-class

2530730
abstract-class	pure-virtual	member-functions	pure-virtual
but not all member-functions of an abstract-class have to be pure-virtual you can have a mix of concrete and abstract functions

2530730
abstract-class	pure-virtual	virtual-functions	abstract-class	virtual-functions	member-functions	virtual-functions	pure-virtual	member-functions	pure-virtual
.when you call member-functions on the abstract-class all virtual-functions including the pure-virtual ones are called polymorphically

2530730
abstract-class	base-class
non-virtual functions call the definition in the base-class you can t have pure concrete functions .so even an abstract-class has to provide implementation for non-virtual functions

2530733
any	set
sad but you can t set any stretch factors or smth. if you need relational column widths not to be equals but you still can reimplement sizehint or resize sections .when header s geometrieschanged fires

2530745
updating	updates
once you re only updating certain areas you can pass those areas to display.updates .so it doesn t have to updates the whole screens

2530749
parsing	comma	contains	any
i need to parsing strings input where the columns are separated by columns and any field that contains a comma in the data is wrapped in quotes comma separated quoted text identifier

2530750
mouseleave	mouseenter
try out the mouseenter and mouseleave events

2530750
hide	show
it would be better to only create the link once and then just hide show it .when they hover over

2530761
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could try mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

2530780
double-quotes	single-quotes
if you want to insert the value gas-stations into the database including the quotes then you can either escape the quotes or surround the string with double-quotes instead of single-quotes

2530781
double-quotes	single-quotes
you can t use doubled single-quotes gas-stations - use either just single single-quotes gas-stations or actual double-quotes gas-stations

2530783
webforms	asp.net
but you can t use these in .css and .js files because they are not parsing using the asp.net webforms view engine

2530793
uitableview	uitextview
i am looking for a way to show my own input view a uitableview to enter certain keyword in a uitextview faster than typing them and also be able to types into this text view the normals way

2530818
malloc	free
address 0x20 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d

2530826
value	field
the latter example considers field as an input value for your algorithm

2530832
contains	elements
these tabs contains mined information about how developers typically extended the selected code elements

2530832
subclassing	base-class
subclassing patterns try to grouping observed extensions of a base-class into typical extension patterns they cluster subclassing by similarity to find patterns in data

2530842
constructor	object
i created a function exactly like the constructor - .so the object would have its own versioning

2530842
constructor	object
are constructor ideally only called .when an object is created

2530843
abstract-class	pure-virtual
i have an abstract-class with a pure-virtual function f and i want to create a class inherited from that class and also overrides function f

2530850
pure-virtual	base-class
are you declaring f int in your base-class as pure-virtual or f

2530850
virtual-functions	base-class
pure virtual-functions can have definitions inside their base-class

2530869
anonymous-inner-class	inner-classes
warning ignoring inner-classes attributes for an anonymous-inner-class that doesn t come with an associated enclosingmethod attributes

2530870
output	cat
you could demonstrate this in your revised program by piping the output of your program to say cat

2530870
output	mode
because there is no newline at the end and the output is running in line-buffered mode or full-buffered mode nothing appears on the terminal

2530870
fflush	stdout
at that points the residual data in the stdout buffering is fflush

2530870
output	cat
.when the output is pipe to cat it is fully-bufferinged .so nothing appears before the fork and both process have the hello line in the buffering to be fflush

2530872
constructor	object
is that you do in fact call the constructor - for a temporary object that is being construct from scratch and which is then immediately destructed since you re not doing anything with it

2530878
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it does not work in mozilla firefox or webkit google-chrome safari

2530878
click	mouse
did you try actually click on the elements with your mouse

2530880
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i ve been using the rest toolkit for wcf for a while and find it fairly powerful but i d be interested to find out what if any advantages there are using the asp.net-mvc 2 approach

2530889
constructor	object
does call the constructor of the class class but it call it inorder to create a temporary object

2530889
constructor	object
there is no way in c++ to call a constructor on an object which has already been construct

2530889
value	field
it s not necessarily the most efficient possible code since it creates a temporary then copies then destroy the temporary rather than just setting the field to their initial value

2530919
progress-bar	progress
checkout real-time progress-bar with asp.net-ajax for doing an ajax progress indicator with ajax and .net

2530919
google-chrome	firefox
to prove my points the following code works in firefox but not in ie or google-chrome

2530925
parametric-polymorphism	polymorphism
in addition to parametric-polymorphism you ll presumably be calling the hashcode methods of object stored in the hashtable which is an example of the polymorphism john refers to

2530925
parametric-polymorphism	polymorphism
hashtable relies on parametric-polymorphism and e relies on plain polymorphism

2530940
malloc	free
the default settings are of course to use malloc and free

2530964
asp.net-mvc	wcf
as to whether you want to expose functionality through wcf or asp.net-mvc it would come down to how you think of your application

2530989
contains	elements
what you are missing is that in the example the list contains exactly two elements

2531002
associations	model
the polymorphism associations are applicable .when several model are eventable

2531015
private-key	rsa
i was using the basic public private-key systemd 1 encrypt the data with symmetric encryption 2 encrypt the symmetric key with rsa

2531055
value	field
right now .when i insert a new recording the id field which is auto_increment and set as primary key increases it s value by one

2531060
webserver	upload
i want to be able to upload file from my .aspx page to my webserver .so that it can be preocessed into a different format

2531062
gtk	swt
swt is a popular gui libs used in project such as eclipse ide and other standalone project which uses native windows components such as win32 on windows and gtk on linux

2531110
positioning	slider
i have a trackbar made in visual-studio 2008 and i want to use it to adjust an image threshold but i can t find the code to retrieve the slider markers positioning

2531120
click	mouse
paint request mouse click timer expirations stuff like that

2531167
python	ruby
ruby 2.1 compared to python 3

2531189
google-chrome	firefox
tested this issues in google-chrome ie firefox

2531190
dependency-injection	inject
those who vote against the registry usually advocate the usage of dependency-injection although it should be noted that you can inject the registry as well once you got an instances of it

2531192
localization	translation
globally store an adaptor or any mecanism that will be used to do translation localization in all layer of your application -- zend-framework itself does that

2531202
subclassing	base-class
i have an arrays of pointsers to a base-class .so that i can make those pointsers points to different subclassing of the base-class but still interact with them

2531202
subclassing	base-class
really only a couple of methods which i made virtual and overloaded i m wondering if i can avoid using the pointers and instead just make an arrays of the base-class but have some way to set the class to the subclassing of my choosing

2531202
subclassing	base-class
edit all the subclassing and if need be the base-class have the same layout size

2531203
google-chrome	firefox
there are a vast numbers of different mobile browsers out there makes dealing with just firefox ie safair google-chrome trivial

2531210
spring	guice
you can t replace the lookup pattern in the netbeans-platform but to answer his question i would use dependency-injection instead of lookup in my .app via hand wiring guice pico containers or even spring

2531215
python	ruby
probably the simplest close relative of your ruby code in python

2531219
jax-ws	cxf
i write web-services at work and have used axis2 jax-ws and cxf our defacto now with eclipse

2531220
execl	fork
i m trying to use fork and execl functions together but i fail

2531223
subclassing	base-class
.so you can t have a mixture of subclassinging or even treat the arrays of subclassing as arrays of base-class

2531224
ruby-on-rails	rspec	version-control	git
you don t need to learn database handling if you know sql already in ruby-on-rails you need to learn a whole new concept migration you don t have to learn a new decent unit test in ruby-on-rails usually they teach rspec along the way because ruby-on-rails is agile and you should learn test-driven development in the early learning stage you don t have to learn a new version-control in ruby-on-rails you will be taught about git anyway you don t have to use complicated plugins in ruby-on-rails they usually use third-party plugins in textbook examples

2531225
click	mouse
middle mouse button trapping via javascript is highly unreliable and many windows mouse drivers such as logitech s don t actually register click the mouse wheel as a middle click but instead directly send the scroll mode cmd to the application

2531237
any	set
if you append an to a cmd and it causes any kind of error the error handler will be called anyway but with the parameter errno set to zero

2531242
subclassing	base-class
set the pointers .so it points to a different subclassing as needed but the base-class methods take a pointers or reference to the elements of the arrays to access the data

2531242
subclassing	base-class
the subclassing implements the base-class methods but otherwise have no data apart from what is passed into the methods

2531252
json	xml
xml or json

2531252
json	xml
or should i serialization back to json .post that to the server and then have the server do the work of recreating the xml according to the schema

2531258
contains	any
it doesn t contains any specific time but it does have the big-o for a numbers of array_ functions

2531260
click	mouse
.when i right click mouse on any of these controls the pop-up menu show up as display in the above link

2531262
put	get
then per these gae docs you create an upload url and in your upload handler typically a subclassing of blobstoreuploadhandler you use get_upload to get blobinfo instances and put their metadata somewhere that will later let you fetch them back as your .app may required

2531281
hide	show
if you are needing to hide the image everywhere it show up on the page you can do this

2531288
administration	credentials
i m not sure what credentials to enter for database administration and database administration passwd

2531297
contains	elements
.when arrays are allocated they need to contains storage for all of their elements

2531309
http	ssl
also it seems you are using http connection to the server which doesn t play well with virtual hosts because of the ssl protocols limitation

2531310
jquery	.post
the submit button on this page will .post to an action that will grab the xml file from the server then parsing it to meet the input requirements of the jquery plugins and return the view with the parsing data in it

2531310
json	xml
maybe it returns xml maybe json

2531310
jquery	.post	json	xml
if the jquery plugins doesn t return xml or json then using jquery take the raw html of the tree .post it to some action and parsing it to xml using some types of html libs checkout html-agility-pack or if you prefer use regular expression to parsing html

2531313
ubuntu	linux
with linux ubuntu specifically a webcam s audio and video are mounted on dev audiox and dev videoy where x and y are numbers

2531314
ruby	php
you should compare ruby with php or ruby-on-rails with some php framework i am not familiar with php frameworks and do not know an example

2531324
concatenation	comma
the echoing made it work just fine because apparently you can give echo more than one string comma separated and it concatenation them

2531330
fflush	stdout
you must either add a n to the end or call ffflush stdout to fflush the standards output

2531355
low-level	hardware
using more low-level api s in java means that you lose the independency from your platform think of os or hardware

2531359
any	set
but if protected_by_mutex_var is set atomically by say a compare-and-swap instruction does the mutex serve any purpose other than that pthreads and other apis required you to pass in a mutex

2531363
arguments	default
python doesn t support pointers arguments types by default

2531377
access-control	authentication
they do not required any special modules to be install on apache and you can use all of apacheâ s built-in access-control and authentication mechanisms

2531388
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
if you view this page in ie firefox or opera everything is fine but in google-chrome and safari the tables are a little out of line as you ll probably clearly notice

2531388
google-chrome	safari
it appears to me that in google-chrome and safari the left and right border 2px in total are added to the set table width while in the other browsers the border is considered part of the width

2531388
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
if here i set the width of table.uitbetaling and table.uitbetaling img table.uitbetaling td to the same value both 496 or 498 the problem in google-chrome and safari is solved however in firefox the right side border is than blank

2531390
paintcomponent	draw
instead you should have only one component that draw all of your line in its paintcomponent methods

2531395
selected	textbox
the problem with this is once the listview item gets selected the user cant keep typing into the textbox

2531396
rar	zip
used in ethernet v.42 mpeg-2 png pthreads cksum arj lha32 rar zip and more..

2531438
innodb	myisam
my main articles table is in innodb but i am also caching articles into myisam table as well for full text searching but .when i search an article it takes ages to perform one search

2531439
python	c++
although i need to do it in c++ root specifically i ve decided to do it in python because python makes sense to me but my plan is to get it working in python and then tackle re-writing in in c++ .so using easy to use python modules won t get me too far later down the road

2531450
directory	folder
if the files are in sub folder these subfolder are also copy-paste into the output directory

2531471
scala	java
for instances the following two classes in scala and java respectively generator exactly the same bytecode

2531471
getter	setter
of particular notice is the fact that scala always go to the field through getter and setter even on other methods of the same class

2531471
scala	java
it s the same thing whether it is compiled in java or scala

2531471
scala	java
scala s for are notably slower than java .when just increment indic -- the .solution .so far is to use while loops instead though .someone wrote a compiler plugins that does that conversion automatically

2531471
primitive	int
it s al.so easy to parameterized functions .so that one can pass int which can cause bad performance if you are handling primitive in scala anyval subclassing

2531483
svg	vml
use raphael.js mit license - it give you canvas-like api using svg and vml for ie and works in all amjor browsers including ie6

2531490
jquery	.post
i ve created a wrapper function for jquery s .ajax methods .so i can pass different datatypes and .post variables - like .so

2531502
metaphone	soundex
i m aware of soundex and double metaphone but these don t let me test for the similarity of words as a whole - for example hi sounds very similar to bye but both of these methods will mark them as completely different

2531507
updating	updates
i would just updates the user count as a batch-file operation every n minutes rather than updating it in realtime

2531508
synchronous	.when
however .when you make the call synchronous it blocks until the data is received and you can return the data as result-of your own function

2531521
checkbox	button
in ib you can simply drag a checkbox cell not a checkbox button

2531531
linux	osx
if you re running linux or osx you can get the full details on commit specifiers via man git-rev-parse under specifying revision

2531553
contains	elements
finally to determine whether two collections contains the same elements ignoring order but paying attention to how often instances are repeated simply call

2531558
execute	prepare
.when you execute such a prepare statement only the statement id and the parameters are transfer not some query-string as if you would replace the placeholder by the actual parameters on the client-side your php scripting

2531572
linked-list	nodes
the server marks a linked-list s nodes s state_ as filled once its data is filled in and its next pointers has been set to a valid location

2531578
sql-server	mysql
alright .so i want to convert an already exist sql-server database 2005 to a mysql database

2531623
beanstalk	aws-ec2
really the decision comes down to whether you pay for a fully managed subversion repository that is pre-configured such as that offered by cloud forge or beanstalk or whether instead you pay for an infrastructure-as-a-service iaas cloud-hosting service such as compute engine aws-ec2 or azure for a virtual-machine and take responsibility for the setup of the subversion server on that virtual-machine instances take responsibility for the security and access-control of that virtual-machine and take responsibility for the domain named ssl certificates etc

2531627
postgresql	mysql
apache thin nginx sqlite mysql postgresql many parsing libs rmagick tcp-ip etc are c programs used by ruby

2531643
spaces	output
note that there is a spaces at the end of that line .when you output it

2531651
any	set
if you set http at the server level then requiressl does not matter setting it on or off should not make any difference

2531668
python	java
having coded a bit in python i ve found that clojure is as a general rules much much much faster than python and you can usually get a clojure program to get within 2x-4x of the speed of pure java

2531689
.when	ready
and load the css-sprites .when dom is ready this can sort of preload the image before user hovers on the submit button

2531703
macros	basic
to add to dnolen s answer .when doing python vs clojure timing contents you might want to package your basic unit of work as a function and then use the time macros in clojure or the timeit.timeit function in python

2531711
panels	grid
custom-controls you can inherited from controls panels grid other controls as well gives power to reuse re-theme etc

2531724
punctuation	words
e.g. if you have a list of words sent that make up the sequences shorn of punctuation and lowercased for simplicity is all you need to make a list of non-stopwords -- could hardly be easier right

2531750
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
c functions deal with dynamic-memory-allocation only malloc calloc realloc

2531766
updating	updates
the only way to avoid this problem would required pre-populating the database only once and then manually updating rows each time there s an updates

2531766
hash	md5
a hash value that i generator for each animal using md5 that i ll assume is unique

2531798
uitextview	nsstring
i have looked through the uitextview and nsstring class references and can t find any methods that could accomplish this

2531808
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is based on safari .so if you can find a plugins for safari you should be able to use this in google-chrome

2531815
contains	any
if somebody s last named would be o riley or any other named that contains characters which should normally be sanitized before handling and i would send it unescaped wouldn t it mess with the scripting email sending

2531841
autotools	gnu
read more on gnu autotools

2531845
32-bit	16-bit
while generally not a problem today many older video cards only support one of 15 16-bit and one of 24 32-bit

2531860
value	field
get other field s value

2531860
value	field
the cmd field value result 1 is not character a

2531860
value	field
i think this because the first field value of the frame is 0x02 stx occupying 3 first places in the arrays frame and leading to the wrong results on the receiver side

2531886
uitextview	nstextview
i m contemplating subclassing uiscrollview the way uitextview does to draw a fairly large amount of text formatted in ways that nstextview can t

2531892
android-emulator	adb
can t you just use adb to pull the database off of the android-emulator

2531902
arrays	loops
i know i m probably missing something easy but i have a foreach loops and i m trying to modify the value of the first arrays and output a new arrays with the modifications as the new value

2531911
fwrite	fread
note that fread and fwrite are not recommended for use with structured-data

2531922
fwrite	fread
you can still use the fread and fwrite call to read and write data from and to a file but you should read and write each elements of the data structure individually rather than reading or writing the whole struct at once

2531929
getter	setter
finally you can create a readonly properties by giving it a getter but no setter like this

2531934
background-color	font-size
however there are difference between the ie way and the standards way for example the ie element.currentstyle properties expect that you access the ccs properties named composed of two or more words in camelcase maxheight font-size background-color etc the standards way expects the properties with the words separated with dashes max-height font-size background-color etc

2531943
executable	jar
in my package there is a .jar file which is executable a scripting which will run this jar file and a .so file for fmod

2531945
message-queue	reactor
it uses a windows message-queue to signals that a handle is read for read write whatever .so it doesn t have the concurrency benefits of iocp but it allows you to implements a standards reactor without having a limit to the numbers of handles like wsawaitformultipleevents

2531946
spring	jsf
it all spiraled out from there with spring bringing in the wave of dependency-injection then jsf was more complicated than ever

2531962
packaging	building
i strongly recommend building your package from source within the debian packaging infrastructure

2531978
swing	gwt
currently i had a project gwt j2ee and swing which i need to use eclipse please do not ask why

2531988
arrays	loops
the postgresql server caching query results until you actually retrieve them .so adding them to the arrays in a loops like that will cause an exhaustion of memory no matter what

2531990
oncreate	onstart
however oncreate will indeed be called and your application can call onstart from there

2531997
udp	tcp
in the end at the levels where java will operate there s either udp or tcp

2531997
udp	tcp
if you can deal with udp s limitations you ll find it faster and if you can t then any lightweight tcp wrapper of which http is one is just about the same

2532011
any	set
match any characters not in the w set except hyphen

2532013
any	set
generally every v smallcase set is negated by a v uppercase where v is any letter that defined a set

2532043
children	nodes
i m assuming that i ll need to somehow loops through all children of the elements that matches the selector and accumulate all text nodes other than ones within elementss

2532046
payment	billing
user post payment and billing information to the server via an html form

2532053
ip-address	hostname
following up to regular expression to match hostname or ip-address

2532058
portrait	screens
how to rotate the screens to landscape or portrait by programmable way

2532095
contains	lookup
to do much for a like where the pattern has the form xxx you want to lookup sql-server s full-text indexing capability and use contains instead of like

2532106
selected	checkbox
i want to get the selected checkbox in my code

2532106
selected	checkbox
how i can get those selected checkbox in a stackpanel

2532107
data-members	private
is there any particular reason that all data-members in a class are private by default in c++

2532114
postgresql	mysql
looks like some databases postgresql 7.1+ mysql v3.23.23+ microsoft-sql v

2532116
data-members	private
the goal is to have private implementation details such as data-members be private

2532129
32-bit	64bit
i am having trouble understanding the difference between a 32-bit processor and 64bit processor

2532129
32-bit	64bit
i know that a 32-bit processor can access 32-bit at a time while a 64bit processor can access 64bit at a time

2532143
32-bit	64bit
though there is more difference between 32-bit and 64bit architectures than this

2532160
firefox	safari
this wordpress site works fine in firefox and safari

2532163
associations	model
i have the following model associations a student model and has_many scores

2532163
average	min	average	max
i need to make a list showing their named and average min max scores

2532166
required	checked
i have a .net 3.5 site with required ssl option checked

2532166
contains	any
after submission any form i got a messages the page contains both secure and nonsecure items and if i click yes it changes the url from ... to ...

2532173
value	field
i would like to generator a query that selected all the users but also add another field column say network_status that depends on the value of user_accepted and fiend_accepted

2532180
32-bit	64bit
a program generally has to be compiled with 64bit support to take advantage of the speed-up and even then you usually won t see a difference unless you re manipulating data larger than 32-bit can store

2532180
multiplication	addition
edit lest people get the wrong idea by operations i m not specifically referring to the operations addition multiplication etc.

2532192
fflush	gets
it can be related to some kind of buffering that only gets fflush ie send data .when

2532232
waveform	pcm
i have the code to encode my waveform as linear pcm 44100hz mono 8 bits per sample

2532252
any	set
lately we have seen that developers have not set setfocusonerror on any of the validaor controls used.we have to set this properties

2532269
groovy	java
it s already in wide use in a numbers of prominent java product such as aspectj groovy cobertura and many others which promise a wide user-base and thus a wide community for support

2532275
http	ssl
this will usually happen .when you are sourcing some of your page via ssl using the http protocols and some of it from regular http protocols most likely images or scripting or css files

2532300
build-process	release
then .when i m building the release versioning i ll write a very simple tool to fit into my build-process which will discover all the scripting i reference from the .html pages and concatenation them into one file and replace the multiple elements with a single one .so that only one request is necessary in the release versioning

2532322
scalatest	junit
scalatest and specifications provide traits you can mix in to your tests .so they are compatible with junit

2532337
cygwin	gnu
if you want to develop windows-applications as opposed to pthreads ones as supportsed by the bloated cygwin from the command-line the best solution is to get the mingw ports of gcc from twilight dragon and the msys ports of the standards gnu tools such as make

2532350
spaces	output
output is quite strange with lotsa free spaces and empty line and sometimes more than one ref paths are on one line bunched together

2532364
checkboxlist	datalist
datalist checkboxlist

2532391
openoffice.org	uno	openoffice.org	apache-poi
if leniel s suggestion doesn t work i would suggest trying apache-poi first as well there s the openoffice.org java uno api which has a different implementation

2532396
javascript	dom
javascript call this methods from the applet .so that i don t have to deal with the clunky applet gui and then i can create the response on the dom easily from javascript

2532399
oracle	mysql
db connection handler classes handling multi-connections to different databases and different servers such as mysql oracle etc.

2532399
introspection	typechecking
you can go further and implements automated handling of table relations field typechecking using introspection on your tables table and field alias support etc

2532405
uiscrollview	subviews
all that uiscrollview does .when the user scrolls is updates its bounds rectangle which causes the scroll views subviews to move

2532407
environment	building
environment building 1.6.0_17-b04-248-10m3025

2532430
hide	show
i suppose i can do a hide show to get back to the first div

2532440
children	nodes
if .blueflip nodes are not children of the corresponding .link_button nodes you might need to introduce some trickery into your object ids

2532450
realloc	malloc
you ll have to checked for allocation errors after call to malloc and realloc

2532477
python	perl
you can write cgi scripting in perl python c bash or even assembly

2532493
comet	chat
i need to create a simple browser chat using a comet webserver

2532495
boolean	int
i have some configuration blocks that i read from a file int boolean floats and

2532495
getter	setter
the fact is that i have many such configuration parameters 15 or .so and writing getter and setter seems an unnecessary overhead

2532503
protected	public
it sounds like you just need to make these members protected - that way they can be accessed by derived classes but are not public

2532512
revision	svn
is there a commend to delete project from svn with all its revision total cleanup

2532513
export	report
report is being show alright but .when printing button or export button is pressed nothing happens

2532513
directory	folder
earlier .when i install the application in a new virtual directory report was not getting show then i ve copy-paste aspnet_client folder in my newly created web application root and the report was then made visible

2532527
highlight	cell
the issue is that since i m using string arrays to write data which is a mixture of strings and floats excel highlight every cell that contains numeric data with the messages numbers stored as text

2532536
ruby-on-rails	django
for production environment you have to choose carefuly the best option the one which is the mostly resource-friendly your framework django ruby-on-rails asp.net etc. needs

2532545
svnadmin	dump
to svnadmin dump your repository then

2532548
stdin	pipe
makes android-emulator to start with pipe attached to stdin and stdout placed into tmp and circular log files of stdin and stdout plus nodes liveness marks placed into some log dir

2532548
stdin	pipe
connect to stdin and stdout pipe

2532581
contains	elements
rather than use the color css use the class to target elements and add a new class that contains the color css

2532595
controllers	routes
is there any simple route for codeigniter that doesn t overrides the other controllers routes

2532617
.when	ready
this is a caching timing issue dom ready doesn t mean all the images are loaded..and .when they re not you see the problem in that page some of the last images to load get left out

2532625
any	set
i would like to efficiently remove the elements of set equals to p but i can t do this with any of the members of set or any of the standards algorithms since is a completely different types to

2532635
contains	set
instead wrap the set in a class which manages the lifetimes of the pointers that the set contains

2532646
lookup	any
this means you could only theoretically compute all possible paths from any positioning of a mxm matrix to the lower right corner and then use this matrix to quickly lookup the numbers of paths

2532675
aspect-ratio	scale
this still won t scale the image proportionally maintaining aspect-ratio

2532708
simulink	matlab
is there anything i can do with code in matlab for digital image-processing that i can t do with simulink s digital image-processing toolbox or vice versa

2532720
version-control	git
do i have to use version-control systemd like svn or git for integration

2532724
margins	padding
the issue is because of margins and padding...if you remove it on that you ll see that the hover ends where elements without margins or padding would

2532727
getter	setter
this is probably overkill but it illustrates how you should create getter setter in python and achieve the functionality you want

2532754
seam	jsf
since seam is buser-interfacelt on jsf it has large numbers of user-interface component libs to pick from

2532754
spring	seam
seam framework would be a better choice as spring is anyway extensible enough to be leveraged by seam

2532760
panels	grid
the middle panels show one grid where the blue line are overlapped by a functional area

2532760
panels	grid
the rightmost panels show how i could do it with nested grid

2532783
fflush	stdio
.so if you are going to use stdio in both the parent and child then you should fflush before fork to ensure that there is no buffering data

2532783
stderr	fflush	stderr	stdout	stderr	stdio	stdout	stdio	fflush	stdio	fflush	stdout
in particular avoid printing the error to stdout or stderr using any stdio function write is ok and then call _exit or _exit rather than calling exit or just returning which will fflush any buffering output

2532787
positioning	slider
i want to then based on this slider value swap all the colors in the arrays based on the colors next color based on the positioning in the arrays

tuples	any
can any one suggest the query .so that my_score is calculated for all tuples

2532858
put	get
.when you put everything in one grid with span columns and or rows - you would get a hard to manage layout

2532874
panels	grid
i would personally go with your middle layout using a single grid with column and row spans to structure the overall layout of the user-interface then put a panels in each of those sections to contains the actual controls and possible further detailed layout

2532893
value	field
this depends on whether field is a value or a reference

2532893
boolean	int
generally speaking basic int and boolean types are usually value-type and everything else is up in the air -- some languages make strings value and others treat them as references etc

2532893
constructor	object	value	field
classtwo takes a classone parameter -- a reference-type -- in its constructor and sets its own int field based on the value of the classone object it is given and then changes the classone object s value

2532893
constructor	object
because classes are reference-type changing the classone object in the classtwo constructor causes the original object to be changed

2532908
rollback	commit
saying that it may be that in more complex code you want to do a partials commit for example rather than rollback the entire transactional

2532935
authentication	login
internal users automatically authentication external users required login

2532943
communication	messages
the client side fetion just like a instant communication tool can send receive messages to from other people who are using mobile to receive send sms

2532943
python	java
my core program is based on java .so i need to take this python program into java environment

2532945
webserver	azure
in azure you need to pay for at least 1 instances webserver to run per hour

2532957
base-class	inherited
person is the base-class which has 3 classes that inherited from it

2532961
string.format	stringbuilder
i won t go into the details and just say that stringbuilder turned out to be most efficient overtime .when compared to string stringbuffer string.format messageformat.

2532964
arrays	loops
--make a foreach loops for the grid and if they are empty set the arrays value to null else set the value to the image associated with it

2532974
managed-code	unmanaged
the only way to catch an unmanaged exception-handling inside managed-code is in this format

2532980
postback	ajax
i recently had a problem in a web application where on an ajax postback the datetime coming back to my server-side code was different from the datetime served out

2532981
while-loop	loops	while-loop	infinite
also now would be a nice way to learn about the while-loop infinite loops and write without the function-calls at all e.g

2532983
python	c++
written with for python c++ c# .net

2532990
python	java	python	c++

it works great over wifi but doesn t work at all on 3g-network

2533004
python	java	python	c++
nss works with c++ and has binding for java and python although i m not sure if it has .net mono binding yet

2533006
domdocument	domxpath
if you want to use xpath to find specific elements nodes either simplexmlelement xpath or domxpath which you would use with domdocument as pointed out by cletus you have to register the namespace first

2533016
uilabel	uiview
methods where you can create your custom view may be uiview with uilabel and uiimageview in your case and return it - .so uipickerview will use it for row representation

2533028
contains	elements
is it possible to have sets which can contains several identical elements

2533029
python	php
say if the .dll or .lib is written in c can it be used by other languages like php python

2533041
windows-server	windows
the service also has to be hosted on windows-server 2003 which means it will have to be a windows service

2533044
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
a decision was made to remove mono support from the main sharpdevelop application since only support for compiling with mono was provided and monodevelop can now run on windows

2533044
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
note that mono support in sharpdevelop does not provide any integrated debugging with mono s debugger and there is no gtk# designer compared with monodevelop

2533047
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements
a collections that contains no duplicates elements

2533047
contains	elements
more formally sets contains no pair of elementss e1 and e2 such that e1.equals e2 and at most one null elements

2533062
getter	setter
the getter and setter among many other useful functions are generator for you similar to a struct

2533077
postgresql	rdbms
if you fit in a few machines without scale and you don t need super performance for multi request as for example in social network - where lot of users send http-request and you don t think you involve saleability take rdbms postgresql have some good functions and structures which you can use like arrays column types

2533081
constructor	private
the private constructor in the singleton example just assures that only the static getinstance methods from the same class can access the constructor

2533095
aes	rsa
the standards python libs implements common ciphers like aes and rsa is pycrypto

2533101
linux	osx
i don t believe the libs will building on osx -- it relies on the linux usb architecture -- but if you need to write your own sync libs it will provide you with a good starting points to understand the protocols and device workings

2533103
constructor	object
there is then class2 which is apparently has a constructor that accepts an object parameter of field types and contains a methods that uses an instances of field to triggers a local methods in this class

2533132
value	field	numeric	zero
i have two widget that can be checked and a numeric entry field that should contains a value greater than zero

2533132
widget	button	value	field	numeric	zero
whenever both widget have been checked and the numeric entry field contains a value greater than zero a button should be enabled

2533138
abstract-factory	singleton
a bit like misusing abstract to combine the complexity of an abstract-factory with the restraints of a singleton

2533140
hamcrest	lambdaj
in his last release lambdaj implements it with a smart use of closure and hamcrest matcher

2533165

it s treating as an expression using the comma-operator which returns the right operands as its result

2533177
specifications	w3c
not possible according to w3c specifications

2533180
abstract	extends
but if your intention is to create an abstract singleton from which to extends from you can do .so like this

2533187
hamcrest	lambdaj
if you find the native java switching construct is too much limiting give a glance to the lambdaj switchinger that allows to declarative switching on any object by matching them with some hamcrest matchers

2533190
hamcrest	lambdaj
if you find the native java switching construct is too much limiting give a glance to the lambdaj switchinger that allows to declarative switching on any object by matching them with some hamcrest matchers

2533202
constructor	object
in the documentation they tell me to create a class that overrides itemizedoverlay but in the constructor i m asked to provide a drawable object

2533207
tuples	set
with the table-valued function you will be able to return a whole set of outid amount tuples

2533272
for-loop	arrays
just do a regular for-loop from 0 to the size of the arrays

2533274
codeigniter	cakephp
the most popular php frameworks cakephp symphony codeigniter etc. all have router code in them which you might be able to use or might serve as inspiration

2533279
proxy-server	apache
if you use nginx as a proxy-server in front of apache you can use its memcaching module to serve caching html output directly from memcaching

2533288
gunzip	cat
cat list.txt | xargs gunzip -c | . a.out

2533297
tcp-ip	udp
i am going for an interview day after tomorrow where i will be asked vaious questions related to tcp-ip and udp

2533303
arrays	loops
therefor your inner foreach loops resets every time the arrays pointers that s why you are getting out only a terrible mess

2533311
attributes	properties
you are trying to do the exact opposite of this - you have a class that does not have any actual properties just an attributes dictionary and you want compile-time safety

2533311
attributes	properties
if you find you re writing a lot of repetitive code for the same attributes then start worrying about adding shortcut properties or extension methods to the class

2533313
cassini	iis
this is not a ninject problem really it seems to be an issue with cassini the webserver built into vs2k8 which handles these request differently than iis would handle them

2533319
unsigned	short
char signed char unsigned char int unsigned int signed int short int unsigned short int signed short int all occupy same no

2533319
32-bit	64bit
of bytes on both 32-bit 64bit processor

2533319
32-bit	64bit
the only change is in long int long-long int both of these occupy 32-bit on 32-bit machine 64bit on 64bit machine

2533319
32-bit	64bit
and also the pointers which take 32-bit on 32-bit cpu 64bit on 64bit cpu

2533319
32-bit	64bit
i mean how can one maintain same pointers size on both 64bit 32-bit machine

2533321
python	lua	python	java	python	c++	c++	lua
v-rep 3d source available lua scripting apis for c++ python java matlab urbi 2 physics engines full kinematic solver etc.

2533330
compatibility	platform
the rea.son for all these difference between platform is that by the time c got standardized there was already many c compilers used on a plethora of different platform .so for backward compatibility all these varieties had to be accepted as valid

2533331
udp	tcp
what is the essential difference between tcp and udp

2533334
pointers	stack
once in foo the old base pointers value is also pushed onto stack 2

2533334
pointers	stack
the stack-pointers is saved as the base pointers for this stack frame 3

2533334
pointers	stack
.so stack contains this value then the old base pointers then the return address

2533335
checkbox	button
along with that is an advanced button that brings up another dialog wherein one finds a checkbox to allow or disallow the raising and lowering of windows by page code

2533336
directory	folder
.when i try .some other directory it says the directory has no tools folder .so i ve searched for a tools folder but none of those found of 15 or 20 appear to be android

2533338
32-bit	64bit
apparently the designers of the c compiler you re using for 64bit compilation decided int should remain 32-bit

2533340
textbox	button
in the design area i have added some graphical components button textbox but i can t move these within the specified area as their positioning remains unchanged

2533352
32-bit	64bit
for example using visual-c++ long would be 32-bit even on 64bit machines

2533353
derived-class	base-class
if the member is declare as public in the base-class adding a using-declaration for base f in the derived-class public section would ve fix the problem

2533361
derived-class	base-class	protected	public
since you make the named public in the derived-class anyway .so derived-classes of derived will be able to access them you could make them protected in the base-class too and omit the friend declaration

2533375
overwrite	copying	pointers	stack
copying the given pointers s data psrc to that char arrat cbuff overwrite stack frame s data which will result in a possible exploit

2533375
pointers	stack
this technique is used by hackers - they send a specially crafted arrays of chars which will overwrite the pointers to the return address on stack and change it to their desired location at the memory

2533377
accelerometer	gyroscope
i managed to get the quaternion through the accelerometer but i cant figure out how to do it with the gyroscope

2533392
subtract	add
checked hasattr c __eq__ would be misleading as it might erroneously catch a per-instance attributes __eq__ defined in c itself which would not act as a special methods note that in the specific case of __eq__ you ll always see a true result from hasattr because ancestry class object defined it and inherited can only ever add attributess never subtract any

2533400
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
the requirements in the standards just give a minimum range for the types -- 8 bits for char 16-bit for short and int 32-bit for long and in c99 64bit for long-long and every types in that list must have at least as large a range as the preceding types

2533407
linux	unix
if their code is in a separate jvm and is running on linux or some other unix required them to run their program at nice 20

2533407
virtual-machine	virtualbox
or you could have them run inside a virtual-machine like virtualbox and use it to limit the processor utilization

2533412
unmanaged	c++-cli
either use com or write a c++-cli wrapper that call your c# dialog then call this c++-cli wrapper from your unmanaged c++ code

2533420
administration	account
you asked how to change the user that hudson runs as you need to edit the service control panel- administration tools- service double click the hudson service and change the log on to this account

2533428
templating	mako
if you prefer a less usual styles with lots of logic in the templates an architecture that many do consider weird consider alternative templating systemdd such as mako because the django templating systemd is really designed against such weird architecture

2533437
python	java
xmpp is a powerful and flexible messaging protocols and this article show how to do the gae side of it in both java and python

2533493
triggers	insert
the best way to go is probably martin smith s suggestion to use an instead of insert triggers

2533507
implements	abstract
however java doesn t concern itself with how the platform implements these specific features and java is unaware of anything beyond the abstract layer

2533525
double	int
i don t know what you are trying to achieve but use double instead of int if you don t want the integer-division

2533533
triggers	insert
if that isn t suitable and you want to prevent even people with sysadmin permissions from insert to the table directly well you can t but you can make sure that it doesn t happen accidentally by using an instead of insert triggers that raises an error and rollback unless a certain context_info value is set then clears the context_info your stored procedure could set this to the expected value

2533563
python	java
i have seen this standards in java as well as in python

2533578
ip-address	proxy
btw .some of the users are using internal ip-address behind a gateway or proxy like 10.10.xxx.xxx -- .so in this scenario two users can not use points to points messages transfer if both of them are behind a gateway

2533605
spring	guice
one of the things i m confused about is whether all of your object initializer needs to be controlled by the di framework spring guice etc

2533614
json	xml
i have a more critical issue on my current project as we ve standardized on json as our human-readable data encoding and most logging frameworks i ve seen required xml

2533614
json	xml	configuration	logging
i would really rather avoid using json for 95 of my apps configuration and xml for the rest just because of the logging framework truth be told i hate xml used for anything other than text markup its original intended purpose

2533623
contains	set
then the algorithm tries to find the best selector that contains everything in the selected set and nothing in the rejected set

2533623
heuristics	greedy
this happens in simplifycss and is a heuristics approach that greedy removes elements with a pre-defined preferences order

2533645
attributes	properties
ideally i can fill the attributes to this clerk object as another properties in some way

2533696
.war	jar
module limbo ejb jar is in dependency of module lust .war

2533713
directory	folder
for instances i would like to create a task that will checkout a particular folder from my repository and then symlink it into the shared directory of the main project on my server

2533714
python	c++
it s free useable from c++ and python

2533716
reflection	runtime
you would only use them .when you a want to generator a different types of code from c# source at runtime or b want to use reflection but provide some measure of compile-time safety

2533716
environment	building
.so if you re building your own runtime environment or asp.net-mvc you definitely want to learn everything you can

2533731
directory	folder
try getting a list of all the folder in the directory then generator a random numbers up to the numbers of folder then choose the folder that relates to your random numbers

2533732
switching	screens
i also want the user to be able to switching focus between the game windows and other windowss as much as he she wants without any weird screens glitches

2533751
.when	ready
applicationdidfinishlaunching is the best place to do it if you re worried about fast loading a better approach would be to caching the data in your plist or nsuserdefaults and then updates it a couple hundred millisecs later .when the db is ready

2533765
asp.net-mvc	wcf
a main project with my asp.net-mvc .app a silverlight .application and a silverlight enabled wcf service project

2533765
asp.net-mvc	wcf
that would be very weird since i have a reference between my main asp.net-mvc .app with the model and my wcf service

2533774
order	add
edit also just to add the execution-time is in the order of hours

2533800
value	field
then if i try to parsing the xml to a city object i get the field named with a null value

2533801
dependency-injection	service-locator
using this term can help distinguish between the dependency-injection pattern where you will usually only refer to the di framework in a single place and the service-locator pattern where you will use it to create access object in multiple places throughout your application

2533831
scala	java
closure folding makes java programming slightly more tolerable after writing scala

2533836
jquery-slider	slider
i am using the jquery-slider control for use as a double sided slider dual slider

2533866
duplicates	elements
a set by definition cannot have duplicates elements

2533866
duplicates	elements
duplicates is defined by the elements s equality see its equals and hashcode methods

2533916
bazaar	git
having said that hg can interact with a git-repo using hg-git and bazaar might be able to interact with both hg and git

2533916
bazaar	git	push	pull
there s also a git-bazaar project to allow one to use git to pull push from a bazaar repository

2533925
playstation	xbox
what kind of frameworks libs are used to develop cross console -platform games like ones that get release on xbox 360 playstation 3 at the same time

2533925
playstation	xbox
or similarly xbox live playstation network wiiware all at once

2533968
xquery	xslt
.when i use the cmd syntax for xquery it doesn t recognize the parameters like -q and gives xslt usage information

2533974
ws-security	wsse
upon receipt of my response messages the java client and wss4j seem to want to lookup elements by their own internal xml alias such as wsa for ws-addressing and wsse for ws-security extensions

2533974
any	set
i am wondering if there is any simple way to transform an xml document from one set of namespaces to another set using c# .net and the system.xml namespace

2533979
arrays	loops
i do not know c++ but here is a general idea of loops assuming the value are coming from an arrays

2533979
arrays	loops
use a for-loops structure opposed to a while to loops over each elements of the arrays

2534066
any	set
question -- is there any way to set up a single structure which updates both of these

2534073
protected	public
i ve always wondered on the topic of public protected and private properties

2534073
getter	setter
i should note here that using public variables is not in my habit i adhere to the principles of oop by utilizing getter and setter

2534091
getter	setter
therefore you d create a public setter getter with some logic checked if something is null or any other calculations instead of accessing the private variables directly and always having to handle that logic in your code

2534092
postgresql	mysql
other searches include using key and indexes which might lead you to postgresql for it s rock solid acid compliance or mysql with innodb

2534095
protected	public
the whole points is to use private and protected to prevent exposing internal details of your class .so that other classes only have access to the public interfaces provided by your class

2534105
getter	setter
note properties in smalltalk are simply getter and setter methods.

2534113
compact-framework	.net
is there a way to dertimine which .net compact-framework versioning is running on my systemd

2534127
exponent	modulo
i m trying to ports a piece of java code into .net that takes a base64 encode string converts it to a byte arrays and then uses it to make a x509 to get the modulo exponent for rsa encryption

2534139
push	pull
option 1 pull push

2534145
strategy-pattern	decorator
i usually favor composition decorator or the strategy-pattern

2534161
asp.net-core	asp.net-mvc
i d recommend setting routeexistingfiles back to false .so that router and the asp.net-mvc pipeline don t handle these request iis and asp.net-core do

2534186
getter	setter
i m going to assume you mean instance-variables since you mention getter setter

2534192
authentication	login
it will have login page and once authentication the user will be taken to a welcome screens which will have links to add view updates and delete users

2534193
windows-xp	windows
we do commercial software development using delphi 2009 in a windows-xp virtual-pc hosted on windows 7

2534219
any	set
then checked each words of length m+2 against the valid set of length m+1 dropping any that can t be reduced

2534220
click	mouse
i am impressed with the animation .when the mouse is click and zooming into images from different angle

2534227
compact-framework	.net
by default windows-mobile 5 comes with .net compact-framework 1.0 sp3 pre-installed

2534227
compact-framework	.net
an application developed for windows-mobile 6 is at least going to use .net compact-framework 2.0 sp2 therefore make sure that it is install on the windows-mobile 5 device

2534228
gwt-rpc	gwt
you may want to consider using gwt-rpc instead of rest if you know you re going to be using gwt for the frontend

2534235
base-class	inherited
the general practice is as you describe to create a non-generics base-class interface then a generics class interface that implements inherited from it

2534247
sql-server	mysql
an indexed view is sql-server terminology for a materialize view which mysql does not support

2534259
constructor	object
also worth noting is that if you re doing objective-c++ c++ object that are ivars of objective-c object are not initializer their constructor are not called by default

2534261
object-reference	instances
error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2534266
click	mouse
a panels contains two labels which are generator by mouse click on the panels

2534266
click	mouse
there are two events here - one is click on the panels to generator the labels and the second is connecting these two labels mouse pressed mouse dragged and mouse release events

2534274
python	java
bdd methods are nice but with a systemd that is .so tied to structure tying into the language and unit-testing seems like a must for it to be worth it and it seems to be hard to find .something to work well with both python and java my two main languages

2534282
arrays	loops
then i would defined my parameter object open the connection then loops through the arrays assign the value to the parameter object and execution the statement

2534295
contains	set
in this example the variables undefined is set to the value true as well and x is set to the value contains in the variables undefined which is true

2534297
pascal	basic
for me java was not a huge leap from c++ which was not a huge leap from c which was not a leap at all from pascal nor basic etc.

2534297
scala	java
i guess in scala you can code in java styles or scala styles

2534308
postgresql	mysql
it support multiple database including postgresql and mysql

2534309
append	input
i ve written a simple javascript function that places the cursor at the end of the contents of an input box .when it receives focus the most common action in the box being to append

2534313
callback	methods
to do .so you don t need to pass a callback to the begingetrequeststream methods you can pass a null instead

2534316
python	perl
if everyone likes python more than perl for whatever reason they are probably going to get more done in python

2534316
python	ruby
if they like ruby more than python it s the same thing

2534316
python	perl
for instances fisheye has a java-api and some rest examples for perl and python

2534316
perl	ruby	python	java	python	ruby	python	perl
this is most likely a good thing in python perl ruby java and almost any other language that you might choose

2534316
smalltalk	lisp
those languages should include ones that have vastly different assumptions about how people express problems say for example the set smalltalk perl c lisp java

2534316
perl	ruby	textmate	emacs
perl people tend to like vi or emacs ruby people tend to like textmate java people tend to like eclipse or intellij

2534342
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
.when you set up your uitabbarcontroller you should add uinavigationcontroller rather than your uiviewcontroller subclassing

2534357
nonblocking	epoll
i have written a single-threaded asynchronous server in c running on linux the socket is nonblocking and as for polling i am using epoll

2534358
lgpl	gpl
even if you manage to finesse the issue much easier with lgpl stuff that full gpl the community may react badly

2534378
system-tray	tray
i want to make an .app which on loading sits in the system-tray and even after i open another program say notepad or vlc or anything even .when the .app is not in focus and if i press g on my keyboard the tray icons should show a tooltip - key g is pressed

2534400
keyboard	mouse
it lets you hook both mouse and keyboard systemd wide very easy

2534416
mathjax	katex
sounds like mathjax or katex could be just what you want

2534441
contains	set
i have a form that contains datagridview whose coloumn are set to

2534447
postgresql	mysql
what do you recommend me to use with erlang -- mysql or postgresql

2534453
boolean	int
i know int boolean are a much better way to do this but i m working with strings and changing the schema is not an option

2534458
signals	sigpipe
the next write on the socket after that points will result in the epipe error and the sigpipe signals if it was not suppressed

2534480
debugging	exit
i m debugging from the python con.sole and would like to reload a module every time i make a change .so i don t have to exit the con.sole and re-enter it

2534484
firefox	safari
firefox and safari also offer scrollbylines and ie has doscroll but the scrolltop properties is cross-browser and simpler to use

2534487
protected	public
i am wondering if it is possible to set visual-studio ide .so it highlight private protected public variables of the class differently as well as change formatting on locals variables that are either passed in or declare inside a function like this

2534488
any	set
for strings - you can use any expression in the set clause

2534488
any	set
in both versioning if published is null it will set to 1 as any comparison with null is false

2534501
automake	cmake
go with a simple makefile and use more sophisticated stuff like cmake automake etc. only .when it becomes necessary

2534505
schema	rdbms
yes sometimes rdbms are not the best solution although there are ways to accomodate user defined field see xml datatype eav design pattern or just have spare generics columns sometimes a schema free database is a good choice

if the table contains sensitive data there are many techniques to enhance security http_request won t give you http support directly but you can encrypt the data you export and decrypt on import look for ssl on the php manual for further details

2534874
csv	xml
you don t need a transfer format such as xml or csv in-memory representation within the php is enough since now both tasks are done within the same scripting

php is better than perl because

2534952
perl	php
syntax-wise you will find php is often easier to understand than perl particularly .when you have little experience

2534952
perl	php	configuration	environment
i believe the reason perl is used less often in shared-hosting environment is that historically the perceived slowness of cgi and hosts unwillingness to install mod_perl due to security and configuration issues has made php a more attractive option

2534952
webserver	security
the speed difference and security issues are rendering moot by fastcgi these days and in most cases php is run out of fastcgi as well rather than leaving it in the core of the webserver

2534955

you can use eclipse to compare jar .war files

2535143
.war	jar
i m using indigo it seems eclipse only support jar comparison hence i have to rename the .war extension to jar to get eclipse to do the structural comparison

2535147
environment	building
you can use profiling to make building a bit different for different environment nightly building release normals developer building and .so on

2535162

the only way to deal with this is to wrap all of the activity in a try-catch block and save any exception-handling that occurred which is exactly what the backgroundworker does

2535184
openoffice.org	uno
you could use openoffice.org s uno api

2535213

internet-explorer	quirks-mode
internet-explorer 6 also uses quirks-mode if there is an xml-declaration prior to the document types declaration

2535280
value	field
i am not sure if this applies to postgresql or not but in most databases if we consider that there may be nulls and that the question was really if the secondperson field is not null then you must explicit include nulls in the conditional rather than the blank value

2535285
factors	primes
it will be much faster to remove the small factors until the residue is primes

2535286

perl	php
.when php came to the scene everyone were impressed with main difference from perl

2535514
reflection	runtime
you can use reflection bytecode decompilation to examine what the generics types methods actually compile to at runtime

2535529
double	int
that is in c++ you can shove a function pointers into a function pointers variables declare with the wrong function signature or even an int a double or worse with appropriate coaxing and the compiler will be happy to produce code that call the function completely incorrectly

2535531
readfile	fopen
as for reading the file simply make sure you open it in read binary mode if using fopen or simply use the createfile and readfile win32 api and it will be binary mode by default

2535536
synchronous	.when
it would simply invoke the delegation synchronous in the context of the calling thread and return .when completed

perl	php
perl 6 classes are closer to php classes but still quite different

2535739
perl	php
perl 6 is different from perl 5 in many other ways but that s off topic. many of the difference between perl 5 and php arise from the fact that most of the oo features are not built-in to perl but based on hacks

switching	screens
given a stack that display characters to the screens fifo fifo how do you switching it to display them last in first out lifo

2539360
arguments	default
if you must use html-entities you have to tell it your encoding is utf-8 in the optional arguments else it will stupidly default to treating all your bytes as iso-8859-1 and encode them to inappropriate entity references one for each byte

2539360

webforms	asp.net
my own superficial research seems to conclude that jsf supports .some kind of custom-controls bear in mind i am not only talking about layout reuse but al.so behavior reuse .so if for example the customer client wants a customer list on page x and not only on page y he would simply put in a fictional example with asp.net webforms syntax

filtering	grouping
the types of product should still flow through and be accessible and the regular grouping filtering shouldn t mutate the types that is flowing through the extension methods

2539910
attributes	properties
i know it s something wrong with the indirect properties targeting or partials path qualification in my doubleanimation s storyboard.targetproperties attributes

2539918
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms is notoriously hard to building unit tests for due to the built-in dependencies on static httpapplication and httpcontext object and the leaky abstraction of the page lifecycle

2539929
contains	elements
one would be to iterate over the elements on the page and checked if the src attributes contains the desired scripting named and then extraction the path you want

2539931
contact	submit
the output on the site simple states there was an error with there has been an error - please try to submit the contact form again if you continue to experience problems please notify our webmaster. this is just a simple messages it pops out of it gets to the catch part of the email function

visual-studio	release-mode
i ve made a simple opencv application with visual-studio 2008 and i ve built it in both release-mode and debugging mode.it works fine from my computer but .when i try to run it from another computer which doesn t have opencv install or has another versioning of visual-studio with opencv it doesn t work

2540007
netbeans-platform	netbeans
for starters this question is not .so much about programming in the netbeans ide as developing a netbeans project using the netbeans-platform framework

2540044
enumerator	any
an enumerator in c# is used to provide named for some known value but any int value is permissible in that enumerator whether it has a named equivalent or not

what is the best way to capture the int from the input-field and have it correspond to the checkbox .so i can use it to calculate the total later on

2540055
shell	tcsh
but unfortunately i cant get the same thing on tcsh shell

2540059
dot-product	transpose
i d have to transpose each arrays to nx1 and that s pretty lame since i d be doing it for every dot-product calculation

2540062
value	field
you can create a status field with value of 0 for closed 1 for open or whatever conventions you want to use

2540073
put	get
this design is pretty nice because the threads will no longer have to compete for a lock to updates data and since the map is confined to a single thread you can simply use a plain hashmap to do get put etc

2540073
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
another benefit is that since only one thread reads and writes to the map plain hashmap and primitive long types can be used no concurrenthashmap or atomicity typess involved

2540101
put	get
imagine building the table of contents toc then click on each heading subheading to get a separate windows where you put the content

2540119
any	set
is there any way to set the return code of dtexec on package failure

2540146

however the named properties in the iidentity interface is readonly the iidentity interface specifies a getter but not a setter for the named properties

2540154
member-functions	inline
your main program file used to test your setup does not include the header file with the inline member-functions

2540175
constructor	object	value	field
once you have a backing field you can set its value in the constructor or make it a public field and set it after you have the object but this is a little uglier

2540181
subclassing	superclass
now subclassing of a can overrides getmember to make the superclass use a specific implementation of isomeinterface

2540192
textbox	button	input-field	textbox
my current aspx form askes users to input-field into textbox and press submit button

2540205
pixels	line
for example if you are scaling by half then each 1 pixels horizontal line has at least a 50 change of appearing in the new image

2540205
pixels	line
however if the white line were two pixels in height you d have a 100 chance of the white line appearing

2540208
webforms	asp.net
the original versioning of asp.net used postback a lot in the webforms model which is why you are seeing that behavior

2540208
httphandler	httpmodule
it is possible to write httphandler or httpmodule which give you more flexibility without requiring asp.net-mvc

2540215
buildpath	libs
i am not sure what you mean with creating a wrapper module and why you would like to do it but normally you just drop the libs the jar files in a project folder which is covered by the project s buildpath aka classpath or to manually add the jar files to the project s buildpath

2540226
selected	cell
selected a cell within the pivot-table open the vbe alt+f11 go the immediate windows ctl+g and types

2540233
filtering	sorting
now however i need to parsing the entire dataset ie all entities and all their attributes inorder to provide a sorting filtering algorithm based on the attributes

2540233
attributes	properties
every entity is represented by a single model for example client_model_entity and has a protected properties called which is an arrays of attributes object

2540249
contains	set	contains	elements
then value set in css file will take precedence over an inline html attributes and thus elements contains inside cell will be aligned to the centering

2540251
checkbox	button
.when i have a set of either checkbox or radio button i often need to have an other choice

2540251
radio-button	textbox	radio-button	checkbox	checkbox	textbox
this checkbox or radio-button is very often accompanied by a textbox where the user is supposed to fill out what this other is

2540251
checkbox	textbox
do you connect the checkbox and textbox in any way with some javascript

2540251
checkbox	textbox
for example do you activate the textbox .when the checkbox is checked

2540251
checkbox	textbox
do you let validation fail with error messages if the checkbox is checked but the textbox is not filled out or if the textbox is filled out but the checkbox is not checked

2540264

which set of definitions html attributes or css properties take precedence

2540264
attributes	properties
css properties take precedence over html attributes

2540274

properties in java a properties of a class is something that is accesible via getter setter methods setxxx getxxx properties xxx tipically but not necessarily corresponds to a private field

2540326
any	set
is your panels nested inside another panels or any other types of containers which has visible set to false

2540326
getter	setter
it seems that setting and getting the visible properties is asymmetric the setter seems to place a flag in the control but the getter to return a calculated value which depends on the visibility of the outer elements and the visibility of the control itself

2540335
selected	textbox
the user selected the textbox and then presses and holds 9 until the textbox fills with 9s

2540336

2540368
webforms	asp.net
i have a ms sql-view that i want to make available as a csv downloading in my asp.net webforms .app

2540370
object-reference	instances
oddly .when the currentcontext.server.execute methods is execute it throw an object-reference not set to an instances of an object error

2540386
constructor	object
by specifying the contextoptions in the validatecredentials methods instead of in the constructor this allowed me to avoid having to specify a dn for a containers object

2540387
any	set
the controllers can make any decisions it needs to inorder to determine what action set to use and which specific action to assign to the user-interface controls

2540393
malloc	free
i am thinking of replacing new delete with malloc free and use mallopt to tune the way the memory is being release to the systemd

2540410
version-control	cvs
once i am happy with my current state of project - i commit all things of course not only then to cvs but it not really matters which version-control you re using tag-it with some release tag and then use scripting which does the deployment to production machine by given release tag fetches needed things from cvs by given tag and puts them to production machines

2540436
value	field
.when the recording gets loaded and there is no value in the field everything is fine

2540436

2540548
buildpath	libs
in the buildpath for the project i ve added the systemd libs for the java 1.5 jre

2540561
realloc	malloc
using malloc realloc will not help this

2540572
variables	boolean
now if you ever need something smarter than just inverting a boolean you can use to turn an option named into a usable variables

2540589
tuples	any
.when you link python to your executable no matter if dynamically or statically your executable already gains basic python language functionality operators methods basic structures like string list tuples dictionary etc. without any other dependancy

2540596
radio	click
the click will react to any radio being click and the if will make sure that it s only the other radio-button that will react to the click and that it will only react if there isn t already a textarea after it .so you don t get multiple textarea propogations

2540601
attributes	properties
then specify string data-members class properties for each dictionary attributes of my classes

2540608
httpwebrequest	webclient
you re looking for the webclient class and perhaps httpwebrequest

2540626
uitableview	uiview
place the uitableview inside a simple uiview

scons	cmake	build-system	cmake	build-system	scons
however i am thinking of switching to cross-platform build-system like cmake or scons

2540636
scons	cmake
and if .so what should be my choice cmake scons or .some other

2540639
postback	ajax	hidden-field	checkbox
i would try to load the checkbox list via javascript ajax possibly saving the value of the checkbox list to a hidden-field .so i can retain the value on a postback

2540667
silverlight	wpf
i want the prettiness of silverlight wpf in part of my current winforms application

2540667
silverlight	wpf
i know silverlight is just a subset of wpf but it has most of the features i m looking for and only required the silverlight plugins

2540682
any	set
also checked for any subclassing code that sets the wndproc - you need a different flag to set this on 64bit windows

2540682
32-bit	64bit	32bit-64bit	32-bit	32bit-64bit	64bit
if using mfc you will also unhelpfully find that the containers sizes now return 64bit size count rather than 32-bit size count which means your 32bit-64bit archiving will be broken

2540682
32-bit	64bit
we created our own custom mfc implementation with some clever tricks to allow us to de-serialize 32-bit archive on 64bit boxes and vice versa

2540684
contains	elements
the collections contains ihtmlstylesheet elements which in turn have a href -property which you can use to downloading the file

2540684
contains	elements
scripting you can get via ihtmldocument2 scripting which gives you a collections contains ihtmlscript elements which have a src properties

project - properties - java buildpath - libs

2540771
scons	cmake
what should be my choice cmake scons or some other

2540779
profiling	debugging
it s worth noting that the viewmodel will execute more slowly with profiling enabled the interpreter has overhead on every methods call and return and it s running in the slower debugging interpreter while native-code continue to run at full speed .so you have to be careful .when drawing conclusions

2540782
getter	setter
the main usage scenario would be the one you describe a properties with a public getter but private setter

2540796
webforms	asp.net
how would you accomplish these in asp.net webforms 4.0 router

2540808
default	reset
but it is good practice to reset it to 1 or should i just leave it out of the sql .so that the default is used

2540811
file-descriptor	pipe
if the file-descriptor being used with write is not for a fifo pipe as suggested by ken bloom asynchronous socket as suggested by mark4o and does not otherwise cause a signals sigio i suppose you could use raise to send a signals to the current process after writing data to the buffering

2540811
signals	aio
even though the author of the previously mentioned article doesn t think highly of the pthreads aio api provided in the 2.6 kernel you may want to look into it anyway as it can be used to provide notification of asychronous read write completion to a regular file through signals and function callback

2540818
value	field
.when i look at my index in luke the field are as i expected a value such as

2540823
constructor	object	extends	sealed
to extends on what reed said who said it more succinctly than what i had typed one very valid scenario for this is for readonly factory which churn out wrapper providing either true readonly contexts or provide set-up of readonly object and avoid constructor setup true sealed classes

2540863
remote-server	vpn
i have tried a local to the vpn user s pc scripting that call a scripting on the remote-server that runs the sc stop cmd and it still fails

2540884
postgresql	mysql
i m more of a ms-sql postgresql guy but i m working on a mysql project

2540885
any	set	margins	padding
assuming the default you ll want to set any margins or padding to 0

2540892
python	ruby
if you are really looking for easy why not just use a scripting-language such as ruby or python to do this

2540905
checkbox	textarea
i have a series of checkbox input and corresponding textarea input to allow specifications of quantity

2540905
value	field
i understand what the value in the checked arrays are i just do not understand how to relate the first field to the second later in the program

2540906
contains	set
the backgroundworker bw class contains a variables isrunning that it is set to true before dowork methods is execute and to false .when runworkercompleted is execute

2540913

the dlr currently supports ironpython and ironruby plus a numbers of other language implementation can be found on codeplex

2540984
.when	ready
.when the toast is ready but also

2540984
.when	ready
sometimes .when it is not ready

2540990
attributes	properties
in two words you can use the binding attributes to bind a component instances to a properties of a backing bean

2541019
order	add
if concurrency is a matter for you you should just add a sequences column with order option if you use rac and write a query like this

2541032
firefox	safari
to find out where particular elements inherited its styles from open firebug firefox or web-inspector safari selected the elements and you will see list of its styless and their origins

2541037
selected	checkbox
i have a jtable code i intend to use but the problem with it is that .when i click on the checkbox once it doesn t selected deselected it instead i have to click twice

2541037
selected	cell	selected	checkbox	contains	any
but if i selected any other cell in the row except the one contains the checkbox the purpose is solved

2541044
order	add
if i add a order by clause to the over it gets closer but still not totally correct

2541060
32-bit	64bit
absolutely 32-bit and 64bit - you can see a list of officially supported platform on the adobe site

2541061
required	checked
the basic approach is to create a workflowservice that regularly checked the database and enqueues a messages one the required change was send

2541065
callback	methods
next step is to test the callback methods directly as you would any other methods

2541067
report-designer	birt
i embedded the birt report-designer in my rcp application and i am able to open and save report designs easily but there are some problems with the data explorer view

2541095
invokerequired	begininvoke
although i recommend using invoke or begininvoke after calling invokerequired of course you can prevent the cross-thread exception-handling altogether by calling this from your form or user-controls

2541109
put	get
get them to start their work and put their results on the queue

2541117
stderr	stdout
if you want stderr instead of stdout rather than stderr and stdout you can do the following

2541117
stderr	stdout
redirect stderr 2 to stdout 1

2541163
file-manager	upload
my reason is i m building a fully standalone javascript templates systemd for a newsletter and since images and other things are upload via a drupal web file-manager i want the content creators to keep their paths very short and simple and i can then modify them before i load in the content

2541166
constructor	object
i have a object that takes an object named and properties named in the constructor

2541166
getter	setter	initializer	setter	initializer	getter
an initializer methods uses reflection to find the object and properties and stores the properties getter as an and the properties setter as an

2541184
reflection	runtime
basically i ll have a collections of object of varying types at runtime and since there s no way for sure to know what types they exactly will be i m thinking that i ll have to use reflection

2541206
getter	setter
you could obtain delegation directly representing the getter and setter methods

2541240
put	get
the only reason why you should be putting a verb force_delete into the uri is if you would need to overload get .post methods in an environment where put delete methods are not available

2541244
arrays	loops
here s loops i m using to take this arrays and process items checked off the form in the first place

2541264
command-prompt	command-line
i m doing everything from the command-line i ve got shell one shortcut away from my ide and .when i m in a directory with a mercurial repository i get a nice custom command-prompt showing me the numbers of heads the status of the repo etc

2541275
malloc	free
we affectivly just call malloc free on the object we want to create

2541285
order	add
in child i have add a reference to the parent as a project and specified that child depends on parent and that the building order should be parent then child

2541296
hash	md5
if an attacker had sql-injection in your application then they could obtain the md5 hash and the user named and login immediately without having to break the md5 hash

2541328
callback	methods
i want to call a callback methods that may or may not be implements in pages being loaded as ajax content by jquery-tabs

2541362
realloc	malloc
if pointers is a null-pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the

2541362
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
calloc malloc or realloc function or if the spaces has been deallocated by a call

2541362
realloc	free
to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

2541369
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
calloc malloc or realloc function

2541369
realloc	free
by a call to the free or realloc

2541371
keydown	keyup
as for the keyup event not happening in flash that is likely because it doesn t generator keyup events without getting a keydown which it never got because focus was still in html

2541385
dependency-injection	singleton
you will learn never to have a global state not even singleton and to use dependency-injection

2541390
checkbox	listbox
then what you d actually want to .post .when you re done would be the listbox results rather than the checkbox

2541398
.when	ready
but i want javascript to be execute only .when html part is ready

2541400
contains	any
the easiest way to handle this if you don t want the code on the main page using live handler is to have your main page load any external scripting files required by any tabs and have the content for each tab contains the callback mechanism for what needs to be done .when the tab is loaded

2541405
buffering	streaming
you should be able to put together a wrapper class that manages a single byte buffering and parcels out temporary locks for data ranges using fixed-size memory streaming

2541424
order	add
removal is o numbers of key but everything else is the same order as a typical map implementation some extra constants scaling since you also have to add things to the reverse

2541450
aggregate-functions	sum
but this is where the aggregate-functions sum count average etc... come into play selected id playername sum score from table grouping by playername

2541450
aggregate	grouping
leave the grouping by as-is and do whatever calculations you want on the groupinging data within the query summing count averaging etc... .so that you get aggregate results for each of the matching time periods

2541480
gethashcode	equals
.so i disabled my implementation of equals gethashcode and it worked just fine

2541483
filtering	sorting
in addition to providing field and filtering for location it also offers basic proximity filtering and sorting features

2541495
hash	md5
the attacker could use this vulnerability to obtain your extremely weak md5 hash crack it and then login

2541496
account	api
then after that process if a profiling show that allocation of small object is a problem updates the api to account for this

2541502
xsd	xml
i m looking for a free alternative to all the xml xsd editor around here that are relatively expensive--at least for me

2541507
dictionary	map
the include templates tag can take a variables contains the templates to include .so you could loops through a sequences contains the various sub-templatess and include them in turn maybe using a dictionary to map friendly named to templates filenamed

2541556
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
most browsers ie9 google-chrome safari use h.264 though currently firefox only supports ogg .when using the video tag

2541572
highlight	selected
getting and highlight the selected item within the collections

2541572
highlight	selected	selection	highlight
there appears to be no selection delegation for nscollectionview and unlike most cocoa user-interface views there appears to be no default selected highlight

2541572
highlight	selected
ok .so i figured finding the selected item s but have yet to figure the highlight

2541584
attributes	properties
plan for the future right now they are just tags but they may end up carrying properties or attributes that building upon the tag

2541586
deep-copy	object
there is also the humble copy function or deep-copy if you have complex object and not just int in your list

2541596
tuples	set
you ll have to use tuples instead of lists as the items because set items must be hashable

2541599
fflush	gets
.when a cmd like play pause or seek is called while the videodisplay is unresponsive it gets put on a queue how do i fflush this queue .so the most recent cmd is the only cmd process

2541628
autoscroll	panels
the top panels has autoscroll enabled

2541635
linux	unix
in linux unix that should be possible .when you get the output of that cmd run in a shell

2541650
favicon	web
unfortunately .when i deploy to iis7 returns an iis-generated 404 presumably because it s actually looking for the favicon in the web root folder where it doesn t exist

2541690
maven-plugin	cargo
i m not sure how you access jetty configuration in cargo but in the normals jetty maven-plugin you would do something like

2541698
blackberry	nokia	midp	cldc
i know that blackberry and nokia provide their own api s that go above and beyond what is specified in midp cldc or any of the jsrs for java-me

2541702
python	c++
python would be preferred but i m also willing to look at other languages c++ or other means sql

2541703
credentials	account
i install ssrs on my win 7 machine but i don t see it in my iis website and .when i try to go to it asks for credentials which i put my admin account credentials and it doesn t work

2541709
listitem	selected
of the selected listitem

2541713
ellipse	line
while i haven t tried it you may be able to achieve something using an elementname binding to bind between the canvas.top and left properties of the ellipse and the line

2541728
export	csv
export a numerical dataset even if it only has one numeric column - .so just make it .so by default to csv for import into excel people love this function even if only 1 of users seem to use it with any regularity

2541730
json	xml
i didn t see the points of using xml or json since a simple numbers would suffice

2541730
json	xml
or do i have to use xml json

2541734
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the user-interface layer is just one of these layer weather it be silverlight asp.net-mvc webforms etc

2541737
jstat	jvm
i wanted to do a jstat jdk 1.6 to probe the jvm but i kept getting not found messages

2541746
subclassing	superclass
referring to a subclassing from a superclass is not a good idea

2541760
contains	any
something like any and all strings contains letters or the characters and - except for the words mg ml oral extended release tablet chewable po susp. sounds pretty difficult considering it probably doesn t cover all cases

2541764
associations	model
the associations setup in the model does this all for you

2541774
.when	ready
instead call whatever code needs to happen using cm from the callback .so it ll run .when the variables is ready

2541776
python	ruby
on windows you can use powershell python or ruby

2541776
python	ruby
python and ruby will work on any unix-flavoured machine too but roughly all unix machines have bash and the coreutils install

2541784
subclassing	inherited
it s interesting that no-one has mentioned one of key benefits of delegation - it s preferable to subclassing .when you realise that inherited is not a magic bullet and usually creates more problems than it solves

2541794
append	input
i want to append a li between form after all other li .so in this example new li will be append between test141 append input box

2541796
decimal-point	digits
i want to convert 123456 to 00 20 34.56 where the two digits to the right of the decimal-point is in hundredth of a second

2541796
digits	zero
question 2 this has been asked a million time before but please shared whatever you ve got what s the shortest way to add leading zero to the digits

2541817
execute	prepare
b stored-procedures cannot execute prepare statements from concatenation strings using .so called dynamic-sql statements nor can it return results with more than one distinct row

2541819
selected	checkbox
the only place a checkbox is valid in my opinion is where you have a small collections of options of which a user may selected more than one

2541831
active-directory	adfs
adfs active-directory federation service formerly geneva server is one example that links with ad

2541832
self-extracting	burn
the wix team is working on burn a new bootstrapper but until it is ready for production use you may use one of the commercial solutions to building a self-extracting single executable that automatically runs setup.exe

2541833
textbox	button
for example have a textbox with a button next to it and .when the button is click you display the standards ad find user dialog

2541838
self-extracting	prerequisites
however you can do the opposite package both the prerequisites and the msi in a self-extracting archive with winzip self-extractor

2541846
authentication	login
the really baked part is that if the value of the cookies an authentication token string contains a slash it doesn t login properly

2541850
registration	login
should i just use the forum software as my login registration

2541864
invoices	product
the total amount of the invoicesâ amount_invoicesd â is calculated by summing the product of unit_price and quantity for each item on a given invoices

2541866
revision	svn
svn isn t my strong suit .so i am trying to figure out how to get subversive to move it s head back one revision .so the trunk branch that was deleted re-appears again

2541869
highlight	selected
that just simply fills the view in blue .when its selected but that can be customized to draw the highlight any way you want

2541876
constructor	object
composed_of will attempt to call the constructor of the object with the field it knows about

2541879
swing	awt
that s not even a good idea in awt let alone swing

2541879
swing	awt
other than get all the awt swing stuff on the right thread part of the fix should be to get the listener checked state to see if it should execute its body rather than attempting to remove and add the listener

2541883
buildpath	libs
if this is done correctly then eclipse will automatically include the server s libs the server is actually a concrete implementation of under each the servlet api in the project s buildpath

2541887
directory	folder
it creates a new directory in the beginning and move 10 files into that directory then creates a new folder again and move another 10 files into that directory and .so on

2541891
neo4j	mysql
my plan is to have all data except the relations in the mysql database and all relations with item_id stored in the neo4j database

2541892
ostringstream	std
just use std ostringstream .so you don t have to manage the char

2541925
value	field
alternatively you could implements a custom edit form-for the list with the business-logic for exposing field as editable baked in but you would need to ensure that your users do not alter field value via other means external applications data sheet view etc.

2541926
audio	ogg
.so they didn t include specificationsific codecs in the specifications al.so screwing over good quality compression ratio and free ogg vorbis audio codec

2541926
firefox	opera
firefox and opera will not support h.264 unless the .war is lost but might or might not after.wards using gstreamer with directshow quicktime providing the nonfree codecs

2541926
gstreamer	vlc	quicktime	vlc
2 systemd codecs phonon gstreamer xine vlc direct show quicktime backends - on linux mostly gstreamer xine

2541926
firefox	opera
5 in mobile firefox fennec planning to use gstreamer i think might use it everywhere ala opera later on

2541949
ubuntu	osx
i m testing on ubuntu 9.10 with google-chrome 5.0.342.7 beta and mac osx 10.6.2 with google-chrome 5.0.307.9 beta

2541950
shutdown	exit	shutdown	sigint	sigint	exit
if you use sigint kill -2 will cause the program to gracefully exit and run the shutdown hooks

2541964
inherited	accessor	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	accessor
is there a way to generator accessor methods for the subclassing as show in the inherited mapping above project task etc... without doing it manually

2541964
subclassing	accessor
should i not be making accessor for the subclassing

2541967
httphandler	httpmodule
but after reading about them i m still no closer to an understanding of what problems i would solve with an httphandler or httpmodule

2541973
difference	count
with row count that small performance optimizations are not going to make any appreciable difference on modern desktop or server hardware

2542019
value	field
maybe store the int value directly in an int field

2542023
abstract	super
of course one could imagine super interesting behavior that takes all sorts of abstract parameters but required a ton of information to be able to call it

2542039
32-bit	64bit
i m trying to cross-compiling a 64bit executable on a 32-bit ubuntu systemd

2542039
32-bit	64bit
if i were doing this on a 64bit systemd i would use getlibs to install a 32-bit glib2 into usr lib32

2542039
32-bit	64bit
however on a 32-bit machine getlibs doesn t seem to do the opposite-- install a 64bit glib2 into usr lib64

2542041
neo4j	mysql
whatever are certain value would you first have to find the correct nodes id in your mysql database and then go into neo4j

2542041
neo4j	mysql
whilst generator statistics using a mysql database might be easier than doing everything in neo4j the code required to traversal a graphing to find all the nodes that meet a defined criterion isn t overly difficult

2542079
specifications	w3c
doing a google-search doesn t turn up any definitive resources on what this is and how it should be used can anyone points me to something along the line of a specifications w3c standards

2542082
n-gram	words
if you do not use a libs that does it for you you can optimize queries by looking up the most globally infrequent characters or words or n-gram first in your indexes

2542087
for-loop	loops
if this test precedes loops it will prevent execution from reaching the for-loop if filesraw is-empty

2542100
directory	folder
question is how do use a basic rescursivedirectoryiterator to display folder and then run the filteriterator to only show the php files in those directory

2542104
authentication	login	required	checked
the real key is to checked for a valid login token whenever you re performing an operation that required authentication and to run your site over http .so that the session cookies can t be hijacked

2542118
salt	md5
every bridge that i did made me choose the main sign-in .app based on the passwd encryption since if you have a scripting that has md5 passwd encrypted and another vbulletin you want to connect to you d surely go with the main scripting as the main sign in due to vbulletin s salt passwd encryption

2542128
debugging	trace
if you al.so want to prepend the userid to it that will make things easier to trace and debugging which will probably make your life easier .so go ahead

2542133
hide	show
i m working on a small problem where i m trying to show hide a panels based on two criterion

2542137
droppable	draggable
but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable

2542138
.net	wcf
we have a software house developing code for us on a project .net web service wcf and we are also paying for a test harness to be built as a separate billable task on a daily rate

2542139
moss	wss
if i had to use it would i need wss or moss

2542144
document-ready	.when
it seems that document-ready is failing .when i use the pop-up

2542148
.net	wcf
i created a wcf service .net 3.5 that grabs data from a db and returns a list of object

2542148
object-reference	instances
after enabling in the configuration file the error messages is object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

2542148
object-reference	instances
.when i ran my very basic testing .app based on the sample code display on the service s default webpage i got the object-reference not set to an instances of an object messages

2542153
mouseleave	mouseenter
i d bind the image source to a properties of the code-behind and capture the mouseenter and mouseleave events to change this properties

2542157
subclassing	superclass
fine but these are all subclassing of a common class .so if i leave their superclass as non-abstract i should be happy .so long as i can get its manager to return object of the proper class

2542184
children	nodes
the following will only selected the root nodes and all of the children

2542184
contains	elements
it contains the root elements and all the children

2542195
git-repo	repo
you could clone the git-svn repo which will result in a git-repo you can t dcommit from but that has some big downsides too

2542196
jquery	.post
- i just .post a jquery + google apis exercise

2542232
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i am running rspec tests for my ruby-on-rails .app and they are working fine except for one error that i can t seem get my head around

2542281
any	set
is there any way to make it .so certain files are set for each server

2542282
revision	svn
and there are gaps in the svn revision numbers sequences

2542283
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome but fails to execute properly in firefox

2542293
bar-chart	plot	uilabel	uiview
in the cptestapp i took the bar-chart nib and placed both the cplayerhostingview and a uilabel for the plot title into a generics uiview making them children of the uiview

2542293
contains	set
where layerview is your uiview with class cplayerhostingview -- make sure to set this in ib that is contains inside of a generics uiview

2542293
uilabel	uiview
that generics uiview can have all the uilabel you want as children

2542342
svnadmin	dump
svnadmin dump

2542343
defined	declare
called even if they are declare .when the class is defined

2542369
enumerator	any
edit my interpretation of however loops will iterate over all user-defined properties including any which overwrite built-in properties is that the properties that are overwrite directly in the object become enumerator

2542372
subclassing	superclass
this sort of extends itself type-parameter is used to let the superclass refer to the subclassing in places like methods parameters and return types even though no actual specific subclassing is available .when the superclass is compiled

2542373
linked-list	arrays
recreate this link in the 2nd linked-list the temporary arrays could really help here

2542374
processor	affinity
you can t set processor affinity for specific threads

2542376
google-chrome	firefox
as wesgarrison commented console isn t always present in firefox like it is in google-chrome and you ll get an console is undefined error

2542404
linux	unix
windows and unix linux terminology is quite different especially the concept of a shell is not at all the same thing in each

2542425
constructor	object
this could be done as a per-call service with database connection the expensive resource initializer in the server object constructor

2542426
pointers	stack
while the iterator syntax isn t friendly for people coming from other languages it gives you the built-in data-structures that you generally use in java s collections or php as built-in maps hash lists stack vectors without writing funky pointers code with dynamic-allocation that .so often sidetracks beginners into reinventing the wheel and messing with memory bugs

2542426
boost	stl
stl and boost can fill in gaps

2542443
nsstring	nsdata
the arrays holds nsstring nsdata and cgpoint value

2542444
data-members	instances
assuming this is c++ a function declare as const indicates that it does not intend to change data-members on the instances on which it is called the this-pointer

2542448
worksheet	excel
you can automate excel write your value to the worksheet then updates the object frame

2542448
radio-button	selected
to link a worksheet choose the create from file radio-button checked the link checkedbox and browse to selected the workbook

2542461
assign	deep
i guess that these value are assign deep in the kernel wherever process are first created

2542463
selected	checkbox
using jquery is there a simple way to selected the text immediately after a checkbox

2542469
textchanged	textbox
ok i added a textbox textbox1 within the updatepanel change clientid to id and onchange to textchanged and it works

2542470
groovy	java
i ve developed in java in the past and now i m trying to learn grails groovy using this slightly dated tutorial

2542486
derived-class	base-class
yes passing a derived-class instances to a function that takes a base-class reference is ok

2542486
base-class	inherited	protected	public
your example compiles for me though and doesn t look like it should produce that error -- an inaccessible base-class generally refers to something that was extended via protected or private-inherited rather than public inherited

2542493
selected	button
this is later on used as the selected index in a grouping of radio button

2542497
32-bit	64bit
if not you can get something even faster by using a 32-bit or 64bit crc for your checksum

2542510
value	field
the only thing i can think of is to updates the onclientclick action of the 2nd submit button .so it clears the photo_search_text field before the form is submitted and then only perform a photo search if that field has a value

2542527
environment	building
also as vittore said i would consider a codeigniter solution to be quite useful that could automate your push from the dev environment over to production where the client could see it on a successful building test cycle

2542583
cobertura	emma
yes coverage tools like cobertura or emma

2542590
any	set
but this error occurs every time .when restart the database is there any configuration to set to start the dequeue on database startup

2542619
perl	php
perl php or java will all do the job

2542619
perl	php
i d do this in perl since i know it well and prefer it to php which i also know well

2542620
debugging	trace
depending on what listener you attach trace output can go to the debugging windows the console a file database or all at once

2542627
libcrypto	openssl
openssl comes with a libcrypto libs which is commonly used to perform standalone encryption outside of an ssl context

2542636
autovivification	key
other languages like ruby support a default action hook for hash key that have not been assign which can be used for autovivification as well

2542655
unspecified-behavior	undefined-behavior
its unspecified-behavior undefined-behavior

2542664
any	set
2 now that a different exception-handling is throw on the server side instead of the file-not-found it would seem i can t use this set up for the application because back on client side any exception-handling is assumed to be file-not-found

2542685
g++	gcc
you re compiling a .cpp c++ program by invoking gcc instead of g++ .

2542705
stubs	tdd
support for generator code stubs from my tests is ok - not as good as more mature tdd plugins but a good start

2542706
callback	methods
if there is a repeated pattern you can decode to a multiple methods callback interface like awt does

2542711
contains	any
you make two separate accesses to screens.screenss .so if each of those call is returning a different arrays of object it s easy to see why you don t find any matches - because the indexof methods tests for equality .so two different screens object won t match even if they happen to contains information about the same physical screens

2542722
hide	show
do not show preview of videocontrol hide make it s size as zero ...

2542740
binary-search	quicksort	insertion-sort	binary-search	insertion-sort	quicksort
then file3 is loaded to memory and sorted using say quicksort which is optimized to add insertion-sort .when the arrays size is small and then we search the numbers in this sorted arrays using binary-search

2542744
telnet	ssh
nowadays a graphical application such as your rxvt console windows application putty telnet ssh client windowss-console etc

2542745
oprofile	valgrind
valgrind oprofile

2542761
configuration	environment
configuration environment

2542761
configuration	environment
don t forget you can use yaml to include one environment configuration within another

2542765
contains	any
perfectly valid query and has also passed through mysql_real_escape_string intact because it didn t contains any of the critical metacharacters

2542769
debugging	trace
try to add breakpoints on your methods and debugging it to trace the cause of the error

2542774
silverlight	wpf
i m much happier using windows forms wpf or even silverlight

2542779
subclassing	superclass
just wanted to confirm that i m not headed for future trouble by using self in the superclass phone-number and using that to execute class methods on subclassing from the parent

2542788
base-class	inherited
in flash-cs4 there s a textfield in the author environment where you can specify a class that will become the base-class - your class inherited from sprite and then becomes the stage at runtime

2542791
postgresql	mysql
all the sql solutions out there and in particular mysql and postgresql are solid and documented for performance usage quirks

2542794
implements	extends
public class swingcapture extends panels implements actionlistener

2542794
void	main
public static void main string arguments

2542810
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
google-chrome seems to like them all but safari firefox and ie all have problems with various icons

2542818
linux	unix
linux unix elf-specific answer

2542831
any	set
i usually set it to do 3-5 retries option r 3 with a 10 second pause if the file is not ready w 10 and then have it log any errors .so i can review them log .

2542867
moss	wss
you can technically use wss for this task but moss has more features aimed at building public facing website

2542874
midp	cldc
i am using cldc 1.0 and midp 2.0

2542902
double	int
it s generics .so it supports int double strings etc

2542916
.when	ready
.when ga.js is ready it execute all the cmd in the _gaq arrays and replace _gaq with an object

2542931
expression	brackets
i want a regular expression to validation string to have only text operators and these brackets

2542945
directory	folder
go to spring installation directory and include all of jars in the following folder

2542952
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	coalesce	isnull
edit according to omg ponies coalesce could be used instead of isnull to make it work across sql-server mysql oracle etc

2542966
directory	folder
i just downloading fckeditor and dropped the folder into my root directory but i don t know how to install the fckeditor into my forms

2542973
contains	any
you would have to make a deep clone of the list add a clone of each object in the list and clone any object that they may contains i would suggest having a clone methods to do this for you to a new list

2542979
event-listener	listener
if anyone has any insight as to why this isn t working or why my event-listener has to be manually cleared even though i m using a weak ref dictionary to hold the listener i d love to hear it

2542986
contains	elements
however you might think about making your own login uiview as a child view of a uiviewcontroller which contains form elements

2543010
frame	width
loops through the rows and columns of images and set the uiimage instances s frame origin some offset-multiple of your image or image-cell width

2543032
triggers	insert	key-value	key
assuming that your tables of interest have or can be augmented with a unique indexed sequential key then you will get much much better value out of simply issuing with output to a file where last_max_key is the last key-value from the last extraction 0 if first extraction. this incremental decoupled approach avoids introducing triggers latency in the insert datapath be it custom triggerss or modified slony and depending on your setup could scale better with numbers of cpus etc

2543032
triggers	insert
unless you are willing to parsing wals including transactional state tracking and being ready to rewrite the code everytime you upgrade postgresql i would not necessarily use the wals either -- that is unless you have the extra hardware available in which case you could ship wals to another machine for extraction on the second machine you can use triggers shamelessly -- or even statement logging -- since whatever happens there does not affect insert updates delete performance on the primary machine. note that performance-wise on the primary machine unless you can write the logs to a san you d get a comparable performance hit in terms of thrashing filesystems caching mostly from shipping wals to a different machine as from running the incremental selected

2543033
windows-vista	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-vista	windows-server	windows-xp
dll wmicookr.dll on windows-server 2003 and windows-xp wmiperfinst.dll on windows-server 2008 and windows-vista

2543037
directory	folder
heroku s filesystems is readonly but you can use the tmp and log directory from within your application folder

2543083
interpreter	runtime
if a task is .so stupid that it can be automated at program writing time .source code can be generator by a scripting from let s say xml then the same can al.so be done at runtime .some representation of that xml can be interpreter at runtime or using .some meta-programming

2543107
defined	declare
declare the member function just like a normals member function inside the class but .when you defined the inline member function prepend the member function s definition with the keyword inline and put the definition into a header file like the following

2543107
put	get
if you put the inline-functions s definition into a .cpp file and it if it is called from some other .cpp file you ll get an unresolved external error c++ faq lite from the linker

2543109
silverlight	wpf
i am using silverlight 3 and not wpf

2543124
value	field
you should not have a field in your database that has a bunch of value separated by value1 value2|value1 value2|value1 value2

2543125
click	mouse
the mouse click should updates this collections and then tell the windows or the affect region to refresh

2543131
32-bit	64bit
the downloading page has both 32-bit and 64bit downloadinging

2543137
any	set
any column not consumed by the pivot operators will remain in the final result set increasing its cardinality

2543146
32-bit	64bit
the virtual-machine running on this laptop is xp 32-bit and this one is a win7 64bit

2543150
virtual-method	destructor
i would say base classes usually should have at least one virtual-method other than the destructor

2543150
pure-virtual	base-class
most of the time at least one of those virtual methods will be pure-virtual .so the base-class will be abstract

2543150
getter	setter	protected	public
the members are protected but there are public getter setter .so they re essentially public

2543153
relational-database	schema
in fact whenever discussing performance in sql-server or any relational-database for the matter the question is never about how to design the queries the queiston is always about how to design the schema

2543159
nested	order
one common way is if you have nested locks that aren t acquired in the same order

2543223
.war	jar
instead of sepearate jar s for each project i built a single .war directly with all the classes of all my project

2543226
perl	awk	python	perl
perl is generally faster at this sort of thing than the sed awk and python

2543227
contains	any
i have a solution that contains amongh other c# project a vc++ project that suports compiling only as x64 or win32 but not any cpu

2543236
google-chrome	opera
opera and webkit based browsers google-chrome winsafari seem to fail

2543238
getter	setter
apart from types compile-time types-safety do the types specific getter setter have any dis advantages or is it ok to use getobject setobject everywhere

2543256
subclassing	superclass
.so any late-bound reference to that named like the one you have in its super subclassingagain call will of course get the subclassing that s masquerading by that named -- that subclassing s superclass is of course the real subclassingagain whence the infinite recursion

2543256
subclassing	base-class
you can reproduce the same problem very simply without decoration just by having any subclassing usurp its base-class s named

2543257
executable	jar
yes you can create your application into an executable one by using jar

2543262
versioning	upgrade
if you have upgrade your opensolaris zpool to a newer versioning for example to take advantage of deduplication you won t be able to do it

2543268
keydown	keyup
as for handling ctrl-z one of the key event handler keypress keydown or keyup is what you are looking for

2543276
classnotfoundexception	classpath
i tried the standards ones given in hibernate search books but they give me classnotfoundexception and i have all the neccesarty libs in classpath

i tried the generator axis2 artifacts... in soapui but that is just a gui for the axis2 wsdl2java and i got the same exception-handling

2546415
duplicates	elements
if you had to find all of the duplicates it is always going to be n comparisons because you ve got to visit each elements in the unsorted arrays

2546422
duplicates	elements
the o n time is true even if there are duplicates elements

2546422
duplicates	elements
searching for 2 will take exactly n compari.sons if you start from the first elements .so having duplicates didn t help at all

2546422
duplicates	elements
if you were to search for 1 you d find it in a single compari.son but there are input of distinct elementss for which you can al.so find an elements in a single compari.son if you re lucky .so having duplicates really doesn t mean much except that you re more likely to get lucky and find your target elements in fewer step

2548882
traversal	parent
in my case a css width was always applied to the actual elements .so i didn t have to worry about this however if the elements doesn t have a width applied to it you may need to do .some kind of recursive traversal of the elements s dom ancestry to find the appropriate parent elements s width

also the linked-list would have to be a doubly-linked-list

2549025

be aware that for...in loops will iterate over any enumerator properties including those that are added to the prototype of an object

2549377
configuration	environment
the same reason you d use jndi for anything i d say - moving the configuration out of the application into the deployment environment

2549377
build-process	ant
you don t need to make your build-process aware of configuration no more ant war_for_qa or screwing around with maven-profiles

2549377
configuration	installation
your installation configuration instructions won t include items like to configure the database login edit the file foo.properties in the .war file which will inevitably result in configuration being overwrite on the production server at the worst possible moment because a sysadmin who s been working all weekend happened to deploy a non-edited .war because the coffee ran out on sunday afternoon

2549384
spawn	exit
the filename is used by a process my program spawn and even though i ensure that process finishes before i exit it seems to have a race conditional out of my control

you should generally stay away from string literals in settimeout setinterval

2549510
highlight	selected
highlight then right click and selected quickwatch.

2549513
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
a good obfuscation will raise the bar high enough to prevent all but a very dedicated motivated person from reverse-engineering your code

2549619
any	set
it sounds like you have set up the root but just don t create any links with root_url

2549625
stderr	stdout
you should have one or two separate threads reading stdout and stderr one if you merge them apart from the thread that call process.exec waitfor destroy

2549656
hash	md5
in that effort i overrides the methods the existing user db had md5 hash pwds

2549659
json	xml
the remote procedure would return the result as xml or a structured clob eg json which could be decode by either the local procedure or the java layer

2549682
treeview	grid
firebug in firefox does the job .when you have a url which returns json firebug is a must have for any web developer if you don t have it install already you can get it here with firebug open and active navigate to your url in firefox in firebug go to the .net tab then click + sign next to your url in the grid there should be a json tab available which you can use to explore your object in a treeview

2549708
geos	ogr
i ve looked into ogr 1.7.1 geos 3.2.0 and whilst it loads the data correctly the resulting intersection aren t correct and most of the other tools available seem to building on this work

if i is a nodes then its children can be found at 2i + 1 for the left nodes and 2i + 2 for the right nodes

2549755
constructor	object
also if you must create personobject in methoda rather than having it initializer in the constructor then you ll need to dynamically create the object with new

2549769
click	mouse
i ve got an event-listener on the parent listening for a mouse click

2549780

any	set
does anyone have any suggestions for how i can create this dialog and get the ui-thread to set it up and call it

2549877
copy-constructor	temporary
in this case the copy-constructor is requiring that it can modify right but stack returned from arb myfunct is a temporary and cannot be modified

2549877
copy-constructor	rvalue
if you are using a compiler supporting rvalue references eg visual-studio 2010 then you can defined a move-constructor as well as the copy-constructor

2549885
boolean	int
generally it is advisable to checked everything against false first if the function returns value of different types such as int or boolean

2549890
invoices	product
for example say you have an invoices table that references a product table

2549890
invoices	product
once you have created an invoices with a specific product you could then never delete that product and if your ri is set up correctly it won t let you

2549894
key-value	key
the arrays_diff_assoc checked key and value and in the above example returns an arrays of all key-value pairs in new id that are not in old id

2549901
elementtree	lxml	celementtree	elementtree	celementtree	lxml
elementtree and the faster compatible implementation in celementtree and lxml let you very easily extraction information from xml -- as long as the xml is correct and your goals are well defined

2549917
filtering	grouping
i ve been asked to filtering this result by removing two specific grouping

2549917
filtering	grouping
it seems trivial but i can t seem to come up with a solid solution for storing the specific grouping i want to filtering out

2549917
filtering	grouping
my idea is to just create an arrays contains references to the two grouping i need to filtering out

2549917
filtering	grouping
my concern is that in the future they may ask to filtering out more grouping and maybe an arrays may not be a good idea

2549920
void	main
the main problem with the program was that the pointers p wasn t initializer in effect reducing the parameter to void

2549932
put	get
however i soon realised that the data refresh mechanism had been put in-place simply because we had live and test as two applications running off the same database at one points as we wanted to get the website live as soon as possible

2549939
signals	sigint
is there a way to map a signals numbers signals.sigint to its respective named sigint

2549944

2549944
sftp	ftp
just go to project properties | runtime configuration - i recommend using sftp instead of ftp

2549948
textchanged	textbox
would the best way to do this be to create a public static text properties that is updates by the textbox s textchanged event

2549958
return-value	arguments
if it helps here are some results of testing the return-values with the first two bits being the arguments and the last bit being the return-value

2549960
mupdf	xpdf
i d prefer mupdf over xpdf because it is actively maintained and has better pdf support

2549967

does anyone know what might cause this in firefox google-chrome

2550004
linux	unix
this wikipedia page says that unix and linux vendors are just now moving to sha-2 for their secure hashing of passwd

2550012
required	checked
.so the problem was that the caching required a checked for the folder

2550015
command-line	cmd
a third common approach is forming strongly-typed cmd from the command-line parameters

2550027
contains	set	contains	elements
because of that you can make your code more efficient by not looping over the elements in the hashset and instead working from the full set and removing strings as you find that they are contains within the full set

2550056
callback	methods
this code invokes a callback to the showmessagebox function from the main ui-thread by creating a delegation of the same signature as the showmessagebox methods and re-passing the sender object and eventargs in effect marshalling the non-ui thread call to the ui-thread

not all validation works client side we d need more detail to answer what s are the attributes your using on your named properties

2550107
derived-class	base-class	derived-class	pure-virtual	pure-virtual	base-class
the base-class vtable will have a slot for the pure-virtual function points to something like pure_virtual_function_called stubs that would probably abort the program while the derived-class vtable will have a pointers to the actual implementation

2550114
opensolaris	linux
root is open source runs on mac windows linux and opensolaris and in principles on other unicies

2550128
python	c++	python	ruby

2550255
key-value	key
would it be worth it to caching the digest filename in memcachingd as a key-value pair the key being the original + versioning and value the sha1 hash or is generator the digest quick enough for a high traffic php web .app

dbvisualizer	toad
that means either scripting the query to include a line break or using another tool like toad dbvisualizer sql lob editor or some other third-party tool

2550464
32-bit	64bit
it s common to see int as a 32-bit entity even on 64bit architectures where compatibility with older systemd and memory efficiency are high priorities

2550464
32-bit	16-bit
on smaller devices such as cell phones the cpu may be built to handle 16-bit data more naturally and have to work hard to handle 32-bit or larger data

2550464
32-bit	16-bit
in such an architecture you will most likely find int to be 16-bit in size and long to be 32-bit in size

2550464
subtraction	addition	32-bit	16-bit
there may also be a performance penalty associated with using longs caused by either wait states to load the 32-bit in multiple reads across a 16-bit data bus or caused by implements long operations addition subtraction etc in software if the native hardware doesn t support such operations in hardware

2550481
punctuation	words
string will lead to boundary problems with the first and last words in the string or strings where the target words have punctuation or are hyphenated

2550735
python	c++
i d recommend you to use python way better than c++ .when it comes to developing applications like the one you re trying to achieve

2550735
python	c++
remember that web bots web-crawler are i o bound not cpu bound .so the performance difference between a language like c++ against python would be almost none

2550770

if you do not use the static member function or some static factory-method which has the same implications but instead pass the singleton object to all clients that need it then you would have no need for the singleton pattern just pass the same object to all clients

2551219
set	bag
a quick fix is to change your nhibernate mapping to use a bag instead of a set

2551231
arrays	loops
if you re accessing two dimension arrays such as the one with the larger value in the inner loops should be slower

2551244

while-loop	arrays
with the while-loop the output simply says arrays

2551428
value	field
must be faster to find an int in hashtable rather than string in list but the resource intensive part is to probably query all items where that field contains some value and then loop.

2551449

2552252
lightbox	colorbox
you should apply colorbox separately to each link or maybe look into a different lightbox implementation

2552256

2553158
primitive	int
this code would be broken after the change because the primitive equality comparison between the int s which was ok before the change is now incorrectly comparing reference value rather than invoking equals object on the identifier

2553158
primitive	int
had the change been the reverse in other words had getid originally produced some fooid types then had it been changed to produce int the compiler would have complained about calling equals object on a primitive and the client code would have been corrected

2553172
opensuse	debian
whatever opensuse s package manager is called... for something like debian s build-essential package

2553172

2553534
contains	elements
what i want to detection is this elements is visible but is contains in a hidden parent

you can t pass in an arrays to string.contains - you will need to loops through your string and checked each or use linq

2553665
inline-code	code-behind
aside from what you and the others have mentioned separation reliability you can do everything code-behind can do with inline-code within page itself coding

2553678
firebird	oracle
although we have used db2 oracle and other product in the past firebird has either been more reliable or outperformed the others

2553687

i can put anything including hardcoding the full path but the setting does not seem to matter and the registry always contains mscoree.dll without any path

2553701
invoices	product
the problem with this is that a product from one company might appear on an invoices for a different company

2553701
invoices	product
postgresql required that i add a unique-index for the referenced attributes .so i am creating a unique-index on id company_id in product and invoices even though id is simply unique

2553701
invoices	product
also doing it exactly like the above would required me to add company_code a natural foreign key to product and invoices

2553709
nsstring	nsurl
note the poorly-named -setmainframeurl methods accepts an nsstring not an nsurl as you d expect

2553710
margins	padding

in my application i needed just to drag an object inside uiscrollview and i did the following in contentsview touch handler for that

2553894
nsmutablearray	nsarray
for 003 i am not sure if returning nsmutablearray .when the methods expects nsarray is good practice it works but it feels awkward

2553899
32-bit	64bit
with a 32-bit db2 client on the same win7 64bit machine the connect also works

2553905
logging	trace
i believe etw and the clrs stress log amongst many other systemd s kernel or highperformance trace logging are implements that way

2553916
logging	trace
logging is an automatic writing of trace text recording while program is running

2553924
dictionary	map
looking at my stl_util.h many of the classics deleter functions copy_if and al.so this one probably al.so quite common but i don t see it given in the response .so far for searching through a map and returning either the found value or a default ala get in python dictionary

2553936
increment	average
after reading the old value for updating the running average you replace it with the newest value and increment the buffering positioning if it is at 99 you set it back to 0 â thus the circular part

2553956
hide	show
you would need to use javascript to hide show the hyperlink instead

2553959
value	field
i am using a asp calendar control to insert a datetime value into a field to be part of an insert to a sql-server 2005 db table

2553963

in a webpage i want to get every visible text in a textnode.i don t want to put all the result into one array.i mean .when i meet a visible text i will do something else

2553969
output	cat
besides the thing posted by other users .when using input redirection from a file standards input is the file but .when piping the output of cat to the input standards input is a streaming with the contents of the file

2553970
any	set
as you have not set any of your button as default checked the browser may be supplying its own value - in this case 0

2553978
32-bit	64bit
other than that recognize that java is 32-bit by design .so you re not likely to see any huge performance increase from moving data 64bit at a time

2553987
contains	any	contains	lookup	arguments	default	lookup	any
in english that means start with any non- default keyword arguments that doesn t contains a double underscore.js which would indicate a non-exact lookup

2554019
google-earth	google-maps
all uses of google-maps and google-earth and content must provide

2554020
updating	updates
if the updates absolutely has to come from somewhere other than your java program pehaps it could notify your java program in addition to updating the database

2554027
nhibernate	ado.net	data-access	nhibernate	data-access	ado.net
if you know you ve got to design a rest service that encapsulates your business-logic and adds a layer of security over the data anyway then why wouldn t you use a traditional data-access technology ado.net nhibernate ado.net ef etc. inside of there

2554048
widget	button
the widget would add a button on the side of the row which would allow to add a new row by doubling the initial row with empty field or more and also it would add a remove button beside the added rows for the removal of the cloned rows except the original one the first row

2554051
http	ssl	contains	elements
i need to use http .when the page is accessed via ssl to avoid the dreaded this page contains both secure and insecure elements warning

i m trying to adapt this des encrypting example to aes .so i made the changes and it try to run this

2554070
credentials	integrated
hi guys i ve integrated roundcube mail albeit pretty bluntly in my application i.e i just have it open in an iframe with the login credentials passed through via session variables

2554077
handler	service
if it s being generator in an web application or service you can try putting an global exception-handling handler in your global-asax file

2554096
multiplication	addition
pointer-arithmetic is constants - it s usually a single multiplication and addition to base

2554102
calayer	uiview	uilabel	uiview
the uilabel you add to your cell view will be children of your cell s uiview and their calayer will be a child of the cell s calayer

2554102
calayer	uiview
.when you draw anything in uiview s drawrect methods the calayer the uiview owns will become backed by a bitmap

2554102
order	add
any child calayer you add to your cell s layer later will be siblings of the uilabel s layer and since you added them later they will be added under them by default there are versioning of the methods that adds them which can control order though

2554116
selected	button
if i selected any one of the options and click the button labeled clear i need to clear the selecteded option using javascript

2554139
png	gif
try using another types of image 8bit png png with no alpha value jpeg gif

2554141
meta-inf	jar
where are the top-level directory you got by running the first jar -xf jxl and are the top-level directory you got by running jar -xf ojdbc14.jar leaving out meta-inf

2554141
contains	any
this will not work though if any one of these top-level directory contains spaces.

2554149
selected	button
i just wanted to be able change div s content it s inner html with selected one of a or b radio button but div#content does not have javascript attributes value .so i am asking how it can be done

2554157
checkbox	button
i have an aspx page that contains a checkbox and a button

2554157
checkbox	button
the button is disabled by default until the user checked the checkbox

2554160
json	xml
i know you said json but it s very simple to generator a sql scripting to do an entire dump in xml

2554164
multiplying	division	multiplication	multiplying	multiplication	division
if you use inherited it means your multiplying and divide functions would have to be virtual which in the case of something as simple as multiplication or division would probably add significant overhead

2554164
valarray	std
another possibility to consider would be to use std valarray s instead

2554184
revision	updates
this allows us to patch the server without having to resort to putting up a maintenance page which is great but it doesn t feel quite right since it s not actually a proper deployment and we still need to manually updates the revision file and our deployment doesn t appear in the hoptoad or newrelic service we use

2554205
checkbox	button
it seems like the validation should be attached to the checkbox not the button

2554207
unrecognized-selector	uncaught-exception
2010-03-31 10 37 10.253 colordoodle 2014 20b terminating .app due to uncaught-exception nsinvalidargumentexception reason - domelement structuralcomplexitycontribution unrecognized-selector sent to instances 0x3e51b60

2554212
checkbox	button
i think it would work if you enabled disabled the button on the checkbox server-side event rather than client side since the associated client-side validation code will be generator to run for validationgroup of the button

2554215
tokenize	parsing
.so far everything went well tokenize parsing but i m getting a huge problem with .some of the data-structures in the part that actually runs the tokenize and parsing code

2554216
gas	att
which i think is this in att gas syntax

2554236
attributes	properties
you can overload methods within the service assembly and differentiate them via the operationcontract attributes and specifically the named properties but to an outside client they will appear to be different web methods with different namedd

2554236
service-layer	crud
.so to summarize it probably makes very little sense for you to have a service-layer that lives on the client which talks to a data-layer that s exposed as a web service unless you need to .solve the very specific problem of providing crud operations over a wan

2554244
callback	methods
you can use the keyguardmanager methods public void exitkeyguardsecurely keyguardmanager.onkeyguardexitresult callback

2554252
contains	set
after the first code line the variables contains the value null because the user who picked the contact from his iphone address book doesn t set the country key for this contact .so far .so good

2554267
player	movie
i guess you can create an uiimageview and place a screenshot of the movie player on it

2554280
.when	ready
this is a bit of a stab in the dark since i have not used jqgrid-asp.net but you might try initializing your grid .when the tab is ready from the tab s show event

2554282
shell	bash
i am working on a bash shell scripting that does something like this

2554299
selected	checkbox
if none of the checkbox is selecteded then i need to show the error messages like please selected any

2554308
directory	folder
which tells biterscripting - give me all entries in folder folder with named that match the patten whose file types is f flat-file not directory and whose file modification time fmtime is earlier than 1 hour

2554318
h.264	mp4
for h.264 streaminging you may also need to prefix the streaming id with mp4

2554336
radio-button	listitem
for every radio-button which is a listitem in a radio-buttonlist i add the following on the serverside

2554341
mouseleave	mousehover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseenter	mousehover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mousemove	mousehover	mouseover	mousehover	mousemove	mousemove	mouseover
there is no on mouseover in winforms afaik there are mousehover and mousemove events but if you change image on those it will not change back .so the mouseenter + mouseleave are what you are looking for i think

2554347
selected	button
wouldn t a better alternative be to just add a third button neither that will give the same result as none selected

2554360
base-class	inherited
i would probably use inherited -- defined a base-class that implements the basic operations you want to support .so most of the other code can just use those

2554364
revision	svnadmin	svnadmin	dump
then still using svnadmin dump and the --incremental option dump all the good revision between the bad branch revision

2554372
private-key	rsa
basically there is one rsa private-key on the card plus a certificate for paired public key

2554374
textbox	button
i also have a cancel button on the add page which is bound to an action methods that again clears the value that the named textbox is bound to

2554374
value	field
however if i set the cancel button to immediate if i enter value in the named field and then click cancel the action methods is fired and clears the object in the backing bean and goes to the listing page

2554377
instances	private
for a proper implementation of the pattern you need to subclassing form to create your decorator and then intercept all operations taken on your decorator and forwarding them to your private form instances

2554377
constructor	private	instances	private
you sort of do that except that aside from assign a reference in the formdecorator constructor you never again use that private form instances

2554414
difference	zero
edit 2 adding in index hints made zero difference

2554416
postgresql	firebird
we chose not to use firebird as the db morfik supports it natively and going with postgresql over odbc

2554419
numeric	nan
support for special numeric states nan + -inf

2554426
put	get
i would guess that the problem is that 42 isn t divisible by 4 and .so they get out of alignment if you put several of these struct back to back allocate memory for several of them determining the size with sizeof

2554432
remote-desktop	rdp
are there any rdp clients that instead leave the remote-desktop at its original size and pan this larger area .when the mouse reaches the border edges of the local display

2554438
hide	next
a next button performs hide on that panels and then call a function called .showyourself

2554464
subtract	time
hi guys i m using microtime function of php to tell how long certain snippets of code take to run i do this by taking the time before and after the snippet and subtract them using microtime function

2554472
serialization	marshalling	getter	setter
the code will likely be either all-at-once serialization code aka marshalling or a bunch of getter and setter

2554490
perl	c++
i understand oop i m getting more familiar with c++ oop aswell i understand the points of the pointsers and some arithmetic and references widely used in perl

2554490
perl	c++	double	int
i don t need manual for dummies what is int bool double if while i just need a directions how to learn c++ from the perspective of a perl programmer because i m sure that there are many like me

2554497
contains	set
also sense your tblpromotion object is going to have properties and therefore memory allocated for those skipped field why not just use an annonymous types or set up a helpers class that contains only your needed properties

2554514
32-bit	64bit	compatibility	platform
my platform is w7 64bit with python 2.6 the applications are 32-bit in case it matters and compatibility with unix is not a concern

2554521
order	join
.when you declare a join b join c there is no order of join involved

2554521
order	join
at a logical level the inner-join operators is as.sociativity .so the order does not matter a join b join c is identical with a join c join b which is identical with b join a join c and .so on and .so forth

2554526
fragment-shader	vertex-shader
to read the color you wrote in the vertex-shader in the fragment-shader read the built-in varying gl_color

2554530
perl	c++
c++ for perl programmers is a pretty specific request

2554530
perl	c++
given that perl abstracts away more of the machine than c++ does i think that a good way to start would be to forget what you know about perl and get a regular c++ book

2554530
perl	c++
if i were going to go from an arrays in c++ to one in perl i would say that a perl arrays is like a c++ arrays that holds pointers to data instead of data if that is even true - i am not a perl programmer .so it may not be

2554530
linked-list	arrays
maybe a perl arrays is more like a linked-list data structure

2554540
virtual-functions	base-class
if the object themselves should have an idea of how to rank with each other and you are pretty sure that you are not going to be deriving more classes with different rules i would probably add a couple of virtual-functions to the base-class named int primarysortkey and int secondarysortkey

2554542
put	get
httplib on .app engine is a wr.apper around the urlfetch api which only supports the get .post put head and delete methods

2554560
richfaces	tomahawk
to fix this you should rather use the jsf-supplied iterator components such as richfaces a4j repeat or facelets user-interface repeat or tomahawk t datalist

2554577
arrays	loops
why not to just loops over this arrays

2554590
javascript	dom
our webpage load two javascript one of which then loads several other javascript dynamically into the dom

2554590
javascript	dom
my problem is that htmlunit updates the dom with the new javascript but does not then seem to run those javascript because expected dom elements do not appear

2554621
if-statement	loops
the basic are all the same -- if-statement while loops for loops etc

2554683
any	set
is there any way to set fake this

2554685
webforms	asp.net
it s far too easy with asp.net webforms and server controls to emit lousy markup

2554687
contains	any
i have double checked triple checked and rechecked that src.calltype can not possibly contains any value which are not in the enum datatypes.calltype

2554709
union-all	union
a simple quick boost might be to change your union to union-all i am a sql-server guy - does this apply to other dbs

2554731
contains	any	contains	elements
any containsers subclassing can have a layoutmanager and contains child elements

2555199
abstract-class	pure-virtual
even in an abstract-class you don t want your destructor to be pure-virtual

2555205
arrays	loops
instead of using continuously is there anyway i can pass a list or arrays or something like that rather that specifying each one or can i use a foreach loops in the middle of the query

2555206
default-value	default	value	field
i need the default-value at the database level because not all row insert are done via l2s and in .some cases the default-value is a little more complex than a hardcode value creating the default based on another field .so i d rather avoid duplicating that logic

2555207
solaris	linux
will using this look-and-feel will appear same on all platform mac solaris linux

2555212
udp	tcp
those who keep telling the poor guy to just use tcp ignore that there are good reasons why a reliable udp implementation would be used over tcp - and it s not datagram semantics which dead easy to layer on top of tcp

2555235
jquery	.post
if you are still stuck on how to .post the form though i would look into the jquery .searlize methods here and combine it with the jquery ..post methods

2555236
contains	elements
in the selected algorithm you do the partition step exactly as before -- but instead of recursively sorting both partition you look at which partition contains the elements you want and recursively selected only in that partition

revision	svn
we use svn for our source-code revision control and are experimenting using it for non-source-code files

2555257

2555276
page-fault	kernel
we assume the code for each task and the kernel is in the i-cache of both processor no added page-fault on load balancing

2555286
value	field
a way is to add another field to your model to store cleaned value

2555299
constructor	object
for example c++ constructor can have no return-value and it is probably bad to have a partially construct object .so throw an exception-handling is .sometimes the best option

2555319
value	field
asp.net building the page with default value in field request 1

2555319
postdata	request
asp.net adds the postdata to the page request 2

2555332

64bit vs 32-bit incompatibility is the most common cause of that error

2555344
any	set
in the project settings page of the c# project your platform target will be set to any cpu

2555345
any	set
you would then need to set the form as web-only and renamed or hide any others with the same named that are set to appear on the web

2555372
constructor	object
sometimes you also want to throw an exception-handling to halt the creation of an object .when the constructor has been passed a non-valid arguments illegalargumentsexception-handling

2555372
exception-handling	error-handling
in java throw an exception-handling pauses the jvm .so you don t want to use for normals error-handling as it will greatly decrease the performance of your application

2555393
directory	folder
i ve placed all these libs into a libs sub folder in my source directory

2555421
linux	unix
that depends a lot on both your compiler and target environment risc unix linux windows

2555437
compatibility	legacy
stringtokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code

2555438
type-safety	generics
generics are useful .when you want to enforce type-safety in complex object

2555453
protected	public
public protected and private keyword do not make it into object-files at all .so there is no benefit at all

2555489
exception-handling	try-catch
by default eclipse will break on any uncaught-exception and will ignore all caught exception-handling anything that is snagged by a try-catch block

2555495

2555532
contains	any
there are plenty and some of them already contains everything you need without any replace

2555541
arrays	loops
you could store all the rows into a separate arrays during the first loops and then reference the arrays throughout all the other loopss rather than fetching the same information over and over assuming you reselect which you probably are

2555541
arrays	loops
or if there are not many items more than the ones you re fetching you could use a single query to fetch all of the rows at once you re using only one query and loops through that to store all the value in an arrays or something similar then simply reference all those rows in the arrays in each of your loopss

2555551
ref	out
i however try to avoid the out and ref keyword if possible

2555566
arrays	loops
you should use a join from items to category and get all the items then you can sort them out into a multi-dimensional arrays and then loops through that for output

2555579
ref	out
that means you need ref or out

2555579
ref	out
that means you need ref rather than out

2555609
flash-builder	air
i have an air .app initially written in flex 3 that i had removed the google-chrome from but now it show up .when i compile using flash-builder 4 with flex 4 sdk

firefox	safari
which other framework or source i can use to create tabs like firefox oder safari

2555652
any	set
then any result set page numbers outside result set s range is not found there s no meaningful points for these page resources to exist hence 404

2555654
.net	wcf	intranet	lan
but if you have an intranet scenario - your company s lan environment - and you have .net clients calling your wcf service there s no reason at all not to use net.tcp

2555666
click	mouse
with vim is made aware of what the mouse is doing and therefore won t perform automatic indentation .when it receives a multi-line paste via a middle-button mouse click

2555667

i assume you have some form of version-control like svn or git

2555672
webserver	upload	build-process	ant
as part of my ant build-process i d like to upload files to a webserver via http-post

2555674
bazaar	git
you can also include svn path git path mercurial path or bazaar path in the pip requirements

2555688
double	int
my guess is that 2 in case2 is casting 5 + 6 to int and causing round of division to 5 then casted again to double and converted to 5.0

2555695
put	get
all data is access changed via standards http verbs get .post put delete

2555701
double	int
int 11 2 5 under int-arithmetic which you then cast to double in the assignment

2555713
coalesce	isnull
if variables is null at the start an uninitialized value then you need a coalesce or isnull and you ll often use a separator

2555724
openoffice.org	uno
i am using openoffice.org uno api to iterate through all text in writer document

2555734
assign	add
instead of assign onclientclick at design-time add a client scripting that stores the current click handler function creates a function that runs your code and then runs the stored handler function and attaches that new function as the click handler

2555759
attributes	properties
as it turned out .when i put the attributes on an overrides properties labelfor didn t seem to notice it

2555759
attributes	properties
however the attributes works fine on the overrides properties and the generator errormessage actually uses the displaynameattributes

2555759
attributes	properties
this is some trivial examplecode the more realistic scenario is that i have a databasemodel separate from the viewmodel but for convenience i d like to inherited from the databasemodel add view-only properties and decorating the viewmodel with the attributes for the user-interface

2555761
double	int
to expand on marc s correct answer a bit whole numbers are interpreter as int whereas numbers with decimal points are interpreter as double

2555766
json	xml
i mean should i create a settings class object and serializing it to settings.dat or provide an structured file like xml json

2555771
google-chrome	firefox
it worked on ie6 and current versioning of firefox and google-chrome on linux

2555778

2555825
blackberry	nokia
the main options would probably be blackberry j2me for nokia ect or android

2555837
value	field
if this value is in some field you could also do

2555843
difference	zero
the difference between equals and deepequals for nested arrays is show here note that by default java initializer int arrays with zero as elements

2555847
any	set
if i browse to the url or any numbers that corresponds to an existing shift i get the proper error about having no parameters set but .when i pass parameters without an id of some sort it errors out

2555850
getter	setter
but the takeaway and you can tell from the il is that they re the getter and setter methods for dealing with arrays at the given index positioning

2555852
constructor	object
global state is very hard to deal with correctly .so i usually pass the relevant settings to the various object in their constructor or in properties

2555852
value	field
i ve had users enter a month and day combinations into a particular field and the format they used was different from what was expected .so the value saved was incorrect

2555855
amazon-web-services	amazon-s3
i am using the ruby amazon-web-services s3 libs to retrieve files from amazon-s3

2555875
wicket	jsf
wicket just like jsf a component-based framework

2555896
groovy	java
groovy metaclass magic is not available in java unless the java code were to explicit call groovyclass.invokemethod somemethod arguments

2555908
ethernet	packets
most network hardware will allow you to set an option in the hardware to store bad packets. this allows you to see packets in which the ethernet crc failed

2555913
task-queue	worker
it s a distribute task-queue built with python that exposes three concepts - a queue a set of worker and a result store

2555916
aspect-ratio	scale
i don t want to scale the image because that would mess up the aspect-ratio

2555918
vb.net	vb6	basic	vb6
1 they must be compatible with project developed in visual basic 6.0 the old vb6 emphatically not vb.net

2555919
versioning	upgrade
you can also use the upgrade methods to move the settings from previous versioning into the newer one

2555920
default	reset
the first way is to provide default value for your parameters in the constructor and only perform certain actions on those parameters if they reset

2555928
authentication	login
upon login authentication as such

2555940
textmate	vim
the guy who is running the site switched from textmate to vim and hosts very good and concise casts on specific vim topics

2555941
servicecontract	datacontract
same thing with servicecontractattribute and servicecontract and i imagine datacontract but i haven t gotten that far

2555947
windows-vista	windows
under windows-vista and windows 7 the binary s virtual-memory spaces is al.so randomized each time it is execute .so the function address will be different for each run

2555956
getter	setter
i have the appropriate getter and setter but only the first newrecnum show up the other two are null

2555982
mediawiki	vbulletin
if i m using an integration bridge scripting for a cms and forums more specifically drupal or mediawiki and vbulletin how should i set up the database

2555987
serialization	marshalling
if it s to deal with data that s in a file or on the wire in a particular format what you should do is write up some marshalling serialization routines that move the data between the compiler struct that represents how you want to deal with the data inside the program and a char arrays that deals with how the data looks on the wire file

2556003
push	pull
.so my question is it possible to push pull changes from each others repo over the internet

2556026
entity	pojo
the best way to explore the java world and to connect all the dotâ s is to just use one of the frameworks as all use web.xml context.xml and java ee components all can persistent the pojo entity beans

2556048
msbuild-task	msbuild
from my reading i understand that i can do this through a msbuild-task or a target and just add it to a c# vb.net project file but i can find no specific example since msbuild is large topic

2556056
vbscript	jscript
as for the timestamp the problem is that neither vbscript nor jscript have built-in functions that would format the date in the format you need .so you will have to write the code for doing this yourself

2556059
hsqldb	mysql
i just made the following change in the base-class because you can t use identiy - the default with hsqldb and also with mysql if i m not wrong - with a table_per_class strategy 1

2556079
push	pull
if you can ssh to each others computers you can do git push pull to each other s computers

2556082
semantic-web	ontology
however .when i research ontology they seem to always exist in the context of publicly accessible data stores serving as the backbone.js of the semantic-web

2556103
environment	execution
i m not execution some_command directly in the shell running the scripting because i don t want to alter it s environment

2556109
push	pull
i would suggest using a central repository location that you can all push and pull from via ssh

2556123
subshell	bash
also you might want to checkout the bracket-style cmd blocks of bash they are always execute in a subshell thus not altering the current environment and are more powerful as well

2556123
shell	bash
edit for instances .when using -style blocks as compared to bash -c cmd you don t have to worry about escaping any arguments strings with spaces or any other special shell syntax

2556136
textbox	button
i created my own custom datepicker consisting of an asp textbox button and calendar complete with css styles javascript code and event handling vb code

2556148
entity-framework	nhibernate
for .net you can use entity-framework nhibernate or subsonic

2556159
entity-framework	nhibernate
your question does not mention how you are actually mapping data from your database to object now but if you are not using any orm framework at the moment do have a look at nhibernate and entity-framework - they are both pretty solid solutions

2556165
c++	lua
however if luabind is used between c++ and lua that will complicate things a bit as luabind adds a lot of stuff to lua and i m not sure this could be simulated or ignore

2556172
python	c++
i m writing a python wrapper for a c++ libs and i m getting a really weird .when trying to set a struct s field in c

2556180

2556245
hash	md5	salt	md5
.so for example 1 salt hash is md5

2556251
panels	grid
even if all you re doing is playing around with how panels layout or grid splitters work put an xmldataprovider in your windows create xml test data and bind to it

2556251
value	field
the fact that properties value can be either local or inherited means that instead of value being stored in field they re stored as dictionary entries

2556262
.war	jar
i have a custom tag packaged into a libs jar that is include in my web apps .war file

2556262
meta-inf	jar	.war	jar
i ve confirmed that the jar is in the .war and that the tag file is in the jar and the that the tld in meta-inf expressly defined widgetfactory

configuration	installation
for your salt store it in a configuration file that is not accessible from the outside but can be read by your php installation

2556290
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
and in fact it works just fine in ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome in windows as well as safari and google-chrome on the mac

2556311
value	field
on now reading your edit i would agree that your original approach would be the way to go in my opinion - passing in an object and updating all of the associated field in a database compared to passing in an object properties value and updating that in a database the biggest performance killer will be opening the database connection not the numbers of field relating to one database recording

2556315
contains	set	contains	elements
maybe you need to set the align attributes on the prefwindow or the contains preferences elements to stretch

2556317
.net	wcf
using is just a short-hand notation which is true and valid and useable for any .net attributes really - nothing special about the wcf attributess here and is 100 equivalent to

2556332
value	field
for example imagine what an expression that built the list of field value and returned them as a comma separated string would look like - but you would need to escape comma in the value themselves

2556363
access-token	login
enhanced security for the user the user won t have to give you their user named and passwd they have to login to google and you will get an access-token that you will use to make any further api call

2556364
tapestry	jsf	tapestry	wicket	wicket	jsf
in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s inversion-of-control containers makes it more powerful than wicket

2556375
jpql	hql
i don t know how to do that in jpql but hql has day and month functions .so you could run

2556378
put	get
wherever i try to put orderby albums.albumid descending i get error

for-loop	arrays
is it possible to initializer an arrays in java using the advanced for-loop

2556436
for-loop	arrays
in the advanced for-loop there is no way to access the hidden counter and neither is there to perform a write access on the corresponding arrays slot

2556437
getter	setter
the snippet of code from the object only contains the important functions everything else is not important getter setter etc ...

2556441
any	set
more importantly because i create a set of partials class files i can regenerate all i want without losing any of my custom coding

2556454

2558632
hashtable	set
you may be referring to a hash_set where the set is implements using hashtable

2558632
postorder	inorder	postorder	preorder	preorder	inorder
however if it is important for your elements to be stored in particular order then the tree implementation is more appropriate since you can traversal it preorder inorder or postorder

2558649
order	add
in this case anytime you want to add an orderitem to the order this invariant should be enforced to make sure that your order is valid

2558661
properties-file	jar
the taskdef isn t paying attention to the properties-file you move because the you provided to tells it to only look in the jar

2558709
any	set
.so is there any feature which handles this feature by default any properties or flag which i need to set to listview to behave like this or manual implementation

2558723
put	get
i m sure there are wrapper around php s libcurl libs that are a little bit more intuitive for the restful i just want to get .post put delete some data approach but then again it s at most 20 lines-of-code to roll a class that does that yourself

2558730
indexof	charat
i figured a way to find the string if there are no extra characters using indexof string.charat 0 and indexof charat string-length -1 and looping through the characters between the two indexes

2558762
binary	hex
a hex string is significantly longer than the corresponding binary string

2558764
rollback	commit
i have built my own solution create a transactionscope in the controllers then commit rollback in onactionexecuted but it turns out to be very unreliable

2558765
directory	folder
you can extraction the libiconv- into a folder first then copy all the sub-folders in to your mingw directory

2558784
memset	malloc	memmove	memcpy
in creating your own memory-management systemd now that you have learned what memset does and doesn t hopefully already knowing enough of the low-level stuff that you know the difference between memcpy and memmove your next step is to learn about alignment and about the guarantees that malloc fulfills but your code doesn t

2558791
children	nodes
here is the nodes i want to remove since it has not children elements nor any attributes

2558809
textbox	button
the idea is that once i click the button btnsearch the textbox txtsearch should be focused even after a process was initiated opened outside the main windows

2558818
malloc	free
the call to free will put the memory block that had been allocated by malloc back onto data-structures that the c runtime maintains for the heap in this case something that might be called the free-list

2558818
malloc	free
on malloc free new delete

2558870
jquery	.post
i am trying to .post some data with jquery ajax but the parameters in my ajax methods are null

2558873
hash	md5
in the following code i use getfiles to retrieve all the files in a given directory and for each file use md5 to hash its contents checked if this value already lives in a dictionary if yes it s a duplicates and i ll delete it

2558876
administration	account
most probably you have a login defined only for built-in administration s but don t have one for built-in users or for you windows account

2558883
children	nodes
using an xpath expression it is possible to find all nodes that have no attributes or children

2558890
hash	md5
you can optimize this routine a bit by calculating md5 hash only once it s either typo in the question or you re really doing .so twice

2558894
attributes	properties
the collections to index is iset t and i suspect that t is a types with indexed attributes and has a properties named marked with field attributes

2558911
specifications	w3c
the specifications from w3c say that xhtml 1.1 predates xhtml 1.0 which is very counter-intuitive to me

2558923
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
the longer answer is that firefox google-chrome and opera all have good standards compliance .so if it works in one it s very likely to work in the others

2558929
digits	zero
i need to encode streaminging of 8 byte such that encode streaming has only digits zero to nine in them

2558930
selected	button
selected your preferred browser from the list and click the set as default button

2558931
arguments	default
i would just document your fullest methods in this case addtree int fruit int and then in the javadoc for other methodss refer to this one and explain how which default value are used for the arguments not provided

2558940
lookup	any
any such more complicated encoding will however introduce the need for more complex packing unpack code and maybe even lookup tables .so it might not be worth the effort

2558953
decimal	octal
the next longest is to convert it to either octal or decimal bytewise

2558959
windows-xp	windows
it seems to happen more with windows-xp and it seems also to be possibly related to windows firewall settings

2558967
listitem	selected
as soon as the user selected a file and click upload i want this file to go directly to the attachment list within that listitem

2558987
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the full versioning will allow you to checkout side-by-side layout across opera safari firefox and internet-explorer 6-8

2558992
average	minimum
i m trying to construct a query to get the average maximum and minimum numbers of items purchased per user

2559000
selected	button
then in a button click event i use the code below try to get the value selected

2559000
object-reference	instances
i get a error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2559010
python	ruby
python and ruby have similar mechanisms for the same reason

2559015
button	popup
after click on submit button it popup new windows

2559038
output	mode
the output .when i run in debugging mode is

2559041
administration	account
on each site there is an administration role that include mainly the customer s account

2559052
contains	any
i can now if a session contains any changes which must be synchronized with the database with

2559066
factors	primes
however the dsa standards explicit required that one of the primes factors of p-1 is large

2559073
keydown	keyup
this is the code you need to get the keyup and keydown events

2559096
event-sourcing	cqrs
i ve studied some cqrs sample implementation java .net which use event-sourcing as the event-store and a simple no sql stores as the report store

2559103
pkcs#7	x509
what is the difference between pkcs#7 der and x509

2559103
pkcs#7	x509
my understanding is der is format x509 is certificate and pkcs#7 is the standards

2559124
triggers	insert
.when you press a button in excel it either reads your spreadsheet data one recording at a time and has the validation logic or it simply upload it with insert query to a temporary table and then you have a triggers that sees the data and process it

2559124
webserver	upload
i suppose you could write .some quick vba to output the excel data to csv and upload that csv file instead .so that nothing on the webserver has to try to read an excel file

2559124
put	get
if you are willing to put ms-access in the middle that can get you around a lot of these complications but is itself an extra layer

2559131
value	field
readonly field can be initializer and only initializer with a value known at runtime

2559134
shutdown	exit
you need to shutdown the jvm by calling exit as

2559141
actionscript	mxml
i have a custom-component that i can call with actionscript or with mxml like this

2559141
value	field
.when i go to design mode i can see the component under custom components i can drag it to the stage and see it but can t set its value field1 and field visually on the right like a normals or would have

2559142
uipagecontrol	uitableview
i have three uitabelview in a uipagecontrol but i could t scroll the uitableview vertically can anyone tell me how to support this feature in this scenario

2559148
constructor	object
a readonly field is initializer at runtime but can only be initializer either in the object s constructor or in the field declaration itself

2559158
selected	button
for some reason the datepicker s prev next button no longer exhibit the correct behavior and instead move from this month selected as default to december 1899 for previous and january 1900 for next

2559171
persistent	transient
if you were using hibernate annotations you could annotations datemodification with transient which would mean any changes to that field would not be persistent

2559176
value	field
a readonly field on the other hand is initializer at runtime and can have any types and value

2559179
groovy	java	python	java	python	ruby
not just java you can write serverside in jython python on java jvm jruby ruby on java rhino javascript javascript and groovy

2559189
javascript	dom
i ve heard bits and pieces about document.write having an adverse impact on the dom or on the use of javascript libs

2559192
stderr	stdout
i suspect that putty actually does that - it would be very unusual to mute stderr but not stdout

2559199
decimal-point	digits
would cause a data truncated warning since the field can only store 2 digits to the right of the decimal-point not 6

2559203
contains	set
i set the transparency background s height and width to 100 causing it to take on the contains div s size

2559209
floating	margins
how can i get a margins between them apart from floating a transparency image to the right to create spaces there has to be a better way

2559218

web-services	ntlm	authentication	login
i have a winform .application calling web-services hosted in iis by default the client .app will use kerberose for authentication to iis and it failed for some reasonsã but the same .app works fine at another pc with different user login and i found it is using ntlm by checked the iis server event-log

2559232
push	pull
in my opinion operation between repository can be done just by hg push and hg pull the other cmd like hg updates hg import just work between a working-copy and its repository

2559262
decrement	increment
ctrl+a ctrl+x increment decrement a numbers

2559264
directory	folder
the rea.son for this is that path does not include the current directory . because doing .so would be a security risk folder with a ton of files in them including a fake ssh which could then intercept your passwd or the like

2559266
postgresql	mysql
soap postgresql mysql ldap and

2559277
any	set
the online time you need to worry about access rights is if you do any task that triggers the uac then you need to set the

2559285
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i don t know about the ajax actionlink specifically but it is possible from a webforms page to .post to an asp.net-mvc action with the attributes

2559285
asp.net-mvc	webforms
see this answer using an asp.net-mvc html-helper from a webforms

2559299
duplicates	lookup
here is one it looks right for you duplicatesticketsearchplugin provides an ajax-style lookup for duplicates tickets used on the new ticket page

2559305
iframe	popup
you might be able as you say to query the iframe s status somehow but i wouldn t know a defined way to do this there will be no onload event because no document will be loaded - once the browser receives the information to expect a file downloading it will popup the save-as dialog and leave the iframe s context completely

2559306
dictionary	arrays
you might consider making some changes on the server side if you can serve up the data as a dictionary with key chosen for clarity rather than an arrays with magic indexes and have any value that are zero-or-more or one-or-more always be arrayss

2559308
callback	methods
i have a working wrapper class for dallmeier camera devices it contains a callback methods to receive the current yuv image

2559309
asp.net-mvc	webforms
that way you can have an asp.net-mvc action with attributes that you can .post to from a webforms generator page

2559309
asp.net-mvc	webforms
see this answer using an asp.net-mvc html-helper from a webforms

2559310
highlight	selected
.so if you click on an item it should be selected for example highlight in blue and then .when you click on this item again an icons should be display

2559315
highlight	tooltip
of course if you want to also show your tooltip in the same code you would need to have this done in highlight and unhighlight

2559334
background-color	display
to display progress-bar you can use table with different td s and set the background-color of these td cell with the status result

2559353
synchronous	.when
.when you do document.write as andy said it s synchronous meaning you have to wait on it before continuing with the rest of the page

2559382
autocomplete	autosuggest
i read that if i want to implements autocomplete autosuggest with form i have to use ajax

2559404
binaries	install
.when i install my application along with the binaries a conf file is install that the user can change as he needs it s actually the user data file

2559404
binaries	install
in other words this conf file is install along with the binaries and should never be touch again overwrite deleted until a real uninstaller happens not repairs modifies upgrade in which case it should be deleted

2559407
order	add
now if you want to change the order then you will have top add it to the tab in that order

2559422
show	next
that works fine since error messages form our custom validation show up nicely next to the textbox

2559503
value	field
enter value for all field and click add

2559503
value	field
enter value for all field and click cancel immediate

2559512
postback	ajax
specifically i m looking at the ajax extensions like timer and updatepanel but it seems like a lot controls more would required postback

2559537
compact-framework	.net
i am using .net compact-framework 3.5

2559540
contains	set
while mainly aimed at running a set of affiliate sites on different domains that shared some content while keeping other content domain specific it also contains many tweak to assist in organizing and administrating such a setup

2559548
getter	setter
about the other field checked to see if you really defined the getter and setter right are they public the named matches exactly

2559571
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
the asp.net webforms controls in the toolbox are pretty useless during asp.net-mvc development

2559584
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
paolo has a good answer to this question though i find there are definitely minor difference between google-chrome and firefox and safari

2559589
switching	router
if you understand what a switching and router do know how multicast works and have a good understanding of the ethernet protocols then you are one up on many

2559611
simplecursoradapter	spinner
i have a spinner view that s populate through a simplecursoradapter

2559615
value	field
as a result .when asp.net-mvc creates a new surveyanswer object to add the forms value to the default-value of the byte types field is 0

2559615
selected	button
nicholas may also be right the browser returns a value of 0 .when none of the radio button is selected

2559616
hidden	reset
unfortunately form.reset function doesn t reset hidden input of the form

2559616
hidden	reset
does any one have an idea how to do the reset for hidden field as well

2559619
value	field
field have the overloaded function val which allows you to get and set the value of the field

2559631
selected	cell
ideally i would like to write a function that i can paste into a cell and then selected the rows or cell over which i run the test

2559641
getter	setter	initializer	setter	initializer	getter
i recently read that getter setter are evil and i have to say it makes sense yet .when i started learning oop one of the first things i learned was encapsulate your field .so i learned to create class give it .some field create getter setter for them and create constructor where i initializer these field

2559641
getter	setter
and every time some other class needs to manipulate this object or for instances display it i pass it the object and it manipulate it using getter setter

2559648
value	field	hidden	reset
if you re worried that someone might tamper with the value in the hidden field then there is no way to reset them

2559648
value	field	hidden	reset
you could think that you could save the value in a javascript file and use that to reset the value but .when a user can tamper with the hidden field he can tamper with the javascript as well

2559648
hidden	reset
.so from a security points of view if you need to reset hidden field then avoid them in the first place and save the information in the session on the server

2559661
getter	setter
i haven t yet read the full article but afaiu the basic points is that one should not unnecessarily publishing class field via mindlessly added or generator getter and setter

2559678
void	main
.so modify in void main

2559695
getter	setter
allen holub made a big splash with why getter and setter methods are evil back in 2003

2559696
getter	setter
encapsulate your field .so i learned to create class give it .some field create getter setter

2559696
getter	setter
clearly fussy getter and setter aren t essential

2559696
attributes	properties	getter	setter
python folks use properties sometimes to create a getter and setter functions that look like a simple attributes

2559696
getter	setter
private methods explicit getter and setter etc

2559696
getter	setter
as we say use the source luke and we re all adults here. we re all able to see the source we don t need to be fussy about piling on getter and setter to provide yet more hints as to how the api works

2559699
code-coverage	emma
i am using emma for code-coverage for my project

2559699
code-coverage	testcase
in my junit test case i am calling a methods but in code-coverage report it show no coverage for that methods which is getting called from testcase

2559701
javascript	dom
if the user has javascript enabled i am using jquery to remove the dom elements in this case .check-js which is the div housing the image

2559708
vsts	tfs
i was unable to meet the requirements to setup tfs .so i m using tortoisesvn and visualsvn as my versioning contol in vsts

2559708
teamcity	nant	teamcity	msdeploy	teamcity	msbuild	msbuild	nant	msdeploy	nant	msdeploy	msbuild	mstest	nunit	visualsvn-server	trac
i don t know which combinations stack i should be using cruisecontrol.net teamcity hudson nant nunit mstest trac bugtracker.net ndepend visualsvn-server perforce msdeploy msbuild scm

2559710
javascript	dom
you ll get much better results since you re not relying on the timing of javascript and the dom which behaves differently in every browser anyway

2559716
constructor	object
you could of course opt for a more dynamic constructor that returns the object

2559743
web-config	app-config
simply place the above code in your app-config or web-config

2559755
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter you don t have encapsulation

2559755
getter	setter
this has quite a complicated internal representation yet has no getter or setter and only one elements of the representation is probably exposed simply by returning its value size

2559767
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know i can run webforms and asp.net-mvc views in seperate files but i want to run the webserver control output and events in on the asp.net-mvc view page however i keep getting this compiler error

2559769
conditional	operators
since the default cross-join does not return those recording you can not express these join criterion with where conditional and you are forced to use join syntax oracle was an exception-handling to this with an extension to sql standards and to operators but this was not accepted by other vendors nor the standards

2559803
show	next
the page only show the latest 10 post and .when i click on the paginator for the next 10 it simply says that there are no post in this category. i tried searching online and some one had a solution to it too but that is with the query-string url filtering which is not available in moss2007 standards edition.

2559809
getter	setter
adding different getter and setter methods for concrete implementation will pollute the client code that uses these entities like lots of dynamic_casts to call required getter and setter methods

2559809
getter	setter
therefore getter and setter methods may remain where they are but you should protected client code

2559852
value	field	hidden	reset
in that listener function you could save the initial value to the dom elements storage mootools jquery and then listen to the reset event of the form to restore the initial value stored in the hidden form field storage

2559856
http	ssl
- notice http and i click a login link there it show a small html div with login form like a litebox .now as i am on a non ssl page http the data which i .post does not get encrypted and .posted to the process action

2559864
getter	setter
getter and setter let external users read modify the state of an object without using any function

2559864
constructor	object
hence the idea that except for datatransferobject for which you might have getter and a constructor for setting the state the members of an object should only be modified by calling a functionality of an object

2559873
pure-virtual	base-class
this is almost certainly a case for using a pure-virtual member function in the base-class then overrides in the derived classes where you do the real work

2559879
configuration	installation
btw this is taken from our server s jboss-log4j.xml file - if you checked your default server installation i am fairly sure you find a similar configuration there

2559888
vlookup	sumifs
the only other option i see would be to combine the value in c and d like and sumifs vlookup that searches for y

2559895
execute	prepare
i think you have not to really execute nothing just prepare the statements resources and whatever you want

2559900
getter	setter
i don t want to have getter and setter methods

2559922
protected	public
templates methods is rational if you have a class hierarchy and base-class defined protected operation step in its public templates methods

2559924
widget	button
i want to activate the jqueryui button widget on a given selector lets say .button

2559930
asp.net-mvc	webforms
but remember the asp.net-mvc page lifecycle is very different than the one of webforms

2559930
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
please see the asp.net webforms page lifecycle as opposed to the asp.net-mvc page lifecycle and this question

2559945
value	field
for each field i would think about the possible value you can enter both valid and invalid

2559945
value	field
if a field is numeric what happens if i enter a value one less than the lower-bound

2559957
stdin	pipe
the spellchecker uses aspell which is called from a scripting on the server which execute the cmd.exe and uses it to pipe a file into aspell it s a long winded way i know but our server side programming langauge coldfusion doesn t support writing to stdin for executable

2559962
getter	setter
first add two properties to the bean confirmuser and emailid of course with getter and setter

2559967
pixels	line
i want to be able to calculate the directions of a line to eye coordinates and store this value for every pixels on the line using a vertex and fragment-shader

2559968
firewatir	watir
3 you can then navigate to your page and just use watir firewatir to enter username passwd into a converted 401 authentication webpage like a regular form

2559986
constructor	private	instances	private
usually a singleton has a private constructor a public destructor a private static instances variables and a public static singleton get lazy-evaluation construction function although there are variations on that pattern

2559991
virtual-functions	member-functions
virtual-functions are inappropriate here because the subclassing member-functions are specific to those subclassinging for example the coursestudent has a list of units whereas a researchstudent does not .so a getunits function implementation in researchstudent would make no sense at all

2559991
constructor	private	constructor	mutators	data-members	mutators	data-members	constructor	data-members	private
in this case i am specifically checked the types before i perform the types using a private data-members that is set in the subclassing constructor and has no mutators .so as long as my checked is good there should be no problem with a static-cast

2559999
click	mouse
.when i click on a combobox i can use the mouse wheel to scroll through options but i cannot deselect the combobox by click off it on a blank portion of the parent form inorder to return to scrolling the parent form

2560036
getter	setter
it s no more of a performance bottleneck than using actual getter and setter no matter what optimisations happen

2560036
parentheses	operators
edit if you prefer not to use the parentheses you can always defined and an implicit-cast operators

2560041
positioning	slider
then .when the slider stops sliding you can set it s value to the numbers you rounded to which will make the slider snap to that positioning kind like snapping to a tick mark

2560042
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
tried the code in webkit safari google-chrome mozilla and opera

2560054
64bit	x86
note use program files x86 on 64bit systemd

2560069
hotmail	gmail
there s no problem with sending the email but some email clients like outlook and hotmail receive html newsletter as an attachment and the email body contains only plaintext with html tags removed and some clients like gmail receive the email just fine

2560075
value	field
to get it initializer at the right points i d create a static private function returning a dictionary with the correct value and use that as the member initializer of a static field in the class

2560085
versioning	migrate
as a side effect way we have to maintain 2-3 versioning instances of web-services until our customers migrate themselves we give them some time until we stop supporting older versioning

2560095
python	c++
python or any other scripting-language might be able to access c++ code in exactly the same compiler and versioning it was compiled with

2560102
perl	ruby
and perl and ruby api exists for tt

2560103
callback	methods
do i need to add custom callback methods to validation rules

2560117
webforms	asp.net
- i didnt mentioned before but its asp.net webforms 3.5

2560145
arrays	loops
within your main loops over the properties you can use an inner loops to go over the arrays entries each properties points to

2560166
delphi	vb6
but the vb6 and excel encoding examples on that page can easily be transfer into delphi code

2560174
credentials	security
in a webpage where each user has a separate security context you may have no choice but to establish a new sql connection with new security credentials with each page hit

2560174
authentication	login
in early versioning of sql-server ie v6.5 or less the login authentication was done by sql-server

2560178
nonetype	iterable
i cannot run since it generator exception-handling nonetype object is not iterable if mymodel has no entry

2560179
order	join
the order is significant because in that order the conditional in join are evaluated but the index will double the size of the database and slow down insert and updates

2560195
protected	public
if inspectable alone doesn t do it try making the variables public or protected

2560199
postgresql	mysql
you could also use the cast keyword mysql or a cast postgresql

2560202
javascript	dom
generator content is not part of the dom and therefor not accessible per javascript

2560207
attributes	properties
i though this was all about implements some interface on the collections or adding some special attributes to the properties but nothing i do seems to work

2560208
value	field
one could extends this logic to handle a smallish numbers of multiple field quite easily - if one or more data value sometimes missing you would have to do a outer-join between a and b inorder to get all recording

2560221
python	php
the server could be configure to parsing .csp as php python or be ignore completely

2560227
gdal	ogr	geos	ogr	geos	gdal
i ve traslated geos and gdal ogr libs

2560304
value	field
the table forms a hierarchy .so i can look for a value in the â œgroupidâ field .when i have found it i can look at its parentid

2560316

2560427
sql-server	mysql
my mysql syntax knowledge isn t spot on i m more sql-server but hopefully if i m slightly wrong you ll see what i m trying to do

2560445
decrement	increment
if you use the .net classes for that purpose there is no need to manually lock the increment decrement and query of a performance counter - the framework will do that for you

2560445
updating	updates
generally i don t think that the updating of a performance counter is really a bottleneck but rather the gathering of the data that is used to updates the counter

2560455

2560656
buffering	streaming
.so if you want to make sure you are always receiving full packets you are likely better off creating your own inputstreaming wrapper where you can add a specialty methods byte readpacket that will block until it can fill its own buffering as data is read from the underlying .socket streaming

2560678
32-bit	x86
you can change that behavior at compile-time by changing the building options platform target to x86 to force the .app to always run as a 32-bit .application

alternatively cmd button may be used but only if there is some clear indication that the player is selected or not

2560751
checkbox	button
instead of a checkbox thereâ s an add cmd button beside each player

my idea is that you could required a file that prepares a connection and then declare a global variables and use that variables to execute all of your queries

2560959
interpreter	runtime
you may add an interpreter for a language to let you easily scripting your application or ease integration and testing at runtime

2560961
value	field
alternative ways of smuggling that value in might include html5-data another spare attributes like title an immediately-following to read the value from explicit additional javascript information or extra hidden field just to hold the default value

2560961
value	field
it can t be created by scripting at document-ready time because some browsers will have already overrides the field s value with a remembered value from a reload or back button press by that time that code execute

python	c++
it all got started i believe because the very earliest googlers sergey larry craig ... made a good engineering decision python where we can c++ where we must -- they used a subset of c++ for the parts of the software stack where very low latency and or tight control of memory were crucial and python allowing more rapid delivery and maintenance of programs for other parts

2561008
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
at the time late 90s the choice for the latter role was essentially between python and perl other scripting languages were either unripe i don t think ruby was around yet for example or had other issues and limitations

2561008
perl	c++	python	c++	python	perl
perl was more mature especially in terms of its ecosystem of available add-on via cpan but python was deemed to be more readable and maintainable and integration to c++ libs via swig was easier

carbon	cocoa
a mix of carbon and cocoa sounds problematic to me but i can t points out specific gotchas

2561788

2563525
any	set
without a diagram it s difficult to explain why but a simplified explanation about why they re not identical cases could be made like this...in the case of the projector glasses you restart with a perfect image that isn t being focused correctly by a set of lenses and then adjusting the lenses adding glasses or changing focus on the projector to correctly bring it into focus...and this is the critical part you are not degrading the image in any way

2564748
interpreter	runtime	disassembly	native-code
however the java debugger api should be able to support manipulating the code at runtime though given the nature of hotspot and jit in general i don t know if it would be possible to rewrite an instruction just before it is invoked --- the currently execution bytecode opcode is really an abstraction for how the interpreter chooses to implements the op unlike native-code where the disassembly opcode is in fact the instruction sent to the cpu

2564932
xsd	xml
we were thinking of using asp.net-mvc using xml to store the data temporary xsd to validation the data xslt to transform the data to presentable markup for them to fill out and then once they submit an application it gets stored into the db in relevant areas

2564932
.when	ready
.when they re finally ready to submit it then we do a full validation and upload the files and store them securely it has their business proof and account statements and then run some workflows

wxwidgets probably uses carbon which is only available in 32-bit mode cocoa is available in both 32-bit and 64bit mode.

2565220
32-bit	64bit
this in turn means that using it in python required you to launchd python in 32-bit mode python is a universal binary with both 32-bit and 64bit versioning of itself available in the same binary file .so it can be launchdd in either mode

2565448
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
completion key is not a pointers - it is a numbers of types ulong_ptr which just means an int the size of a pointers .so it is 32-bit on x86 and 64bit on x64

2565465
execution	exit
now you have all the pieces needed to create disaster if you can pass just the right data to this subroutine to make it overwrite stack and overwrite it enough to overwrite the function return address that is also on stack not far from the data buffering then you have the potential to alter where program execution will return to .when the function exit

2565477
macports	homebrew
if .so you might be getting .some funkiness as a result-of using this other quasi-different environment--i ran in to all kinds of issues like this after upgrading to 10.6 with macports and as a result switched to using rvm for my ruby upgrading management and have been using homebrew for a macports replacement

2565494

silverlight	wpf
i m trying to find a good tutorial on creating custom itemscontrol in silverlight though i imgaine a wpf versioning might work as well

2567184
google-chrome	firefox
nevertheless you might try using speed tracer in google-chrome or firebug in firefox though it doesn t have quite as detailed timing information to see what s taking the time

2567190
scala	java
scala 2.8 uses java thread pool

2567193

2567221
benchmarking	profiling
and by now i have evolved it independently of the actual application-level parts but based on profiling and benchmarking thereof to completely different implementation currently based on numpy

2567221
benchmarking	profiling
once you have the code working then comes the right time for profiling benchmarking and -- just perhaps -- internal optimization of the implementation

just for example if you re designing a program that will get data from one database or some source anyway massage it as needed and then put the result into another chances are that you re going to start by thinking about database schema data flow and data encoding formatting probably in about that order

2567327
versioning	upgrade
then you could just change the ssis package their job call .when they upgrade to the new versioning

2567332

but if you re willing to accept that delegation types with ref and out parameters or return value won t be covered you should be able to use a dynamicmethod

2567332
reflection.emit	dynamicmethod
get the dynamicmethod s methodbuilder and use reflection.emit to add the opcodes for increment the field

2567332
ref	out
well there s an example on that page showing that you just grab the methodsinfo for the invoke methods of the delegation i guess the named invoke is guaranteed somewhere in the standards and then getparameters and then pull out all the parametertype value checked that there are no ref out parameters along the way

2567340
stderr	stdout
if your scripting is invoked with 2 1 at the end backticks invocation will return stdout stderr

i know that private instance-variables are accessed through their public getter and setter methods

2568463
initializer	setter
but .when i generator constructor with the help of ide it initializer instance-variables directly instead of initializing them through their setter methods

2568463
initializer	setter
.so should i change the ide generator code for constructor to initializer those instance-variables through their setter methods

2568592
directory	folder
the problem is not that the filesystems is not able to store .so many files in a directory but that if you want to access that directory using windows-explorer it will take forever .so if you will ever need to access manually to that folder you should segment it for example with a directory per each 2-3 first letters numbers of the named or even a deeper structure

2568643
asp.net-mvc	webforms
now i cringe every time i go back to webforms and wish i could write it in asp.net-mvc because i just love how your working with html instead of using drag and drop controls that usually make your life alot harder if you got to customize them to much

2568643
webforms	asp.net
i am not saying you can t write good code in webforms but in the books and classes that i seen teach asp.net this never seems to be a main focus

google-chrome	firefox
also please note that this occurs in firefox but not google-chrome

2568655
javascript	dom
i al.so tried commenting out all the jquery.cycle.lite stuff .so that i knew i didn t have any javascript manipulating the dom elements in #photo but that wasn t the problem

2568655
javascript	dom
i guess the obvious solution here is to mark the slider up as links rather than imgs and have javascript insert those 12 extra sliderhow images after the dom is ready--users without javascript shouldn t need to downloading the extra images anyways

2568655
google-chrome	firefox
seeing as how it happens in firefox but not google-chrome is it simply a browser issue

2568690

2568716
getter	setter
i rather use setter and getter

2568735
asp.net-mvc	webforms
on top of that youre asp.net-mvc sites should use less bandwidth than a typical webforms website imho mainly because there is a lot of additional stuff put into a webforms page for example extra attributes in the html htat are tailored for webforms viewstate .so that should be seen as a positive by them

2568735
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i wasn t a huge fan of webforms either but asp.net-mvc just felt like a step back to asp development back before .net came out

firefox	opera
both code work in firefox ie opera

2568791

margins	padding
between ie and firefox the effects of margins and padding on elements are a lot different

2568796
contains	set
first of all you need to add a reference to the activex data object libs which contains the set of object that allow you to do database access - in the excel visual basic editor go to tools|references.

2568805
environment	building
you ll need a working building environment and the ruby development libs too

2568818
version-control	git
a few other version-control systemd git possibly starteam have the notion of a personal branch

2568819
subclassing	base-class
the downside is that nearly all queries will required join operations between the base-class table and one or more subclassing tables

2568826
value	field
i can see by the echo that the sql syntax and value are correct but the changes to the expires field are not done only in ie8

2568826
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it works fine in other firefox safari google-chrome ie6 and 7

2568861
height	frame
.when i run this in 2 avds with hvga and wvga80 i get the frame floating at different height

2568867
put	get
if you determine that it isn t feasible or decide to go in a different directions you ve put in less effort to get the decision

2568868
getter	setter
xaml does not understand normals properties getter and setter .when it comes to attached-properties

2568881
quirks-mode	doctype
if your .app was running in quirks-mode consider adding a doctype .so that you can rendering in standards mode makes css javascript much more compliant .

2568881
google-chrome	firefox
i d recommend developing in firefox or google-chrome first then tweak if needed for ie

2568890
height	frame
hvga and wvga80 i get the frame floating at different height

2568903
contains	elements
i am cloning div elements that contains image span textarea elementss and their value

2568954
ready	live
i think it s almost ready to go live but i want to quadruple checked if there s anything else i should do to protect it

2568982
aggregate	grouping
by creating these dedicated repositories and types i can implements high performing search queries that can contains grouping data such as a plannedtraining count without loading all of the associations of the aggregate in memory

2568983
constructor	object
a class constructor is used to initializer an object and the object is not in a consistent state until the constructor returns

2568983
constructor	object
if your constructor call a non-final methods which is later overrides by a subclassing you can get strange unexpected results because the object is not fully initializer .when the overrides methods is called

2568996
data-structures	map
but if for some odd reason i wanted better performance than the std map what data-structures and functions would i need to consider using

2568998
floating	padding
without examining the code thoroughly i d image it to be among one the various bugs ie6 has relating to floats and margins- you could try using padding instead or floating the list differently

2569002
http	ssl
i m very new to http ssl .so excuse my lack of knowledge

2569011
32-bit	64bit
for example you can use --target i386 on an x86_64 systemd to building a 32-bit rpm but you can t building a 64bit rpm on a 32-bit platform

2569014
contains	elements
the expected behavior is to map a list that contains only some s into a some contains a list of the elements inside the elements some s

2569015
digits	zero
i plan to keep two digits after the zero ie 10.50 and majority of the time if these digits are zero i will be hiding these numbers and display it as 10

2569044
subtraction	addition
even simple operations addition subtraction are not immune to float rounding issues

2569045
put	get
if you put everything into a purely event based systemd there s no guarantee that the ais won t get more cpu time than your user or the other way round unless you have some control over thread priorities and even then you re apt to have difficulty keeping timing consistent

2569051
data-structures	map
the smarter data-structures like std map come into play .when you re dealing with larger amounts of data and a well distribute set of data that you are searching for

2569063
debian	linux
can some one tell me how the google-chrome s linux beta versioning carry out automatic versioning updation using debian package manager

2569063
debian	linux
i am currently checked out the postinst scripting present in the debian control package and i can see google-chrome uses pgp publish-subscribe model for getting automated versioning updates in linux

2569072
decrement	increment
if the tree is like 10 3 nodess and you change it 10 3 time per second then you could just keep an external count which you decrement .when you remove a nodes and increment .when you add one

2569079
contains	set
one of them contains a set of data that only needs to keep things that show up in the other hash

2569091
32-bit	64bit
the libcurl.net libs is a 32-bit libs .so it can t be used by a 64bit application

2569091
32-bit	64bit
this will cause it to run as a 32-bit .app under wow64 on 64bit operating systemd

2569097
value	field
the alternative is to use enumtype.string to specify that the enum will be persistent using the named of the enum value that the field is set to

2569098
hide	show
true to show systemd files false to hide them

2569104
base-class	inherited
i have 2 web user-controls both inherited the same base-class which extends user-controls

2569105
versioning	upgrade
first upgrade to the newest versioning of the snmp libs if there is one

2569118
32-bit	16-bit
if your assembly is running in protected-mode for instances your stack will be 32-bit or 16 if your operands are 16-bit even if your processor is x86-64

2569119
submitchanges	datacontext
if i try to submitchanges on the datacontext i get an exception-handling because it attempts to insert a null into the friend and food columns in the friendsfoods table

2569119
put	get
i m sure i can put together some kind of convoluted logic to tracking changes to the friendsfoods table intercept submitchanges call etc to try and get this to work the way i want but is there a nice clean way to remove a many-to-many relationship with linq-to-sql

2569138
implements	extends
both .post and .postonepointone will implements the i.post interface they are not extends an abstract-class because that inherited break the wsdl though i suppose there may be a way around that via some fancy xmlserializer tricks

2569147
versioning	upgrade
most of the rest of that scripting takes care of the multiple versioning of repoitories they maintain allowing the user to disable it without getting pissed off at you and gracefully handling an os upgrade that disables third-party repo

2569153
value	field
however the reason that you can t see this in the designer is that the designer auto-detects the value of this properties based on a the cascade setting of the parent-to-child associations and b whether or not the foreign key field is nullable

2569171
mobile-safari	safari
i would suggest you investigate html5 persistent storage which is supported on safari and mobile-safari as a sqlite db

2569172
databound	gridview
you d be surprised how quickly you could whip out an .app with a databound gridview control that would give you decent excel-like ability to add edit delete table data

2569177
order	join
however as an exercise you could do it all in one query if you selected the forums join with grouping and order by grouping id

2569181
versioning	upgrade
you ll forget you did upgrade the versioning and bam changes are gone

2569184
itemscontrol	tabcontrol
this styles s automatically applied to whatever containers elements the control generator for its items - .so if the itemscontrol you re using is a listbox it will apply it to the listboxitem and if it s a tabcontrol it ll get applied to the tabitem and .so on

2569185
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
currently i m only testing firefox 3.6 opera 10.10 and safari 4.0.3

2569185
firefox	safari
i ve started with a fairly simple test and can confirm no memory-leaks in firefox and safari

2569185
javascript	dom
as you can see this is simple javascript no circular dom links no closures

2569185
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari reload the page does not use any further memory and all memory is returned .when the windows tab is closed

2569185
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari and very possibly other browsers if there s no windows.onunload handler then memory is only reclaimed .when the windows is closed

2569193
put	get
the catch is that to measure the impact you need to look at it differently - instead of how much time does a single query to fetch an image takes ask yourself how much time does a series of put a reasonable numbers here queries to get the same set of images takes

2569197
duplicates	elements
if you add or delete elements of a hash while you re iterator over it you may get entries skipped or duplicates .so don t

2569199
basic	vba
i would recommend investigating using vba visual basic for applications or based on your coding experience tools available to you vsto visual-studio tools for office

2569250
codeigniter	drupal
codeigniter doesn t have built-in multi-page form support the way content-management systemd like drupal do

2569259
decrement	increment
also since your p pointers are of types you can perform simple increment decrement on it - the compiler will deal with the sizeof t issue as a normals course of pointer-arithmetic

2569273
constructor	object	easymock	mockito	powermockito	easymock
you can use a mock libs like mockito or easymock +classpath to create a mock file object newer libs have classloader extensions that let you mock concrete classes like file or can cooperate with something like powermockito see blog and have a mock generator for the constructor call and throw the appropriate exception-handling .when called

2569291
value	field
.when a content-length is given in a messages where a messages-body is allowed its field value must exactly match the numbers of octets in the messages-body

2569372
tuples	set
given a training set d of mean std class tuples and a new p mean std-pair find that q in d for which distance d p is minimal and return that class

2569384
selected	textbox
upon selected a numbers - say 1 - csvline 0 would be display inside a textbox textbox1 let s say

2569384
put	get
if i then put it as an arrays ie i then get a different error messages

2569388
fflush	gets
the content-length header-only gets set if the entire response is buffering if you never fflush or if you set it yourself

2569406
traffic	packets
note that there are some limitations with http traffic but since you are testing your own wcf service you can temporary switching to http for inspector of the packets payload even if you intend to deploy it as http in production

2569417
value	field
as a result .when you merge the entity back in with a null value openjpa isn t certain that the field was ever loaded and thinks it hasn t been changed

2569417
value	field
openjpa will then know which field were present and will handle a null value properly

2569424
32-bit	64bit
however on a 64bit system.in an older versioning of the assembly that i am referencing they only created a 32-bit versioning

2569424
32-bit	64bit
i was looking at doing it dynamically and ideally i would want my msil .app in 64bit mode to load the 32-bit dll

2569427
python	php
also what would be the difference from calling a php scripting to retrieve the data from the database and hand it over to python and import one of these third-parties plugins that required some additional software in the server

2569427
python	php
edit the server has php and python install by default

2569450
scrollable	grid
i m building an ipad .app and would like to use a tile display with object arranged in a scrollable grid similar to the iphone ipad home screens and the ipad photos .app

2569450
scrollable	grid
updates i think i understand how to do a basic arrangement of the object in a grid but i don t know how to make this work with thousands of object and a scrollable view without using tons of memory and making everything really slow then again i still don t have a device to test on

2569457
early-binding	late-binding
i can t remember if vb5 actually supports early-binding iunknown -based object or if supports only late-binding idispatch

2569465
entity-framework	data-access
the object are mapped into entity-framework and exposed through a data-access class

2569491
.net	wcf
this is explained on wenlong dong s blog - performance improvement for wcf client proxy creation in .net 3.5 and best practices a much better source of wcf information and guidance than msdn

2569503
hash	md5
right now i m using md5 which doesn t generator case-sensitive hash

2569505
selectedindexchanged	selecteditem
that way .when you handle the selectedindexchanged event or similar you get the selecteditem from the combo box which can be nothing .so checked and cast it as the systemspecs to use it

2569529
32-bit	64bit
you cannot load 32-bit dlls into 64bit process

2569531
dictionary	map	dictionary	arrays	arrays	map	key-value	key	mapping	unique
key-value an associativity arrays also associativity containers map mapping dictionary finite map and in query-processing an index or index file is an abstract data types composed of a collections of unique key and a collections of value where each key is associated with one value or set of value

2569539
reliability	scalability
you really don t want to base a synchronous systemd around messaging if your at all concerned about performance reliability scalability

2569546
midp	cldc
in my experience ibm s j9 is the best - i ve used it to support midp cdc apps but the .profile configuration combinations supported include midp and personal .profile and both cldc and cdc foundation

2569556
plugins	add-on
i am using s3 firefox organiser plugins add-on to add the buckets by the way

2569558
sorteddictionary	sorted
the easiest way to get a sorted dictionary is to use the built-in sorteddictionary class

2569558
contains	sorted
sortedsections will contains the sorted versioning of sections

2569596
copy-constructor	deep-copy
you can do this by eliminating the need for the destructor by not using a pointers or by adding the needed code to the copy-constructor and-operator to make a deep-copy of the list

2569604
put	get
try get netbeans_midp_components_basic.jar off your friend s pc under and put it in your own install in the same path

2569624
required	checked
you can use the following regex to checked that it is a numbers d+ and required

2569630
attributes	properties
to pass in parameters from powershell you need to add properties to your class and mark them with the parameter attributes

2569647
haskell	scheme
for what it s worth the arbitrary-precision int in ghc haskell and gnu guile scheme are both implements using gmp and the fastest implementation of the pidigits benchmarking on the language shootout is based on gmp

2569650
lwjgl	jogl
i imagine that other languages like clojure jython could also handle this request -- either through lwjgl or jogl

2569655
constructor	object
edit the idea here is that every object will have a different width and height .so the arrays i use to represent that object will be unique to the object but once that arrays is defined preferably in the constructor it will not change

2569671
display	height	display	width
in that case an arrays with dimension matching the height and width of your display might suffice with each elements in the arrays being a presumably short list of the rectangles on that pixels

2569676
base-class	inherited	pure-virtual	base-class
both of these inherited from treematrix which is pure-virtual nothing is actually initializer as treematrix it s just a base-class

2569678
windows-server	windows-xp
in windows-xp and windows-server 2003 .when a passwd is used it is encrypted using

2569678
hash	md5
another idea i ve had is that it is not the direct result-of cryptencrypt but a result-of the rasessionid in the md5 hash

2569681
constructor	object
edit you can still use this di types behavior on the constructor but the problem is that this constructor will not get called .when the object is rehydrated from a serialization form .when it has been passed to from a web service

2569695
fflush	gets
a standards mutex won t work since i run the risk of having the main thread grab the mutex before the data gets fflush to the database

2569697
exif	xmp
that s backup exif makernotes iptc xmp etc whether at the beginning or end of the file

2569709
compare-and-swap	atomicity
every time you change the database you must compare-and-swap the atomicity state value you used indicating a change

2569716
key-value	key
what you want is to either call the dictionary iteritems methods to get a sequences of key-value tuples or to call the itervalue methods to get a sequences of the value since you are not using the key

2569723
any	set
but to retain your sanity i think you should try and aim to have one place where you set all the configurationuration pertaining to your application and then a well-defined mechanism for translating that into entries inside web-configuration and any other configuration mechanism you have to support

2569728
directory	folder
i points coverstory to the objects-normal directory in my building folder and it complains that there s nothing there for it to read

2569739
attributes	properties
this isn t entirely feasible as you ll soon find out you ll need to make your properties virtual inorder to support lazy-loading and if you want to use nhibernate-validator you ll be decorating your properties with validation attributes but for the most part nhibernate does a good job of staying out of your way

2569767
synchronous	.when
i am getting 403 errors from apache .when i send too many 12 synchronous http post via a desktop .app i am building in xcode objective-c

2569776
factors	primes
i know the first part 1 is to calculate the primes factors of p-1 - which is fine

2569784
value	field
turns out to be trickier than expected because you can t directly access field value on the instances from within the admin class - you need to do it by redefining the form used by the admin class

2569784
value	field
the goal is to detection the current instances value of the use_visual_editor field and turn javascript paths on or off depending on its value .so author can turn off the visual-editor on a per-record basis

2569792
put	get
the simplest way to do that imho is to get rid of the standards title bar in the elements in the manifest and put your own title bar at the top of the activity

2569794
put	get
.when you get the file read put it into a normals class and just bind to the class or use the list of items you have to do custom stuff with the combobox

2569808
value	field
i m trying to search multiple field zc_city zc_zip and zc_state matching against a single value input by the user

2569819
base-class	inherited
.when you inherited privately you cannot convert to or otherwise access that base-class outside of the class

2569819
derived-class	base-class
if a base-class is accessible one can implicit convert a pointers to a derived-class to a pointers to that base-class 4.10 4.11

2569824
contains	any
my idea is to store bounds of the rectangle contains all pointss already retrieved in other words nearest points on the left west of most west already retrieved nearest points above north of most north already retrieved etc. and i will make next query .when any edges of screens goes outside of this bounds

2569825
attributes	properties
the question is how do i get access to the value of the properties and labels attributes of the nested column tags from the table tag

2569865
passenger	thin
tune a production deployment passenger thin apache etc

2569888
textures	fbo
i m creating an fbo binding a textures and then the very first gldrawarrays crash with a exc_bad_access on my iphone simulator

2569888
textures	fbo
here s the code i use to create the fbo and bind textures and...

2569890
vbscript	jscript	vbscript	perl
you could also choose to use vbscript or jscript rather than perl and you wouldn t need to worry about installing any additional software

2569902
.when	ready
on .doc ready div fade out the problem im having is .when a visitor navigates away from the page or .unload i want the div to fade back in

2569915
google-chrome	firefox
yeah this works in firefox and google-chrome but for some reason wont work in ie 8

2569915
google-chrome	firefox
does anybody know why this works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie8

2569951
arguments	default
under action to take if arguments is not present selected the last option provide default arguments selected userid from url and checked also look for a nodes and use the nodes author

2569951
any	set
now find the recent post by user block again and set it to content bottom region or any other region your themes has available

2569957
32-bit	64bit
i have a 32-bit imac that i am writing an iphone .app in xcode with and i was wondering if i saved my project to a flash drive and dropped it on my macbookpro which is 64bit and continue to code the iphone project on my laptop in xcode would this cause a problem

2569962
terminate	timeout
mysql terminate a connection after 8 hour timeout

2569965
version-control	git
currently i am using git for version-control

2569977
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome - launchd special firefox .profile with elevated security privileges to bypass javascript security errors

2569991
selected	listbox
what this little class does is help your control to focus on the listbox selected item .when you activate a control inside it ie

2569991
click	mouse
it works .when the mouse is click inside the listbox item

2569996
arrays	loops
my application loops through the x and y coordinates of my rectangular arrays does calculations based on each value and reassigns move the arrays around

2570001
stderr	stdout
i have a native dll which output via stdout stderr

2570001
stderr	stdout
i have a c# console application which call this dll and output binary-data to a parent c# application which started the c# console exe process stdout stderr

2570007
terminal	prompt
then go to stories 1 or whatever id you re using to test the page will not finish loading go to the terminal you re using for your server and you will see an irb prompt

2570012
contains	set	output	cat
if all else fails set the building cmd to cat from cygwin and the building arguments to the named of a file that contains the output log from however the software was built

2570026
plugins	add-on
what you are looking for are extension or add-on sadly and confusingly also sometimes called plugins and those are mostly browser - specific - search first before writing your own

2570033
bazaar	git	version-control	git	version-control	bazaar
first thing get to know a version-control systemd subversion git bazaar mercurial are some examples

2570033
versioning	staging
then using a shell account on the production server i checkout the new versioning of the software to the staging subdomain

2570035
version-control	git
if you re not doing .so already start using a version-control systemd such as svn or git

2570037
32-bit	64bit
most likely size_t is 64bit wide while unsigned int is 32-bit wide

2570042
carbon	cocoa
because each windows has its own which is why you can have carbon and cocoa windowss in an application of mostly the other types

2570042
carbon	cocoa
i d really suggest you read the carbon cocoa integration guide

2570043
if-statement	loops
what should i put in my loops as an if-statement to checked for digits and make it upper and lower case

2570051
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome works fine but in ie7 sometimes returns the value into the labels sometimes not

2570070
conditional	operators
the || operators is meant to evaluate to true if one of the parts is true .so your conditional will evaluate to true whether is exact cube or exact square

2570074
double	int
loops through the int in the range of those two int s like you re doing with your floats. for each one find the cube root and square root and store them in double

2570082
buffering	streaming
in c# i need to write t to a streaming ideally without any additional buffering

2570102
selected	button
under test package folder click the add folder button and selected the tests folder

2570110
show	next
the urls for next and previous would show the page numbers rather than the date but you could probably modify the behavior of the params sent to the action to use the date instead of the page numbers

2570112
fputs	gets
and .when i run it in xcode i get an exc_bad_access .when it gets to the first fputs

2570118
setinterval	settimeout
and setinterval is like settimeout except it repeat a code repeatedly

2570122
any	set
i am wondering whether there exists any declarative language for arbitrarily describing the format and semantics of a data structure that can be compiled to a specific implementation of that structure in any of a set of target languages

2570122
data-structures	tree
that is something like a generics data definition language but geared toward describing arbitrary data-structures such as vectors lists tree etc. and the semantics of operations on those structures

2570129
administration	credentials
users do not need administration credentials to install the application

2570134
linked-list	arrays	data-structures	linked-list
these data-structures are inherently tied to implementation as the only difference between a linked-list and arrays is specifically how it is laid out in memory

2570141
google-chrome	firefox
i have some code here which works perfectly in firefox but not in google-chrome or ie

2570146
vertex-buffer	vbo
just use the functions to do the copy and let the drivers figure out how to do what you want chances are as long as you copy directly into the vertex-buffer it won t actually do a copy but will just make your vbo a reference to the data

2570154
google-chrome	firefox
i think google-chrome and firefox interpreter it differently .when you assign both a left and right properties

2570170
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox google-chrome ie 8

2570176
required	checked
i m trying to send simple email via ruby no ruby-on-rails on os x with xcode which install ruby. but i m running into a problem with my smtp server which required the email-client to checked mail before sending as a form of authentication

2570176
required	checked
i only want to send html formatted email eventually via applescript calling ruby because applescript doesn t support smtp but the server required that i checked mail before i send

2570182
show	next
if i run next saturday into strtotime function it show 4 3 2010 as the date

2570188
administration	account
my account is of types administration for the joomla backend

2570199
put	get
i would use a single file to get and put the serialization string

2570200
pbo	vbo
if this is a one-time operation though i d go with copying it over to a pbo and then binding into gl_array_buffer and then just using it as a vbo

2570223
malloc	free
in c++ using delete to free memory obtained with malloc doesn t necessarily cause a program to blow up

2570223
malloc	free
should a warning or perhaps even an assert failure should be produced if delete is used to free memory obtained using malloc

2570224
malloc	free
in c++ using delete to free memory obtained with malloc doesn t necessarily cause a program to blow up

2570224
malloc	free
do you guys think a warning or perhaps even an assert failure should be produced if delete is used to free memory obtained using malloc

2570230
directory	folder
i use the nshomedirectory function to get the .app s home folder and write to the document directory within that

2570236
windows-server	windows
a component called extended linguistic service els has the ability to detection scripting and natural languages and it s in the box on any windows 7 or windows-server 2008 machine

2570239
constructor	object
that said new also call the object s constructor while malloc does not

2570251
arrays	map	key-value	key
create a map then you can add key-value pairs .when the key is your named and the value is your arrays

arrays	map
if you want to named an arrays instances after you ve created it you could always store the instances as the value in a map using the named as the key

2570265
double	int
the first class is called measuredparams and it s got 40+ numeric field height weight waistsize wristsize - some int but mostly double

2570265
value	field
what i need to do is load a new arrays toclassify with the value stored in the field from measuredparams that match the field list including order found in reqdfield

2570270
innodb	myisam
insert into a blob is 2x to 8x faster on myisam than on innodb

2570270
binary	hex
using a hex coded string bin2hex into a x ... uses more memory on average than using an escaped binary string mysql_real_escape_string on the raw-data

2570270
innodb	myisam
- this seems true for both myisam and innodb

2570270
innodb	myisam
the binary string is faster on myisam but the hex-coded data is faster on innodb

2570275
reflection	runtime
for this i want reflection rtti mechanism to know class attributes at runtime

2570281
data-members	instances
commonly you make data-members static .so you don t need to create an instances to be able to access that member

2570287
lightbox	jquery
i m continuously having the problem .when i use jquery lightbox which runs prototype and jquery news slider

2570298
getter	setter
fortunately the .net client libs has been updates with a getter and setter for this parameter although the methods are undocumented in the .net developer s guide

2570304
lightbox	jquery
jquery lightbox doesn t use prototype

2570325
duplicates	elements
now we have an unsorted arrays that also accepts duplicates elements value

2570334
contains	elements
even if it is points to the first elements of an arrays on the heap which contains 100 elementss

2570358
similarity	distance
robust similarity comparisons levenshtein distance are typically expensive

2570374
arrays	map
the value methods returns an arrays that is handy for constructing the map

2570375
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can watch them for the mouseenter event and if no mouseleave event fires within x milliseconds show your tooltip

2570375
mouseleave	mouseenter
it also provides hover which is just a convenience means of hooking up mouseenter and mouseleave handler. although this means you re hooking up a lot of event handler since mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble mdash

2570375
mouseover	mouseout
you may well be better off tracking mouseover mouseout at the document level and handling the complexities that arise since they do bubble

2570375
contains	elements
to show your tooltip you can get the location of the elements in question via offset and show an absolutely-positioned div nearby contains the title which you can get via attr

2570375
mouseleave	mouseout
.when the user move the mouseout of the tooltip mouseleave remove it

2570394
easymock	jmock
if it is just for a sake of unit-test developers should apply dependency inject pattern in their coding and take advantages from mocking tools such as easymock or jmock to circumvent dependencies

2570396
attributes	properties
assuming that you want to overrides the default error messages strings in the validation attributes you can do that by setting the errormessagesresourcename and the errormessagesresourcetype properties like this

2570412
json	xml
jsonml provides a well thought out standards mapping from xml - json

2570425
return-value	arguments
it occurred to me that this code does not checked the return-value of close .so i read the manpage for close 2 and it seems it can fail with eintr in which case the appropriate behavior would seem to be to call close again with the same arguments

2570453
linked-list	nodes
a linked-list in c is commonly represented by a pointers to a nodes which objc_method_list could be

2570457
binary-search	shellsort
if the latter you may find that a plain insert-sort using a binary-search for the insert step might be better than a shellsort

2570489
webserver	nginx
if not are there some standards headers to pass in that will accomplish that in common webserver i m thinking nginx or apache

2570528
stored-procedures	ado.net
thus far used ado.net stored-procedures with asp.net and now like to move with an orm

2570542
subtract	add
add subtract a random numbers to the latitude-longitude value stored with each user and add a translucent circle around the icons

2570549
rubygems	bundler
ruby-on-rails hosting on shared hosts is already a minefield but throw in ruby-on-rails 3 in all its pre-release goodness including bundler reinventing the rubygems workflow is a recipe for pulling your hair out

2570552
malloc	free
why new delete is slower than malloc free

2570554
malloc	free
new and delete are dealing with construction destructor for which part of their work is the effectively calling malloc and free - malloc and free are raw memory allocation deallocation

2570566
malloc	free
if you use them to allocate plain old data such that the constructor destructor are trivial they are unlikely to differ at all significantly in speed from malloc free

2570566
malloc	free
really all they do aside from calling on to malloc free is execute types s constructor destructor multiple time for arrays

2570593
malloc	free
if the constructor and destructor are empty like for built-in new and delete shouldn t be slower than malloc and free are

2570593
malloc	free
if they are it s often due to the fact that common implementation call malloc free under the hood .so they are a wrapper around them

2570593
constructor	object
first it call the operators new then it initializer the object usually by invoking the appropriate constructor

2570599
mpfr	gmp
mpfr is based on gmp

2570612
any	set
while operating on the list the locked field will be set to true not allowing any other alterations

2570614
malloc	free
the compiler could certainly associate a bit of data with each pointers saying allocated with new or allocated with malloc or unknown and .when it found a free or a delete if the allocation didn t match it could issue a warning

2570621
sftp	ftp
i need to upload multiple-files from directory to the server via ftp and sftp

2570621
python	php
solution can be on python or php

2570640
subtract	add	order	add
.so it wouldn t be too hard for me to brute-force the damn thing by simply checked the precedence within the arrays if the symbols is smaller than the next symbols in the exampe xiv if i is smaller than v in which case it would be because i have order them in the arrays then i could make it subtract the value instead of add

2570649
subtract	add
moving to the left add the value as long as they increase or remain the same and subtract .when they decrease

2570663
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate is currently one of the most popular orm s but microsoft has been busy working on entity-framework

2570681
jquery	.post
pleeease don t .post jquery examples

2570683
constructor	object
the first statement inside the constructor will be to register the component with the context object using the appropriate key

2570683
constructor	object
.when the constructor needs to initializer a field with another component it will obtain this component from the context object by specifying the need component s key

2570696
children	tree	children	nodes
.when erasing a nodes from the tree that has 2 non-leaf non-null children it says to move either side s children into the deletable nodes and remove that child

2570702
malloc	free
in c++ using delete to free memory obtained with malloc doesn t necessarily cause a program to blow up

2570702
malloc	free
although some compiler allocate memory for new using malloc free doesn t call destructor

2570702
malloc	free
do you guys think a warning or perhaps even an assert failure should be produced if delete is used to free memory obtained using malloc

2570707
python	java
ps i am a java guy dont know the syntax of python

2570710
sigkill	sigsegv
except of course the ones that will kill you .so sigkill and frequently sigpipe if you handle it by quitting along with sigsegv and similar fatal errors which will in any case never be delivered to a correct user-space .app

2570716
entity-framework	nhibernate
once you ve learned internalized and understood the principles you can always move on to a more enterprise-ready solution like nhibernate or entity-framework v4

2570718
google-chrome	firefox
now it still works fine in firefox but in recent versioning of google-chrome i believe since 4 it throw this error

2570718
google-chrome	firefox
the above works in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 3 but in google-chrome 5 it throw the above error.

2570718
google-chrome	firefox
then it works in firefox all versioninging and google-chrome 3 but not google-chrome 5 i don t have google-chrome 4 .so i m not shure about that specific versioning and don t know if it s even possible to downloading a specific google-chrome versioning

2570731
authentication	login
pop before smtp isn t one of the authentication types supported by .net smtp .so i think you re going to have to use .net pop3 to do your pop3 login

2570735
roman-numerals	decimal	digits	zero
roman-numerals are positioningal in a sense it is merely that each positioning may have multiple characters representing the decimal digits the symbols change with decimal magnitude and that zero as placeholder are not used

2570742
nsinteger	int
the same applies to int and nsinteger

2570744

2570794
sql-server-express	sql-server
both sql-server compact and sql-server-express are free to use

2570794
sql-server-express	sql-server
if you have a multi-user scenario you will have to go for sql-server-express as sql-server compact doesn t allow multiple simultaneous access

2570797
postgresql	mysql
there are various experimental linq-to-sql and linq to entity-framework providers for other databases like mysql and postgresql - in my experience they are .so immature it is not worth using for anything serious

2570799
selected	cell
1- first selected 9 cell for 1s

2570804
push	pull	.when	ready
.when you re ready to expose your changes to the rest of the world you ask them to pull from you or you push it to some main git-repo

2570849
show	next
.when click the grid item i want to show a progress-bar between the time of next activity show

2570871
javascript	dom
what i mean is sometimes a page is forwarded to a different page via javascript or sometimes dom elements get added to the page via javascript with an onload event

2570887
32-bit	64bit
.so that yes on 64bit unsigned long nsuinteger takes twice as much memory as nsuinteger on 32-bit

2570890
double	int
suppose that you have a binary file that contains numbers whos types is either int or double

2570890
double	int
the string is composed of the letters i for int and d for double in the order of the types of the subsequent numbers

2570890
double	int
for example the string iddiiddd indicated that the file contains eight value as follows one int followed by two double followed by two int followed by three double

2570893
mockito	jmock
the api classes such as httpservletrequest servletconfig etc are primes targets for using a mocking framework of your choice jmock mockito etc since they re all interfaces

2570923
platform	gpl
the only things i can find are socket call like htons but they required different #include files on each platform and some gpl code like this however that particular file while comprehensive seems to miss out on some of the high performance functions provided by some compilers

2570934
floor	ceil
i do not want to use ceil and floor

2570938
any	set
i m not aware of any better generalized solution than the htons function set

2570960
abstract-class	subclassing	subclassing	inherited
abstract-class are useful .when you need a class for the purpose of inherited and polymorphism but it makes no sense to initializer the class itself only its subclassing

2570960
subclassing	superclass
they are commonly used .when you want to defined a templates for a grouping of subclassing that shared some common implementation code but you also want to guarantee that the object of the superclass cannot be created

2570960
abstract-class	superclass
abstract-class also have the added benefit in polymorphismâ allowing you to use the abstract superclass s types as a methods arguments or a return-types

2570967
testng	junit
jax-ws web-services are annotations pojos .so you can unit test them in i.solation using a regular unit-testing framework junit testng and mocks

directory	folder
all these files are loaded dynamically into index.php it reads all folder inside templates directory and then include every template.php file

2571075
getter	setter
you want to encapsulate object but your member field is not encapsulated well make them private and add setter and getter methods

2571081
triggers	insert
versioning 3 introduces ajax support meaning that any html that gets insert into the document via javascript will also triggers hover active and focus styles in ie

2571114
contains	elements
it s generally cheaper especially .when the arrayss only actually contains single words per elements a pointers to a string or structure to trade off some spaces for time and have a separate temporary arrays that you sort back and forth between

2571119
filesystems	symlink
i think none of the common filesystems store if there are symlinks points to this file in the file nodes .so you would have to scan all other files to see if it is a symlink to this one

2571124
associations	model
for your first question i think you can order the results by specifying the order in the model associations

2571141
entity-framework	nhibernate
first things first unless you re willing to give up using stored-procedures nhibernate will not provide much benefit and the entity-framework will probably frustrate you

2571154

in your case the code says maps should be true if either the named or the description field contains the value of search_terms

2571164
put	get
now after i ve changed the styles on the page i want to get the new background-color using the following code which i put after the call

2571178

if this is to be draw to the screens you ll need to locate your drawing code within the -drawrect methods of a uiview or â drawincontext of a calayer

2571178
calayer	uiview
to updates its contents you d need to call -setneedsdisplay on the uiview or calayer

2571185
selected	button
you won t be able to do this without some very shaky tricks having a relatively positioning div next to the selected overlapping the button which is never reliable because the size of the dropdown button can vary.

2571235
versioning	upgrade
the minuses and pluses it s a bit of work to start with but with this you ll have all the ground work done to handle upgrade automatically later on to do .so just add an upgradecript section to your xml an attributes called versioning for each upgrade scripting and simply compare it against the versioning of the db you have save in the registry

2571238
swing	gwt
with the introduction of the html5 elements could swing theoretically be implements in google web toolkit gwt by using the tag for drawing

2571238

i m aware of effort to ports source code from using swing call to gwt call but what i m after is a pure behind the scenes ports where a swing application would compile under gwt without any source code modifications

2571253
selected	checkbox
how do i postback selected checkbox to the controllers

2571297
textbox	button
the idea here is that once a textbox is in focus and the enter button was pressed something will happen.

2571298
versioning	migrate
for each release we also have a file to migrate the schema of our databases from versioning n-1 to versioning n

2571303

edit added the fact that the list is sorted and realizing duplicates is misleading replace that with redundant in the title

2571317
constructor	object
union cannot contains class object that have constructor or destructor

2571335
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter key do raise the keydown and keyup events

2571338
constructor	object
constructor doesn t return anything although it may be thought of a function that returns an initializer object

2571338
constructor	object
constructor is not really a member function in the sense that it can t be called on an object like s.member

2571368
attributes	properties
i want the attributes on the properties set accessor to catch some types of exception-handling and then deal with this in some custom way or even just swallow it

2571379
setcontentview	oncreate
i had to do that in oncreate before calling setcontentview on the activity

2571401
scheme	lisp
i know that lisp and scheme programmers usually say that eval should be avoided unless strictly necessary

2571410
scrollbar	widget
in tk you wouldn t add a scrollbar to the main windows but you create a widget to be scrolled and add scrollbar to scroll it

2571421
double	int
instead of looking for duplicates for each item which is o n 2 or zipping which is n 2 in memory use map double int

2571426

execute stmt using lower_limit at line 1 prepare stmt from selected from images as i where i.on_id 1 and i.on_type .profile order by i.updated_at limit

2571615
derived-class	base-class
in the derived-class overrides dispose bool disposing cleanup your stuff and then call the base-class dispose bool disposing

2571615
derived-class	base-class
the derived-class can overrides it do it s cleanup and call the base-class cleanup methods

2571629
contains	set
i dont know much about monodevelop but you jsut need to set the svn ignore for the file in question on the folder contains it

2571636
postgresql	mysql
i haven t used mysql much but in postgresql if the numbers of recording is small in the table it can decide not to use the index

2571658
any	set
i have a crontab that runs every 10 mins and checked the db for any rows that has remind_me field set to go off within the next 10 mins

2571675
background-color	display
if by chance you really do want to change the background-color remember that links display inline and don t have a large comfortable rectangle around them .so depending on the containers s background-color it might not be noticeable

2571689
private-members	object
it s been awhile since i implements something like this but i recall having to overrides to reconstruct some private-members from the object upon receiving the serialization data

2571696
contains	any
and those functions can contains any code at all

2571702
jquery	.post
i have a jquery .post function that returns a response on success after the click of a div

2571717

i know the 360 runs the .net compact-framework and i was under the impression that reflector could read cf assemblies but .when i open them all of the methods are blank and no internal classes are show

2571730
populate	row
the way our systemd works is that once a row is populate we immediately triggers a send task that gathers all the pending email and send them

2571734
jquery	.post
i have a jquery .post function that returns a response on success after the click of a div

2571738

what i really need is my own custom button which will ultimately be an image that upon successful file selected not upload quite yet triggers a jquery event to show a div

2571787
decimal-point	zero
i have been successful at rounding my value to one decimal-point but i would like to trim off the multitude of trailing zero

2571789
subtraction	addition
you should also support basic vector operations like addition subtraction and dot-product

2571796
value	field
i think the best you can do is attach a handler to the change event of the file upload that display the div if the file field s value is different from null

2571797
32-bit	64bit
if you are running a 32-bit process on a 64bit os createremotethread will fail to inject your dll into 32-bit .apps 100 of the time and cannot inject into 64bit .apps anyway as that is a job for a 64bit .app

2571807
decimal-point	digits
the second parameter of the decimal data types is the precision - 1 will give you a single digits after the decimal-point

2571810
numeric	digits
by casting a numbers to numeric x 1 you both round it and change it s data types to single digits precision

2571810
numeric	digits
sql-server management studio will display numeric x 1 with one digits behind the dot but it is free to display it in another way

2571840

a virtual-destructor in a base-class is only needed if an instances of the derived-class is going to be deleted via a pointers to the base-class

2571871
standard-library	boost
boost and the tr1 and c++11 standard-library doesn t want to force you to have that overhead just because you need to be able to obtain a shared_ptr from the this-pointer

2571877
hide	show
in this you d have all those pages be user-controls which you progrmattically hide or show

2571898
debugging	trace
debugging executable get a higher default trace level but the trace level can be set by configuration file or dynamically at runtime

2571916
abstract-class	subclassing
basically nsstring is an abstract-class with no methods of storing characters and the various -initwithâ methodss all return different concrete subclassing of nsstring based on the methods of initialization

2571929
local-variables	class-variables
this is similar to the case-when you are using class-variables and not local-variables

2571944
calloc	malloc
if not then what other objective is achieved using malloc and calloc

2571952
instances	destroy
a virtual-destructor is only required if you want to destroy an instances of that class virtually

2571973
textbox	button
now i want that on button click i would call the function at the client side json which pass the textbox value to the function

2571977
swing	gwt	user-interface	look-and-feel	keyboard	mouse
what you need to do is implements custom look-and-feel that defined user-interface delegation generator gwt widget and on the gwt side capture the mouse and keyboard events on the client and feed them to the swing event queue

malloc	free
malloc still has the advantage that the memory can be deallocated with free exactly .when you want it to be -- .so you can usefully return a malloc ed arrays as your function s result and the caller will free it .when done with it

2571980
malloc	free
of course style-guides that constrain malloc and free to happen within the same function would give up on this crucial difference

2571980
realloc	malloc
there are others though such as the ability to realloc a malloc -ed arrays if you need to change its size which also doesn t apply to runtime-sized arrayss

2571981
calloc	malloc
it certainly reduces the need for calloc and malloc by using the compiler for variables allocation

2571981
calloc	malloc
you might still use calloc and malloc where you need to support older compilers or in situations where you want to allocate more dynamic data-structures

2571992
shell	bash
the cmd you issued ran in a separate process than your bash shell and that process terminate .when it was done

2571992
shell	bash

2572005
google-chrome	firefox
the only solution i can see is that suggested by ole above namely to look at the code from google-chrome and firefox and work out how they encode the caching

2572006
hide	next
.when the view is move to the next level i would like to hide the tab bars and .when the view is move back i would like the tab bar visible

2572130
data-structures	tree
it has nothing trie-specific and should work for other tree data-structures as well

2572146
function-call	inline
during compilation function-call is replace by passing arguments to stack and than if function is not inline its call is replace by some symbols for linker

2572154
put	get
.so the needs to be escaped to 26 .when it is put into the string .so that the get will read it properly

2572157
pointers	stack
a simple function-call in c for example would be represented in the compiled form as low-level operators to push things into stack change the instruction pointers etc

2572162
simple-html-dom	domparser
use a domparser or simple-html-dom for html

2572163
display	width
but than realized that since the menu is list the different list items break the line whenever they reach the width of the and move on to the next line thus the browser doesnt see the need for a horizontal scrollbar it doesnt display a vertical one as well because of the overflow-y hidden

2572170
hide	show
google-translate include show hide romanization which is better than unihan for two reasons

2572175
twitter	tweets
i want to calculate the numbers of tweets of a twitter search and a countup

2572205
python	java
and hadoop seem interesting i guess i could run then im java prototype in python and maybe migrate the really slow bits to java.

2572207
wxpython	pyqt
i don t have too much experience with building gui s but i ve done a little bit with wxpython and pyqt

2572209
value	field
i found a that i can use a bigint field to store the value

2572215
append	input
instead you have a linked-list or similarly order data structure with constants time amortized append for each bucket and you append that item to the end of the list for bucket x as you scan the input left to right

2572216
children	nodes
some author consider it to be the minimum numbers of key a non-leaf nodes may hold while others consider it to be the maximum numbers of children nodess a non-leaf nodes may hold which is one more than the maximum numbers of key such a nodes could hold

2572216
children	nodes
the numbers of leaf nodess is itself driven by the numbers of children that fit in a non-leaf nodes the order

2572216
contains	elements
a tree of depth 4 a root nodes two level of non-leaf nodess and one level obviously of leaf nodess and of order 12 non-leaf nodess can hold up to 11 key hence points to 12 nodess below them and such that leaf nodess can contains 5 elements each would

2572233
client-server	multi-user
everything i read about threading seems way more complicated than what i need - and yes i understand that all those precautions are necessary for applications that are running in multiprocess multi-user client-server systemd etc

2572252
set-union	set
since each operation returns a new set object the new object needs to shared the comparator possibly leading to threading issues and there is no good way to decide what comparator the result should use for the result-of set-union of two sets with different comparators

2572253
perl	php
xampp for windows comes with apache mysql php + pear perl mod_php mod_perl mod_ssl openssl phpmyadmin webalizer mercury mail transport systemd for win32 and netware systemdd v3.32 ming jpgraph filezilla ftp-server mcrypt eaccelerator sqlite and web-dav + mod_auth_mysql

2572253
eclipse-pdt	phped
then you just need an editor with a debugger which there are many choices mostly non-free such as nusphere s phped - or free - such as eclipse-pdt or gvim+xdebug+dbgp client

2572263
hash	md5
you send md5 hash and not plain passwd

2572281
qt-designer	pyqt
pyqt is the fastest gui toolkit to develop with imo partly because you can use qt-designer to design your gui instead of coding it by hand

2572293
contains	any
but .when i put the applet and edited jnlp files contains changed paths to server into server it doesn t load any data from an server text file

2572317

i m using open read here but fopen fread would work just as well

2572385
oracle	mysql
migrate from oracle to mysql

2572397
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops	arrays	loops
at the moment the for-loop i have to remove the rows causes an indexing error as the size of the arrays changes in loops

2572398
combinations	permutation
quite the opposite its goal is to reduce it to box the numbers of design-decisions to reduce the permutation and combinations in building software ergo minimizing the cracks from where errors creep out.

i use graphing to make this a bit more visual but .when i start the game my background turns from black to grey and the other problem is that if i click the game start button the game runs many time until i release the mouse button

2572445
constructor	object
by conventions the only two cases .when a methods returns a retained object are constructor alloc new etc

2572448
virtual-memory	paging
most likely it will be paging off virtual-memory

2572459
hashmap	trie
i think the answer to q2 can be to use a hashmap or a trie to store the words and its frequency

2572459
doubly-linked-list	hashmap
maintain a hashmap and a doubly-linked-list

2572459
doubly-linked-list	trie
i think the most efficient solution is by using trie with a doubly-linked-list

2572464
factors	primes
i m using pollard-rho to find the small primes factors of p-1

2572464
private-key	dsa
then using pohlig-hellman to solve a dsa private-key

2572471
arrays	loops
then you can loops thru the arrays and output the value which is simply the line

2572473
constructor	object
note in that example we are just exposing the constructor if you wanted instances of the object

2572477
put	get
some libs introduces too many abstractions forcing you to put in more effort to get around it or forcing you to do things in a certain way and i think that s bad

2572483
short	base
i would like to change it .so that it uses the short description as the description in google base

2572490
spritebatch	xna
i ve not used xna for a long time but shouldn t spritebatch be lowercase or have another named otherwise you ll be referencing the actual class spritebatch and not the instances

2572516
default	reset
is it considered better practice and or more efficient to create a reset function for a particular object that clears default all the necessary member variables to allow for further operations or to simply construct a new object from outside

2572526
checkbox	textbox
how to disable asp textbox on client-side click on html checkbox or server-side asp checkbox using javascript

2572543
hotmail	gmail
hotmail and gmail users among others may find your email in their junk folder if you set these incorrectly or not at all

2572553
oncreate	onstart
this methods is called after oncreate more precisely after onstart and is another place android recommends restoring state

2572553
selected	checkbox
if anyone can tell me why the checkbox selected state is being changed in this methods i would very much like to know

2572560
any	set
i run xp x64 but i ve set the platform in the configuration manager to x86 because i know it shouldn t doesn t work on x64 or any cpu

2572566
value	field
changing the field value has undefined results

2572577
cryptography	security
pkcs#7 is a cryptography standards published by rsa security in 1993 that deals with data that has cryptography applied to it

2572577
pkcs#7	x509
pkcs#7 references the x509 as the source for certificate formatting

2572577
pkcs#7	x509
privacy enhanced mail - some kind of tool release before openssl - needed to pass pkcs#7 wrapped data around in email messages that at the time were exchanged on systemd that only supported 7 bit ascii characters - pem created the standards of using base64 to encode the x509 required by pkcs#7 and storing the base64 inside -----begin

2572577
private-key	rsa
can be a rsa private-key psa public key certificate etc

2572584
groovy	java
uses groovy for templates which i think is nice but maybe you want only java

2572593
silverlight	wpf
some wpf and silverlight control suites are ports from established windows forms suites

2572593
declarative	imperative
generally that wpf is declarative rather than imperative

2572613
click	mouse
the mouse event goes directly to the view that the user click on which is the button

2572625
scheme	let
rather than trying to selected one presentation scheme for fitting n levels of informations in a gui why not let the user choose the right level of details he she wants or needs

2572627
restart	reload
after editing the views there is no need to recompile code not even a server restart is needed just reload the page

2572627
annotations	mapping
controllers code is also simple and straightforward there is no need for extensive mapping in xml files all is excellently default and configurable by java 5 annotations

2572634
python	perl
i am trying to write a small client in python or perhaps perl that helps me to determine the types of messages this client supports for which i need to perhaps do a handshake with the client

2572634
python	perl
is it possible to do this using some libs in python or perl

2572640
fclose	fopen
this can happen if the pointers itself is corrupt checked in your debugger to make sure it has the same value at the fclose as was returned by the fopen or if the file data structure gets corrupt by some random pointers write or buffering overflow somewhere

2572642
pointers	stack
by setting the inspector range to start just before this code then looking at which allocation are still alive after this code has returned you can see what got leaked and then look at the leaks pointers histories and the corresponding stack trace to see exactly what happened

2572643
alt	src
what an img elements represents depends on the src attributes and the alt attributes

2572643
alt	src
if the src attributes is set and the alt attributes is set to the empty string

2572643
alt	src
if the src attributes is set and the alt attributes is set to a value that isn t empty

2572643
alt	src
if the src attributes is set and the alt attributes is not

2572643
alt	src
if the src attributes is not set and either the alt attributes is set to the empty string or the alt attributes is not set at all

2572655
slidedown	slideup
the list items kind of appear but aren t animated the containers is only animated .when i apply the slidedown slideup toggleslide effect

2572664
rollback	commit
then go to right click on project- view- custom action- right click on install- add custom action- selected application folder add primary output.the same thing done for all the remaining options like commit rollback uninstaller

2572695
ip-address	hostname
i have a server client architecture where the client hits the asp.net server s service at a certain hostname ip-address and ports

2572700
arrays	map
map is o log n .so not as fast as positional lookup in an arrays

2572700
lookup	any
that is write a lookup that can be efficiently implements by any suitable containers to allow yourself to switching and compare speeds of different implementation

2572704
local-variables	class-variables
for example python the c implementation changes local-variables into references by index but global-variables and class-variables get referenced by named using a hashtable

2572726
python	java	erlang	python
these service could be coded in any numbers of programming langauges such as erlang java python etc

2572728
updating	updates
my question is is there an easy and elegant way to updates the data similar to or do i have to read out all the field deleting removed updating changed and adding new ones

2572737
sorted	lookup	lookup	any
with a map you d have the additional advantage that any non-cached symbols lookup would be much more performant than searching in a vector assuming that the vector isn t sorted - and keeping a vector sorted can be expensive if you have to do the sort more than once

2572772
linux	unix
i ve developed an auto-updater libs which works beautifully on mac os x linux and pretty much every unix that allows you to unlink a file while the file is still open

2572772
windows-xp	windows
however renaming the working directory of the application works on windows 7 and windows-xp

2572776
emacs	vim
are there any snippets to make emacs use the .vim syntax files found in usr shared vim vimfiles for coloring text

2572776
emacs	vim
many applications like conky have the vim syntax files like conkyrc.vim for vim but not for emacs

2572809
32-bit	64bit
by default this will compile both 32-bit and 64bit versioning

2572809
32-bit	64bit
if you want 32-bit only or 64bit only run the appropriate one of these two

2572827
linux	osx
mind you if it is a gui .app then you ll probably have .so many difference between the osx code and the linux x11 code that detection by platform is rea.sonable

2572834
frame	width
now the width is returned once per frame and everything works properly

2572839
groovy	java
apache cfx in jruby groovy and plain old java that lets you consume your wsdl to create clients on-the-fly

2572839
groovy	java
if it is the later you can knock that out quickly with java or jruby groovy

2572855
app-bundle	info.plist
i also learned that the app-bundle is readonly on device making the info.plist un-editable

2572871
getter	setter
contains getter and setter

2572871
getter	setter
secondly if getter and setter are definedd in an interface they don t really defined complete behavior other that one is for read and one is for write wrt a property. you can have complex behavior behind setter and getter but they can only be implements in the actual classes

2572871
getter	setter
with that into consideration there is nothing wrong - syntactically and semantics - with having setter and getter in interfaces

2572871
getter	setter
if your application is well-modeled and the problem required that you have an interface defining setter and getter why not

2572871
getter	setter
now if we look at getter and setter from the points of view of implements classes compliant with the javabeans specifications then you do not need to defined interfaces for them

2572871
getter	setter
but if you have things that required setter and getter like a bean might and which is also requiredd to be plugged at compile-type not at runtime like a bean might and for which multiple implementation might exist then yeah this would call for an interface defining getter and setter

2572905
haskell	python
in other words like most other languages python is eager in its evaluation the major exception-handling today is probably haskell but that doesn t help you

2572919
pointers	stack	queue	fifo	circular-buffer	queue	circular-buffer	fifo
lifo is easily represented by a stack fifo is a queue and i ve used a not-very-optimized-but-probably-adequate circular-buffer implementation using a and index pointers to approximate a round-robin access pattern

2572922
combinations	permutation
i then used a combinations permutation generator to try all possible arrangements of the logs until a solution was found where all the intersection equated to zero ie

2572938
internet-explorer	firefox
it works fine in firefox internet-explorer and even safari.

2572960
python	java
you can try something like this example in java -- you don t specify in your q if you want to use java or python in your .app or this one in python but they re more like proof-of-concept and quite instructive admittedly than fully-ready productionized components

2572961
red-black-tree	tree
stl map implementation usually are implements with self-balancing tree like the red-black-tree data structure and their operations take o logn time

2572963
expression	evaluation
what i would expect at this points is the result variables to contains the text and the decompressed.readtoend expression evaluation to an empty string

2573001
operators	keyword
you are limited to what you can do with the built-in c keyword and operators

2573016
wymeditor	wysiwyg
your phrasing is a little confusing but if you re looking for a wysiwyg editor to generator html you could look at wymeditor

2573064
webforms	asp.net
i have a asp.net webforms application that has in the page load this

2573082
attributes	properties
you can t add an attributes and automagically have exception-handling code added around all call to a properties methods

2573086
git-filter-branch	repo
git-filter-branch didn t remove this submodule from my repo it was still tracked .when i viewed git-status

2573113
subclassing	accessor
the example code i linked to describe how to create accessor in your nsmanagedobject subclassing that will convert the image back and forth between a uiimage and binary-data

2573118
value	field
the reason why the combo box is blank .when you navigate to the next recording is because you have notinlist set to true which is what you want but .when you arrive on the recording the rowsource has been filtering to not include the value stored in the field the combo box is bound to

2573121
mks	svn
at work i m using mks which does this automatically but i am yet to figure out how to achieve this with svn and eclipse

2573124
constructor	object
you can then create a concrete checkconfiguration class that takes those two bool properties in its constructor and configure your containers to create different instances of the parameter object interface based on a higher-level di parameter

2573143
shell	bash	bash	zsh
in most unix shell csh bash zsh alias are a form of expansion

2573201
google-chrome	firefox
this is a pretty picky one but .when you click the headline it expands but at least in firefox haven t tested it in google-chrome yet the text jumps from the right and to the left locking in-place from which the css tells it to padding-left

2573212
double	int
my guess is that the reason for this slowdown is due to the conversion between the javascript double and the internal unsigned 8bit int used by the canvaspixelarray

2573218
health-monitoring	metrics
turn on asp.net health-monitoring to start getting some metrics numbers

2573223
display	width
now you are just setting a display block with no width and that expands as the accordion opens and pushes past the thumbnail

2573223
margins	padding
you could set a long bottom margins to your thumb or just remove that padding and allow the text to wrap it

2573235
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
i want to extends this using perl python or php but i want to be able to pass in for example yellow and the function returns all types of yellows - their hex rgb

2573236
defined	declare
since you can only triggers an event from a class where it is defined you re probably defining a new event in the class using the event keyword .so there is no real rea.son why you couldn t declare your own delegation

2573238
scrollbar	widget
i can work out how to do this by building a custom scrollbar widget but i wanted to checked if i was missing some way to do it using a native scrollbar first

2573262
pascal	delphi
delphi and its underlying pascal language is still alive and well with the 2010 edition recently release

2573268

using such row-column index numbers i need to change an attributes s value in the previously selected cell and in the cell just click

2573273
shutdown	restart
do you restart your hudson server frequently without doing a prepare for shutdown on the manage hudson page first

2573277
putimagedata	drawimage
looks like you re doing .some kind of blitting .so maybe drawimage or all-at-once putimagedata could help

2573287
json	xml
yql converts the page into xml then does your xpath on it then takes the domnodelist and serialization that back to xml for your output and then converts to json if needed

2573290
system.web	.net
the regular .net contains httputility.urlencode in the system.web assembly and in silverlight it appears it was move to system.windows.browser

2573295
background-color	transparency
if you did not want to make the whole cell transparency but the labels only you can set the background-color attributes of the textlabel and detailtextlabel to clear as well

2573296
json	xml
for instances if the resource responds to json or xml request you could format and organize that data via javascript from the client web browser or you could use your web framework to gather the data from the rest api and manipulate organize it making the result available to your application

2573296
http	ssl
http ssl is a must for this types of traffic to prevent eavesdropping

2573303
wxwidgets	mfc
you can also choose to use a different gui framework than mfc such as wxwidgets or qt

2573310
value	field
you need to do a rtrim on the value or store the data in a varchar field

2573312
value	field
if you insert 01 into the field the value stored is actually 01 note the trailing spaces

2573325
standard-library	boost
i m wondering if what i m trying to do is possible using the standard-library i know i can do it easily using boost

2573340
google-chrome	firefox
this is not quite a javascript solution but can i recommend using the imacros plugins works with firefox google-chrome and ie for this

2573361
put	get
i can obviously get it to work if i put it in the a class tag but that s the problem

2573369
contains	set
an idea i ve been toying with has been something along the line of a base set of entity tables in 3rd normals form these will contains the facts that are common among all product

2573398
display	width
by specifying exact width for these you freeze their size and prevent them from flowing properly .when the display changes due to different fonts sizes screens etc

2573423
instance-variables	local-variables
it is difficult to answer your question because it is unsure whether the qem1 and qem2 variables where the quickentrymediator object is initially allocated are local-variables or if they are instance-variables or even globally static

2573423
listbox	textbox
your intent in showing these however may be in trying to infer from the quickentrymediator object lifetime the lifetime of the textbox listbox themselves in case quickentrymediator makes references to them

2573432
double	int
typedef void foo int double

2573442
percentile	median
they then return not only their median but say their 25th and 75th percentile as well perverse worst cases are better if you choose slightly different numbers

2573445
return-type	arguments
for passing function-pointers you only need to know the arguments types and the return-type

2573454
sql-server	mysql
if you have 600 mb of data it s better that use from another db like sql-server or mysql

2573482
google-chrome	firefox
note this will only work in firefox and possibly google-chrome

2573492
constructor	private
for being able to inherited from a singleton class we would have to make the constructor protected instead of private

2573506
factors	primes
the mixed radix case is similar though you need to divide x into equals portions each time .so it helps if n doesn t have any large primes factors

2573510
freebsd	bsd
try out javasysmon bsd licensed to be precise the freebsd 2-clause license

2573520
filtering	sorting
you need to follow the example of better exposed filteringing in form_alter ing the exposed filteringing form and sorting your filtering s #options arrays

2573557
attributes	properties
i list this elements by visualtreehelper and save its attributes in db question is that how to retrieve this properties and affect them

2573956
ternary-operator	operands
while the ternary-operator does have its place the if-statement is often more intelligible especially .when the operands are fairly complex

2573956
ternary-operator	operands
in addition if you repeat code in different branches of an if-statement they will only be evaluated in the branch that is taken in many programming languages both operands of the ternary-operator are evaluated no matter which branch is selected

2573956
ternary-operator	operands
while as you have pointed out this is not a concern in java many programmers have used a variety of languages and might not remember this level of detail and .so it is best to use the ternary-operator only with simple operands

2573956
verilog	hdl
the vast majority of programming languages use lazy-evaluation evalution with the ternary-operator i was thinking of verilog at the time of writing which is a hardware description language hdl in which both branches are evaluated in parallels

2573959
scala	java
is it more difficult to learn scala than java

2573959
scala	java
is code written in scala tends to be more complicated than code written in java

2573959

2574064
command-line	cmd	git-add	git-rm
another thing to be aware of is that cmd like git-add and git-rm allow the -n command-line option to specify dry run while in git-commit the -n option means something completely different

scala	java
scala on the other hand - despite running on the jvm providing easy interoperability with java apis - is what is commonly referred to as a multi-paradigm language

2574156
functional-programming	imperative
the concept of functional-programming - especially once you get into code beyond trivial tutorials - proves to be hard for devs who are only experienced with imperative oo languages

2574156
functional-programming	imperative
in a nutshell imho it s not scala that is hard to learn the functional-programming paradigms is the reason for most devs who ve only been exposed to imperative languages having a hard time getting up to speed

2574173
children	nodes
the function should given a nodes return the nodes itself or any of its children such that the probability of choosing a nodes is normally distribute relative to its depth .so the function should return mostly middle nodess but .sometimes the root itself or the lowest ones - but that s not really necessary if that makes it significantly more complex if all any nodes is chosen with equals probability that s good enough

2574195
any	set
the methods in qt4 do not have an arguments which allows you to set a selection id nor can i find any other function in the qtextcur.sor or qtextedit which looks like it might allow me to do .so

2574559
qtextcursor	qtextedit
to graphically visualize all the various selection separate qtextcursor object instead of calling the settextcursor methods for the qtextedit widget for each of the selection i change the background-color of each of those sections of text by calling the setcharformat methods for each of those qtextcursor object

2574616
scala	java
the scala collections libs is much reacher than java s because of these

2574640

2574697
bimap	map
a bimap or bidirectional map is a

2574727
n-gram	words
if the above methods is too simple you can increase its complexity by count n-gram grouping of words or even grammatical structure by first tagging the part-of-speech lots of spam is usually random garbage populate with keyword where non-spam usually makes some sense

2574729
attributes	properties
adding all properties with an attributes that tells you what the id is

2574737
initializer	setter
unfortunately the initializer blocks cannot be used in conjunction with such object at the moment because to make this pattern work the object has to have properties setter which an immutable object doesnâ t have

2574769
administration	account
i need to connect as the administration server account .when setting up the application

2574772
sniffing	packets
reliability of the protocols by packets sniffing programs like wireshark is very useful

in both these cases hostname and dns you consulted a machine other than the one with the specific ip-address you are interested in

2574774
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
the second approach which i think might be faster if you re doing this for many many a s haven t thought carefully is to instead use a sieve like the sieve-of-eratosthenes

2574774
factors	primes
10 10 to be perfectly correct but since you re willing to tolerate some composite numbers a smaller list of primess will do testing by the first 50 million primess ensures your numbers have no primes factors below 982 451 653 and there aren t many of them.

2574781
udp	tcp
if not you ll probably want to use udp or tcp

2574781

few protocols these days design individual packets though many do send very specific data-structures across the wire using tcp or less commonly udp

2574783
dependency-injection	inject
dependency-injection - use a di framework to inject dependencies

2574799
json	xml
if you will pass the serialization data to another application you should use json or xml for compatibility

2574813
contains	any
it s working fine but .when my numbers contains any 0 the output is unexpected

2574827
put	get
i don t really understand the purpose of the get and put functions here

2574827
put	get
.so my question is what is the purpose of get and put in general

2574831
constructor	object
the properties that are essential for the object work should be initializer in the constructor .so you should provide the appropiate parameters in hthe constructor

2574866
udp	rtp
first of all are you about to implements an enhanced transport protocols like rtp on top of udp or an application protocols like http smtp

2574935

2574993
value	field
on every value updates a store methods is called which stores all field in a file

2575016
getattr	setattr
well for that you could use python getattr and setattr instead as you would on any python object

2575035
put	get
however more generally that won t apply and then get and put are convenient plumbing pieces whose meaning is perhaps clearer than writing the inner function directly

2575036
value	field
still if you have a field that is capable of being read and written by multiple threads marking the field as volatile guarantees that your code sees the most current value

2575058
put	get
but if i put aaa bbb ccc .when i printing i only get ccc it cuts the previous off

2575064
ebnf	bnf
i have read bnf ebnf and abnf from wikipedia and it has describe some difference and why ebnf and abnf came into picture based on bnf

.so this b-tree is just a single nodes contains 7 elements

2575116
decimal-point	digits
if i m using long-double then i assume that my answers are good till 15 digits after the decimal-point

2575123
ebnf	bnf
the ebnf is the extended newer versioning of bnf .so the problem becomes simpler ebnf vs abnf

2575156
constructor	object	dependency-injection	inject
in the example i provided above dependency-injection can be done if a containers is used to initializer object and automatically inject the dependency in the constructor we speak then frequently of di containers

2575181
oracle	mysql
what would be an appropriate sql data types for storing ipv4 or ipv6 addresses in the following supported databases h2 mysql oracle

2575248
scheme	lisp
lisp and scheme have interactive mode

2575251
perl	php
php and perl will all do it

2575251
python	lua
lua has a more formal interactive mode like python which will show you the indentation level of your code at the prompt

2575266
python	ruby
on the other hand i think python javascript ruby programmers think in terms of prototype of the object list of methods and properties which is slightly different from types

2575266
python	ruby
the fact that the methods invocations are resolved at the runtime allows languages like python and ruby to have libs that redefines the meaning of properties or methodss

2575267
any	set
also is there any way to set this up into a templates

2575275
priority-queue	queue
.when i pop a struct off the priority-queue the queue stl priority-queue implementation is supposed to call the object s destructor

2575354
exp	pow
i think you need to have a caching of base exp - pow base exp

2575365
mouseover	mouseout
there seems to be a bit of difference between the mouseout and mouseover events

2575365
mouseleave	mouseout
quick example of mouseout and mouseleave

2575365
mouseleave	mouseout
what looks like a much more in depth look at the difference between mouseout and mouseleave

2575399
subclassing	superclass
as other have said this is not advisable but here s a contrived example that does what you re looking for--the superclass call an overrides methods which uses an arguments that was passed to the subclassing s constructor

2575401
common-lisp	lisp
the interactive environment i m most familiar with and one that i have found among the most congenial of all the free environment for interactive programming i ve tried not that i ve tried them all is slime a mode for emacs that allows integration with a running common-lisp and can also be used with clojure a lisp for the jvm

2575401
smalltalk	lisp
if lisp isn t your cup of tea a variety of smalltalk environment are worth mentioning

2575427
extends	super
if you use super instead of extends allowing you to pass a it s the other way around

2575432
execute	declare
maybe like spawn execute declare scroll cursor open fetch etc

2575435
scripting-language	dsl
in a sort of similar project in asp.net i wrote my own scripting-language dsl

2575450
subclassing	base-class
it s equivalent to accepting some object of a base-class types even if you re passing in a subclassing

2575451
scrollbar	widget
.when there are too much widget to fit in the windows i want to use a scrollbar .so i put tix.scrolledwindows inside that frame and add my widget to this scrolledwindows instead

2575461
subclassing	base-class
this avoid some weird down casts if you have a list of some subclassing but the methods expects a list of the base-class

2575461
double	int
you still can add double and int object in a list with or without

2575465
arguments	default
as of gwt 1.5 it must have a default zero arguments constructor with any access modifiers or no constructor at all

2575469
web-inspector	webkit
the license for webkit is generally lgpl and bsd however the web-inspector files all have differing copyright owners apple google nokia etc and the following license

2575493
32-bit	64bit
from what i can tell environment.processorcount may return an incorrect value .when running under wow64 as a 32-bit process on a 64bit os because the p invoke signature it relies on uses getsysteminfo instead of getnativesysteminfo

2575508
arrays	map
note that in f# the map data structure can happily use list or arrays elements as key

2575523
double	int
some cursory research states that bitwise-operators in javascript are inherently slow because internally it appears that javascript will cast all of its double value into signed 32-bit int to do the bitwise operations see here for more on this. because of this i can t do a direct ports of the java random numbers generator and i need to get the same numeric results as java.util.random

2575529
click	mouse
the problem is that .when i click on the start inditas button on the menu the procedure execute many time until i release the mouse button

but i doubt it since all boolean are stored as double

2575546
contains	elements
i have an xml file that contains its elements like

2575561
multiplication	bit-shift	multiplication	division
bear in mind that a bit-shift is directly equivalent to a multiplication or division by a power of 2

2575604
constructor	object
techpriester is it ok to use object s constructor as a function to create new item

2575620
constructor	object
objitem usually have a class constructor .so this class might be responsible for creating object of types objitem

2575623
webforms	asp.net
it is now 100 detached from asp.net webforms and it s not going away

2575626
constructor	object
wether you let the collections create it s object like which then call the items constructor or use directly and then some methods is entirely up to you and the needs of your application

2575633
hide	show
it is commented to death but in general you give it a containers id in which your elementss to show hide are and then some hide-all-then-show-one-of-them is done in the selected elements s onchange

2575642
getter	setter
we use a lot of getter setter .so i wrote the following templates

2575642

internet-explorer	firefox
my website looks good in internet-explorer 8 and firefox but the part of the picure and top navigation is laso noty in-place can anyone figur out why

2575686
constructor	object
all you have to worry about is if your constructor will work fine in both cases with new object created and without it

2575686
constructor	object
usually it is better to inject object as a constructor parameter instead of id not to create it inside another object

2575689
calayer	uiview
i have a uiview that contains a numbers of calayer subclassing

2575690
udp	tcp
the difference between tcp and udp is that the former takes care of sequencing of data and retransmission of dropped packets plus a flow control slow reader slows down fast writer while the latter doesn t

2575690
nonblocking	epoll
many excellent high-performance network applications have been written without threads but using nonblocking sockets and some polling mechanism see selected 2 poll 2 epoll 7

2575690
udp	tcp
i agree that playing with udp and low-level protocols state-machines is a lot of fun but it has been done already and decades of research went into tuning tcp performance

2575695
stderr	stdout
i encountered much the same problem and eventually decided to use threads to gather up all the data on a subprocess s stdout and stderr and put it onto a thread-safe queue which which the main thread can read in a blocking fashion without having to worry about the threading going on behind the scenes

2575698
stderr	stdout
i have a scripting that call a filtering program with systemd and replace the file in the buffering with its output but there doesn t seem to be a way to detection if the line returned by systemd where written to stdout or to stderr

2575701
instances	private
in c# you have to explicit declare an instances methods as virtual and then that methods cannot be private

2575702
click	mouse
in case the mouse unit doesn t provide a way to wait for a mouse click or something similar

2575711
constructor	object
if .so i would recommend adding it either in a constructor assuming the interpreter is an object or an init methods

2575713
contains	any	contains	elements
your scripting generally has access to any elements declare in the source before the scripting-tag contains calling your scripting

2575713
contains	elements
this include parent elements contains your script-tag

2575713
google-chrome	firefox
is it possible to hinder a scripting elements in dom from running using userscriptinging content scriptinging or similar in google-chrome or firefox

2575719
eclipse-virgo	spring-dm
you should look into spring-dm server it s being transitioned to eclipse-virgo but that s not been release yet

2575722
factors	primes
one has to repeat the algorithm above for every primes factors r of p-1 and then to use the chinese remainder theorem to find x from the partials solutions

2575722
exponent	mod
this step is repeated for every exponent of q this is from knowing x mod q i we iteratively derive x mod q i+1

that will printing the src of the image and its alt text

2575789
selected	checkbox
the selected column is a checkbox

2575792
base-class	inherited
one example is the char_traits parameter to basic_string even though that s implements differently than mc++d s policies which use inherited to make use of the empty base-class optimization and to allow easy addition to a class s public interface in a much better way than wrapping each possible methods

2575803
stderr	stdout
you can use python to distinguish between stdout and stderr

2575814
gridview	listview
note that here lv is your listview not your gridview

2575871

2575903
basic	vba
you can do a substantial amount in excel both by simply using the facilities provided as cell functions and if that doesn t suffice you can use vba visual basic for applications built into excel for more complex analysis

2575911
data-structures	tree
you write the code to parsing your function into suitable data-structures tree

2575920
interpreter	runtime	expression	evaluation
that could be done at runtime like an interpreter usually does or it could be a compile phase which creates code to execute by copying the instructions from each expression evaluation into allocated memory and then sets it up as a function

2575936
tostring	equals
a properties named p in the form of a string value is an arrays index if and only if tostring touint32 p is equals to p and touint32 p is not equals to 2 32 âˆ 1

2575948
any	set
you don t have to use tablerow elements in it though any subclassing of view can go in .so you can easily use a linearlayout set to flow vertically for the top row

2575950
bundler	gem
it is always better to defined your gem dependencies in the .gems manifest or in the new bundler styles gemfile

2575958
contains	set
you ll also either need to overrides getitem to contains custom logic for figuring out which set of source data to look in and to map the data accordingly or mush the data down into one list of object if you re using an arrayadapter and cast in the getview methods probably a bit slower than handling it in the getitem without casting

2575961

2575995
hide	show
now i want it .so at first only the first div is showing and the others are hidden but i have asp loops that generator clickable links for the various divs pages and click on any given link will show that div and hide all the others

2575996
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
you should throw a nullpointerexception or an illegalargumentexception if filename is null

2575996
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
there s a good debate on which to use in the question illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception for a null parameter

2576002
haskell	sml	haskell	scala
ml haskell scala f# sml and other languages can easily figure out the types from equivalent expression in their own language mainly because they were designed with types-inference in mind from the very start

2576002
haskell	sml
by contrast ml haskell f# and sml support types-inference .so well because they have these .sorts of restrictions you can t call methodss before they re declare the first methods call to inferred functions determines the types compilation order has an impact on types-inference etc

2576004
python	ruby
the interpreted-language in question is python though i may also use ruby

2576007
contains	lookup
note that the cookies doesn t normally contains the user named just a index to a lookup table that s stored server-side

2576008
click	mouse
i remember seeing a javascript libs a long time ago that offered the ability to recording where users click and move their mouse on your website inorder to do usability testing

if i handle the panels s mouseenter and mouseleave events and its child s mouseenter and mouseleave events the events are raised in this order

2576045
contains	any
nothing you would do in your http-headers html or javascript would make it across the gap between the browser and that other program and the pdf format itself contains no switching to enable any kind of modal user-interface

value	field
if value was the only reference to an already existing field it becomes eligible for garbage-collection

2576061

2576077
udp	tcp
after studying tcp udp difference all week i just can t decide which to use

2576077
udp	tcp
the only other solution i came up with is to use udp and if there seems to be too great of loss of packets switching to tcp client-side

2576084
show	next
at the next keystroke it removes the windows and show the stdscr again .so it s again all- s

2576095
persistent	transient
a new instances of a a persistent class which is not associated with a session has no representation in the database and no identifier value is considered transient by hibernate

2576095
persistent	transient
you can make a transient instances persistent by associating it with a session

2576100
udp	tcp
if you can t lose data and you use udp you are reinventing tcp at least a significant fractions of it

2576102
udp	tcp
udp is simpler protocols than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp

2576102
udp	tcp
however i d firstly just use both udp and tcp checked their behavior in a real environment and only then decide to reimplement tcp in terms of udp in the exact way you need

2576107
decimal	hex
here is my code which is doing the conversion from hex to decimal

2576107

background-color	width	frame	width
add a 12-pixel-high sublayer with a flat background-color starting with a zero-width frame and animation out to your view s width

2576136
udp	tcp
therefore tcp by definition is the right answer over udp

2576136
udp	tcp
the only other solution i came up with is to use udp and if there seems to be too great of loss of packets switching to tcp client-side

2576138
low-level	hardware
and an os or indeed a hardware chip can be designed specifically .so that jvm or clr like runtime are the native low-level layer of the systemd

2576139
udp	tcp
start with the simplest setup i m guessing tcp for bulk data transfer and udp for non-reliable sensor data test measure find bottlenecks re-factor

2576141
controllers	routes
it s router features solve the problem highlight by zneak and dd you would simply defined in your routes that would points to a particular controllers action i presume you re using the asp.net-mvc design pattern considering you want a twitter like url structure

2576142
attributes	properties
i ve done this by messing with the .csproj file either move the attributes into the configuration-specific properties grouping or just use conditional

2576149
shallow-copy	deep-copy
slicing a list by using as you do does not create a deep-copy -- it creates a shallow-copy

2576190
object-reference	instances
do they respond with a tailored error e.g elephant is not a fruit or an internal error which is a by-product of your bad input e.g object-reference not set to an instances of an object

itertools	functools
discover itertools and functools

2576251
subtract	add	subtract	time

2576271
json	xml
it s a lot easier to traversal xml document than it is to traversal json object to find particular nodes types

2576279
required	checked
checked the this variables contains the paths where ruby looks for .when you use required

2576280
subtract	time
the simplest solution is tracking added subtract time separately and rework getelapsedtime thus

2576288
value	field
i would consider adding in an offset field to handle any changes to the starting value of the timer

2576296
multiplication	addition
the trouble is .when i need to implements things like addition and scalar multiplication

2576322
json	xml
json is generally much simpler to use than soap or any xml format and soap support in objective-c is very limited

abstract-class	derived-class
what i want is to building an abstract-class that will have a function that will call a function expecting it to be implements in the derived-class

2576372
exception-handling	error-handling
and if your users are not techies and will want more helpful error messages than exception-handling dump then you should do more custom error-handling yourself

2576379
google-chrome	safari
the following seems to work but i d like to avoid printing errors to the console at least safari and google-chrome do .when accessing location-href on the parent frame

2576395
constructor	object
the effect of making a virtual call 10.3 to a pure-virtual function directly or indirectly for the object being created or destroy from such a constructor or destructor is undefined

2576605
click	mouse
3 the child is positioninging relative to the mouse click positioning

2576605
click	mouse
if the mouse click was on the right half of the canvas the child will be positioning 200 pixels to the left of that spot

2576613
memmove	memcpy
the similar function memcpy does not have reliable semantics if the areas to be copy-paste overlap whereas memmove does

2576613
memmove	memcpy
in c++ you need to be cautious about using memmove or memcpy

2576627
strcpy	gets
make sure you know how big your buffering needs to be in advance because strcpy doesn t stop til it gets enough

2576667
entity-framework	nhibernate

void	main
use a constructor or a main methods public static void main string arguments ... to fill your arraylist

2576688
valarray	std
as i try to become more familiar with it and the issues being worked i came across this site which seems to be advocating for deprecated or removing std valarray since most people are using blitz++ instead

2576688
valarray	std
i guess i m probably one of the few people out there who still uses std valarray and yes i know the class has a sordid past a tarnished present and a questionable future

2576688
valarray	std
aside from the one site above i ve been able to find very little on what is actually happening with std valarray in the new standards and was hoping that .somebody on .so might be able to provide .some insight and or references where google wikipedia and even the c++ standardss committee website have .so far failed me

2576689
associations	model
entity-framework can building you entity model that need only conform to standards programming concepts like inherited and associations

2576701

2576723
tiff	png
.so roll your own format but convert to png or tiff for display

2576733
contains	any
the responsibility of your nested control is then purely collecting and exposing the data to its nestedviewmodel for consumption by the contains viewmodel and it is theoretically more re-usable in different contexts that required the same information to be entered if any - let s say you wanted to re-use it for editing already-created connections

2576737
radio-button	selected	radio-button	checkbox	selected	checkbox
.when it asked me to selected the checkbox to create the main methods there wasn t anything on-screen that looked like a checkbox with main or methods next to it .so i guessed that maybe what they meant was the modifiers radio-button

2576739
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
i ve always thought to myself if javascript went on the desktop it would demolish ruby python and perl as the language of choice for ad hoc scripting -- but that s pure speculation

2576782
automapper	nhibernate
luckily there is an automapper called fluent-nhibernate that can make even that aspects of nhibernate seamless you can customize the mapping on a per-table or per-column basis if you like and also overrides the automapper conventions

2576782
data-access	nhibernate
i just think microsoft doesn t target me and my needs with its data-access strategies nearly as well as nhibernate does

msvc s implementation of a 64bit modulo on 32-bit x86 is .some hairy loops filled assembly vc crt src intel llrem.asm for the brave .so i d per.sonally go with that

2576798
stderr	stdout
in tomcat unrecovered exception-handling are usually logged to the stderr and that usually doesn t end up in the same logfile as the stdout

2576798
configuration	logging
even more it is entirely dependent on the logging configuration

2576799
protected	public
itunes analogy aside the main frame details show all of the public and protected information needed to interact with that class or interface

below that is a summary of all the field constructor and methods that are public or protected on the class

2576808
selected	checkbox
a user able to selected or remove by selecteded checkbox productâ s from the view finally save-as a collections .when user submit these changes

2576838
version-control	git
concept is inspired from distribute version-control systemd like git

2576839
vba	vb6
systemd hungarian notation still makes a lot of sense .when you re working with the old vb6 or vba languages

2576849
assign	add
i ve used both of these and they both have easy interfaces to add new mysql users and assign them privileges

2576856
linux	unix
there are many filesystems in common use for unix linux and you would need to write a custom copy algorithm for each

2576890
put	get
the iphone simulator 3.2 will get you the ipad simulator or compile for iphone device 3.2 and put the .app on a phone to test it

2576904
postgresql	mysql
i have been tinkering with mysql and postgresql a bit the past few weeks and at this points i can t really decide which to go with

2576908
configuration	environment
use visual-studio s new web-config transformation to permit easily altering configuration based on environment

2576912
32-bit	64bit
due to a 3rd party application s requirement i may be forced to use 32-bit client of oracle 10gr2 on the application-server to connect to a 64bit db server oracle 10gr2 10.2.0.4.0 - 64bit

2576912
32-bit	64bit
there are no problems connecting to 64bit db server via 32-bit client

2576919
gtk	sdl
how can i interact between the gtk events and the sdl events inside the gtk windows

2576946

however .when querying the same recording back immediately after it was insert the recording_dates field ends up null even though in the table those field have got value

2576961
postgresql	mysql
why is this marked mysql and postgresql

2576970
checkout	payment
i need a checkout process devoid of a delivery and payment step

2576975
mousedown	mouseup
another idea is to tracking click myself with mousedown mouseup which seems pretty primitive and probably belongs in a framework rather than my application

2576977
export	csv
there s no one-step plone-to-ldap export tool you ll have to export your plone users to csv and then import your users to your ldap database

2576977
export	csv
tools for plone that can export members to csv include

2577001
sql-server	mysql
visual nhibernate has come a long way from a tool to generator nhibernate mapping and classes from just microsoft sql-server to a tool that does all the major databases i am biased cause it does mysql now

2577001
sql-server	oracle
if you use oracle microsoft sql-server or mysql-server and you do not wish to spend too much time designing mapping and typing classes then this is the tool for you

2577011
google-chrome	firefox
i ve used the developer-tools on google-chrome firefox and ie and on ie it s extremely slow

2577013
python	java
one form can be converted to the other with one notable restrictions many popular languages c java normals python do not support tco tce tail-call-optimization tail-call-elimination and thus using recursion will add extra data to stack each time a methods call itself recursively

2577013
haskell	scheme
.so in c and java iterator is idiomatic whereas in scheme or haskell recursion is idiomatic

2577024
display	height
one approach i can use is to manipulate the height of the page and display some textfield at appropriate positioning as header and footer but i think there must be smarter way to do this in cocoa

2577035
easymock	jmock
jmock easymock are tools to help achieve unit-testing your class

2577035
easymock	guice	easymock	jmock	jmock	guice
in the context of unit-testing guice is overlapped with jmock easymock

2577035
easymock	guice	easymock	jmock	jmock	guice
guice forces users to pollute their code with all kind of annotations such as inject to achieve the same result as jmock easymock

2577035
easymock	guice	easymock	jmock	jmock	guice
if developers find themselves to use guice instead of jmock easymock they properly either not doing a real unit-test or they try to test controllers classes

2577044
constructor	object
it also makes sense to me to have the dependencies in the constructor for your object

2577050
controllers	routes
resort to using find_by_permalink in your controllers using which is passed in form the routes

2577067
command-line	cmd
these cmd seem to run on command-line sqlite3

2577074
touch	drag
to drag you can simply set the sprite s centering to the location of the current touch coordinates

2577078

binary-search-tree	binary-tree
how to convert a binary-tree to binary-search-tree in-place we cannot use any extra spaces

2577117
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i believe asp.net-mvc is not here to replace webforms

2577120
binary-search-tree	binary-tree
a binary-tree usually is a binary-search-tree in which case no conversion is required

2577128
dialog	pop-up
if there is a need to display some simple confirmation pop-up most developers would rather install jquery find some dialog plugins for it skins it than put a one liner

2577130
google-chrome	firefox
am trying to get http response from php web service in javascript but getting null in firefox and google-chrome

2577139

since gui elements can be initializer at runtime you could probably roll your own inflater with an xml parsing and a bit of reflection

2577140
aggregate-functions	sum
i am using a query with aggregate-functions sum to generator the sum of each product the result looks like this

2577140
dump	temp
i know 1 way of doing this is the dump the 1st query result to a temp table then join it with product table

2577160
attributes	properties
full control over how a properties is serialization including it it should be a nodes or an attributes

2577166
double-quotes	single-quotes
allows variables to be interpolation using single-quotes doesn t and using the tag without either behaves like double-quotes

2577184
silverlight	wpf
i have read somewhere that silverlight is subset of wpf then why triggers are not used in the silverlight and the states are used

2577209
where-clause	sql
they are allowed at nearly any meaningful points in a sql statement including the target list the where-clause and .so on

2577209
value	field
note that using a normals value operators on the results of a sub-query required that only one field must be returned

2577214
contains	elements
the 0th elements of the pmatch arrays of regmatch_t struct will contains the boundaries of the whole string matched as you have noticed

2577219
silverlight	wpf
because silverlight is subset of wpf

2577223
key-value	key
.so to use mysql as a key-value store that means you just create one table with two columns key which should be the primary key on the table and value

2577232
selected	button
the idea is to write scripting or a small application which will click the button in the target application to open dialog box and then somehow selected files which i needed

2577251
binary-tree	linked-list
at the end you are left with the worst possible sorted binary-tree -- a linked-list

2577263
reflection	runtime
however since all gui elements can be initializer at runtime you could probably roll your own inflater with an xml parsing and a bit of reflection

2577285
worksheet	excel
.when you go search for excel.sheet.8 again in hkey_classes_root you ll find an entry with a default-value of microsoft office excel 97-2003 worksheet - that s probably as good as it gets

2577294
silverlight	wpf
the silverlight team were working on a very compressed delivery cycle and chose to implements the visualstatemanager instead of triggerss because they felt that visualstatemanager delivered most of what they needed and would be much cheaper to implements than the full wpf triggers systemd

2577295
children	tree	children	nodes	traversal	parent
for this each nodes is compared and possibly swapped with each of it s direct children and therefore also with its parent repeatedly until you traversal the tree and don t find any

2577295
traversal	parent
doing a shaker sort bubble-sort that goes left to right and the right-to-left versioning of this would work best and after the initial pass you would not need to traversal down subtrees that did not look out of order with respect to it s parent

2577297
32-bit	64bit
i have developed a windows sidebar gadget which plays videos in a flash player it works in vista home basic 32-bit os but doesn t work in vista home premium 64bit os

2577383
administration	account
but it only searches files that has been upload by a windows user account like administration and ignore the ones upload by systemd account

exception-handling	try-catch
however since you re hiding all exception-handling with your try-catch block you ll never know what s wrong

2577453
callback	methods
al.so the get and .post methods dont return the data because they need to work async .so you actuall have to run your createselect function as the callback

2577476

you have not in any code that you ve show set this-pointser to points anywhere

2577608
subclassing	superclass
i have a superclass with lots of methods but they will always not all of them be subclassing

2577623
rvalue-reference	move-semantics
next .when you don t care about move-semantics are there any limitations that would cause a non-const reference to be preferred over an rvalue-reference .when dealing with function parameters

2577623
copy-constructor	rvalue
and rvalue references are themselves lvalues .so you can t inadvertently call a move-constructor instead of a copy-constructor or .something like that

2577636
versioning	upgrade
normally i would upgrade it to the latest versioning but something keeps me away from the building later than 2.8.1

a common way to do this is to have your enumerator specified in a common low-level assembly that can be referenced by any other assembly every project i ve ever worked on has some sort of framework or common assembly

2578015
sql-server	mysql
i am looking for few global variables in mysql which are equivalent of sql-server

2578020
arrays	loops
the variables you supply to the foreach loops has to be an arrays

2578040

asp.net-mvc	webforms
just move from webforms to asp.net-mvc and replacing various userinterfaces

2578091
implements	abstract
i don t know much about opengl at this points though and don t want my abstract interface to expose anything that isn t simple to implements in opengl

2578091
direct3d	directx
i was hoping to be able to implements a vertex-buffer interface much like the the directx one but it looks like in direct3d you have an arrays of structures and in opengl you need a separate arrays for each elements which makes finding a common abstraction quite hard to make efficient

2578101
aggregate	grouping
other sql dialects don t they ask that all selected field that are not aggregate be in the grouping by statement

2578109
constructor	object
you can stop the first assert from firing by making the object refer to itself .so that its reference count doesn t go to zero for instances by giving it this constructor

for internet-explorer 8 you need to do like for ff3 ie use the access-control-allow-origin header plus use xdomainrequest object instead of xmlhttprequest

2578263
contains	any
and if you look at this file based repository in their svn repository you will see that it contains the mentioned artifacts which are thus very likely not available in any known public repository

2578291
contains	elements
you might be able to get a better effect by append successive span elements contains each letter if the text is very long -- this would reduce flashing as the text gets replace and the layout changes momentarily

2578302
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie and firefox but google-chrome does not work

2578304

append	input
i have a homework assignment where i need to take input from a file and continuously remove the first words in a line and append it to the end of the line until all combinations have been done

2578319
quicksort	heapsort
we can fit more recording into memory with a heapsort it uses o 1 spaces than with a quicksort which uses o log n memory for the call stack but in most implementation quicksort wins by virtue of its memory locality and lower instruction count

2578319
duplicates	sorted
for disk i o it would read the terabyte data file write 16 gb to disk read that 16 gb from disk and write it back sorted then read it and return the duplicates

2578321
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
.when i enter www.upitr.com in browsers it works but for upitr.com it works just in firefox and safari while it doesn t work in ie and google-chrome

2578361
selected	button
i ve already figured selected with these value and all but i just want the button to pass about five arguments to a given function

2578375
arguments	default
a few tidbits that should help .when you call a function with a string the string is split into multiple arguments the positional parameters named where n are int starting at 1 on the characters in the variables which default to spaces tabs and newline

2578402
selected	button
as expected and understood on ipod touch after selected video it show a play button which brings up video in another screens

it s probably just qwidget not qplaintextedit

2578443
contains	elements
your html might look like this where idofswf is the id of the elements contains the swf on the page

2578443
click	mouse
note that you won t get a mouseevent my example passes null as the value for it because the event handler is being called manually external from javascript instead of from within the swf on a mouse click

2578450
internet-explorer	firefox
i think right now is firefox 3.6.2 but .when internet-explorer 9 launchd it will support html5

2578504
physx	gpu
the gpu is a simple geforce with physx cuda and opengl 2.1 support

2578523
checkbox	button
if i don t misunderstand your question you need not wrap the items in checkbox button etc in a form

selected	button
you populate the hidden form having some hidden variables with the user selected recording identifier and action you want to perform with help of javascript on button click

2578540
python	php
the site is to be hosted on a vps server.although i have pretty good experience with python and php but i have no idea how to use either of the framework

system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

2578605
32-bit	64bit
from googling i found this thread where a couple of other people have had the same problem and the solution is to use 64bit arithmetic instead of 32-bit arithmetic

2578615
object-reference	instances
the problem is i get a object-reference not set to an instances of an object error .when the object attempts to raise the event

2580489
versioning	upgrade
between ms anal strong-name implementation specifically the exact versioning checked before loading a given assembly a documented wix msi bug that sees critical files erased on upgrade essentially if a file in the upgrade msi has the same versioning numbers as the existing install that file is deleted edit having trouble producing said documentation... and having to work around wow64 virtualization x86 msi can only write to registry hd location via wow64 yet x64 msis cannot run on x86 computers... i am about ready to trash the whole thing and ports it over to a different install systemd

2580491
value	field
i am wondering since these 2 value are asp.net auto-generated hidden field used for the auto-postback feature of the framework and hold information specific to the controls initiating the postback is there really the potential for sql-injection if you are never manually calling and or pulling value out of these parameters in your code-behind

2580860
linux	unix
inorder to open a ports below 1024 on unix linux systemd you need to be

2580868
constructor	object
if you re constructor are expensive to execute then the object pool may be a good idea

2580978
any	set
is there any way of ensuring that it is still set in the object which has been unmarshalled

2580985
addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	addition
most compilers will go even further than reducing division by powers of 2 into shifts - they ll often convert integer-division by a constants into a series of multiplication shift and addition instructions to get the result instead of using the cpu s built-in divide instruction if there even is one

2580985
addition	division	multiplication	division	multiplication	addition
there s an online added chapter that provides some addition information about about division by constants using multiplication shift add with magic-numbers and a page with a little javascript program that ll calculate the magic-numbers you need

2581011
joomla	drupal
does anyone know some plugins for either joomla drupal or wordpress that can do the simple purpose above

2581012
selected	button
your page works correctly if you selected any of the first 4 radio button ans1 2 3 4

2581012
selected	button
but the rest of the radio button next to all those images have blank value which would explain why your posted value is-empty if you selected any of those to test with

2581013
value	field
jaxb should then use the getter-setter methods pairs to inject retrieve the data rather than the field and because setaddress adds the value to the set field that should work as you expect

2581030
checkbox	textbox
i have two checkbox and a textbox

2581030
checkbox	textbox
i want to textbox to have isenabled false if both checkbox have ischecked false

basic rules do not create object in constructor

2581042
contains	any
ant there it comes i expected the model to contains the new blank datetime because i didn t put any new data in

2581055
value	field
modelstate holds keyvaluepairs for every form elements with the key being the field named and the value is what you put in the field

2581059
attributes	properties
clearly my understanding of what value needs to be passed to the attributes properties of the settingsproperties class is wrong

2581059
attributes	properties
i m further confused by the fact that .when i iterate through all they key returned by settingsproperties.attributes.key i can see system.configuration.settingsdescriptionattribute but .when i pass that string in as the key to the attributes properties null is returned

2581061
.when	ready
the only other .approach i could think of is that each task runner makes a tcp connection to the server and registers it s interest then .when a new task is ready the web .app chooses a task runner and pushes the task down to that task runner to process

2581085
getter	setter
you should never put any logic in your dependency properties getter and setter except for the getvalue and setvalue call

2581085
callback	methods
a better approach is to add a callback methods using the dependencyproperty.register methods there is an overload to add a callback

2581132
contains	set
in a c# winforms 3.5 application i have added a class that contains many properties get set used to stored value from a 12 form long process

perl	php
markup perl gets you pretty close to php asp styles programming in perl

2581188
any	set
while there are ways that you could accomplish this both straight-forward create a methods that explicit resets all properties value and not straight-forward using reflection to find all properties and set their value i would not recommend any of those approaches for what it sounds like you re trying to accomplish

2581188
constructor	object
you could pass your data object between forms as a constructor arguments or as a public properties on each form

2581188
constructor	object
the mydataclass object is passed to each form as a constructor arguments

2581197
webforms	asp.net

2581268
python	php
if you don t know python nor php both offer very good examples and seem easy to use

2581270
fwrite	fread
in my opinion fread and fwrite are just adding a layer of confusion

2581276
value	field
in the item table is a field with nochange if this field true no tag is allowed to insert a itemtag value with this itemid

2581282

value	field
if you do want the public static field not sure if there is a good reason for that you can bind the types to its value like this

2581545
core-animation	uikit
as jeff7 and fendermostro said you re using the high-level api uikit and you d have better performance using the lower apis either core-animation or opengl

2581545

your best option would be to use calayer instead of uiimageviews get a cgimageref from your uiimage and set it as the contents for these layer

2581565
private-members	object
is there any considerations to determine which is better practice for creating an object with private-members

2581587

better in my opinion to put a few readonly public properties in the class .so that mapper can get access to the attributes they need

2581658
quicksort	mergesort	bubble-sort	quicksort	bubble-sort	mergesort
.when doing extreme optimizations you will likely find that in certain very special edges cases old and slow bubble-sort may win over a glorified quicksort or mergesort

2581662
display	width
as an example with .16le i can have an output like 1.0047914240730432e-002 which gives me 16 precision digits and the width of the field has the right width to display the numbers correctly

2581782
postgresql	mongodb
.when we had to make a choice between postgresqlql and mongodb in one of my jobs we compared query time on millions of recording in both and found out that with about 10m recording postgresql would provide us with adequate response time

2581782
postgresql	mongodb
we knew that we wouldn t get to that numbers of recording for at least a couple of years and we had experience with postgresql while mongodb wasn t very mature at the time .so we went with postgresql

2581805
istream	std
edit you can also use std istream ignore see

2581806
decrement	increment
now i can see that timepicker contains id decrement id increment and id timepicker_input

2582032
double	int
double has range more than a 64bit int but its precision is less dues to its representation since double is 64bit as well it can t fit more actual value

2582032
double	int
note how max int can fit into a double without loss of precision and boost intmax_t 64bit in this case cannot

2582036
disconnect	transfer
the connection is alive and well and heap of data is being transfer but it then becomes disconnect out of nowhere

2582044

2582228
persistent	transient
decide to persistent the transient field

2582228
persistent	transient
it doesn t really seem to be transient if you need it after merging the class into the persistent context

2582228
value	field	persistent	transient
maintain the value of the transient field outside of the persistent object

2582228
persistent	transient
one final thing the main use case i ve found for transient field on domain classes is to demarcate derived field field that can be recalculated based on the persistent field of the class

2582232
linked-list	arrays
if you want to operate arrays data after all elements had already insert or deleted there is a way that try to create a linked-list or arrayslist its simply resize after the data input is finished you can transfer the arrayslist to an arrays then do all the things you normally to arrays

2582604
postback	ajax
as an alternative to using updatepanel however i would recommend writing the client-side ajax functionality using jquery or .some other javascript-framework - the asp.net updatepanel is really just a standards asp.net postback using a rendering trick .so the screens doesn t have to be refreshed

2582613
highlight	selected
most of the time with asp..net server controls providing an out of box feature required creation of custom control by inheriteding from the original one.say for if you need sorting on all columns of gridview and also you need to highlight the currently selected column then its best done by creating your own control which inturn inherited from asp..net gridview control.there are resources on .net which explains on how this can be done

mongodb	couchdb
this article tries to evaluate kv-stores with document stores like couchdb riak mongodb

2582879
value	field
on submission of the form and re-creation of the field the newly generator control has the correct value by the end of onload but by onprerender it has assumed the identity of the submitted control and has been given the submitted form value

2582879
value	field
.net seems to have no way of detection the fact that the field was originally created in a disabled state and that the submitted value was faked

2582879
value	field
is there some way other than a brute force approach of detection that this field s value should not have been changed

2582882
any	set
os x also use ipfw and i m pretty sure it supersedes any rules set by the application filtering

2582894
jquery	.post

2583138
deprecated	javadoc
then look in the javadoc for the deprecated methods to

2583152
deprecated	javadoc
you can use any ide like eclipse which has a option of showing the deprecated methods while programming if you have attached the required javadoc for the classes which you are using

2583153
urlclassloader	classpath
this approach is tricky if you have a complicated classpath and impossible if your effective classpath include a urlclassloader with a remote url-for example

2583261
python	java
the current thinking is to add capabilites to jython itself to generator bytecode from py files and run those statically compiled items rather than jythonc s approach of making java classes that work like the base python code

2583261
python	java
turn python classes into java classes without a java interface or class using function annotations to specify the static java types information

2583261
python	java
statically compile proxy-classes for python classes that extends java classes

2583261
python	java
the example suggests special annotations for any methods in a python class that needs to be visible from java

order	add
this way any time you add a new orderitem it should be added via order object

2583388
for-loop	loops
while the benefits and shortcomings of this can be discussed to eternity the bottom line is that java is really sparse-matrix in syntactic-sugar in fact only syntactic-sugar in java i can think of is the enhanced for-loop and even then internally jvm knows only of while loops anyway

2583389
data-access	ado.net
my project is supposed to follow table gateway pattern using tradional ado.net dataset for data-access

you might want to take a look at the ado.net entity-framework - this exposes your data as strongly typed business-objects and allows you to building queries using strongly typed expression or linq queries

2583412
hash	tie
tie ixhash is a good module to store hash order but may be slow you will need to benchmarking if speed is important

2583416
udp	tcp
there are many choices http tcp udp jms xml-rpc rmi corba c rpc or flash-drives carried by .post pigeons

2583699
configuration-files	web-config
configuration-files will be an ideal place for keeping the details about the database credential.but if you are worried about its security as its stored in plain text then in asp.net you can encrypt a particular section of your web-config file.encyption can be done either by making use of aspnet_regiis.exe utility by providing relevant command-line arguments.otherwise encryption can also be done through code with the help of web-configurationmanager class.also you donâ t need to unprotect a section inorder to read the configuration settings in that section the runtime will perform the decryption necessary for your application to read the plain text value

2583718
subclassing	base-class

you should definitely have a look at the wcf-configuration editor tool to give you a hand at configuring your wcf service

2584982
directory	folder
same as above but a little tweak create a helpers class to fetch all classes inside the model folder by using the directory iterator then append model_ at the beginning of each result to get the actual model named

2584982
directory	folder
this may fail given additional directory inside the model folder

2585010
margins	padding
but since most things that you would want to wipe are going to be related to fonts text color or margins padding you could take care of most issues with a few simple rules

contains	elements
this nodes class would contains an elements of types t where t is the generics parameter and a reference to the next nodes of types

2585169
doubly-linked-list	nodes
in case of a doubly-linked-list the nodes would also contains a reference to the previous nodes

2585169
linked-list	nodes

scala	java
both java and scala have new challenges for a php programmer jvm new libs compiled language statically typed

2585400
scala	java

textbox	button
.when i enter the textbox i can tell that the first button will be used .when i press enter because it is a bit dark-blue-bordered then

2585523
textbox	button
.so my second thought was that there must be a possibility to tell the browser which button should defaultly react for an enter press .when i m in a specific textbox the dark-blue-bordered button

2585524
any	set
.when the location is set then onlocationchanged is fired .so you don t need to poll any variables

2585529
interpreter	runtime
hotspot dynamically switchinges back and forth between the interpreter and one of the compilers at runtime but it will not switching between the two compilers you have to specify one of them on the command-line and then only that one will be used for the entire runtime of the jvm

2585529
arguments	default
you selected between the two by specifying the -client and -server command-line options -client is the default if you don t specify one which also sets a couple of other jvm parameters like the default jit threshold in -client mode methods will be compiled after they have been interpreter 1500 time in -server mode after 10000 time can be set with the -xx compilethreshold command-line arguments

2585529
linux	unix	linux	osx	linux	bsd	unix	bsd
my guess is that the vast majority of desktop users run the hotspot jvm from oracle s jre jdk or one of its fork .soylatte on osx icedtea or openjdk on unix bsd linux and they don t fiddle with the command-line options .so they will probably get the c1 compiler with the default 1500 jit threshold

the problem is in that img loading.gif and safari on winxp in firefox and ie i have no problems and i clearly see the animated-gif

2585759
constructor	object
this means that the string field need to have either initializer in their declarations or they need to be set in all the constructor for the object

2585759
any	set
obviously this can be set to null at any time and there s nothing you can do about that

2585763
revision	updates
you make an updates to an entity and create a matching updates scripting revision to updates your database-schema to reflect the entity change

2585795

returns the numbers of mouse click associated with this event

2585818
methodology	paradigms
a methodology such as agile dsdm etc how is oo classed as a methodology and a paradigms

2585818
methodology	paradigms
whats the difference between a paradigms and a methodology or a development pattern

2585836
constructor	private
if a class has a private constructor then it can t be initializer

2585836
constructor	private
what is the use of a private constructor

2585838
any	set
the process would be set up to ignore any file ending in .processing .so that they don t step on each other

2585840
constructor	object
if this still doesn t make any sense you should probably read a bit more about constructor in object oriented languages for example here

2585846
any	set
if you want the last option to apply .when j is any value other than 0 1 2 then you have to checked for that and set it to 3 before this code

2585856
constructor	private	instances	private
private constructor can be useful .when using a factory-pattern in other words a static function that s used to obtain an instances of the class rather than explicit-instantiation

2585856
constructor	private
any nested classes that inherited from the outer class can access the private constructor

2585856
constructor	private	instances	private
for instances you can use this to create an abstract-class that you can inherited from but no one else an internal constructor would also work here to restrict inheriteded to a single assembly but the private constructor forces all implementation to be nested classes.

2585857
lambda-calculus	paradigms
a paradigms is a way of thinking about a problem - .so object a relational-database lambda-calculus are all model for getting a problem into your head

2585857
methodology	paradigms
a methodology is a way of actualy building something based on the paradigms

2585860
base-class	inherited
adding base parameter after the constructor allows you to call the constructor of the base-class the class your class inherited from with the parameter passed into your class constructor

2585870
constructor	private
if the class only has private constructor it cannot be initializer from outside

2585870
constructor	private
you can also have private constructor and public constructor with different signature

2585879

then i tried to do extends domnodes to implements the same methods .so i can perform an xpath query directly on a nodes

2585880
constructor	private	instances	private
a static methods can call the private constructor to create a new instances of that class

2585882
exception-handling	try-catch
if you expect exception-handling to happen in the converter and this is ok for the application you must have a try-catch within the converter the following code sample will return null for failed conversions

2585890
constructor	private
if you want to create a factory for a class you can use a private constructor and add some static factory methods to the class itself to create the class

2585894
processor	affinity
to specify processor affinity for a thread use the processthread.processoraffinity methods

2585900
python	c++	any	set
finally the other set of options is not to use a runtime and to simply compile an .app from any language development-environment you like - c++ .net python anything

2585902
constructor	private
as stefan adam and other have pointed out private constructor are useful in cases where it is undesirable for a class to be created by code outside of the class

2585902
static-classes	inherited
there are also cases where you may want to create an inherited hierarchy in which one or more of the leaf classes are singleton - this is not possible with static-classes either

2585903

but .when i resize it until the horizontal scrollbar is activated the content of the hidden div will be show at the end of the page .when the tooltip is activated

2585948
pascal	delphi
in our case we detection the buggy vpn drivers and swap out move and fillchar with the delphi 7 versioninging replace inttostr with a pascal versioning int64-versioning uses the fpu and since we re using fastmm we disable its custom fixed size move routines too since they re even more susceptible than system.move

updates i am looking for something that can run from windows-xp up to windows 7 no matter what versioning of .net is install

2586032
value	field
it will have a similar effect as disabling the field but without the need to store the value to a hidden-field

2586033
keydown	keyup
basically you will have to keep the states pressed or release of the key you are interested and change them .when you receive a keydown or keyup event

2586050
contains	set
have a look at - this is a way of process a delimited input variables to give a results set contains the split items by joining against a numbers tally table which is a good thing to have in the database anyway if you haven t yet

2586052
javascript	dom
the extra javascript code would collect the information in the table either from the dom you ve built or by accessing the same data you used .when building the table into a string which can then be sent to the server using one of standards ways

2586054
google-chrome	firefox
i m using a tooltip that works in firefox google-chrome and ie7-8 but in ie6 it doesn t appear

loading	png
now we re dealing with some legacy images and it appears as though this problem isn t universal - some images believed to be 32-bit alpha png are loading

2586059
keydown	keyup
there should exist a keyup-event as well and by using both keydown and keyup you can achieve the effect you re looking for

2586059
keydown	keyup
one would be to let your keydown event initiate a repeat action and let keyup cancel it

2586059
keydown	keyup
keep a list of key and toggle them on .when keydown and off on keyup

if .so which ones should i add and in which order

2586195
wgs84	gps
it has also been mirrored by mysociety which include conversion to wgs84 co-ordinates those used by gps devices from which it would then be fairly trivial to calculate the great-circle distance between the two points - trivial enough that it could be part of a sql query if you have the points in a database

2586199
communication	messages
how should my application communication with the messages broker and the database

2586199

32-bit	64bit
the address is somewhere in 32-bit spaces for most systemd or 64bit spaces for newer systemd

2586558
mapping	unique
prelink on linux works by creating a unique address spaces mapping for each .so in the paths you give it

2586558

2586605
callback	methods
the advantage of the first methods is among others that you can do a lot more inside the callback than just putting the content into an elements

2586614
any	set
is there any qt widget that allows us to manipulate with picture and text simultaniously and it has set get functions which operate with serialization types

2586617

3 .when request goes to asp.net-mvc engine the router module routes the request that is picked up by the controllers

2586623
methodology	paradigms
looking at only one of the questions you asked ...how is oo classed as a methodology and a paradigms

2586623
methodology	paradigms
edit how i d separate methodology from paradigms is fairly simple at least in theory

2586627
jquery	.post

superclass	inherited
the interface is usually the better choice as client classes can implements any amount of interfaces but they can only one have one superclass inherited is a scarce resource as they put it

2586669
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
an example would be the collections api with list being an interface - usually .when you use a list you don t really care if it s saving stuff in an arrays or in a linked-list of nodes or in some other kind of way

2586669
implements	extends
then we have abstractlist an abstract-class implements list which provides implementation of almost everything a fully-fledged list needs - to create your own list implementation all you have to do is extends abstractlist and fill in a few methods

2586675
directory	folder
.so instead of pasting them into the directory via explorer use visual-studio to paste the files into the folder

in fact most of the examples on the web that i ve seen demonstrate mspec with some kind of nunit dependancy or integration

2586912
nunit	mspec
my team is attempting to use mspec without nunit on a new asp.net mvc2 project

2586912
nunit	mspec
are there benefits to using mspec with nunit

2587094
callback	methods
you need to keep the length of your entered string every time your wait methods is called by the html textbox callback

2587101
linux	osx
the gitignore file is project-specific but shared between developers iow there should only be things in there that are common for all developers working with the code including ones that use osx linux instead of windows and eclipse intellij or notepad as editor and that are specific to the project

2587113
primitive	int
i suspect the decision to use primitive value for int and reals done for performance reasons made that option not possible

2587113
python	ruby
note that python and ruby both do what you ask

2587140
copy-constructor	temporary
note the unusual form of copy-constructor from a non-const reference which prevents by standards gcc is correct the ability to copy-construct an instances from a temporary the result-of make

2587184
selected	button
i have fiiled dropdownlistfor in javascript using ajax service but unable to get its selected value in button click event on server side

2587189

2587194
virtualbox	bootcamp
al.so with bootcamp you have to reboot the machine to switching between windows and os x .so virtualbox is the way to go

2587197
callback	methods
the interesting thing to points out there is that .when i put a window.alert debug1 messages in the addclosehandler methods it does run the callback below but as soon as i remove it the callback doesn t happen

2587201
triggers	insert	required	checked
you can always create a triggers that checked the required conditional before insert

2587220
or-operator	operands
the logical or-operator || has a similar behavior it will return the value of the second operands if the first one is falsy

2587228

2587297
nunit	mspec
mspec does not depend in any way on nunit or xunit.net

2587297
nunit	mspec
what you can do although it s neither required nor do i see any benefit in doing it is to use nunit s assert libs assert.istrue et al. together with mspec

2587307
.when	ready
approach we make sure the image will be ready in the browser s caching and thus immediately available .when needed

2587331

in particular note the last line in addition this implementation quarters this amount. i take that to mean that the division by four is in fact entirely arbitrary

2587332
ruby	php
there are amf libs for all languages php ruby java python..it s not that hard to switching over and it will improve the performance of you .app

2587342
entity	poco
this is because you can always project your entity types onto poco instances using linq without having to materialize the entity instances first

2587346
json	xml
this works fine for json xml endpoint but the i don t know how to use a soap endpoint with this setup because the generator wsdl doesn t include field that are not in the service call parameter list

2587368
document-ready	.when
but .when i bind the event with a function that takes an arguments the event fires on document-ready and onclientclick

2587368
.when	ready
this causes an alert box to fire on ready and .when the button is click

2587376
switching	screens
if the users are spending a majority of their time on one screens and don t commonly want to switching to the other screens the tabbar may be a bit of overkill

2587406
subtract	time
you don t need a nested loops you just need to change the value you subtract from y each time

2587419
boolean	int
.when you pass a lambda to sort you need to return an int not a boolean

2587423
native-code	unmanaged
we tried going with .net and the watin libs but it was built on a marshalling ie and .so it lacked many features that we hacked in with call to unmanaged native-code but at the end of the day ie is not thread safe nor process safe and many of the needed features could only be implements by changing registry value and it was just terribly unflexible

2587423
javascript	dom
javascript support- we have to be able to parsing the actual dom after any javascript has execute and hopefully an event is raised to handle any ajax call

2587423
any	set
ability to set headers and alter postdata for any browser call

2587423
python	c++	python	ruby
languages acceptable c++ c# python anything that can be a simple little background application that is somewhat bearable and doesn t have a completely untraditional syntax like ruby

2587440
puts	gets
maybe use a sleep function after puts and gets to give the transactional time to finish and see if that makes a difference

2587442
value	field
i am trying to write a function in java that returns a unique hash value long needs to be the return-type of hash for the above field

2587453
debugging	trace
updates i switched on the log4net internal debugging and found the following error in the trace

2587480
triggers	insert
2 create a triggers that validation your logic and causes invalid insert updates to fail

2587489
execute	prepare
you have no error checked on the prepare execute call .so there s no way to tell if either spit out an error

2587518
background-color	transparency
would i just make a background-color transparency

2587569
haxe	mxml
for this simple application i would suggest using haxe since it is free and easy to use for simple swfs no mucking about with mxml etc

2587576
put	get
it s inside a bigger arrays i need to get the first and second hef attributes seperatly .so that i can put one href as a link and another with a

2587590
binaries	install
i m not sure if ssis has to be install as a component though or just the general binaries

2587598
highlight	cell
if i click on a cell item that cell item is linked or related to other cell items which need to be highlight

2587613
typedef	struct
the header has a typedef struct and a numbers of function declarations

textchanged	textbox
you can assign an event handler to each of the textbox s textchanged events

2587644
defined	declare
partials-classes are only allowed for classes that are both declare partials in all files and defined in the same assembly

2587645
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i have an asp.net-mvc web application that will be using wcf service for everything including authentication and roles via membership providers on the wcf backend

2587656
reflection	runtime
i think if you do some digging and hacking you can make it work with reflection to extends the class since reflection allows to add functions or swap function bodies at runtime

2587679
display	height
how can i fix this issue .so that .when myid starts to display content height of the .box resize itself to fit the inner div

2587682
arrays	loops
if you try iterator over a two-dimensional arrays in a foreach loops you ll find that you iterate over each item across both dimension not just one dimension

2587686
decrement	increment
it is a contrived program that increment one elements decrement another and toggle a third elements

2587686
decrement	increment
after that since the data is in big endian format .when i increment decrement and toggle the value are incorrect

2587689
slideshow	loading
i want to make sure that at least the 2 or 3 first images are loaded before the slideshow starts and meanwhile i want to run a loading animated-gif then i want to fadein the first image

2587691
implements	extends
create a custom class mypanel that extends htmlpanel and implements hasclickhandlers

2587692
click	mouse
depth of call chaining is also a factors - some older browsers only look at the immediate caller newer browsers can backtracking a little to see if the caller s caller was a mouse click etc

2587699
protected	public
also you might consider following the proper .net event pattern of making the event public calling a protected virtual-methods named onwhateveryoureventisnamedd and in that methods invoking the event with this and a new eventargs

2587709
shell	bash
i was wondering if there is a way to automatically run cmd on entering the python shell as you would with the .bash_profile or .profile scripting with bash

2587716
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
the part before the #include stdafx.h line is actually explainable given that the file is actually compiled everything before and including that line is ignore if precompiled-headers are enabled which is the default

2587757
stop-words	nlp
and i know it s pretty trivial to code it sill i d like to use .some nlp domain specific tool .so i get stop-words trimmed etc

2587769
firefox	gecko
from the site geckofx is an open-source component which makes it easy to embed mozilla gecko firefox into any .net windows forms application

2587770
getter	setter
however it s a good idea not to add any listener unnecessarily and it s also a good idea to keep any sort of business-logic out of getter setter but that s strictly for the sake of code legibility

2587780
python	java
are there any freertos project that interpreter java python or similar bytecode

2587781
contains	any	contains	elements
a user-controls contains a single root elements into which you place all of its user-interface and this elements which is usually a grid but can actually be any frameworkelements is normally named layoutroot

2587789
directory	folder
assuming your server has mod_rewrite enabled you should be able to put this inside a .htaccess in the root folder of your site inside a directory or virtualhost section

2587795
qtablewidgetitem	qtablewidget
i m using qtablewidget as view widget and qtablewidgetitem as items

2587797
shell	bash
if you want you can give me a bash scripting as osx can handle sh bash and some other shell i think

2587799
copy-constructor	constructor
furthermore before you reach the constructor in this case a copy-constructor the memory has already been allocated .so there s no need to allocate it again which is what it appears you are trying to do here

2587806
selected	checkbox
i am using the jquery validation plugins and i want the user to selected no more or less than two of these checkbox

2587806
selected	checkbox
if possible i also want the other checkbox to become deactivated unclickable after two have been selected

2587809
arrays	map
what you want is .so simple that in most languages i would suggest you roll your own .solution using an arrays of hashtable that map from strings to int

2587821
alt	src
html5 says that both src and alt must be present

2587821
background-color	transparency	background-color	border-color
to answer the question as posed you can only set background-color and border-color to the transparency value

2587821
alpha	rgba
in css3 you could use an rgba colour with its alpha channel set to 0 but don t expect support from ie

2587830
populate	row
now if i add a row with datacolumn1 being null and datacolumns 2 and 3 populate and try to serialization it it works

2587832
uiscrollview	subviews
i have a view within a uiscrollview that loads an additional subviews .when the user presses a certain area

2587873
php-extension	imagick
if that doesn t do the next step is using imagick either through the command-line or through the appropriate php-extension

2587876
any	set
i ve tried to make it as simple as possible to set up but basically in each slider you can create a div in any way you like

2587880
extends	sealed
since it is a sealed class how will you extends it into factory

2587893
32-bit	64bit
.so instead of storing 32-bit in stack in the object or anywhere else we use them we store 64bit for example and use the additional 32-bit to control whether we want a reference or a literals

2587893
32-bit	64bit
basically on modern hardware it is preferable to store stuff in 32-bit increment for performance rea.sons .so we ll be padding 40 bits to 64bit anyway

2587919
linux	unix
derived from the unix or linux real userid or the windows userid

2587923
instrumentation	profiling
if you enable full profiling of the application by line the instrumentation performed by aqtime will be .so heavy and the data collected .so much it will slow down your application a lot

2587955
triggers	insert
essentially a triggers will scale a lot better compared to your current methods because instead of having to perform a lookup to find the last updates recording you can just perform the insert operation then directly insert the primary key of the new recording into the last updates table

2587980
hide	show
i m using a bit growing to a lot of jquery to hide some images and show a single image .when a thumb is click

2587985
where-clause	sql
the where-clause of a sql query is looking for a true false result from the and or logic

2587991
logging	trace
in that case you should temporary enable trace logging on your service

2587996
environment	building
this hasn t happened yet but it could happen that in the future we write a versioning of c# that say is for building device drivers in an environment that has different garbage collector semantics than the standards clr semantics

2587996
derived-class	base-class
they must ensure that base-class finalize are called strictly after derived-class finalize

2588004
openerp	tryton
tryton might also be a starting points it s gpl3 and iirc a fork of openerp

2588024

2588071
erlang	scheme
according to the computer language benchmarking game the luajit implementation seems to beat every other jit-ed dynamic-languages v8 tracemonkey plt scheme erlang hipe by an order of magnitude

2588075
rollback	commit
this will result in a statement within a second transactional that would that could inviolate the constraint blocking till the first transactional commit or rollback

2588080
while-loop	infinite
also if you wanted to get rid of the tail -f you could do what i listed in the first instances in an infinite while-loop syntax might be wrong been a while

2588111
panels	grid
i m trying to building a simple panels that contains one child and will snap it to nearest grid sizes

2588111
put	get	panels	grid
.when i put my panels inside of a grid i get either 0 or positiveinfinity i forget for the incoming size in the overrides but what i need to know is how big can my spaces actually get

2588118
vb.net	vb6
i have a vb6 application that needs to communication with a vs2008 vb.net wcf server

2588118
vb.net	vb6
i have built a vb.net wcf dll to be used on the client side and it --almost-- works with the vb6 application

2588118
vb.net	vb6
.when i try to run the vb6 .app in debugging mode i get could not find endpoint elements with named nettcpbinding_icomportmanager and contract icomportmanager in the servicemodel client configuration section. using a dummy vb.net client .app with the same wcf dll works fine

2588122
stanford-nlp	opennlp
you could try the stanford-nlp java package or opennlp

2588122
jflex	cup
use jflex to scan the input and tokenize and cup to create a grammar if you want to handle more input

2588127
key-value	key
i was thinking of creating a master resx key-value list where the key would be the fully qualified named of the control variables constants etc

2588177
json	xml
the points above about no completely foolproof one-one mapping are valid but i have had a good experience with converting xml to json using the above libs

2588190
ruby	php
i ve been a php developer for a few years now and i ve recently been interested in learning ruby ruby-on-rails but i ve found a lot of the resources i ve found seem to be dated and not for ruby-on-rails 2.0 or ruby 1.8.6 etc.

2588194
javascript	dom
you can add a tag to the dom which points at a javascript file on another domain

2588194
contains	set
if this javascript file contains some javascripton data that you can use you re all set

2588195
pointers	stack
push the current program positioning onto stack then .when you reach test the data pointers

2588202
visualvm	yourkit
for profiling you can use visualvm yourkit etc

2588229
append	input
i m trying to checked if a form input has any value doesn t matter what the value is .so that i can append the value to the action url on submit if it does exist

2588231
textbox	button
on your click event for the submit button include some if then statements that checked all of the textbox to see if they have acceptable value

2588278
getter	setter
the getter and setter map the nid field to the id field

2588284
click	mouse
jpanel can listen to key presses keylistener mouse click mouselistener and mouse movements mousemovementlistener

2588302
triggers	insert
based on the creation of a triggers you know what some of the context delete insert updates

2588319
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
use existing core exception-handling where appropriate argumentexception invalidoperationexception etc

2588329
revision	svn
i m looking for a simple tool that would enable me to add custom comments to svn revision

2588332
cakephp	django
now suppose a customer has some other framework like django or cakephp and i want to provide the functionality offered by my gem eg

2588332
cakephp	django
could i .somehow make it .so they could interface my gem with django or cakephp

2588338
entity	poco
i have not exposed the generator linq classes as datacontract i ve instead created my own viewmodel as a poco for each entity i am going to be returning

2588342
callback	methods
i forget the named of the constructor methods on activerecord classes or if there is a callback to leverage here

2588374
checkbox	textbox
.so .when anyone click on the textbox i want to checkbox to get checked

2588376
modifiers	final
the only thing you should count here is that you should use final modifiers near button declaration due to java doesn t have real closures

2588378
stateless	stateful
we started a discussion about stateful or stateless web-services for this approach

2588383
.when	ready
you can turn drupal commenting off with the press of a button and if .when you decide to add onto your website perhaps you want an ad rotator more extensive user-permissions etc etc it is all already developed for you and ready to go

2588399
default-value	default
i have a database column defined as nvarchar 1000 not null default n - in other words a non-nullable text column with a default-value of blank

2588402
updating	updates
also be sure that is actually matching on the users you re updating if it s not it won t updates any rows

2588404
attributes	properties
it seems that the width and height attributes determine the width or height of the canvas s coordinate systemd whereas the css properties just determine the size of the box in which it will be show

2588409
exception-handling	try-catch
you add a try-catch block to your code and ignore the error or you .post the entire exception-handling messages .so that we can help you .solve the actual problem

2588413
contains	any
within inrules we could configurationure pretty much have any task for example our sql-scriptings and stored-procedures where all part of a separate rules configuration file i am wondering if there is a similar functionality within windows work flow where i could just call a declarative task and pass it a bunch of parameters â this task should contains the sql scripting i would be execution we should be able to change the scripting at runtime without recompilation to the wf code

2588424
32-bit	64bit
can i use something like py2exe from 32-bit vista or would i have to have to make the executable from a 64bit machine with pyqt 64bit install

2588425
selected	button
you can make the popover disappear without selected an item if you tap anywhere outside the popover but i would also like to make it disappear if the user taps the button again

2588425
hide	show
or would i have to write an action that show hide the popover myself behavior that s being done behind the scenes presumably by the split view controllers now

2588426
lgpl	gpl
i m looking for an open source gpl lgpl etc graphing layout libs for .net preferably fully managed-code

2588433
attributes	properties
you just need to hide that properties from the serialization using the xmlignore attributes and serialization a xmldictionaryentrycollection instead

2588448
checkbox	textbox
.so .when anyone click on the textbox i want to checkbox to get checked

2588460
32-bit	x86
you should be able to compile to the 32-bit x86 and include 32-bit pyqt binaries and all will be well

2588462
textbox	button
i just want every button inside the mwindow to get a special styles and in time every textbox and .so forth

2588470
push	pull
pull push to remote git

2588472
32-bit	64bit
which operation i.e a 32-bit operation or a 64bit operation like masking a 32-bit flag or a 64bit flag would be cheaper on a 64bit machine

2588473
selected	button
.when you navigate to the homepage a choose a digital-certificate dialog is display and required that you selected a valid certificate and click the ok button

2588475
uiscrollview	subviews
the problem that you are having is not that you need the superview to invoke touchesmoved on the subviews but rather that uiscrollview subverts the normals responder chaining hierarchy by intercepting touch-events inorder to deliver a smooth-scrolling experience to the user

2588479
annotations	mapping
annotations based mapping is a different story though

2588479
abstract-class	base-class	base-class	inherited
.so you may need to experiment including changing your inherited mapping strategy maybe turning the interface into an abstract-class if it s possible - since a class can only extends a single base-class .

2588497
command-line	cmd
i am receiving ip-address as command-line arguments for my tcl scripting and trying to updates cmd with recvd ip value

2588500
updating	updates
.when the user click the save button i want to triggers a linq updates to the sql server...all the rows already exist .so i m just updating existing data

2588511
32-bit	64bit
generally speaking a 64bit operation or a 32-bit operation would have the same cost

2588511
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit operation might end up taking an extra instruction depending on if the compiler needed to ensure that the upper 32-bit of a 64bit register was cleared or sign-extended but that operation generally has little cost

2588511
difference	factors
there might be some difference in instruction encoding that might make one take more spaces than the other but that and which way the advantage would lie would depend on a numbers of factors

2588516
32-bit	64bit
loading 64bit of data from memory will generally be slower than loading 32-bit of data -- but if you re using more than 32 flags you ll have to load more than 32-bit of data anyway and handling the masking in one cycle will improve speed over doing it in two or three instructions

2588519
windows-xp	windows
i ve a asp.net-mvc 2 project that runs fine under windows 7 and will start on windows-xp if i use the visual-studio development server however starting under iis generator an error

2588533
if-statement	for-loop
can t go much simpler that one for-loop and no if-statement

2588535
eventhandler	behavior
inorder for the same behavior i must al.so include the eventhandler from josh smith s relaycommand within commandreference but in doing .so i must comment out .some code from within the oncommandchanged methods

2588539
variables	boolean
you could set a boolean variables to represent whether the accordion is open or not and just checked it onclientclick

2588539
variables	boolean
set a boolean global variables outside the click event like this

2588551
exponentiation	modulo	exponentiation	exponent	exponent	modulo
to give just a very rough estimate on the speed of this montgomerys reduction i have an old benchmarking that performs a modular exponentiation with 64bit modulo and exponent in 1600 ns on a 2.4ghz core 2

2588551
multiplication	exponentiation
this exponentiation does about 96 modular multiplication and modular reductions and hence needs about 40 cycles per modular multiplication

2588564
triggers	insert
triggers on transactional table to dump all insert updates deletes to an audit table

2588584
android-emulator	adb
in all cases the integration is the same whether you re using a physical device or software android-emulator because the adb daemons conceals the details

2588584
android-emulator	adb
if you have a device and android-emulator connect simultaneously you can use adb -e logcat for the android-emulator and adb -d logcat for the device

2588584
android-emulator	ddms
from stand-alone ddms or eclipse just pick the device or android-emulator from the popup menu

2588586
administration	account
to reduce the chance that this is related to permissions we have given the launchd account administration rights as well as non-administration rights in case that made a difference

2588612
buildpath	libs
what i did to get an outside jar include in my package was to right click the package named in the navigation menu eclipse - then selected buildpath - then add libs

2588626
32-bit	64bit
that is the processor may need to fetch 64bit regardless and then mask shift off 32-bit of it to load a 32-bit value

2588626
32-bit	64bit
alternatively if the bus can handle half-width fetches then 32-bit may be loaded in the same time as a 64bit value

2588626
32-bit	64bit
the proces.sor hardware is optimised for dealing with 64bit value .so calculating value using 32-bit may cause it more trouble and thus could slow things down

2588626
32-bit	64bit
it might be able to process a double 64bit value natively but have to convert a float 32-bit value into a double before it can process it then convert the result back to a float afterwards

2588626
32-bit	64bit
alternatively there may be 32-bit and 64bit paths through the cpu or the cpu may be able to do any conversions required in a way that does not affect the overall execution-time of the instruction in which case they may be calculated at the same speed

2588645
rounding	currency
i am seeing an intriguing situation rounding currency in c# vs 2008 sp1

2588651
selected	button
i want the submit button to be enabled only if a file has been selected

2588658
contains	elements
i m trying to use the jquery function to iterate through an arrays and if there s an elements whose text contains a particular keyword remove that elements

2588712
compatibility	legacy
afaik command.com exists for legacy compatibility .so applications you run from it will run differently

2588725
contains	elements
removes all elements from the tokens parameter which contains the string passed in in the search parameter

2588725
contains	elements
would remove all elements which contains the search string with case ignore

2588734
rhino-mocks	moq
not sure if anyone is interested but i have translation the moq fakehttpcontext to one using rhino-mocks my weapon of choice

2588744
selected	checkbox
.when .someone is looking for a per.son to hire they enter one or more area codes to look in or selected them with checkbox and .when the form submit it saves these as a cookies .so the site remembers what location you were searching in

2588751
directory	folder
it may map to a different folder in other languages but as long as you get the directory from the environment variables and not hardcode it then it doesn t really make a difference

2588780
margins	padding
this is pretty rudimentary because it doesn t respect things like margins and padding but those probably aren t essential for you right now

2588791
attributes	properties
this can be configure in odbc data sources in odbc connection attributes or oledb connection properties

2588811
logout	login
the most robust way would be storing the timestamp in a database since the client could simply logout login or trash the session delete cookies or restart webbrowser to obtain a new session

2588826
attributes	properties
i ve racked my brain trying to figure out how to pass public properties that are populate in an attributes to the controllers and i can t get it

2588836
contains	elements
something like this usually works which will clear both left and right floats and pad out your contains elements

2588838
click	mouse
unfortunately the margins capture the mouse events and don t provide a way from what i can see to get the click information - numbers of click mouse button click etc

2588856
ubuntu	linux
go get virtualbox and create an ubuntu or fedora image or whatever other flavor of linux you may prefer and use that for development

2588863
inherited	accessor
alternatively keep the member variables private but add a protected accessor methods to allow classes that inherited base to add to the vector etc

2588865
protected	public
another option is to create a public or protected constructor in base that will take the parameters and populate the vector directly

2588872
qtablewidgetitem	qtablewidget
assuming that the qtablewidget is enabled you just set the correct flags on the qtablewidgetitem

2588878
listboxitem	selected
everytime .when listboxitem is selected the border s background should be changed

2588890
32-bit	64bit
unfortunately the way macports buildinging python bypasses those fixed .so there does not appear to be any simple way to force a macports python2.6 32- 64bit universal building on 10.6 to run in 32-bit mode

2588927
oembed	feed
i m using the jquery oembed plugins to display videos from a vimeo feed

2588930
data-access	nhibernate
.when execution an nservicebus handler that uses nhibernate for its data-access operations i am seeing an error that i am not sure if i need to be concerned with

2588964
subtract	time
it would have an input date range and then allow subtract partially or completely intersection time range splice from that date range and the result would be the numbers of minutes or the fractions multiple of a day left in the original date range after subtract out the various non-working time splice

2588966
keyboard	mouse
i know that you can write javascript and do it yourself but do any keyboard key shortcuts already exist without using the mouse

2588974
derived-class	base-class	protected	public
if you want the containers in the base-class to remain private you might consider adding a public or protected function in base to allow the derived-class to add a range

2588974
protected	public
and as zdan suggested this functionality could be part of public or protected constructor for base if that makes more sense which is likely

2588977
highlight	selected
i have been trying to figure out how to highlight the selected row in a table

2588997
udp	tcp
instead you can use udp and implements your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp

2589011
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
this is less of an issue in python than in perl since perl and i believe ruby by default will automatically create a variables and initializer it to zero or on its first use

2589035
contains	any
if the page reload after a submission then the whole javascript scripting will be reload as well therefore any variables contains any kind of data will be reset to the default-value

2589047
json	xml
what about an xml file json

2589050
put	get	key-value	key
key-value systemd basically support get put and delete operations based on a primary key

2589050
json	xml
document-oriented systemd store structured document such as json or xml but have no join join must be handled within your application

2589052
radio-button	selected
i have two forms one with a radio-button that users must selected to edit

2589052

i want to uncheck the radio-button on form a .when user click on cancel button editbtncancel in form b

2589070
istream	ostream
should i open - write - close every time i want to write to ostream and thus to the ftp and can i then expect a reply hasbytesavailable event on istream

2589072
zipfile	archive
you can take another step of compression the bin folder into an archive like a zipfile to make it easy for the user to extraction them or you could use a tool like wix or nsis to create an install to extraction and copy the files

2589074
handler	service
i ran the service as a fastcgi based handler for apache2 w mod_fcgid

2589083
implements	abstract
defined in the event class an abstract description properties having each child class implements it

2589097
value	field
the user would then click on the correct employer and then the correct employer value would be populate in the original parent windows employer field

2589107
subclassing	inherited
enums are good for a fixed set of options - in your case you want the flexibility of inherited .so just use subclassing directly

2589129
calloc	malloc
short answer change your innermost malloc to a calloc

2589136
joomla	drupal
after all drupal joomla and other php web-frameworks are in fact complete applications they re just targeted towards the developer community

2589142
uilabel	uiview
i have a nib with a uiview that contains some uilabel uibarbuttonitem etc

2589142
uitableview	uiview
i want the uitableview in the uiviewcontroller to be positioning below my uiview but whenever i add it in interface-builder it takes up the whole screens and my uiview becomes part of the uiviewcontroller

2589142
uitableview	uiview
how can i make sure the uitableview in my uiviewcontroller appears below the uiview

2589146
abstract-class	base-class
i have an abstract-class base-class with a public insert methods

2589149
sql-server	oracle
can a modern rdbms sql-server 2008 oracle db2 cope with the volume and complexity i have describe given an appropriate amount of hardware or are we in the realm of technologies like google s bigtable

2589159
.when	ready
.when you re ready to plot the graphing load the file up and plot the graphing

2589173
base-class	inherited
in the end if you inherited a methods that does not make sense for your child class it could be that you really shouldn t inherited from that base-class at all

2589173
instances	private
another route to look at might be composition where your class has a private instances of what used to be the base-class and you can choose which methods to expose by wrapping them in your own methods

2589178
sql-server	mysql
it s quite easy to interface c# with sql-server there s a free versioning called express edition or mysql and storing and retrieving huge amounts of data is not a pain

2589184
csv	xml	export	csv
my question is what would be the quickest way to export the data and in what file-format gpx xml csv to the sd-card located on the android device

2589189
32-bit	16-bit
um your tag indicates 32-bit but it looks like the value that you re using are 16-bit

2589218
show	next
.so next time they visit their .profile page they are show the resize image

2589223
google-chrome	gecko	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	gecko
this handles webkit safari google-chrome etc gecko firefox and khtml konqueror

2589232
contains	any
passing a variables contains a function pointers to a different function works the same as passing any other variables

2589239
order	add
in the case of delete top .. you can t add an order by .so you should use a where-clause which uniquely identifies the row s to be deleted as you have done in your first example

2589248
void-pointers	dereference
you need to dereference void-pointers like any other

2589257
aspect-ratio	scale
compare the aspect-ratio of the screens with the aspect-ratio of the image then scale the image appropriately

2589257
aspect-ratio	scale
for example if the aspect-ratio width height of the screens is larger than the aspect-ratio of the image then it s too wide - .so scale the width of the image but keep the height the same size as the viewport

2589282
contains	set
with regards to sets and uniqueness the data in the list will likely contains a member specifying positioning along a time line given that is one of the main selection criterion using the term set might be misleading as there is no guaranteed uniqueness regarding positioning along the time line - that is events can occur simultaneously

2589302
click	mouse
it may have to do with the way i click maybe a very fast double click gets sent or maybe i very slightly drag the mouse .when click the tab

2589304
oracle	mysql
mysql doesn t have a function like oracle s initcap - you have to create the function yourself

2589325
filtering	sorting
actually if the task really is about users finding files of a particular size range sorting or filtering the list by file size by default or as a user option is probably the best solution

2589327
substitution	replace
you may wish to read up on the liskov substitution principles the idea that as wikipedia puts it if s is a subtyping of t then object of types t in a program may be replace with object of types s without altering any of the desirable properties of that program

2589343
colorbox	jquery
you can use colorbox and jquery s live function like this

2589344
export	report
also i give my clients an export to excel button which copies the report recordset to excel

2589346
having	union
i m having the above error request member rv in something not a structure of union

2589352
default-value	default
however if a sensible default exists you could mark the inherited methods as final and provide the default-value inside of it

2589365
java-me	swing	java-me	lwuit
a fast and loose definition for lwuit could be small swing for java-me

2589375
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i tested firefox 3.6 msie 7 safari 4 google-chrome 4 and opera 10 and they all do in fact support creating cookies via third party javascript even .when third party cookies are disabled

2589378
put	get
in this case you can probably get away with because it looks like the filtering on the id column will limit you to one recording but generally what you need to do instead is put a full-text index on the named column and write the query like this

2589380
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms

2589398
priority-queue	queue
i am creating an priority-queue with multiple queue

2589405
javascript	dom
while i haven t mucked with changing form field myself i think you can use uiwebview s stringbyevaluatingjavascriptfromstring methods to run arbitrary javascript to manipulate the dom and set those form field as desired

2589413
arrays	loops
your loops begins at 1 and since you re using it to access the arrays you will be starting with the second elements and trying to access 1 elements beyond the scoping of the arrays which will throw an arraysindexoutofboundsexception

2589419
arrays	loops
first of all arrays in java are zero-indexed .so your loops should read

2589442
subclassing	base-class
your myqueue subclassing is also abstract just like its base-class therefore it can t be initializer but just defining it which is all you ve done is fine

2589453
populate	row
this code works fine but i d like it populate the next row below instead of overwriting the same row each time the button is click

2589459
treeview	listview
anyone who s sweated with the standards winforms controls listview treeview combobox etc. for a few yearas has imho learned a lot about inconsistency in object design from the glass is half-full perspective however maybe that s what enables the third party software companies to thrive and innovate

2589462
processor	cpu
although the same opcode was chosen deliberately and as far as the processor state is concerned they make no difference the execution-time - and the exact internal implementation - can differ on a ht pause vs non-ht nop cpu

2589462
machine-code	disassembly
apart from the pause vs rep nop that makes little difference it is possible to write machine-code that is hard to disassembly it statically

2589462
machine-code	disassembly
one can carefully construct a machine-code sequences that results in completely different assembly instructions if the disassembly starts at say offset 0 vs offset 1

2589469
selected	cell
what if the user has selected all the text in the cell ie foo and they are now typing b

2589491
attributes	properties
removing that attributes will restore the default behavior and the datacontext properties will be inject

2589514
linux	unix
linux unix has flock 2 windows has a similar but different mechanism

2589530
rollback	commit
just execute the test instead call commit call rollback at the end of

2589542
httphandler	httpmodule
i want to resolve whatever from inside non-page contexts such as global-asax httpapplication httpmodule httphandler etc

2589543
joomla	drupal
joomla drupal and wordpress all come with .so many out of the box features you d have to stripes out - look for .something that starts fairly simple

2589549
javascript	dom
inspect and modify the dom including viewing the dom after it has been dynamically modified by javascript

2589552
static-classes	class-members
the msdn article static-classes and static class-members will give you some additional insight

2589555
google-chrome	firefox
of course i think google-chrome s developer-tools and firebug web developer for firefox are tremendously helpful as well...each tool has it s area that it helps with

2589562
click	mouse
just click make 10 000 bigger about 4 time then scroll down and on the right it will show the mouse x and y positioning and as you move down through the image and hover over the red area if you go down enough it will go into negative y

2589565
compact-framework	.net
client written in .net compact-framework

2589580
installation	building
the installation is delphi 7 enterprise versioning 7.0 building 4.453

2589591
exception-handling	try-catch
it s used to capture exception-handling that may occur within the block of code inside the try-catch

2589593
textmate	vim
i often work in eclipse but recently switched to textmate which is in my opinion the best text-editor out there barring perhaps vim or something like that but i find the learning curve too steep to jump into that quite yet

2589609
document-ready	ready
this allows a bit more flexibility in the click also note you need to wrap the click handler in a document-ready function like i have above...this way it wait until the dom is ready to bind once the elements it should bind to are there and ready

2589617
arrays	loops
one possible solution - you could extraction the string into an arrays of characters sort the arrays and then loops over it checked to see if the next character is equals to the current one

2589621
nsarray	plist
in summary i am having a problem where i read what i expect to be an nsnumbers from an nsarray contains in a plist and instead of getting a numbers such as 1 i get what looks to be a memory-address 61879840

2589621
nsarray	plist
the plist is read in as data and then converted to an nsarray

2589635
jquery	.post
and at view index i have a form and i .post the form-data to the action index decored with http-.post using jquery like this

2589647
hashmap	arrays
if you can use a little auxiliary memory then a small arrays of bits indexed by the numerical code of the character is all you need if your characters are 4-byte unicode ones you ll probably want a hashmap instead

2589660
hash	md5
normally with http-html request cookies would store a md5 hash representing a sid

2589663
managed-code	c++-cli
all applications will be in managed-code .so using native c++ oledb would required c++-cli to work no pinvoke way to slow

2589673
sql-server	teradata
the teradata installation is many time more expensive than the sql-server installation .so it just goes to show how much of a difference model and matching your data and process to the underlying feature set matters

2589693
revision	svn
the only thing that i can think of is that from revision 1000-9000 foo.cs had the svn mime-type properties set to application octet-stream

2589693
revision	svn	any	set
experimenting with subversion 1.6 any time i have a revision in history with svn mime-type set to application octet-stream i get skipping binary file from svn blame

2589693
revision	svn
this will truncated history but at least svn blame will work for newer revision

2589698
sql-server	mysql
if you use auto increment field eg mysql sql-server the id won t be created until the entity is saved

2589705
contains	elements
.when linq compiles a query with multiple join clauses it call them in a sequences and it generator resultselector for the first one automatically - and the generator code returns a simple anonymous types contains the elements from both of the source tables

2589721
lookup	any
if you see any full index table scans row lookup etc. that indicates inadequate indexing for your query or a query that s written .so as to be unable to take advantage of covering indexes

2589721
relational-database	schema
.so the basic answer to your question is yes relational-database systemd are completely capable of handling this scale but if you want .something more detailed helpful then you might want to .post an example schema test scripting or at least an execution plan for us to look over

2589724
datagrid	textbox
however the event doesn t seem to fire unless the cursor focus is on a textbox or datagrid or the like

2589730
vbscript	jscript
if you need your code to be a service but to be activated every hour the easiest approach would be to make your service a com object and have a simple task scheduling every hour that invokes a jscript vbscript that creates your com object and call simple methods on it

2589739
virtual-memory	paging
other desktop os s rely on virtual-memory and paging to deal with memory constraints

2589746
dto	dao
and also i was looking for some dao dto sample implementation and design-patterns

2589748
arrays	loops
if you want to do this in 32-bit c probably just loops over the arrays as a 32-bit int arrays and compare it to 0 then make sure the stuff at the end is also 0

2589754
python	java
objective-c being in the smalltalk lineage of object-oriented languages has a concept of object that is very similar to that of java python and other standards non-c++ object-oriented languages

2589824
execution	restart
i ensured that my apache server restart and used the latest change of my php-ini by execution httpd -k restart

2589832
32-bit	64bit	value	field
.so if you decide to make your time field a unix-timestamp know that it can store up to 64bit signed int but value you store now should actually occupy 32-bit on disk even if the .source value is a 64bit time_t

2589853
.war	jar
i m guessing that if i put them in my ruby apps .lib folder they would be copy-paste to web-inf .lib and all would be well however it seems odd to have 2 copies of the jar in the .war file is that what i am meant to do

2589862
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
pick up its output with firebug for firefox or the built-in consoles in the developer-tools in safari and google-chrome ie no help as usual

2589873
silverlight	syncfusion	silverlight	wpf
you forgot syncfusion and you really should not count xceed as they dont appear to have anything useful for silverlight xceed does have an impressive wpf grid tho

2589876
arrays	loops	any	set
in the distant past performing a comparison and conditional branch for each elements in the arrays in addition to loops branch itself would have been deemed expensive and depending on how often or early you could expect a non-zero elements to appear in the arrays you might have elected to completely do without conditional inside loops using solely bitwise-or to detection any set bits and deferring the actual checked until after loops completes

2589876
arrays	loops
if anything comparing each elements to zero and breaking out of loops early as soon as the first non-zero elements is encountered could be in the long run more efficient than the approach which always traversal the entire arrays unless that is you expect your arrays to be almost always made up exclusively of zero in which case making the approach truly branchless by using gcc s -funroll-loops could give you the better numbers -- see the numbers below for an athlon processor results may vary with processor model and manufacturer .

2589892
variables	boolean
given that these are boolean random variables is it possible to rewrite the system.in terms of boolean algebra

2589905
contains	any
you can add a change_type column to your log tables to indicate whether the log entry is a insert updates delete - of course the many-to-many log table shouldn t contains any updates change_type entries

2589923
any	set
setting up building scriptinging will depend a certain amount on what platform you set up but in general it s easy to add any tool you want into the scripting once you start using any sort of building scripting

2589923
any	set
i use teamcity which i have set up to watch for any changes in svn and triggers building test whenever something is checked in

2589931
benchmarking	profiling
of course only benchmarking and profiling will tell you if that s actually going to be a benefit for your particular situation

2589940
configuration	environment	environment	building
the framework on the target machine will take care of it and it makes your life easier rather than having to manage building configuration for various environment

2589948
windows-xp	windows
also i ve currently running on windows 7 enterprise and i m aware the results may be quite different on windows-xp but i haven t been able to test this

2589956
triggers	insert
what most people also do is couple this with an insert triggers

2589956
triggers	insert
.so .when a row is insert without an id the triggers fires to fill out the id for you from the sequences

2589957
spaces	output
in this example i started with the function radial.m from the first link above and modified the way it relates points between the input and output spaces to create a nice circular image

2589958
contains	set
if you don t want the text to stay inside the windows .when you shrink it .so if you want a horizontal scrollbar you have to set a min-width on a contains the text

2589960
centering	fixed
the fixed width keeps the text from filling the windows and the margins 0 auto centering the h1 tag itself

2589984
selection	cell
a control will typically provide one or more additional events to allow an application to respond to the controls response to some input - in this case where a keyboard input results in a cell value being modified rather than a change in cell selection for example

2589989
authentication	login
create the user as os authentication and straight away login into sql without any userid passwd

2590000
malloc	strdup
strdup is basically a shortcut that does a malloc and a strcpy and you don t have to worry about the size of addr upfront

2590006

.so i m not sure how to reach the blackberry s androids nokia s without effect the code of my actual site

2590058
ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby
i ve done some python and ruby and now php and oop is more prevalent in both python and ruby

2590087
output	mode
i ran in diagnostic mode with the -d flag and received the output below

2590095
contains	any
you just have to remove the isvalid call in your controllers since it won t be performing any validation and also remove the .post request checked if it will not contains any form

2590107
contains	set
the set contains pairs of dates x value and scores y value

2590114
line-endings	newline
one way would be to count the numbers of line-endings n or r n depending on the string the caveat being that if the string does not end in a newline you ll have to make sure to add one to your count

2590122
logging	trace
in the app-config file i add trace logging as show

2590155
double	int
the types of a unix-timestamp is an int and you are reading data as a double

2590171
facebook-page	facebook
i have to develop facebook .app and put it into custom made facebook-page as a side widget

2590173
required	checked
ok .so after browsing through all of the examples in the php.net documentation for checkeddnsrr i figured out that for a recording you are still required to append a . to the end of the domain inorder to checked it validly

2590184
python	ruby
if you start to learn either ruby or python which are both good suggestions you should not just pick the most popular web framework but investigate several options

2590194
normalize	cosine
if you want to use the cosine metrics then you ll need to normalize your data such that the dot-product of two vectors is never greater than 1

2590195
getter	setter
i want to learn from the user of setter and getter this- constructor and .so on..

2590216
buildpath	libs
right click your project properties java buildpath libs add class folder

2590219
decimal	hex
in here you can see that decimal is internally represented as hex numbers

2590226
communication	messages
it can be compared to the relationship between normals oop in a shared state language and a language using the actor-model and no shared state like in erlang where you have a lot of light-weight process not sharing anything but communication through messages only

2590229
javascript	dom
if this is also not working then checked whether all the javascript files are loaded or not using a dom inspector

2590274
video-streaming	streaming
i am developing a video-streaming website my problem is how do i limit users by time like if they have credit balance for 3 hours of streaming how to i stop or pause the streaming once the credit is used up

2590281
updating	updates
note put has mostly been used to updates resources by replacing them in their entireties but recently there is movement towards using patch for updating existing resources as put specifies that it replace the whole resource

2590283
button	popup
3- i want to add an agreement popup to the new form which will be open just after click send button in the form

2590292
response	timeout
as you said the client connect with a long timeout and the server doesn t actually send a response until there is anything to send

2590310
constructor	private
however this code fails to compile because the constructor for directoryiteratorimpl is private

2590310
constructor	private
since this class is an internal implementation detail that clients of directoryiterator should never touch it would be nice if i could keep the constructor private

2590322
type-safety	generics
in c type-safety in general didn t receive as much emphasis as it did in c++ especially .when it came to because it was suppose to be a simple generics pointers to whatever

2590354
database-agnostic	sql-server
should have mentioned - i can t just use sql-server report service - this needs to be database-agnostic although it will be connect to one and needs to support a variety of data sources

2590355
contains	any
if there are any hooks are you sure they don t contains any errors

2590374
perl	awk
if perl is not a must you can also use awk

2590374
perl	awk
here s a fun benchmarking on the perl one liners posted against awk

2590401
touch	drag
it used to work fine where a touch that started above the screens and then would drag down onto the screens would just register as a normals touch .when the finger came onto the screens but with this new templates even .when building it with the 2.2.1 sdk it doesn t work anymore

2590403
put	get
i am planning to get the list of station and put them in an xml file in sd-card and provide that in a listview .so that .when one item is get selected that station will start playing.the xml file should be updates if any new station is added

keydown	keyup
have you tried registrering the keydown event for setting the flag and then the keyup event for unsetting the flag

2590526

updates btw - one way to deal with the multiple users may be changing the order issue is to do what i do give each user a numbersical id and then add this to the temporary numbers my staff id is actually the unique identity field id from the staff table used to gate login

2593246
value	field
first you could change the existing sort field of the entire set to a new set of non-colliding value -100 - staffid maxsetsize + existingorderval and then go recording-by-recording and change each recording to the new order value

you can try ironpython or ironruby for those languages but to run java or perl i think you ll actually need to downloading and install a java viewmodel and a perl interpreter

2593558
constructor	object
in the class below only the second constructor takes a forumthread object

2593558
constructor	private
without extraction the null-check into a new private methods is there some simpler re-factoring i can do or a better design to guard against the use of the wrong constructor with those dependent methodss

2593565

2593600
tapestry	spring
an example i read seemed to use spring to interface with hibernate and then tapestry to spring but i was under the impression tapestry integrated to the same degree with hibernate

2593600
tapestry	spring
i was interested because i hadn t found information anywhere else on how to maintain user levels and sessions through a tapestry application before but wasn t exactly impressed by the need to use spring in the example

2593608
ado	jet
you need to use ado and the jet provider

2593633
value	field
if it is not convenient for you you want to have the current data in the field .when you begin to edit it then you could create your own qitemdelegate qstyleditemdelegate and implements .some custom logic there make it .so the widget is not updates with new value .when it has focus for example

2593642
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i ve tested it on firefox safari and google-chrome

2593645
firefox	safari
safari and firefox have the same level of â supportâ for html5 sectioning elements after seeing your demo page iâ m guessing these are the elements youâ re talking about they can be styled but you have to set display block

2593651
kohana	drupal
account management and quick data collections like fast form creation are tedious in kohana but appear incredible simple in drupal

2593673
expression	brackets
the backslashes are doubled .so that the string pattern will look like the regular expression in my first example - one backslash before each brackets character

2593689
hash	md5
i looked at creating an md5 hash of the entire row insert that into the database and using a constraint to prevent sqlbulkcopy from insert the row but i don t see how to get the md5 hash into the bulkcopy operation and i m not sure if the whole operation would fail and rollback if any one recording failed or if it would continue

2593698
iostream	boost
for a single process there isn t much benefit to using boost iostream memory-mapped-files

we want to know the numbers of sets that will contains a unique elements

2593902
allocation	deep
stack overflow you ve allocated a lot of memory on stack because of deep recursion or are allocation object contains large arrays of data as local-variables not created or the heap with new or malloc

2593902
pointers	stack
maintaining a pointers or reference to an object allocated on stack that has been deleted the printout code above will uncover this case

2593916

what s the fastest communication model for a silverlight component communication with a wpf component

2594043
silverlight	wpf
that is at the very least i d like to consume an event from a silverlight component in a wpf component

2594043
silverlight	wpf
i understand you can use javascript to bridge from wpf - silverlight and i have that working

2594043
silverlight	wpf
however i m looking for a tighter communication model not using com - perhaps like eventaggregator silverlight component pubs wpf component subs ...but i ve only seen eventaggregation in wpf or silverlight but not both at the same time

2594053
32-bit	64bit
first of all it s not .net that s optimized for int performance it s the machine that s optimized because 32-bit is the native words size unless you re on x64 in which case it s long or 64bit

store your 32-bit dlls in the x86 subdirectories of the .app install directory the 64bit dlls in the x64 subdirectories

2594137
unmanaged	c++-cli
.when you mix it with c++-cli or managed-c++ you will likely end up with the stl code running as managed and the client code running as unmanaged

2594140
tapestry	spring
personally i ve found that tapestry 5 does everything a basic web .app needs without spring

2594140
tapestry	spring
there might be some specific spring utilities you would want to pull in but the tapestry hibernate integration is very solid and easy to use

2594153
vba	vb6
neither vba nor vb6 provides any

2594156
arrays	loops
this is because plottedloops is already an arrays and you want i to take on each sequential value in the arrays for each pass-through loops

2594160
required	checked
in reality it s probably better and far easier to just have the new versioning of the application checked the db scema and updates it if required

2594186
value	field
there are named value that can be used to replace field in the monolithic messages

2594191
aggregate	grouping

contains	elements
this gets the value of the first elements after the first elements contains second_wanted_key

2594220
calling-convention	extern-c
in fact there may be a compiler which treats extern-c as a different calling-convention

2594222
calling-convention	extern-c
it s the calling-convention that needs to be guaranteed and because we can t assume we are running on a certain compiler platform or architecture the best way to try and do that is with the functionality given to us extern-c

2594226
key-value	key
it then grouping the key-value pairs by key and takes only the first key-value pair for each key

2594231
double	int
.when it finds one it creates a .doc struct contains the .docid an int and the .document s rank a double and pushes it on to a priority-queue

2594231
priority-queue	queue
why should there suddenly be a bad_alloc exception-handling .when i try to push a .doc onto a queue that has a capacity to hold it i used a vector with enough spaces reserved as the underlying data structure for the priority-queue

2594267
calling-convention	extern-c
the points is that extern-c is the closest thing there is to a cross-platform way of telling the compiler to make the function use the standards c calling-convention on that platform exactly how parameters and return value should be passed on stack

2594297
arrays	map
what i d like it to do though is to use the given arrays of value rather than the map .when it comes to populating the display list

2594299
sql-server	oracle
can any one suggest me a good framework for working with sql-server or oracle

2595070
constructor	object
if you need the ability to create new object then i don t think your constructor should be loading from the database by default

2595070
default-value	arguments
since php doesn t support function-overloading .so you can t have overloaded constructor you can either just remove the populate from database code from the constructor into a function for that purpose or give the -type arguments a default-value that indicates that properties shouldn t be populate from the database

2595073

decimal-point	digits
if a decimal-point character appears at least one digits appears before it

2595808

i think that if you don t want a zero to appear before the decimal-point you ll probably have to do something like use printf to format the numbers into a string and remove the 0 if the formatted string starts with 0. and similarly for -0.

2595810

2596044
font-size	width
because it would be dependent on font-size default white-space width etc

2596047

2596077
version-control	git
you could use a distribute version-control systemd like mercurial or git

2596081
google-chrome	firefox
the rea.son why firefox performed the binding and raised the onload event on the 1st snippet and the others didn t might be because the firefox google-chrome its user-interface itself is written and automated using javascript - that s why it s .so flexible and easy to write extensions on it

2596102
any	set
actually if it is just for you you may set up a svn repository on local disk and you do not have to setup any server

2596109

2596251
linked-list	nodes
if the child adds a nodes it s adding it to its own linked-list - the modification won t be seen by the parent

2596251
linked-list	nodes
you need to have the parent process add the nodes to its linked-list

2596253
having	union
not sure this is actually possible having a union with order by and limits in each sub-query.

2596280
copy-constructor	constructor
in c++0x allocation should be able to call any constructor not just the copy-constructor .so it might be that boost s allocation already support this to an extent

2596285
arrays	loops
-a activates auto-split into the arrays f -n implicit wrap the code in a loops which reads input line-by-line

2596286
exception-handling	error-handling
there is a reason why c# error-handling is done with exception-handling and not with return codes and that is because exception-handling allow for structured hierarchical and call stack based handling

2596287
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php	python	php	python	ruby	python	perl

2596303
constructor	object
pascal casing is generally used only for constructor functions functions that create object

2596312
controllers	routes
others have suggested dynamically rebuilding the routes but this won t work for me as there may be thousands of views that map to the same controllers

2596317
value	field
presently i am using a field to create a new list adding a value to the list and then returning the result

2596321
windows-xp	windows
on windows-xp dependency walker finds it in windows system32 not in the sxs folder like i expected

2596329
content-disposition	content-type
--append lets you add arbitrary headers to the mail which is where you should specify the content-type and content-disposition

2596338
postgresql	rdbms	postgresql	mysql
.so if i want the performance of doing reads from ram and the durability of writes to disc then the size of the tables are very limited compared to a traditional rdbms like mysql or postgresql

2596344
initializer	getter
i wouldn t like to make that boring private _initializer variablesiables which would be returned by the getter of the public initializer variables

2596352
multiple-languages	locale
i know it s possible to have multiple-languages in a single application through the res string and depending on locale

2596357
phpmyadmin	mamp
mamp has its own built-in mysql and you can t get to it via the command-line only the built-in phpmyadmin

2596391
loading	gif
i m fine with this but i only want to show the image once it s fully loaded and have a loading gif in its place until that time

2596391
loading	gif
if javascript is not enabled i want standards img tags to be outputted otherwise the images are removed and replace with a loading gif until they have been fully loaded

2596397
webforms	asp.net
i have been reading about agile techniques tdd unit-testing solid design-patterns and felt utterly powerless to bridge the gap from all this wonderful theory to asp.net webforms

2596448
mac-address	ethernet
for example the source and destination of an ethernet frame would be the same mac-address all of the time

2596458
buffering	streaming
write the individual members to your output streaming or have the structure do this or write the individual members to a buffering

2596458
csv	xml
since you have floating-point value int value and text i highly suggest you use an ascii or text based format such as csv or xml

2596465
authentication	login
401 is handled internally by asp.net-mvc framework that is why redirection to login page is done after failed authentication

2596499
boolean	int
for example a book item has two properties int pages and boolean hardcover

2596509
order	add
i am using the convert cmd to convert a pdf to multiple pngs i need the naming-conventions to be slide-##.png at the moment they come out like slide-1.png but because there is 20+ slider .when i loops through them to add them into the model the order comes up wrong .so it looks like slide-1.png slide-10.png slide-11.png and .so on how can i force convert to use double numbers like 01 02 03 and .so forth or is there a better way to loops through them this is the code i have at the moment

2596519
uiresponder	uiview
uiview is a subclassing of uiresponder

2596519
uiresponder	uiview
uiview overrides this methods as documented in uiresponder for some reason instead of in uiview as follows if the view has a view controllers it is returned by -nextresponder

2596526
pointers	stack
you couldnt return a pointers to a local variables bc local-variabless lives on stack

2596577

next let make our welcome page to show the value from tempdata collections

2596624
postgresql	oracle
i m coming to postgresql from oracle and looking for a way to find the table and index size in terms of bytes mb gb etc or even better the size for all tables

2596634
debugging	trace
do some debugging by using trace macros i think that is what you use in msvc to output the memory location of searcherlock in both functions to guarantee they are the same object

2596635
typedef	struct
create a struct also typedef contains the data types

2596635
typedef	struct
i am kind of leaning toward making a struct with a typedef but could be pursuaded to change my mind

2596639
gradient	clipping
create a rounded rect as a path selected the path as the clipping path then do a gradient fill of the same rectangle

2596658
revision	svn
use svn log to find the revision that corresponds to the points in time then svn co -r revision to checkout that revision

2596664
click	mouse
i ve worked on this sort of .app before and it s much more bandwidth-efficient to send a data structure indicating mouse movement click drawing primitive etc

2596674
configuration	installation
depends on the types of .application that you are creating if it is a simple .app you can consider using sqlite and the distribution will just be the database file and it required no db server installation or configuration

2596677
authentication	login
asp.net treats all failures as authentication failures and endlessly redirects to login .when it should recognize under-authentication and allow redirection to 403

2596688
revision	svn
in essence use tags or the revision numbers that svn provides or the svn log if you don t have this documented

2596692
32-bit	64bit
my theory is that the iis compilation uses csc.exe compiler from the framework64 64bit folder while the visual-studio uses csc.exe compiler from the framework 32-bit folder

2596694
postgresql	oracle
afaik oracle postgresql both have their own c libs

2596709
controllers	routes
in addition to setting up an admin namespace in my routes i use the declarative_authorization plugins which lets you defined roles for users and defined access controls on controllers actions as well as model attributes

2596711
if-statement	loops
loops is apparently infinite -- exit controlled by the if-statement exit loops and makes loops finite

2596711
if-statement	loops
for example types a as input to the first read instead of a number. in this case the iostat variables acquires a non-zero value the if-statement activates the cycle and the rest of the do loops is skipped .so that loopss cycles anew

2596720
realloc	malloc	realloc	free	malloc	free
if you defined your own data structure you have to manage all aspects of what you re doing -- if you want a variables numbers of recording you ll need to manage that spaces with malloc free realloc

i per.sonally use a relative-path to a directory .so i can change the root folder in case of systemd migration or load balancing

2596757
selected	textbox
is there a mvvm way to selected text in a textbox

2596773
associations	model
with this approach your model would still subclassing activerecord base but defined the columns manually which allows you to use activerecord features such as validation and associations without a database

2596776
for-loop	arrays
anyways an easier way to do it is to calculate the length of the arrays and then calculate which variables needs to be used for that particular positioning using a single for-loop

2596789
digits	radix	digits	base
alternatively you could convert the numbers themselves to a base radix in the unencoded uri character range see which should work well if many of the numbers are larger than 2 digits

2596800
linked-list	arrays
solution 1 some people recommended me to implements the graphing the vertices part as an arrays instead of a linked-list

2596800
space-complexity	time-complexity
using linked lists is good for space-complexity but bad for time-complexity

2596800
space-complexity	time-complexity
and using an arrays is good for time-complexity but bad for space-complexity

2596805
emacs	vim
i would prefer to write my commit messages in vim but it is opening them in emacs

2596819
configuration	environment

2596833
positioning	fluid
i have al.so considered changing the css .so that the elements are ab.solutely positioning - but to be frank the page is setup with fluid elements all over and i really want these elements to be floated in their new parent

2596839
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this seems to fix most of the issues in firefox google-chrome ie7 and safari

2596857
compile-time	hardcode
this means that regardless of what you do and how you do it one way or another the path will always start from an explicit hardcode value be that a member named or an compile-time offset value

2596857
key-value	key
that means that if you want to selected a struct member based on some runtime key you have no other choice but to manually create a mapping of some kind that would map the key-value to something that identifies a concrete struct member

2596871
radio-button	textbox	radio-button	checkbox	checkbox	textbox	required	checked
they give an example of required #other checked but i want my field to be required if the #other field is either checked or filled i don t know whether it will be a checkbox radio-button or textbox beforehand

2596882
derived-class	inherited
derived-class inherited

2596912
user-controls	treeview
implements selecteditemchanged on the treeview and setting the appropriate user-controls to visible and the others to collapse

2596914
any	set
also if a person does not have any document then there will be one recording in the peoplesdocs table with the docid set to null

2596933
jquery	dojo
jquery is popular because it s ace but there s mootools prototype and dojo to named a few

2596942
perl	c++
.so we wrote a perl scripting to find the struct parsing its members and output a c++ file that looked like

2596942
g++	gcc
nowadays i understand that gccxml can output an xml file representing any c++ source that gcc can compile since it actually uses the g++ front end to do the parsing

2596942
python	c++
.so i d recommend pairing it with an xml-parsing scripting i d use python with the lxml libs to find out everything you ever wanted to know about your c++ .source

2596952
freebsd	netbsd
receiving recommendations for commercial tcp-ip stack implementation based on freebsd or netbsd

2596956
windows-server	windows
it s hitting iis 7 on a windows-server 2008 viewmodel external box windows firewall is off

2596965
arrays	loops
you can t just invoke nearby on the arrays you have to loops thru your arrays and apply nearby to each address yielded in loopss

2596979
.when	ready
for example i use mercurial for my pet project and i simply tag my repo .when it s ready and updates the production server to the tag .when i deploy

2597001
versioning	packaging
i m going through many minor versioning numbers daily and the haskell packaging systemd cabal doesn t seem to offer any tools for updating versioning numbers or for maintaining a changelog

2597013
tuples	any
i m not aware of any sql dialects that support tuples inside in clauses

2597013
where-clause	sql
generally sql where-clause predicates only allow filtering on a single-column

2597118
hash	md5
in the .net there are a couple of ways to calculate an md5 hash it seems however there is something i don t understand

2597130
buffering	streaming
your function will take the streaming as an arguments will use an enumerated value and a char buffering internally and will yield the strings one by one

2597139
base-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class	derived-class	inherited
public inherited would make it possible for a derived-class to be deleted through a base-class pointers which is undefined-behavior in c++

2597146
hash	md5
md5 represents the abstract-class from which all implementation of the md5 hash algorithm inherited

2597146
hash	md5
md5cryptoserviceprovider computes the md5 hash value for the input data using the implementation provided by the cryptography service provider csp

2597168
linked-list	arrays
3 - in the edges substitute you linked-list for an arrays

2597168
linked-list	arrays
even with the extra spaces allocated .when you increment the size with step of 50 the total size used by the arrays should only be marginally larger than with the size of the linked-list

2597171
onresize	onload
if you want something to work onload and onresize you should do

2597195
http-get	get
redirect to get seems to fix it using tempdata to pass the model that was posted from the client to the http-get view

2597232
32-bit	16-bit
evolution of the 32-bit mv line from the 16-bit nova line words

2597232
32-bit	16-bit
compatibles may use 16-bit data pointers and 32-bit function

2597235
exception-handling	try-catch	triggers	insert
simply moving using new sessionscope inside the outermost try-catch may be a viable workaround the initial insert will fail raise an exception-handling which will take you out of the sessionscope likely triggers a second failure on the same insert failure which you finally catch -- also see data is not fflush on sessionscope.flush in com.googlegroups.castle-project-users .

2597239
contains	any
if either u or v containss any other symbols then #4 fails .so u and v must contains only c

2597239
context-free-language	pumping-lemma
this demonstrates that no string from l provides a counterexample using the pumping-lemma to the supposition that l is a context-free-language even though it is context sensitive

2597243
constructor	object
.so the gameobjectcontroller constructor sets those object up

2597252
selected	button
my problem is i don t understand how to get the submit button to selected the currently selecteded query and run it

2597255
python	perl
i am wondering if there are any tips or tricks to converting perl into python

2597263
python	perl
the best tool to convert perl to python is still yourself

2597263
python	perl
for example perl makes use of regex a lot however in python string manipulation is .so easy that most of the time regex is not needed

2597263
python	perl
there are al.so many ways to do things in perl .so how would a converter know what is the best with python equivalent

2597297
any	set
if you re working with an 8bit character set the regex matches any character that is not ascii

2597298
if-statement	loops
you ll probably need to loops through the columns collections and use an if-statement

2597301
children	tree	children	nodes
the input of the tree would be internal nodess of the tree with the children of this nodes being the leaves of the eventual tree

2597308
python	perl
converting would required writing a perl parsing semantic checker and python code generator

2597308
python	perl
you d be better off translating perl to python from the perl ast opcodes using the perl opcode or related modules

2597308
python	perl
some notations do not map from perl to python without some work

2597308
python	perl
in short either convert it by hand or use some integration modules to call python from perl or vice-versa

2597360
subclassing	base-class
if your base model definedd the appropriate abstract virtual methods that are suitable for all subclassing you can defined the properties once in the base-class and be done

2597360
subclassing	base-class
2 offer strongly typed properties .when accessed through subclassing but store the field once in the base-class

2597364
value	field
and on your code change the value of the parameter during runtime to change the field s background based on the color set for a particular value of the parameter on the field s properties

2597370
perl	awk
it s for letter permutation and the solutions use awk bash perl but that at least gives you a starting points

2597371
selected	button
i need to option to add a selected all none but you can t bring up the menu in an alertdialog and i want to do this function from a button

2597374
queue	fifo
since you have only one worker thread and the queue is used in a fifo manner tasks will be execute inorder

2597374
implements	extends
note many people will argue that you should not extends a threadpoolexecutor but instead say you implements executorservice and have your class contains a threadpoolexecutor which you delegation to aka composition

2597386
value	field
overrides the form s createparams methods and add the ws_ex_toolwindow value to the params.exstyle field

2597388
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
though i have been able to do it in ie and firefox but its not working for opera and google-chrome

2597388
google-chrome	opera
can anyone suggest how may i be able to achieve the same in opera and google-chrome

2597391
gzip	zip
i have attempted to find a way to create a zip archive or gzip archive in objective-c but my knowledge of the language is still lacking

2597391
zipfile	archive
to be explicit clear by archive i mean the equivalent of a zipfile or gzipfile that contains many different files internally and are archive and then compressed for transfer or usage as a single entity

2597399
firefox	opera
this works as expected in webkit browsers and opera but it seems like firefox doesn t updates the background-color in css immediately after a mouseout event occurs .so the current background-color doesn t get draw if a mouseout occurs and it isn t followed up by another event that call the draw routine

2597399
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
it works just fine in opera google-chrome and safari

2597423
triggers	insert
and t2 and an insert triggers is

2597423
triggers	insert
to t1 the triggers fires and insert a

2597423
triggers	insert
insert on t2 by the triggers

2597434
triggers	insert
by that i mean place an insert updates triggers on the users table .so that if a user changes their user named it s al.so changed in the items table and possibly vice versa

2597471
jquery	.post
it does appear that a few insights are present in the .post titled combining jquery form validation and ajax submission with asp.net

2597486
audiorecord	audiotrack
i ve noticed that the c++ classes underlying the audiotrack and audiorecord apis in android both have a latency methods that is not exposed via jni

2597486
audiorecord	audiotrack
as far as i can see the latency methods in audiorecord still does not take into account the hardware latency they have a todo comment for that but the latency methods in audiotrack does add in the hardware latency

2597491
checkbox	listbox
i have a datatemplate which contains a checkbox and listbox

2597491
checkbox	listbox
.when the checkbox is checked i want to change the itemtemplate properties on the listbox to change the appearance of each item

2597542
carbon	cocoa
on the desktop core at one points meant shared between cocoa and carbon

2597544
observablecollection	dependencyobject
another way of achieving this would be that you implements a new xxxviewmodel class that derives from dependencyobject and you put this one in the observablecollection

2597558
scons	cmake	autotools	scons	autotools	cmake	autotools	gnu
you can use gnu make optional with autotools ant maven cmake or scons among many

2597558
debian	linux
once you have the basic building working you can package your program as a .deb and or .rpm .so it can be easily installable by users of major gnu linux distributions debian and red hat

2597561
logout	login
messages login || messages logout

2597584
viewwillappear	viewdidload
the content of viewa that u would be setting in viewdidload methods of the viewcontroller of viewa can be set in viewwillappear

have a boolean variables in viewa now its value should be set to true .when u change any thing in viewb by having its reference in viewb now .when you pop checked in viewwillappear if the boolean is changed to true

2597588
google-chrome	firefox
this application run well in firefox 3+ google-chrome and ie8

2597632
versioning	staging
a way that might required less complex sysadmin ing would be to building and use a different versioning of jquery in staging

2597649
key-value	key
this class is not key-value coding-compliant for the key test.

2597679

2597715
groovy	java
i am trying to figure out the difference between the following code this is groovy but the java result is the same

2597723
autotools	gnu
the most common way is to use gnu autotools to generator a configure scripting .so that your project can be install by doing

2597724
subproject	libs
learn about subproject and libs

2597726
children	nodes
apparently a nodes with no children has a height of 0

2597727
logout	login
i m a beginner in php and i am trying to create a login and logout

2597727
logout	login
my logout just call for the login form which is this

2597734
callback	methods
the macros styles callback is probably a better idea generally than simply overrides the methods

2597745
partial-trust	xbap
because of using xbap in partial-trust can not use windowsformshost

2597750
contains	set
set the default-value for the key to points to a file contains the scripting code implements the context menu action s possibly integration with a com object must support idispatch iirc

2597751
decrement	increment
tag.used is increment by one and decrement by one in case of deletion

2597758
32-bit	x86
i have a .net windows forms application compiled as x86 â it needs to be compiled as x86 because it references 3rd party dlls which are 32-bit

2597775
version-control	git
git is a distribute version-control systemd you commit to your local repository for the small changes

2597813
literals	hardcode
a string literals is a hardcode nsstring that exists indefinitely while your application is running

2597832
mouseover	mouseout
i am using javascript mouseover and mouseout events .when i move my mouse very quickly the events are not triggers

2597834
triggers	insert
if any of your tables have auto-increment columns used as foreign key in other tables use an after triggers to capture actual auto-increment value for insert and updates statements and write a corresponding sql statement to a separate file for production playback

2597851
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
checkout my article protect your java code - through obfuscators and beyond for a discussion of obfuscation vs three other ways to make the reverse-engineering of your apps more expensive and a collections of links to tools and further reading materials

2597861
required	checked
in addition a checked for null would be required in the following case as you can t be sure createconnection won t return null

2597891
webforms	asp.net
in normals asp.net webforms your page user-controls is technically in charge of the process and imposes its lifecycle on the code

2597891
silverlight	wpf
these same model classes could then be used in future asp.net-mvc web sites or silverlight or as a web service for wpf applications or embedded in a wpf application etc

2597893
double	int
assuming you re sure the result will be convertible to int you can parsing it as double and cast to int

2597899
double	int
you can parsing the string as a double and later cast the double to int

2597899
double	int
however casting from double to int is subject to precision lost or even int-overflow

2597921
preserve	copying
in .some filesystems there can be more metadata available but it s typically hard to get at and often not preserve .when copying files around - .so shouldn t be relied on for this

2597928
domain-object	repository
the controllers get action would retrieve the domain-object from the repository create a viewmodel populate the viewmodel and then pass it to the view

2597937
arrays	map
map str arrays is equivalent to .so returns

2597942
subtraction	addition
this algorithm uses o 1 storage with the temp variables which could be eliminated using the addition subtraction swap technique i m not very good at runtime analysis but i believe this is still o n even though we re performing many swaps

2597943
contains	set
you can t ever set the properties value even in the contains class

2597943
contains	set
however the contains class itself can set the properties multiple time via within the class definition

2597950
show	next
is it possible to have a single listview with 2 or more columns operable with paging properties at a time listview will show only 4 items in single column and on press of right arrow it will show next 4 items

2597988
arguments	default
the key here is the ref bool cancel arguments cancel false allows normals closing of the workbook default cancel true prevents the workbook from closing

2597997
derived-class	base-class
this is annoying if a base-class implements clone its derived-class has to overrides the clone all the way

2598028
header-only	boost
a numbers of boost libs are header-only even for their non-template parts simply because it makes integration easier no linking required

32-bit	64bit
if the office and autocad are purely 64bit then probably not because they will be 64bit images and therefore not load into a 32-bit process and you have the reverse problem for your 32-bit ones

2598034
32-bit	64bit
we had a similar situation and ended up making our program anycpu and provided another little program that was 32-bit to talk to the 32-bit dll s then .when we detection if we are on a 64bit machine then we invoke the 32-bit program to perform the communication to these 3rd party dll s and generator some kind of output in our case we wrote a small xml file and then exit

2598036

.when its done it invokes your callback methods with its results

2598212
required	checked
and checked .when required

2598215
configuration	logging
does basic configuration for the logging systemd by creating a streamhandler with a default formatter and adding it to the root logger

2598215
configuration	logging
logging module is designed in a way that configuration is separated from creating log messages .so there s no need of having access to logger instances

2598218
mousedown	mouseup
using listbox and it s events mousedown to get data with indexfrompoint methods and mouseup to call calendar s doubleclick event

2598225
configuration	logging
if the libs you are using doesn t overrides the logging configuration this should be enough to get messages into the logfile

2598252
javascript	dom
if your javascript wasn t inline you could try something adventurous like rhino with dom support and completely eschew the browser

2598252
javascript	dom
you shouldn t have to resort to trying to unit-test javascript in the dom

2598263
digits	zero
it would perhaps be easier to work out if we assumed that all numberss had to have the same numbers of digits with leading zero where required

2598288
svg	vml
i am evaluation raphaeljs svg vml for developing a similar component like flicr map or google map based on purely drawing rather than utilizing images

javascript	dom
is it possible to load an html document into a dom javascript object .so that you can read the elements in the document

2598296
javascript	dom
can the page hello.html call javascript code to load test.html into a dom object

2598298
python	perl
another approach is that you might be able to reuse existing perl code and complement it with new python code

2598298
python	perl
one possibility that might work for you is to use the perl python-module which allows you to execute perl code inside python

2598298
python	perl
another approach is to have perl produce its output as simple text json yaml files which is parsing by python for further process

2598298
python	perl
thus i was able to use my legacy perl code without rewriting it while switching to python

2598298
python	perl
this pass files methods is good .when you have long calculations that produce intermediate results you can start the computation in perl and continue it in python

2598301
initializer	getter
a proxy is initializer if you call any methods that is not the identifier getter methods

2598330
contains	set
i am trying to get updates queries from a list of files using this script.i need to take line containss updates alone and not updatess or updatessql as we know all updates queries contains set i am using that as well.but i need to remove cases like updatess and updatesssql can anyone help

2598352
decimal-point	digits
i believe paypal required you to have two digits after the decimal-point .so your netamt should be 22.00

2598367
account	userid
you could store a token in the users session that maps back to their user account either a hash of their user named or their userid or similar and then checked the two on the request - if they don t match then the session has become invalid

2598367

1 strictly speaking if the user does not allow using core-location or if permission were given but core-location is not available there is no other fallback to get the user s location as a latitude-longitude pair

2598446
latitude-longitude	location
if you choose to ask for the user s location then you can get the corresponding latitude-longitude pair but this will required a working network connection

2598457

division	modulo
i would like to defined some kind of safe division and modulo function one that would return some predefinedd value .when attempting to divide-by-zero

2598487
linux	unix	lighttpd	apache	webserver	nginx

2598487
postgresql	mysql
also databases like mysql postgresql or nosql stuff runs better and are more supported on linux machines

2598490

2598535
delphi	c++
i recently had to work around the different default sizes used for enumerations in delphi and c++ since i have to use a c++ dll from a delphi application

2598535
delphi	c++
however since delphi selected the size of an enum-variable dynamically by default and uses the smallest datatype possible it was a byte in my case but c++ uses an int for enums my data was not interpreter correctly

2598567
account	userid
i assume this was because it was associated with my originaldomain userid account rather than newdomain userid account

2598569
boost	stl
p.s. i don t prefer a big switching sweat and also i know boost is capable of everything i would prefer a stl solution

2598580
gtk	gdk
ideally using only gtk gdk nothing x11-specific

2598590
directory	folder
as the checkout information is stored in the filesystems is there any reason that you cant mount the ftp directory as a local folder or just browse to the ftp url and use tortoise on it

2598596
expression	evaluation	template-meta-programming	expression-templates
expression-templates are a category of c++ template-meta-programming which delay evaluation of subexpressions until the full expression is known .so that optimizations especially the elimination of temporaries can be applied

32-bit	64bit
however you can still compile it and run it on a 64bit os as a 32-bit process

2598689
32-bit	64bit
the question of the libs is a bit more complex if you compile it as a 64bit libs you won t be able to load it in your 32-bit process at all

2598689
32-bit	64bit
however assuming you re going to compile it for 64bit and then use it from a 64bit process then the actual length of an int variables is most likely going to stay 32-bit that s not going to be the case for everything though

2598696
search-engine	web-crawler
this will let you use a single hostname and would generally not create problems with crawling and indexing on the search-engine side since the web-crawler don t see multiple urls for the content

2598720
dependency-injection	factory-pattern
for item 2 he said that is factory-pattern not dependency-injection

2598725
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari

2598728
toupper	tolower
the problem is that tolower toupper are fundamentally broken for many locale

2598733
attributes	properties
there are lot of different attributes that control what the winform designer does with properties on a custom control i am never clear on the one i should use in this case

2598740
export	csv
yes you can export the information as a csv file and give it an excel file-extension

2598749
constructor	object
while this is possible it is generally easy just to adjust the value in the constructor itself using non-final parameters and after that initializer the object attributes in short you don t need recursion for this

2598752
binutils	newlib
anthony green did a blog series on coming up with an instruction set porting binutils gcc newlib and .so on as well as setting up sim and qemu to emulate a machine with this new instruction set

2598754
attributes	properties
the second attributes prevents the properties from appearing in initializecomponent

2598760
capacity	storage
what is the storage capacity of a mnesia database

2598799
xcopy	cmd
in my opinion you may begin with the following cmd dir copy del move echo types and xcopy

2598827
panels	grid
the panels 1-4 can be stack panels grid or whatever

2598855
response	timeout
using nsurlconnection you will get a nonblocking asynchronous functionality and will also be able to handle things like authentication response codes timeout and cancelling the request

2598855
nsmutableurlrequest	nsurlrequest
lookup the documentation for nsurlconnection and nsurlrequest and also nsmutableurlrequest

2598882
ostream	std
i would expect that c++ std ostream behavior is consistent with the c i o printf

2598922

2598940
.doc	xls
npoi is an open source project which can help you read write xls .doc powerpoint files

2598951
derived-class	base-class
pitfall also make sure that the destructor of request is virtual since you cannot delete object by a pointers to its base-classe .when there is no virtual-destructor in the base-class c++ can call the base-class destructor with the derived-class instances in this case leading in undefined-behavior like memory-leaks or crash

2598965
ip-address	hostname
i have a program that uses gethostbyname in windows inorder to convert ip-address to hostname

2598995
hide	show
it doesn t hide show at all your scripting isn t touching it anywhere

2599008
linux	unix
based on what you say about it working on linux unix i would guess that you got hit by a difference in filesystems locking semantics

2599008
filesystems	fat
as your other zip operations work i assume that writing is not a problem and you have enough disk spaces quota and are not writing files bigger than 2gb on a fat filesystems

2599009
value	field
it propably holds value for this field

2599014
unsigned-integer	int
i spent hours seeking whether timestamps should be unsigned-integer or int8 whether int8 is 8-digits or 8-bytes and what is the named of that esoteric 6-byte int

2599020
firefox	safari
i developed some javascript enhanced pages that run fine on recent firefox and safari

2599033
calayer	uiview
.so i replace the uiview by calayer

if you stick to using jquery or yui as your .post is tagged you should have minimal difference between browsers...that s what the frameworks are for to take care of these cross-browser difference for you

2599045
json	xml
json is a subset of the object-literal syntax and is meant as a data exchange format like xml which is why it s designed to be pickier

2599057

google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i m trying to get this thing to work in ie any versioning - works in firefox opera safari google-chrome ...

2599111
silverlight	wpf
i presume you mean silverlight rather than wpf

2599115
executable-jar	.war
if you have a .war you can use the embedded mode of the winstone servlet-container to get a stand-alone executable-jar

one-to-many	entity
the mapping is defined using many-to-one in the properties entity and using one-to-many mappedby... in the other three object

2599138
reflection	runtime
you can get around the circular dependency issue if your lazy-loading code loads the repository at runtime activator.createinstance or something similar and then call the appropriate methods via reflection

2599142
keydown	keyup
try triggers the jquery keydown keyup event manually

2599150
tiff	png
those images are png but could just as easily have been tiff

2599170
authentication	login
however the basic logic would be simple - .when a user logs in checked their username or id against a list of already logged in users and if there is a match do not authentication them and instead give them some kind of messages explaining why they cannot login

2599171
implements	abstract
add an abstract methods called validateproducts to subscriptionlicence and let each child licence implements the logic that is specific for that particular types of licence

2599171
implements	abstract
furthermore by making the methods abstract on the base-class you enforce each child licence to implements the methods .so you do not need to checked anything

2599175
duplicates	elements
the page over here suggests sorts an arrays of dom elements in-place with the duplicates removed

2599192
cvs	git
tortoise xxx git cvs whatever

2599197
authentication	login
for instances upon every authentication request you can reject the login request if the flag is already true

2599240
filtering	grouping
you could add another state grouping for filteringstates with the members unfiltering and filtering

2599256
hide	show
if you are using winforms the easiest way would be to create several panels instances on your your form that contains the grouping of controls you currently have on the different forms and just show hide the right panels depending on which button was pressed and what is the previous visible panels

2599256
selected	button
an alternative would be to use the tabcontrol with hidden tab button and just change the selected tab on button press

2599260
virtual-functions	base-class	virtual-functions	derived-class	derived-class	base-class
the usual object oriented way would be to have pure virtual-functions in the base-class that are called in operate and that get overrides in the derived-classes to execute code specific to that derived-class

2599261
revision	updates
couldn t you make your experiments on top of your existing clone and .when you want to make some changes to the main line go back and updates to the last revision before you started the experiments

2599262
decrement	increment
as a general rules system-supplied atomicity increment decrement facilities will apply whatever memory barrier are required to just do the right thing

2599269
required	checked
.so maybe checked for a php hosting .solution that provide this functionality and you won t need to write any php until you required more complex custom functionality

2599270
multiplication	division
as a general rules division is slow and multiplication is faster and bit shifting is faster yet

2599270
32-bit	64bit
to determine if this would be faster than the brute force as there will be many more multiplies since we will be using 32-bit registers to simulate 64bit and 128bit numbers .profile it

2599272
wamp	php
then i d suggest trying it all out using html for starters just .so you get used to the wamp mamp sever before heading over to for a brilliant set of tutorials on php

2599273
authentication	login
however the project im working on i need to be able to view an authentication rss feed which is behind a login

2599299

allows that the field value might be altered by triggers s on the table

2599314
.when	ready
.when she show up to perform the operation all the tools are lined up and ready for her -- they ve been provided from without and the surgeon doesn t care or need to know who put them there as long as they are available and ready .when she needs to her work

2599314
dependency-injection	inject
likewise in a given class dependency-injection means that any other component on which the class relies to do its work should be inject as a parameter to the constructor or by setting a properties .when the class is initializer

why not to leave date field as is and convert only constants value

2599326
pixels	line
i want to get relative to picture pixels coords start and endpoint of line

2599333
serialization	casting
sometimes the serialization throw a casting error on int32s being set to null

2599367
contains	any
the struct string_struct have the same memory layout as the const char since it only contains a 256 bytes char arrays and does not have any virtual members

2599367

in c++ call by reference string_struct is implements by passing a hidden pointers to the reference .so on the call stack it will be the same as if it was passed as a true pointers

2599368
jquery-ui-tabs	sortable
if you re already using jquery the jquery-ui-tabs has a sortable option for this

2599369
authentication	impersonation
i have looked for various solutions on the .net that include giving specific users and even everyone permissions to windir tasks using cacls which didn t work and also using impersonation and adding the iuser to the backup operations user grouping which won t work as the application must use windows integrated authentication

2599381
class-instance-variables	instance-variables
class-instance-variables being simply instance-variables of the class object that represents a class are thus not inherited

2599381
class-instance-variables	class-variables
this is a strong arguments for the use of class-instance-variables instead of class-variables

2599384
value	field
2 use the eav anti-patterns create a feature table with a foreign key field from your primary table as well as a fieldname and a value column and store the features as rows in that table instead of as attributes in your primary table

2599385
instances	self
as sender take the vc instances self instead of nil

2599388
quirks-mode	firefox
firefox and ie in quirks-mode document.body.scrollleft scrolltop

2599388

key event code difference key event codes vary wildly though if you look at quirks-mode or javascript madness it s hardly specific to ie safari and opera are different again

2599388
default	reset	keydown	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown	keydown
note just returning false in keydown keypress mousedown mouseup click and reset will also prevent default

2599390
entity-framework	data-access
if you are using entity-framework 4.0 you will have support for poco s with deferred loading will allow you to write a generics repository to do data-access

in an interview i was asked a question about private constructor

2599440
constructor	private
can you access a private constructor of a class and initializer it

2599440
constructor	private	constructor	object
can you explain why i was wrong and give an example of initializer an object with a private constructor

2599445
mongodb	couchdb
if just one index would be enough then a simple key-value-store couchdb mongodb or even cassandra for distribute environment would give you wonderful storage performance as well

2599460
constructor	private
consider for a class test with a private constructor

2599466
constructor	private
you can of course access the private constructor from other methods or constructor in the same class and its inner-classes

2599466
constructor	private
using reflection you can al.so use the private constructor elsewhere provided that the securitymanager is not preventing you from doing .so

2599475
contains	elements
.so each data elements contains the nodes to be insert at the positioning given by the index attributes

2599482

as the other answers already pointed out javascript arrays are able to contains elements of different data types

2599490
required	checked
on any page that required a this level of security checked to see if the sid stored in the .profile matches their session

2599490
ip-address	proxy
using the users ip-address is unreliable - corporate users those behind proxy etc often shared an ip-address .so would appear to be the same user

2599520
constructor	private
it uses private constructor

2599531
scikits	scipy
i also couldn t find one in the time-series scikit one of the libs in the scipy scikits domain-specific modules not include in the standards scipy distribution but it s worth checked again

open a command-prompt cmd and types

2599612
margins	padding
i suggest that you try setting margins padding on the elements to 0 via javascript

2599613
executable-jar	.war
have a look at the winstone servlet-container which allows you to distribute a single .war file as an executable-jar as a supported use case

2599624
scriptmanager	updatepanel
is there an easy way to get this to remember without dropping the updatepanel scriptmanager

2599631
