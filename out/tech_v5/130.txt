g++	gcc
for example on a network filesystems i have an executable built from my c++ program under a machine with centos release 4.7 x86_64 ad gcc g++ 3.4.6 20060404 red hat 3.4.6-10

1301225
g++	gcc
i surprisedly find that the executable can be used under another machine with ubuntu 8.10 x86_64 and gcc g++ ubuntu 4.3.2-1ubuntu12 4.3.2

1301225
32-bit	64bit
another example i remember a executable built on a 64bit machine cannot run on a 32-bit machine

subclassing	base-class
the leading-underscore conventions is widely used not just for private named but also for what c++ would call protected ones -- for example named of methods that are fully intended to be overrides by subclassing even ones that have to be overrides since in the base-class they raise notimplementederror

1301557
queue	fifo
for example to make a thread-safe queue with a different queueing discipline than fifo one import queue subclassing queue.queue and overrides such methods as _get and _put

1301557

my log files must contains utf-8 data but i can t find where i can set encoding for appender

1302159
put	get
the rea.son why its .so long is the sareplacement hrmsadminreplacement hrmanagerreplacement and payrolladminreplacement can all be null .so i put in a checked to ensure they are not null .so the rest of the clause does not get execute

with respect to versioninging especially semantic versioninging patching will upgrade a software s patch versioning numbers and updates upgrade their minor versioning numbers

1302262
revision	updates
.so a versioning numbers 2.1.3.089 is the second major versioning first minor revision .so there has been one major updates third maintenance building .so three patches since versioning 2.1.0.x was release and building 089 no significance to buildinging patches can be thought of as additional metadata specifying a unique versioning id numbers

1302307
packaging	building
under the packaging settings category in the building tab you want to change the product named value to myapp2

are these myisam or innodb tables

1302362
temporary	copy
make a temporary copy of your templates file naming it whatever you want

the way i think about it is this xpath returns any nodes anywhere .so long as for that nodes the preceding axis contains a br and the following axis contains a br

1302393
intraweb	vcl
it has vcl for the web formerly intraweb which gives you the ability to create pretty good web-applications with almost the same functional capabilities as a delphi win32 application

1302393
intraweb	vcl
you didn t mention what versioning of delphi you re using but there are demos of vcl for the web or interweb in both delphi 7 delphi demos intraweb and delphi 2007 c document and settings all users document rad studio 5.0 demos intraweb win32 on winxp

1302393
intraweb	vcl
disclaimer i am in no way affiliated with intraweb vcl for the web or codegear embarcadero

1302401

delphi	basic
i know the most basic examples from fitnesse is ported to delphi and comes with fit4delphi

1302414
delphi	basic
i know it is possible to use delphi together with fit fitnesse comes from the knowledge of fit4delphi and basic google-search giving lots of results stating that it is possible

1302427
value	field
my hunch is since i m using double value that the decimal separator is being misinterpreted as a field separator

1302427
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to connector versioning 6.1.0 but still no luck

1302430
selected	button	background-image	width
the code uses css clipping to selected the correct background-image from the sprite based on the width of the button

1302456
contains	elements
this object always contains an arrays of elements even if it is an empty arrays or an arrays with just one object

1302475
updating	updates
to building the updates statement dynamically only updating the changed columns

1302476
reflection	runtime
dynamic-typing usually being far easier to handle introspection reflection activities and runtime modification while adding the risk of runtime errors due to typos or incorrect object used in regular code

1302530
updating	updates
if you are using a pk to figure out which row to updates and it is a clustered key then i wouldn t worry about updating a column to itself

1302530
updating	updates
if you plan on doing massive updates i might hesitate to recommend updating all columns since it may cause fk lookup etc

1302537
checkbox	button
you can do removals in the same way with checkbox or a button next to each input

1302540
getter	setter
currently javascript getter and setter are possible only on

1302588
oracle	mysql
it works in oracle but to the best of my knowledge is not supported in mysql

1302592
phpmyadmin	heidisql
since you re on windows i can highly recommend heidisql over phpmyadmin for working with mysql

1302601
versioning	upgrade
the biggest reason for that is if you have multiple .applications that use the same libs and want to upgrade to a new versioning for one .app you can do that without affecting the rest of them

1302602
64bit	x86
alright it appears that it s an endian issue which still doesn t quite explain it since a little-endian x86 64bit signed int should fit in a big-endian 64bit int and vice versa they d just be corrupt

1302629
firefox	safari
it works in firefox just not safari

1302661
value	field
i ve been trying to have a field that changes value based on if the value of a yes no checkbox in the underlying query is true or false

you have to put the call to becomefirstresponder in viewdidappear instead of viewwillappear

1302768
python	ruby
maybe something in python or ruby

1302769
push	pull
now i want the origin topic to reflect the git-rebase .so i want to push but first i have to pull to make clone topic fast forwarding then i end up a merge which has all the original commit from clone topic with all the commit from origin topic on top

1302778
udp	tcp
effectively it looks like what you are trying to do is wrap some raw-data you already have in a file in udp or tcp and ip headers and then get the wrapped data output

1302778
udp	tcp
one quick and dirty way to accomplish this would be to transmit the data to a remote hosts could be nonexistant for udp though you d need a listening socket on the remote for tcp

1302778
tcp-ip	udp
this pcap would have your raw-data packetized data inside udp tcp-ip and ethernet headers

1302781
temporary	copy
of course you should evaluate if the temporary table and copy is required first

1302795
document	editing
those events which are insert using code templatess can be modified by editing the templates files they are xml document in the c program files codegear rad studio xxxx objrepos code_templatess delphi directory

1302809
variables	boolean
the boolean variables are not being used bool miatacreator registered os the linker is not pulling them from the .lib into the executable remember if there is no reference to a function global in the executable the linker will not pull them object from the .lib it only looks for object that are currently undefined in the executable

1302809
constructor	object
the linker knows about c++ object and constructor and should pull all global-variables as the constructor can potentially have side affects i know your bool does as well but i can see some linker optimizing that out

1302822
click	mouse
the listener is spared the details of process individual mouse movements and mouse click and can instead process a meaningful semantic event like item selected or item deselected

1302823
automated-tests	selenium
it might be worth considering selenium and running some automated-tests at the browser level

1302865
panning	pan
right now i m trying to design a kind of image panning tool where the user can pan an image in any directions within a viewing windows a fixed div

1302865

after the initial on mousedown and on mouse move i can t seem to release the panning with an on mouseup and the user can pan the image without click

1302889
linux	unix
i think this types of thing could be achieved on linux unix using the setfacl getfacl cmd but i m unsure on how to do this with os x

1302890
any	set
does each row have a different set of updates columns or is the set of columns updates the same for any given run but the list might vary from run to run

1302899
updatepanel	gridview
this will make exception-handling more apparent that otherwise seem to be swept under the rug because of the use of updatepanel that wrap around the detailview formviews and gridview on the list edit insert details listdetails page templates

1302906
value	field
storing the value in a field is the faster option

1302925
any	set
edit i don t get any error messages but instead of getting the expected result set i get an empty result set with a single column that has the same named as the function i am trying to call

1302926
hash	md5
but .when i try pasting anything other than iso-8859-1 into it it returns the same md5 hash

1302937
buffering	streaming
as long as you are able to continue providing audio data to the streaming before the read pointers arrives at the end of the buffering you wont hear these artefacts in the generator audio

1302958
32-bit	16-bit
32-bit were chosen because cpu engineers are fond of powers of 2 and 16-bit weren t enough

1302969
double	int
do the calculation using double and just convert the to int at the end

1302974
istream	std
how can i read from an std istream using

1302989
value	field
as for checked if an item is reserved i would as a field in the properties table to hold a boolean value

1303038
webserver	security
by taking control of the serving process into your own hands you avoid any problems with the webserver handling filetypes in unexpected ways you can use your own known-safe filenames and by having your scripting add a â œcontent-disposition attachmentâ header you can mostly prevent browsers from treating active content like javascripting as originating from your site s security context causing cross-site scriptinging problems

1303040
digits	short
i m sure that there s a crc32 implementation in python but that may be too short 8 hex digits

1303041
triggers	insert
create or replace triggers startuptriggers after insert on startuptest for each row begin insert-into startuptest value 99

1303043

if this website has been migrate from an earlier versioning of vs it might not be set up to run that way specifications

1303057
any	set
set the common stuff up as external references then any updates to them will be shared to the specific website

1303063

md5 is always 32 hex digits but an arbitrary substring of it or any other hash has the proper qualities of a hash equals value produce equals hash and the value are spread around a bunch

1303071
unique	words
for two string comparands the jdm calculation is simply the numbers of unique characters the two strings have in common divided by the total numbers of unique characters between them in other words the intersection over the union

1303072
any	set
you can t set a fixed or maximum height on any table elements

1303072
display	height
since it s no longer one of the display types in that case that will make it take the height

1303089
selected	checkbox
i want to send multiple ids that selected with checkbox to the controllers in this code

1303132
http	ssl
you have different layer you can apply security at in wcf the messages level meaning the contents is encrypted and checksummed and transport meaning the underlying connection is encrypted with ssl on http for instances

1303138
memcached	apc
xcache eaccelerator apc and memcached allow you to save items to semi persistent memory you don t necessarily know .when an item will expire in most cases

1303141
order	join
you need to actually join to the status table and then use the columns in an order by clause on the outer query

1303151
language-features	operators
operators should be considered language-features and not expected to translation well between different languages

1303176
selectedindexchanged	onclientclick
with onclientclick it containss nothing good but in some events like say in a gridview selectedindexchanged it will contains the new index or some other useful data

1303183
constructor	object
c++-cli has pass-by-value semantics for clr object not references but object themselves complete with copy constructor temporaries and their destructor etc

1303186
callback	methods
one of the things that the observers class methods does is test for a callback methods in the original model image in this case

rather than calculating line calculate the pixels under each finger

1303234
compact-framework	.net
i m building a small vb .app using the latest versioning of the .net compact-framework

1303244
digits	short
in computer jargon a single binary digits is called a bit short for b inary dig it

1303244
32-bit	64bit
terms like 32-bit and 64bit are talking about the longest address for which a computer can store and retrieve information

1303244
factors	digits
this applies to computers too but because they are binary machines instead of decimal machines adding an additional binary digits bit only increases the range by a factors of 2

1303244
32-bit	64bit
what all this means is that a 64bit computer can store and retrieve much more information than a 32-bit computer

1303248
web-config	app-config
if you use the system.configuration classes they will always pull from the active application s .config file app-config for executable web-config for asp.net website

1303270

how does lua compare to php python jsp etc

1303297
value	field
simple enough because my json defined the end of the value of the field and is a single quote

1303300
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	lua
using lua for web development is pretty rare...you could do it but it will be a lot more time consuming than using a language that has matured as a web developing language php or has good web related libs python ruby etc. if you do go with lua this means you may end up recreating the wheel a lot for what may be easily available in mature web languages

1303314
bufferedinputstream	inputstream
try bufferedinputstream which adds mark and reset functionality to another inputstream and just overrides its close methods

1303317

1303363
websphere	ibm
a link to downloading the ibm websphere mq

1303364
arrays	loops
size however is not a special methods and activerecord will load all the comments into an arrays in memory and then tell you how long this arrays is which may be unneccessary - if you re going to loops through the arrays of comments further down the page then you may want to use size to load them into memory because it will need to happen later anyway

1303365

postgresql	mysql
i don t need the entire database and have been looking at migrating postgresql to mysql which it seems lots of people have difficulty with

1303475
postgresql	mysql
wouldn t it be simplest to just dump the postgresql data into a comma-delimited text file and then import that into mysql

1303517
any	set
in fact strictly speaking the statement pick any positive int is meaningless as it cannot be done although you as a person may believe you can do it you are actually picking from a bounded set - you are merely unconscious of the bounds

1303549
javadoc	phpdoc
it s similar enough to javadoc that i found it easy to adopt and works nicely with the phpdoc engine

1303572
.net	wcf

1303619
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
you want to make a filename - is that on a case-sensitive filesystemd as typical on unix or do you have to cater for case-insensitive systemd too

1303624
directory	folder
would it be best to use virtual directory for all the folder that are identical for each site

1303637
progress-bar	progress
depending on the server server side language you could probably send some kind of progress info to the client to rendering as a progress-bar

1303650
constructor	object
if you re creating numbers and strings via a constructor such as you should keep in mind that typeof may return object for foo

1303669
any	set
asp.net themess let you not alone set css and images for whatever themes is selected you can use a .skin file to change any themesable properties of a .net control

1303672
pixels	line
also note that the physical text is going to look smaller than the text height you set because you need to factors in descenders--the parts of letters that go below the text line like lowercase g s p s y s etc. which is why you ll need to play with the exact pixels amounts if you change text size

1303673
mbunit	nunit
nunit borrowed this from mbunit

it may save you a lot of time to reinstall python using fink or macports then get the berkley package from either

1303689
powermockito	jmockit
the jmockit project home page contains a comparison with powermockito for those interested

1303697

1303750
internet-explorer	opera
but in internet-explorer opera it only redirects to index page index.php and doesn t save submitted information

1303765
contains	any
incidentally this should also obviate the need for the whitespace checked as a string that consists entirely of alphanumeric characters cannot contains any whitespace by definition

1303785
constructor	private
the common approach in c++ is to make the belonging classes constructor private and have them declare the factory class as friend

1303792
bytearrayinputstream	objectinputstream
new objectinputstream new bytearrayinputstream byte decryptedcookie .readobject

1303799
constructor	private
i would make classes a and b friend of xfactory and keep all their constructor private

1303805
recording	playing
assuming we break the task in to the recording and then the receiving and playing components then the following should help you with each side

1303808
constructor	private
if you were up for hacks and could not make your constructor private you could

1303808
constructor	object
have the constructor retrieve the global factory object and call it to validation the key

1303811
callback	methods
each buffering was played via the waveoutwrite methods and the callback from this methods was used to queue up the next buffering and also to send midi messages

1303817

python is a nice language but much bigger than lua and in the throes of a major revision transitions from 2.5 to 3.x

1303827
python	ruby	python	lua
ruby is less complex than python but more complex than lua

1303827
python	php
if you want a lot of stuff already built for you i can t advise you how to pick among php python jsp ruby-on-rails and .so on

1303827
python	lua
more on lua and python at which language is better to use lua or python

1303841
numeric	zero
as mark rushakoff already mentioned but didn t solve in his answer str n doesn t handle numeric n with leading zero which you need for kaprekar s operation

1303841
numeric	zero
you should also be aware that in versioning of python prior to 3 a leading zero in a numeric literals indicated octal

1303843

1303893
double	int
there is one propertiesmanager for each types of properties int bool double

1303893
highlight	selected
i guess i iterate over all the selected object and all their properties compare them and as soon as there is a mismatch i can highlight it

1303899
post-increment	pre-increment
my workmate claims that for object types pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment

1303903
python	java
the best example i can think of is python jpython where there is the original c implementation and a pure java implementation of the language

1303903
.when	ready
another benefit of c is the numbers of cross-compiling available you dont need to run the development-environment on the target architecture you can deveop and unit test on your favourite paltform ide .when you are ready you can then export your executable to the target-platform

1303906
dictionary	arrays
for backing store this class would keep the actual value in an arrays a dictionary a sqlite or something like that

1303906
attributes	properties
.so you ll want to make sure the object is accessible via a properties with a retain attributes

1303915
post-increment	pre-increment
.so unless you specifically must have post-increment because you re using the value before increment in .some way you should always use pre-increment instead

1303916
vmware	esx
this gives me a image that is 100 portable between workstation 6 fusion esx vmware server and vmware

1303926
cvs	git
transferring legacy codebase from cvs to distribute repository git or mercurial

1303931
lookup	any
even then it would still have to lookup child.parent in the database to know that it s the same entry that father represents .so there wouldn t be any considerable gain performance wise from this caching well on the ruby side it safes allocation multiple object but at the cost of the bookkeeping overhead but on the database side it should be basically the same

1303937
device-driver	hardware
be aware that building a systemd of this kind is a multi-year multi-per.son project requiring deep understanding of virtual-machine internals compilers garbage collectors hardware architectures device-driver writing and .so on

1303956
silverlight	wpf
silverlight can be viewed as a subset of wpf though this isn t technically correct

1303956
silverlight	wpf
whereas silverlight applications are actually integrated into the browser wpf is merely using the browser as a hosts for its process

1303956
silverlight	wpf
for a more in-depth guide on the difference between wpf and silverlight i would refer to this white-paper on codeplex

1303977
base-class	inherited
note that i m constructing the base-class capital a above rather than attempting to directly initializer its inherited member lowercase a drawing from your example

1303980
profiling	trace
the trace indicates that the problem is in the profiling controllers in the new methods

1303980
associations	model
to give you the rest of the details on the .app the model have the following associations

1303981
http	ssl
you may also want to watch out for the enforce ssl option as it will prohibit access to the page using the http protocols

1303981
put	get
regarding the untrusted certificate error much as david also said if you plan to put your site public you will want need to get a ssl from one of the trusted providers

1303988
http-proxy	squid
maybe you rather use a already existing http-proxy software like squid

1304012
directory	folder
if you make a folder called fscommand and put it in the same directory as your projector your projector s content can run batch-file in that folder

1304013
textarea	textbox
here is plugins to limit input to textbox textarea

1304018
javascript	dom
to actually remove elements from the dom you ll need javascript or not put the elements there in the first place

1304020
post-increment	pre-increment
notice the post-increment is defined in terms of the pre-increment

1304020
post-increment	pre-increment
usually this is construct a copy and then return the copy via a copy note the pre-increment can return itself by reference but the post-increment can not

1304027
configuration	installation
this methods gives us the best of both worlds as well as the ability to provide different default configuration for home and corporate customers - hints tips splash screens auto-updates and welcome dialog are all disabled by default for corporate installation but enabled for single users

1304045
display	height
a float left might be what you re looking for alternatively display inline but then the height won t work

1304097
antivirus	security
i have been running the zonealarm security suite antivirus licensed from kapersky and it kept giving me clean report on the infected apps right through till about five hours ago

1304101
contains	any
any query-string the site creates get lost and window.location just contains the location upto .htm

1304104
traffic	wan
if this is a wan you may find hardware solutions like riverbed s are more effective as they work across a range of traffic and don t required any changes to software

1304108
post-increment	pre-increment
seriously unless you re actually having performance problems due to calling post-increment instead of pre-increment the performance difference will only matter in very rare circumstances

1304108
post-increment	pre-increment
i seriously doubt that you ll have noticeable slowdowns iterator through a std vector with post-increment instead of pre-increment although i haven t benchmarking any stl implementation on this matter

1304127
updating	updates
then i would create updates procedure for updating the report database periodically say one a week from the main database

1304132
value	field
i have a field in datatable .if 1000 is the value in it i want to display it as 1000.00.then if user changes to 1000.50 it should display as it is.is there anyway to do this

1304142
silverlight	xbap
both are sandboxed but wpf-browser apps xbap can ask for more permissions but in silverlight you can t by design

1304154
initializer	setter
but the object initializer fails because named s setter is private

1304158
perl	ruby
since i don t know ruby here is an example in perl

1304173
initializer	setter
you cannot use object initializer and have an immutable object as object initializer required the properties setter to be public

1304173
constructor	object
per.sonally i don t think that would be a good design and i would question why you are .so keen on using object initializer instead of constructor

1304180
hide	show
i want to attach show hide text dynamically to a span and .when click on that particular text i want to have show hide effect on a fieldset below

1304180
hide	show
i acheived the task of having show hide text append to span

1304189
expression-blend	silverlight
i install everything else before the devex product visual-studio and sp1 the silverlight 3 tools expression-blend deepzoom composer silverlight 3 toolkit and the ria service

1304203
constructor	object
if the object gets too complicated for a comprehensible constructor you can also use builder-pattern

1304240
value	field
use navigationmove if dx some value if edit field not in edit mode

1304277
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
if you wanted mysortfunc to conditional sort as case-sensitive or case-insensitive while also still being thread-safe you would pass the is-case-sensitive indicator in the context likely casting on the way in and way out

1304292
arrays	loops
i have a long php arrays which i loops through and create a form with

1304294
hide	show
how to make it not show hide

1304309
stax	sax
if .so you just need a streaming api such as stax or sax - stax will probably make this significantly easier than sax but it isn t built into java 1.4 .so you d need an extra dependency

1304312
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
if your company can live with that fact and have a way on convincing all of your site users to upgrade to ie8 or even use firefox google-chrome safari opera then that would be better

1304325
push	pull
there are two ways to do notifications in an rpc systemd the push model and the pull model

1304358
webforms	asp.net
does anyone have any recomendation on how to implements pageing in asp.net webforms .when applying the mvp pattern

1304370
firefox	opera
yes i do because i use ie6 edit i use it in lieu of other ie s i browse exclusively with firefox and opera but sometimes i need ie

1304373
value	field
the insert will be a tiny bit slower and you ll lose several mbs in your hard-drive but it s nothing compared to the lookup time you ll waive .when searching for a value in this field

1304374
constructor	object
i want to make a constructor function that creates a documentelement object

1304374
constructor	object
as an example consider the new audio constructor - it creates a documentelement object and if you pass it some variables it populate the new documentelement with attributes

1304374
constructor	object
.so the question is - what makes a documentelement different from a vanilla javascript object of the properties value kind and can you write constructor for them like you can for object

1304387
python	ruby	python	java
most high-level languages python ruby even java use pass-by reference

1304390
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome have no problems display the pages

1304392
contains	set
for example in python the framework will contains what make install puts into the installation .so you get the same set of headers in the framework as you do in a regular unix installation

1304407
perl	php
is there a way to lock a file using php in a way that perl will respect

1304415
malloc	free
your approach not only has the disadvantage using more memory but also the disadvantage of being slower the callee needs to malloc the caller needs to free

1304418
32-bit	64bit
well what if you re on a 64bit machine where int and unsigned int remain 32-bit

1304420
iframe	popup
is it really necessary for you to use an iframe or a popup

1304425
javascript	dom
the document elements is not a plain javascript object is a dom elements object that implements the general dom core document interface

1304425
constructor	object
the elements is returned from the constructor function the object instances is lost anchor.constructor in the above example refers to htmlanchorelements instead of elementscreator and for that the access to the elementscreator.prototype is also lost

1304461
stderr	stdout
you should redirect stdout and stderr somewhere as this cmd apparently has no quiet mode

1304488
qtextdocument	qtextedit
however you can achieve this using a qtextedit qtextdocument

1304490
triggers	insert
insert a recording with no index_nr and then have a triggers manage the thingsâ in some way never worked with triggerss before

1304536
environment	building
my development and production environment required different database login credentials and right now i m manually changing the connection-string by hand before building for the 2 different environment

1304558
configuration	environment	environment	building
.when the building scripting is run it grabs the correct configuration based on which environment you re doing the building for.

1304576
perl	php
another possibility would be to instead of having the perl scripting write to a file let it write to a named pipe and have your php scripting read out directly on the other end and let it write to a real file

1304577
versioning	upgrade
as vonc said this is a jvm error and is reported fixed in the current versioning .so you should by all means upgrade

1304595
extends	final
and then i wish to extends the information in class a with the additional information and get the final class b

1304603
administration	account
i now want to let users edit their own account and provide administration access to edit anyone s account

1304608
any	set
is there any generics way to set this up

1304623
execution	exit
you can see this by execution a cmd and then checked its exit status by typing echo

1304623
execution	exit
getting an if-then-else loops here and checked the status for 0 for execution of scripting and any other value to exit the scripting totally with a suitable error messages

1304636
rdbms	acid
if you just want to persistent the graphing without using any of the features or properties you might expect from an rdbms solution such as acid then how about just pickling the object into a flat-file

1304673
versioning	upgrade
i don t understand that because ie6 has still got security flaws that makes it safer to upgrade to a newer versioning

1304701
keyboard	mouse
my only beef with 2008 r2 was the lack of bluetooth support which meant no keyboard and mouse for me...so i went for 7

1304702

i want to make a button that acts with the keyboard as with the mouse

1304715
selected	checkbox
i currently have an asp.net hyperlink for selected all numberofcheckbox which works but what i m looking to do is add another link possibly just a standards html hyperlink for uncheck selecteded numberofcheckedboxes and updates the value of numberofcheckedboxes as checkbox are ticked without reload the page

1304737
malloc	free
there a few questions on .so about malloc free versus new delete but all of them focus on the difference in how they are used

1304737
malloc	free
i often hear c programmers say that malloc and free are costly operations but i ve never heard a c++ programmer say this about new and delete

1304737
malloc	free
.so my question is how do the algorithms used by malloc and free differ from those used by new and delete

1304752
malloc	free
there s no real difference under the hood - usually the default new and delete operators will simply call through to malloc and free

1304768
packets	ping
ping on its own will send one icmp packets per second

1304785
copy-constructor	rvalue
in fact the following code fails to compile as expected because binding an rvalue to a const reference required accessible copy-constructor

1304788
malloc	free
often new and delete use malloc and free for memory allocation deallocation

1304788
malloc	free
anyway they must use some primitive for memory allocation deallocation - with overloading new and delete operators that could be something faster that malloc and free say it can be functions working on a memory pool for fixed-size object

1304790
show	next
i want the days that are not part of the current month to show up grayed out which it does now and i want it to appear as those are the days of the previous and next month

1304799
order	join
you might want to try reversing the order of the join to see if that affects the query plan for the generator sql.

1304804
realloc	malloc
if you have n bytes of malloc ated memory you can realloc m bytes where m n and thus throw away the last n-m bytes

1304804
malloc	free
to throw away from the beginning you can malloc a new smaller buffering and memcpy the bytes you want and then free the original

1304829
realloc	free
your entire 4k may be free and realloc may move your memory elsewhere thus invalidating any pointers to it that you may hold

1304840
realloc	malloc
if your block was allocated with malloc realloc will allow you to reduce or increase the size of the block

1304840
realloc	calloc	realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
this is a limitation of the malloc calloc realloc free api -- and implementation may rely on these limitations for example keeping bookkeeping information about the allocation immediately before the start address which would make moving the start address difficult.

1304854
radio-button	button
in the end i put the radio button into a listview and bind the isselected properties of the listview to the radio-button one

1304889
contains	elements
the toolbar contains button .so html elements

1304899
margins	padding
for example margins padding etc set to zero

1304916
continuous-integration	teamcity
we re currently using cruisecontrol.net as a continuous-integration server for a numbers of asp.net web project but we re also evaluation teamcity

1304936

1304988
textbox	button
i create the textbox declaration initialization adding them to the placeholder in another click button event

1304990
copy-constructor	temporary
seems like older g++ compilers can t pass temporary object by reference if there is no copy-constructor available

1305008
user-interface	drawing
if the stackoverflowerror seems to be coming from deep inside android s code for drawing your user-interface your user-interface is too complicated

1305024

1305072
children	nodes	children	tree
ideally i de like a tree object having only one nodes for identical children

1305078
constructor	object
c++0x standards removes the ambiguity and the reference is always bounded to the object represented by the rvalue not needing the constructor to be accessible

1305086
contains	sorted
however since the sorting is wrong each page contains entries that are incorrectly sorted

1305091
tokenize	parsing
it needs to be turned into the following parsing tree once tokenize

as far as converting the current pages to basic html i use jquery to capture the bar code scanner input and tab down to the next textbox or if there was only one textbox i tab down to the submit button and submit the form

1305184
boolean	double
if you follow the rules that you should avoid double negatives then simple single boolean are fine

1305184
selection	highlight
appropriate selection of the active flags .so that you specify only what is uncommon will then lead to highlight uncommon usages

1305201
value	field
the read_attribute function will return the database column value for the field

1305214

object-reference	instances
secondly the error you get object-reference not set to an instances of an object occurs because you re referencing an uninitialized part of the arrays

1305236
arrays	loops
ensure that the arrays is filled or at the very minimum full of empty strings obviously you need to run this loops in the constructor changing the variables named where appropriate because programdata is readonly as you have it

1305273
output	mode
luckily pthreads mode only output the variables

1305286
32-bit	64bit
is there a way from a 32-bit application running on a 64bit systemd to have access to the default folder for 64bit applications

1305286
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
for example using shgetspecialfolderpath with csidl_program_files from a 32-bit application returns c program files x86 if the same call was used from a 64bit application i would get c program files

1305286
32-bit	64bit
a related question here does not help shgetfolderpath 32-bit vs 64bit nor does supressing the wow64 filesystems redirection before calling shgetspecialfolderpath

1305290
query-expressions	linq-to-objects
i believe it s really useful for developers to understand at least the basic of what query-expressions do - the fact that they re basically translation into dot notation and that the language itself doesn t know anything about linq-to-objects linq-to-sql etc

1305298
google-maps	bing-maps
they ve spent a lot of time integration the google map control on their site but they didn t discover that to run google-maps on a http site you must license the control and it isn t cheap and the same goes for bing-maps

the editor implementsation for files which include java source code can be that you extends from the eclipse java editor and implements the extension points org.eclipse.ui.editors .add the file-extension to the editor extension preferences entry extensions

1305633
defined	declare
.so it s just a generalization removing the silly restrictions that functions can only be defined inside classes but keeping the idea that functions can see whatever variables are visible at the points where they re declare

1305656
ip-address	hostname
server_name returns the server s hostname dns alias or ip-address as it would appear in self-referencing urls

1305875
internet-explorer	doctype
this page states that using the doctype xml should be enough for internet-explorer 6+ to come through - but i have tried every doctype tag i could think of find in examples without getting the expected results

1305875
firefox	safari
the example above works fine as-is in firefox safari

1305919
sql-server	ms-access
if you want to connect to ms-access or sql-server ado would be the better choice since it s more native for these databases

1305997
perl	ruby	perl	php	perl	c++	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	c++	python	perl	python	java

you can add a new user-interface dialog box with textbox checkbox etc

1306023
any	set
do you know about any mature and efficient php toolkit providing a set of widget just like gwt does

1306069
member-functions	inline
if you mark everything inline which is automatic anyway for member-functions defined in a class definition then there is no need for the separation

1306082
diagram	erd
no need to put that on the diagram unless it has attributes on top of the join attributes much like you would generally omit a join entity from an erd unless it had attributes that weren t foreign key in the related entities

1306118
execution	jobs
my problem is that using the thread pool and 4 threads is much slower than doing the jobs sequentially having one loops execute by a separate thread is much slower than execution it directly in the main thread sequentially

1306126
java-wireless-toolkit	java-me
the java-me sdk and the java-wireless-toolkit both required that the generator wsdl be of the document literals types

1306140

this is what i want but the methods runs horribly slow .when the numbers of elements in the input sequences rises above 1000 and it gets progressively worse the more elements the input sequences contains

1306159
selected	textbox
i want to bind combobox the selected value to text in the textbox

1306163
mstest	nunit
you can create nunit mstest tests to drive them

1306174
subtract	add
if you re doing this for a calculation you can subtract datetimes or add timespan directly

1306179
selected	listbox
it would be easier with a simple listbox that allowed only one company to be selected because you could then set the link child to the company id and link master named of the listbox fields-for the subform control

1306231
webforms	asp.net
i m just wondering if you are creating a new asp.net webforms .app in asp.net 3.5 which would you recommend for url-rewriting

1306233
nokia-s40	midlet
reading around nokia forums it seems that accessing the cell id and related information from nokia-s40 series phones is virtually impossible unless your midlet is signed and even this would work only for s40 3rd edition fp1 and above

1306233
nokia-s40	java-me
i tried the following on a nokia-s40 dev platform 2 phone using java-me

1306234

use class.getfield to get the field then call setaccessable true on that field .so that you may write to it even though it is private and finally you may call set on it to write a new value

1306246
protected	public
the naming guidelines for field apply to static public and protected field

1306246
protected	public
you should not defined public or protected instances field

1306248

1306280
toolbar	tabs
click â ¼ tools on the toolbar to the right of the tabs

1306281
google-chrome	safari
aside from safari there is google s google-chrome that is based on webkit .so they would probably support these too

1306282
uitableview	uitextview
your list of similar words will probably be in nsarray format already .so it would be pretty easy to set up another uitableview instead of a uitextview to display the list and given that you already have this code working for the main uitableview you already know how to make them clickable

1306301
google-chrome	safari
shiira browsers on symbian s60 phones safari google-chrome are webkit browsers

1306305
strict	let
what i want to do is first to validation the entered value to the more strict types if it s a person that fills out the form and if that doesn t pull through validation it to the lesser strict types if it s an organization that fills out the form otherwise let the validation fail if it doesn t validation at all

1306317

1306328
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome and konqueror use webkit

1306328
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	opera
.so no neither internet-explorer nor firefox or opera supports the webkit css styles although of course firefox have their own extensions which are similar

1306352
protected	public
you can unambiguously find all references call hierarhy usages of classes or public and protected members - it is very valuable .when you studying the code of the project or going to change something

1306358
gridview	formview
item #1 and #3 are fairly close in my opinion as formview gridview are just controls and entity classes linq data sources could be used together in conjunction with each other also

1306365
getter	setter
like chaining many setter not getter which the methods you want to use essentially is

1306368
url-rewriting	rewrite
the url-rewriting takes an incoming url and rewrite it before passing the request off to asp.net or iis to handle

1306373

stylesheet-rendered raw-xml document appear always to be in quirks-mode .when in theory they should always be in standards mode regardless of doctype which are kind of antiquated and not used .so much in xml these days anyhow

1306386
profiling	trace
run a profiling trace on your database and see the query that s actually being run .when you query your view

1306389
contains	any
it makes sense as it s still part of the main form class but i assumed the separation between different files would inform vs2008 that it is simply a logic file holder of simply cmd and doesn t contains any gui form code

1306399
python	ruby
there is support for python and ruby

1306417
data-access	nhibernate
i started out creating tables and data-access logic manually but then i realized maybe this was something that a tool like subsonic or nhibernate could help with

at the moment i m making a user-controls for form elements called labelsedtextbox which contains a labels a textbox and a textblock for errormessages

1306500
mips	x86
gcc inline-assembly for x86 x86_64 ia64 powerpc 440 and mips 5k processor

1306525
firefox	gecko
for example firefox uses the gecko layout engine to rendering the pages

1306525
firefox	gecko
the gecko engine is used in more project than just firefox and since it s open source you could easily get the source code and try to throw it in an application

1306540
google-chrome	firefox
works beautifully in firefox and google-chrome but ie give an error

1306549
removeclass	addclass
you can also use addclass removeclass on the parent but be careful if you remove a class that you re using as part of the selector to find the child elements

1306560
instance-variables	class-variables
to summarize there are two types of variables associated with classes and object class-variables and instance-variables

1306560
instance-variables	class-variables
class-variables are associated with classes but instance-variables are associated with object

1306560
instance-variables	class-variables
class-variables function as default value for instance-variables

1306567
revision	svn
you can specify a revision range to merge using svn

1306567
revision	updates
after you ve updates all the revision i would edit the mergeinfo properties .so it holds the full set of revision

1306569
local-variables	stackframe	stackframe	alloca
for this to work you must be sure that the stackframe of a function stack passed parameters local-variables and alloca allocated spaces is always less then a page size otherwise you can skip over the guard-page

1306569
interpreter	runtime
but i m pretty sure that google will find useable code and helpers for this technique for all systemd as it is a pretty common technique for low-level programmers for example runtime or interpreter implementors

1306583
javascript	dom
watch the crockford videos for more on javascript dom issues

1306609
buildr	ant
browse .so a bit and you ll see buildr and gradlew both have issues too same for ant and ivy generally you re trading one set of problems for another and its a case of finding the least painful

1306645
attributes	properties
have you tried adding the prefix to the bind attributes either as the prefix properties or as part of the include e.g

1306653
tuples	set
you can however add tupless to the set because you cannot change the contents of a tuples

1306656
default	reset
for css cross browser compatibility a css-reset can help tame the madness a bit the goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line height margins and fonts sizes of headings and .so on.

1306692
tuples	set
a tuples is immutable .so it can be added to the set

1306694
value	field
the clock field stores datetime value using unix time

1306697
javascript	dom
if your javascript references any of the browser dom you ll also need to mock stubs those.

1306730
any	set
is there any way without naming all the relevant variables individually to cycle through all the currently set variables in php

1306753
asp.net-mvc	webforms
why not just go with asp.net-mvc and ditch the webforms methodology altogether

1306753
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc is a vastly superior framework over webforms it just required a bit more upfront work and has a learning curve

1306755
digits	base
since the numbers of digits in base 10 of an int is just 1 + truncated log10 numbers you can do

1306782
dictionary	arrays
to fix this you d just need to create a dictionary or arrays if you know the range of numberss that can exist to hold collections of vert hor dt td for each numbers and use those instead of the if yournum

1306783
bazaar	git
i for one have switched from bazaar to git and i ve been pleased

1306788
click	mouse
i have a windows form that has a datagridview with some private methods to perform validation of the datagrid and interpreting right mouse click on the datagridview etc

1306788
base-class	inherited
i then inherited from this base-class and customise it in various ways templates pattern defined the columns of the datagridview and particular formatting methods which are specific to those columns etc

1306789
subtraction	addition	assign	add
it is not sufficient if we just checked for overflow during the addition or subtraction because someone might add 1 to -5 and assign the result to an unsigned int

1306795
any	set
a crt monitor can be set up with most any resolution you like while a lcd monitor works best at it s max resolution

1306796
subclassing	base-class
virtual means that the methods may be overrides in subclassing but has an directly-callable implementation in the base-class

1306799
digits	base
length and digits are both properties of a physical representation of a numbers in a specific base a string

1306803

1306804
firefox	safari
i have a page which works fine in firefox and safari on os x and

1306813

1306814
hide	show
then .when the user sets the keyboard focus to it hide the windows and if the focus is removed and nothing is in the box then show it

1306821
lookup	any
no lookup of the hosts if any is performed and no scheme-dependent streaming handler is construct

1306835
deployment	install
then depending on the combinations of sections that are relevant for the customer install only the required jars on the jboss server for deployment

1306837
derived-class	pure-virtual	implements	abstract
a pure-virtual function or pure-virtual-method is a virtual function that is required to be implements by a derived-class that is not abstract - wikipedia

1306852
exception-handling	try-catch
in my opinion you should have try-catch blocks around anything that could potentially throw exception-handling if only to have a safe running systemd

1306857
promise	future
the php grouping has made no promise about the future of the serialization format and while it s unlikely to change in the future the fact that a single grouping controls the format means you may end up with future data that s unreadable

1306857
primitive-types	generics
json will only allow you to store generics primitive-types lists of primitive-types arrays and key-value pair object

1306859
emacs	vim
learn some more vim or emacs shortcuts

1306877
json	xml
many tools like xml json schema

1306879
pointers	stack
they usually grab the next instruction to execute from a stack if you manage to put in the next value of stack a valid instruction via overwriting the memory without creating execution pointers corruption or any other kind of corruption you can create an exploit

1306886
arrays	loops
.so i loops this arrays and add each myobject to another list then i m changing things in this new list

1306887
buildpath	libs
at this points i have added the external jar file to the libs section of the buildpath however .when running the jsp page on websphere in-browser

1306897
getter	setter
is there maybe a way to let the synthesize directive create other named for getter and setter methods which i then call easily

1306911
margins	padding
it s usually bad practice to mix margins padding with widths height

1306917
low-level	hardware
most use low-level hardware access to write various bit patterns to memory then read them back to ensure they are identical to the pattern written

1306924
c-strings	c++
it works on c-strings not c++ strings though

1306928
getter	setter
if you provide an implemnetation for the setter or getter it will use that instead of the generator implementation

1306928
getter	setter
its not hard to implements the retaining aspects of the getter and setter that are generator for you by the compiler .when u synthesize .so you can just write your own getter and setter i would say and go with that

1306929
contains	any
interestingly the would return the same height as long as the text does not contains any character

1306930
asp.net-mvc	webforms
our new user-interface extensions for asp.net-mvc will aim to bring the productivity of webforms to asp.net-mvc without violating any asp.net-mvc concepts

1306935

no luck - i can click on the two radio button all i want - nothing happens

1306951
selected	checkbox
now i m selected the three checkbox specifically by their clientid - this ought to be exact and get the right elements i thought

1306951
radio	click
i assumed that in the document-ready function i could hook up the click events on the two radio button

1306951
radio-button	checkbox
the scale down html only versioning is available at for anyone who might be interested - i expected to be able to click on the do limit radio-button and have it disable the three checkbox below it - no go -

by adding a pure virtual-method to your class you make the class an abstract-base-class

1306965
google-chrome	firefox
fyi tested in ie 6 7 8 compatibility mode on or ofirefox firefox 3 3.5 google-chrome 2

1306965

button	popup
and i want to make it .so that if you press that button it al.so sets a variables that makes it .so that if you try to leave the page it will popup one of those are you sure you want to leave this page alert to prevent people from accidently leaving while there is an upload going on

1308614
any	set
a primary key is a minimal set of columns such that any two recording with identical value in those columns have identical value in all columns

1308620
puts	gets
.when i run vscandemonstarter it puts entries into its different logfile the vscandemon logfile gets created but no entries

1308623
value	field
unique ensures that a field s value is unique among the rows in table

1308628
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch blocks have a negligible impact on performance but exception-handling throw can be pretty sizable this is probably where your coworker was confused

1308678
value	field
unique-key just imposes uniqueness of the column.a value of field can be null in case of unique key

1308725
digits	zero
digits is greater then zero

1308727
directory	folder
instead i see a directory view of folder files such as meta-inf web-inf etc

1308730
jpasswordfield	jtextfield
well aside from using jpasswordfield which is just a subclassing of jtextfield you could replace every character with on each key press and store the actual text in a string or an arrays of chars

1308731
attributes	properties
however i do not think that it actually cares about fk .so if you write the classes yourself or modify the generator classes to use entityset properties with attributes as describe in msdn you shouldn t have any problems

1308749
progress-bar	progress
if you email process can send back information then it may to possible to updates a progress-bar or progress text with the messages

1308760
python	php
i have been having .so much trouble doing this with libcurl and php that i tried doing it with urllib2 in python only to find that urllib2 cannot .post to http .when going through a proxy

1308762
stderr	stdout
a bit tricky if you want stdout and stderr combined in one file with stderr yet tee d into its own streaming

1308762
stderr	stdout
stderr is sent to a named pipe picked up by tee 1 where it is append to the logfile wherein is also append your cmd s stdout and tee d back to regular stderr

1308764
python	c++
not a direct answer but you could split the systemd into 2 process - the cygwin one python c++ no wxpython and the win32 one python wxpython and communication between them with rpyc xml-rpc etc

1308778
delphi	vb.net
if you can try consuming your web service using some of the development tools your customers will use delphi c# vb.net coldfusion hand crafted xml etc...

1308806
compile-time	dead-code
also you could try just doing and see whether your compiler is capable of evaluation the branch conditional at compile-time and removing dead-code

1308810
stderr	stdout
for .some rea.son it output everything to stderr instead of stdout and i d like to checked on its progress .so i find myself needing to redirect stderr output within a start cmd

1308822
jpasswordfield	jtextfield
imho the best way to solve the problem is to look how jpasswordfield overrides jtextfield and to make your own derivation of jtextarea

1308833
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the .app in question is a ports of a webforms .app over to asp.net-mvc as a proof-of-concept project

1308837
stderr	stdout
claft runs all the defined tests supplying arguments and input to each checked return codes and matching output stdout and error messages stderr against regular expression patterns

1308852
handler	service
first the handler your food service do not need to know each other

1308863
constructor	object
or an object can have some sort of id field generator in constructor - again .when you clone that you get two object with the same id which may lead to all kinds of weird failures in methods assuming that id is unique

1308868
constructor	object	copy-constructor	constructor
one final note even .when i do create the ability to clone object i don t tend to create a clone methods instead prefering a copy-constructor - a constructor that accepts another object as a basis

1308874
capacity	storage
in theory setting a larger capacity may change the allocation and storage strategy for the arrays although called nsarrays internally the structure is a bit more complex than that

1308892
put	get
if you can put the javascript right in your .aspx markup then you can get around the changing id s as well by doing this

1308899
reinterpret-cast	static-cast
in my case i had problems with directly reading the b1 c1 .so i had to do the double static-cast - the reinterpret-cast did not work

1308947
carbon	cocoa
but for older versioning of mac os x and because .app bundles aren t designed to be passed command-line arguments the conventional mechanism is to use .apple events for files like here for cocoa .apps or here for carbon .apps

1308950
constructor	private	constructor	object	contains	set
from that points of view since these object don t change and since there are a set numbers to begin with it makes sense to implements a single static collections contains all 52 possible card object and access these cards from other classes make the constructor on card private .so that it is impossible to create a card outside of the card class

1308958
for-comprehension	foldleft
the foldleft operators here written with its synonymous will be invoked on the object returned by the for-comprehension

1308960
activerecord	datamapper
it s obviously a datamapper instead of an activerecord

1308982
mac-address	ethernet
hard disk ids and ethernet mac-address are two common unique identifier used in systemd identification scheme

1308985
tabcontrol	panels
if you don t like the tab look you could extends the tabcontrol to not show the tabs or hack it together by placing the tabcontrol inside a panels just large enough to show the content but not the tabs and change tabs programatically in your menu control

1309001
order	join
to give an example where fast would be useful consider a join between a and b with an order by constraint

1309001
order	join
say evaluation the join b first and nested-loops a honors the order by constraint .so will produce fast results no .sort necessary but is more costly because of cardinality b has many recording that match the where while a has few

1309005
attributes	properties
using that plus the instancecontextmode properties of the servicebehaviour attributes and the ability to configure service throttling you should be able to get what you want

1309035
contains	elements
for instances they cannot contains elements

1309035
contains	elements
an elements may contains text other elementss or both

1309035
contains	elements
one thing that i dislike about wsdl is that most of the contents are contains in wrapper elements except for messages

1309058
filtering	sorting
a dailyreport has many different options for creating a view such as sorting ice cream types alphabetically by dollar value - or including an hourly breakdown - or optional including the temperature for that day - or filtering out certain ice cream types as a list

1309072
stop-words	trigram
english stop-words and then change the string into trigram

1309082
any	set
if you are anticipating any kind of traffic make sure to set maxclients in prefork configuration to about 20 starting out or else your .app passenger will crap out in periods of high traffic

1309100
keyboard	mouse
via user-input through the keyboard or mouse

1309101
silverlight	wpf
you say that winforms will requser-interfacered a learning curve for you - well you might as well use wpf then as it s a similar technology from the user-interface perspective as silverlight

1309117
any	set
set the base types of your tables to tablebase and if they have a properties of dateupdated that properties will become datetime.now as soon as any properties is changed

1309119
hide	show
i need to show both spans and hide the drop down after a user makes a selection

1309135
lookup	any
any good ideas for converting the coefficient lookup in numbertopoint into rock solid math without using modulo integer-division and sign a thousand time

1309166
type-safety	generics
you should really use however as it is generics and provides you with type-safety

1309170
ellipse	line	ellipse	angle
graphicspath.addarc does exactly what you ask it to do -- it the arc up to a line projecting from the ellipse centering at an exact angle of 135 degrees clockwise from the x axis

1309185
unique	words
in other words try to create a unique url each time you send a request via the xmlhttprequest object

1309206
silverlight	wpf
winforms and wpf are easier than silverlight .when you have to access a database because you can do it directly

1309235
contains	elements
the first sequences contains more than one elements

1309246
arrays	loops
if you created arrayss to hold each main menu piece maybe what the others meant then you could loops over the arrays and combine the arrays content some html and your variables to create the menu systemd

1309251
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i am using ruby-on-rails 2.3.3 rspec 1.2.8 rspec-ruby-on-rails 1.2.7.1

1309273
javascript	dom
why are you trying to change the stylessheet with javascript instead of simply applying styles changes directly to the dom where security issues are not raised

1309300
where-clause	sql
i m assuming this is in a where-clause at which points ifnull properties like value 0 is not valid sql since like evaluates to true or false and 0 is neither of those

1309306
firefox	safari
enhance your site progressively .so you can have a great design in ieâ and make it even better for those safari firefox users with things like css3 multicolumn or multiple background images

1309311
contains	elements	contains	set
do you want to actually set the opacity to each of the contains elements as well or you just want it to appear as if the child elements have the same opacity

1309315
constructor	object
i ve looked into wpf ui-automation automationpeers from an automationpeer you can get the owner properties which is the actual business object but it seems that you need to be in-process to use these as they all have constructor which required you to supply the wpf control

1309320
firefox	safari
wouldn t work in safari but worked just fine in firefox

1309321
contains	any
i believe that the path class should be an immutable types that containss a string known to not contains any invalid characters

1309333
dependency-injection	service-locator
you may decide to use dependency-injection or a service-locator to connect things

1309334
arrays	loops
.so the foreach loops through the first or containers arrays

1309345
arrays	loops
note that the difference is that the foreach loops basically assign each elements in an arrays to another variables inorder

1309347
recording	playing
the selenium-ide does what i need for recordinging and playing back the actions but i haven t found an easy way to recording timings

1309348
filtering	grouping
membership is an intermediary model connecting artist and grouping with some extra data date joined etc. i was asked to see if one could filtering artists by what grouping they re in but i can t figure out how to do that

1309357
vba	vb6
vb6 vba - 190 chars

1309363
.net	wcf
i am not using wcf for java to .net soa stuff or anything like that i know the concrete types will be on the other side of the wire

1309366
python	php
is there similar syntax to php s variables in python

1309367
csv	xml
it ll even put it into csv or a variety of xml based formats

1309370
packets	ping
the server gets the ping packets in both cases and therefore send the pong packets in both cases

1309392
margins	padding
you can do other things like set the corner radius margins and padding

1309396
any	set
for instances along with users we had a simpleusers object which held little or no relation to any other object and had a limited set of columns

1309407
contains	set
another alternative which is good .when you have a set of pre-canned report is to create a dailyreport resource that contains a list of preconfigured report links

1309410
contains	elements
that is important if data contains by the xml is defined from the hierarchy of elements contains it

1309410
contains	elements
as far as attributes go the general rules is to use elements to contains data instead of attributes

1309425
player	movie
you would need to write the player or perhaps modify an existing one there are several available to add another layer over top of the movie for the title and an audiotrack

1309430
shell	bash
can i embed the following bash shell code

1309433
glassfish	weblogic
if money was not part of the equation and i had an employer that insisted on spending money that wasn t mine i d still choose weblogic over websphere or jboss or glassfish or anything else on the market

1309433
websphere	ibm
websphere is a typical ibm project twice the cost half the functionality poor documentation and you have to buy all their nonsense eclipse based ides to use it

1309436
hide	show
i d like to do just this but still show and hide the messages at completion

1309441
stderr	stdout
for .some rea.son it output everything to stderr instead of stdout and i d like to checked on its progress .so i find myself needing to redirect stderr output within a start cmd

1309512
postdata	request
store the postdata in the session for the life of that request redirect

1309514
32-bit	64bit
i m al.so not sure what your proposed alternative would be - any kind of attributes to allow value to be mapped to uint would be inherently wrong because c# uint is guaranteed to be 32-bit regardless of the architecture and .so on 64bit platform to marshalling it correctly it would have to trim half of it losing data and likely rendering the result useless

1309528
wordpress	mediawiki
if i m having the user authentication in wordpress how do i read that session cookies with mediawiki such that the user then has permission to edit the wiki

1309547
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	er-diagram	er-diagram	diagram
the easiest methods of visualizing a database-design is to use entity-relationship diagram er-diagram and it also allows us to easily see what your design looks like without sifting through code

1309557
bazaar	git
any of git mercurial and bazaar are fine choices in general

1309557
bazaar	git
this .so question is about git mercurial bazaar on windows

1309558
.net	wcf
in wcf service and a variety of other .net apps i understand that app-config is used to specify settings

1309570
moss	wss

1309573
upgrade	migrate
do you need to migrate or upgrade data

1309580
filtering	grouping
is there a way in a report to filtering data by ad grouping

1309600
attributes	properties
i am trying to determine the types of a properties which an attributes relates to from within the attributess constructor

1309602
click	mouse
i think i am half way there i have a subclassing of nsoutlineview that allows me to catch the right click and display a context menu based on the selected row rather than the row the mouse is click on

1309612

or perhaps redirect stdin either in code or by a pipe .when running the unit test

1309624
postgresql	mysql
just trying out postgresql for the first time coming from mysql

1309626
attributes	properties
i don t think attributes .when initializer can know the types or properties to which they are being associated

1309626
attributes	properties
properties have attributes

1309626
attributes	properties
for each types in your set you can reflect to determine the attributess attached to the types or dive into attributess on the properties and if those attributess are your category attributes add to the dictionary

1309627
virtualenv	fabric
tools of the modern python hacker virtualenv fabric and pip

1309633
associations	model
as a side note - usually .when you see a user grouping model the associations is called membership

1309638
.net	wcf
any technology can be used here although for .net wcf would probably make this fairly easy and robust

1309657
contains	set
the second is a containsers with two subcontainserss each of which contains a set of one particular types of entity

1309673
pointers	stack
in my limited understanding are object not simply stored on the heap and pointers to them on stack

1309676
value	field
i don t know if it s worth the effort but i think creating a function that returns temporary table with not null field should work for the computed value

1309677
firefox	safari
the styles are exactly the same for firefox and safari

1309697
pointers	stack
then you just need to get your current stack-pointers as describe in other answers and compare the end of stack segment pointers to that address

1309699
sql-server	ms-access
i m using ms-access 2007 to view tables in a database through an .adp file that lies on sql-server 2000 and sql-server 2005

1309709
radio-button	selected
i need control 2 to know which radio-button was selected .so i can change the data.source for the dropdown on control 2

1309723
triggers	insert
you will probably have to use a triggers to checked that at least one is not null before allowing an insert

1309725
base-class	inherited
i wanted the constructor to initializer each specific side topside rightside bottomside leftside that inherited from the base-class side

1309753
uitableview	uiview
you could place a transparency uiview on top of the uitableview .when the search bar is active

1309759
parentheses	operators
since it is difficult to remember operator-precedence rules and the rules can be subtle it is often best to simply use explicit parentheses .when chaining multiple operators in an expression

1309797
postgresql	mysql
this ought to give you a mysql field -alike function under postgresql 8.4

1309816
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
the code works just as expected in firefox google-chrome opera but low and behold it doesn t work in ie 7 - i m not even going to bother with ie6

1309826
fcntl	fork
with this information you can either call fcntl fd f_setfd fd_cloexec on each open file-descriptor or alternatively you could call close fd on each file-descriptor after fork

1309857
order	add
the sum function will add up all rows .so the order by clause is useless instead you will have to use the grouping by clause

1309860
accessor	ivar
only exception-handling is if self ivar is a lazy-loading accessor and i already used it in the methods and i know it has been initializer and i don t want to checked if it is nil the 10 more time i use it in the methods

1309865
aggregate-functions	sum
the problem i see here is that sum is an aggregate-functions

1309873
32-bit	64bit
downloading 32-bit 1.5 python even if you have 64bit windows

1309879
versioning	upgrade
i can t upgrade to a newer versioning of jsw because they went gpl

1309882
value	field
if you disable viewstate on a page-level the value in the hidden field should remain relatively small.

1309924
attributes	properties
you might consider exposing a properties called viewname on the attributes .so the user can specify an alternate view to use in the case of an exception-handling

1309937
qsharedpointer	qlist
if you are using 4.5 you can use qt s qlist and qsharedpointer classes like this

1309939

google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
it seems to be working well in google-chrome and opera but in firefox i get strange rendering artifacts

1310036
checkbox	button
users see radio button and checkbox as checked but .when they submit the form the browser simply fails to send the postdata

1310040
any	set
bottom line the c abi doesn t have a syntax that allows for specifying that a methods or function takes a variables numbers of arguments with any kind of set of constraints on the arguments or their termination

1310051
exception-handling	error-handling
this example does not have error-handling and is assuming that an exception-handling is throw if the transactional needs to be rollback

1310061
oracle	mysql
modules are customized .so its fine if it does not work with oracle or mysql as backend

1310078
wicked-pdf	prawnto	wicked-pdf	prawn	prawnto	prawn
we tried all of those solutions prawn prawnto prince ruport and i think even pdf-writer before running into the wicked-pdf ruby-on-rails plugins and wkhtmltopdf

1310097
constructor	object
as another poster pointed out it is possible to do this by making one of the classes responsible for constructing the other and passing itself into the constructor for the other object

1310097
constructor	object
another object could potentially pass an existing reference to the first class into the constructor for the second class thus allowing an invalid situation the an instances of the second class now has a reference to an instances of the first class which references a different instances of the second class

1310098
sql-server-express	sql-server

1310114
erlang	ocaml
hi i d like to pick up one fp language it s always a pain .when you work in a positioning that does not required you learn much and after doing some research i felt erlang and ocaml are the two that i d really like to get my feet wet for the following reasons

1310114
fault-tolerance	scalability
i heard erlang is a great fix in scalability and fault-tolerance

1310135
any	set
for example if you set up a tabbarcontrollers and then navigate to any tab other than the first one there will be a gray box that says view and if you double click that you get to set up a view to go in that tab but it s just a view not a view controllers am i right

1310136

i prefer the has-many-through associations like what toby hede wrote

1310172
contains	any
the messages could not find a base address that matches scheme net.pipe for the endpoint with binding netnamedpipebinding. basically says it all - it would appear as if your server configuration does not contains any endpoint or base addresses that use the net.pipe binding

1310180
derivative	inverse
you are creating an inverse coupling that is convoluted confusing and contrived severely lacking in clarity failing best practices and object oriented principles which is going to create a maintenance and management nightmare for people implements derivative of your abstract-class

revision	updates
.so the user must be sure that he has updates the re.source being refactored to the repository location revision

1310437
hide	show
.when you pick an option you need to relocate the panels and show hide them

1310437
tabcontrol	panels
maybe not using panels or tabcontrol but some smarter way

1310437
hide	show
if tabcontrol is used most of the time how to hide and show the tab parts of the tabcontrol and how to set the margins and border size of the tabcontrol .so no big gap exists

since moving away from buildbot i ve been using cruisecontrol.net and i ve been happy with it to certain degree

1310507
updating	updates
building phases we have do consist of running unittests some functional tests getting code-coverage and making a report of those updating package database irc integration software packaqge creation and repository updates debian

1310530
revision	svn
you can use -r or -c to specify specific revision or ranges to merge as explained .when you types svn help merge

1310543
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
you can checked if a string contains any character from a given set of characters with strcspn

1310554
value	field
you may have to extraction the field value like this

1310562
oscommerce	magento	oscommerce	zen-cart	zen-cart	magento
this being said if you decide to miss on the extras coming from using an integrated cms e-commerce solution like drupal+e-commerce or drupal+ãœbercart you should probably not be using oscommerce anyway but rather look at something with a different codebase like magento or zen-cart which derived from oscommerce originally

1310568
html-select	selected
i ve got the following jquery code for getting the first character of the string value of the selected option of an html-select box

1310600
buffering	streaming
using streaming will remove the need to have large in-memory buffering holding the entire file at once

1310618
communication	messages
the book essential windows communication foundation suggests that if you need reliable messaging digital signature or resuming after failure then another option is to manually chunks the data into smaller messages and then reconstitute them on the server

1310620
32-bit	64bit
the reason is that std bad_alloc either happens .when you exhaust the memory spaces 2 or 3 gb on 32-bit systemd doesn t happen on 64bit systemd or .when you exhaust swap spaces

1310644
arrays	map
if only dynamic object move on the map then i just updates that object in the vertex arrays atlas

1310671
value	field
then you set the value in the new column based on this triggers and order by this field

1310678
keyboard	mouse
one major reason is that i find my hands need to leave the keyboard too much in ides as they required the mouse too often.

1310687
droppable	draggable
unbind all bubbles first then re apply the droppable object by simply recalling the init function for bubbles won t do any good because it looses the draggable tag

1310687
droppable	draggable
edit the actual question is if i defined a new droppable on an elements that already is droppable will it only change the options or will it apply a whole new draggable and double bind it

1310731
windows-vista	windows-xp
i am trying to detection three operating systemd - windows-xp windows-vista linux

1310731
windows-xp	windows-nt
is there any chance for it to show windows-nt 5.0 for windows-xp in pre-sp2 or pre-sp3 configuration

1310733
internet-explorer	firefox
i could ask them to spell it out instead of using acronyms like ie or firefox but internet-explorer uses msie as its identifier doesn t it

1310736
git-repo	repo
we maintain both a central svn repo and a git-repo then things are bit more complicated because

1310736
svn2git	git-svn
a simple git-svn will reproduce the svn branches actually simple directory with copies in it .so i would recommend using svn2git and git2svn

1310737
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
you happen to move your hands out of the keyboard less to hold the mouse drag it here and there and click

1310755
sql-server	oracle
for instances in dutch governmental areas oracle has been really strong but sql-server has established quite a user base as well

1310778
jquery	.post
most of jquery user-interface uses the same general format for destroying the binding and setup done or altering options .post setup

1310778
any	set	instances	destroy
as far as performance goes i would think think any performance hits from double binding can be avoided if you destroy the old instances first then set it backup or just change an option in the draggable

1310819
autodesk	revit
i am using ironpython to create a shell for a plugins api to autodesk revit architecture 2010 to speed up learning their api

1310844
.net	wcf
it has a walkthrough and a sample visual-studio solution using c# soap wcf on .net 3.5

1310849
arguments	default
read-line takes an optional arguments eof-error-p allowing it to return either nil default or a user-specified value eof-value on hitting an eof instead of signals an error

1310860
substitution	replace
the short answer is you can t the replace task always uses an empty namespace even if the substitution file s nodes has a namespace

1310890
if-statement	loops
add an if-statement to the above loops checked for class equality

1310896
any	set
let s say this variables could be set to any value between 1 and 10

1310902
textbox	onblur
i know there is the onblur client side event and that there is no lost-focus event .so how can i cause a postback to occur .when my textbox loses focus

1310902
textbox	onblur
it involves adding a custom event to a textbox subclassing and registering a client scripting which call the server-side event in the onblur javascripting client event

1310921
directory	folder
after creating addin project vs creates addins folder in visual-studio 2008 directory of your s project directory

1310945
windows-applications	silverlight
some of the clients include silverlight applications whereas others include web and windows-applications

1310947
defined	declare
the way you are doing it you declare some operators that are in namespace foobar then you defined some completely new operators in the global namespace

1310951
value	field
now if i use change event it triggers only after text field value change and it losses focus and if i use keyup event it will start validation as soon as he start filling the form

1310955
selection	cell
you need to change the selection mode to single cell

1310956
build-server	nant
nant to do building on the build-server

1310958
any	set
if math mark english mark for any row then it will set that particular row color as green.can you pls suggest me how to do that

1310967
sql-server	oracle
if an application asks for oracle or sql-server or whatever it s because it relies on the implementation details of this specific vendor to run its sql its stored-procedures etc

1310977
getter	setter
unfortunately this approach doesn t work with properties getter setter as there is no such concept in javascript at least not in every major browser yet the only way to get properties getter setter to work is to let the silverlight runtime be the one creating the wrapper for my class

1310981
value	field
change is good if your field has its value changed because of the user changing a value of another input like in a multiple dropdown questionnaire

1311033
updating	updates
both of these are visible and updating at the same time - whilst the video is playing the graphing will updates at regular intervals to show data relevant to the current location in the video

1311053
compact-framework	.net
final thought express isn t your only option for free .net development there is also sharpdevelop which has some advantages svn integration compact-framework support over express

1311060
contains	any
you can adapt the lightbox to contains any html

1311064
contains	any	value	field
a primary key should therefore under normals circumstances never contains value that have any meaining in your domain often automatically incremential field are used for this

1311068
aspect-ratio	scale
how can i scale a div to fit inside the browser view ports but preserve the aspect-ratio of the div

1311078
rollback	commit
if you chose to implements two-phase commit you d required write-ahead logging for each participant in the transactional where you log actions before you ve taken them allowing you to rollback any changes if the transactional fails

1311123
sql-server	oracle
by default we tried to support both sql-server and oracle

1311135
windows-xp	windows
i have just completed moving my c# asp.net web application from visual-studio 2008 running on windows-xp to visual-studio 2008 running on windows 7

1311136
authentication	login
then you overrides the login methods and add your other authentication there

1311152
transcoding	flv
i d like to process a large numbers of files - think video transcoding like youtube where you have to transform everything into flv format or image-processing where you create thumbs from large raw files

1311159
libxml2	lxml
my favorite xml process libs for python is lxml which because it is a wrapper around libxml2 also supports full xpath

1311166
constructor	object
cmybool x from binary sadsido change the return-type of longfunction to cmybool which can construct from a bool return from longfunction will construct that object .so just set a breakpoints at the constructor will work

1311168
mouseover	mouseout
.when the height of the goes beyond max-height and the vertical scrollbar appears hovering over the elements triggers mouseover but if i move to the right to the scrollbar and start scrolling with the mouse the mouseout event never fires

1311185
shell	bash
cmd shell the cmd-prompt on windows sh bash csh etc on unix and scripting languages can all trivially do the same operations for all files matching some pattern

1311190
required	checked
monitor the process might required some thought although it should be possible to keep an eye on a shell task that you have created or at the very least checked for a file in the output directory that you are expecting to have been created

1311228
value	field
it seems that pivot can t be done on a numbers types field value

1311235
any	set
this means you d only see the selected working set at any one time

1311237
malloc	free
in xcode run- start with performance tool- shark. however in this case i feel reasonably certain that the primary problems are the per-pixel malloc free the floating-point arithmetic and the two methods call in the inner process loops

1311237
malloc	free
to avoid the malloc free you want to be doing something like this instead

1311242
ostringstream	std
and i ve tried std ostringstream which seems to work for most value if i do stream.precision 16

1311249
filtering	grouping
a reason to put it in a table as opposed to writing it to a logfile is that you can use sql syntax to filtering out grouping calculate average time etc

1311304
keyword	term
or how can i tell lucene to treat or as a search term not as a keyword

1311321
private-members	object	defined	declare
in plain english if i have a class with a methods that gets called very often and this methods defined a considerable amount of temporary data either one object of a complex class or a large numbers of simple object should i declare this data as private-members of the class

1311334
required	checked
if you decide not to include the use of the value attributes you will be required to cycle through each option and manually checked its value

1311362
init.d	pid
start will start your service and recording the process id in a known location stop will kill the process with the pid from the file you created and then place it in etc init.d

1311364
contains	set
add all your constants to a std set then you can checked if the set contains your string with

1311366
contains	elements	contains	any
i think the call to contains is necessary in case you have any root elements with no children - i would expect the indexer to throw an exception-handling if the specified key doesn t exist

1311367
contains	set
.when using configparser module i would like to use value contains of multiple words set in cfg file

1311368
double-quotes	single-quotes
i know that using single-quotes around a string in php is faster than using the double-quotes because php doesn t need to checked for variables presence in the single quoted string

1311374
put	get
in the module s code you will put the statements that will get the image and return a link to it

1311386
filesystems	fat
while linux can work from fat you could just create another partition on the usb stick which will be ext2 or any other non-journaling filesystems and let linux work on it

1311399
constructor	object	callback	methods	arguments	default	subclassing	superclass
you could create a default callback superclass which takes a loadingmessage object arguments in its constructor and provides hook methods for subclassing onsuccess0 and onfailure0

1311406
background-color	height
overflow visible .solves the problem but makes the wrapper have no height .so that the background-color and borders aren t visible which is part of it s function .so that doesn t help either

1311416
emacs	vim
actually a good text-editor like vim and emacs i personally use vim is fairly enough for php development i think

1311422
itemtemplate	databound
did you try the above methods .when adding databound controls in the itemtemplate

1311435
autotools	gnu
as kristof already pointed out gnu autotools inherently support out out-of-tree building at the configure level

1311474
rhino-mocks	moq
i don t know about moq but in rhino-mocks you can make something called a partialmock which allows you to mock parts of a object but leave the other alone anything with a expectations on it will be mocked

1311500
sequences	unique
you haven t told us anything about your database structure but since you are successfully allowing people to add links you must have a sequences defined .somewhere which keeps tracking of an int id for the link .so that every link can be given a unique id in the database

1311513
python	java
.when i run a python scripting from the below java code where an input file is given as an arguments to the python scripting as well as an -v option i get a ioexception

1311515
attributes	properties
if you are running a sun viewmodel you have an mbean with named java.lang types runtime which exposes the attributes viewmodelnamed whose value is the same as systemd properties java.viewmodel.named

1311516
tcp-ip	udp
network cards and router have a tendency to prefer tcp-ip package above udp

1311517
display	outline
be the outline view s delegation and respond to outlineview isgroupingitem tableview isgroupingrow for a non-outline table view with yes if the item row is a grouping and should be display accordingly

1311528
cursor	row
if this doesn t work or you cannot straightforwardly limit the inner query to a single row per outer row it would be possible to carry out a row-by-row updates using a cursor

1311530
instances	self
self refers to the instances of the current class that you are working in and yes it is analagous to this in java

1311530
instances	self
for example if you are writing an instances methods on a class and you want to call a methods on that same instances to do something or retrieve some data you would use self

1311530
getter	setter
this is al.so often used for acces.sor methods on an instances setter and getter especially with setter methods if they implements extra functionality rather than just setting the value of an instances variables .so that you do not have to repeat that code over and over .when you want to set the value of that variables for example

1311556
margins	padding
a css-reset to make sure all margins padding borders etc are the same in all browsers

1311556
.when	ready
then .when that specific elements s html is ready and looks good in a style-less browser i start applying the css

1311563
any	set
this is good practice for any large set of files you have to organise

1311564
instances	self
self is an implied arguments to all objective-c methods that contains a pointers to the current object in instances methods and a pointers to the current class in class methods

1311564
callback	methods	instances	self
if you declare a c++ methods for instances as a callback from some c libs you won t get self or cmd

1311580
elementtree	lxml
elementtree supports xpath queries just like lxml

1311580
elementtree	lxml
elementtree is include in the standard-library but lxml is faster

1311588
profiling	debugging	debugging	exit
in the dim dark ages of software engineering one often used a profiling tool to achieve that since profiling inject extra code at entry and exit of all functions although i must say that this is a pretty dismal approach to debugging and .when i used it it was a desperation move not front line

1311589
floating	overlap
i cant figure out how to maintain the menu on the right without floating it or making the grid elements respected the menu and rearrange due to its width they simply overlap

1311603
packets	lan
you ve already said the network is private lan which eliminates one of my suggestions the other is to make sure the network is switched - a hub could easily lose packets

1311622
postgresql	firebird	postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	firebird	oracle	firebird	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	firebird	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
out of the box it supports sql-server oracle mysql firebird postgresql and a few other databases

1311630
sql-server	oracle
then you could have different implementation of your dao layer one for oracle sql-server etc.

1311630
entity-framework	nhibernate
i d take a look at nhibernate or entity-framework

1311660
coalesce	isnull
aside from isnull on sql-server i m a big fan of coalesce since that takes any numbers of arguments

1311671
32-bit	64bit
on the plus side this approach allows to provide the user transparently with both 32-bit and 64bit binaries unlike any libs methods that have been proposed

1311675
ref	out
the getpositionlist may be badly designed and simply create a new arrays for you essentially meaning that the libs author should have used out instead of ref

1311686
pixels	line
then .when the next printing job is sent it would output a single line one pixels wide of garbage and printing the new page

1311688
interop	tlbimp
did you create an interop dll using tlbimp

1311688
ref	out
normally an out modifiers is used if the callee initializer the passed-in data and ref if the data is to be initializer

1311728
panels	grid
hi i have a problem in my jqgrid .when i am click the panels the grid size is not resizing .how to resize it

1311738
coalesce	isnull
here s some difference and other explanations about isnull and coalesce

1311740
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
for example for a 8bit cpu stack size is expected to be 8bit wide and 16-bit cpu vs 16-bit stack width and 32-bit 64bit cpu and .so on

1311750
postgresql	mysql
mysql is a .solid database and .so is postgresql

1311750
postgresql	mysql
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

1311763
16-bit	8bit
a 8bit cpu 8bit databus 16-bit addressbus

1311763
pointers	stack
there is a stack-pointers and a instruction pointers the stack-pointers having 8 explicit and 8 implicit bits stack is always in the same 256-byte region and thus the stack-pointers register having 8 bits the instruction pointers having 16-bit

1311764
lookup	any
is there any better algorithm than sort o n log n and lookup middle elements or mean of two middle elementss if an even numbers of items in list

1311767
directory	folder
here is an example configuration that will generator the standalone application in the target appassembler folder and generator the jsw wrapper files in the target appassembler jsw myapp directory

1311770
contains	any
like org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui.prefs which contains any non-default value for cvs settings

1311776
revision	svn
problem svn diff with -r x head x being the first revision of script.pl produces a diff between the first versioning and head while -r x-1 head tell me the file script.pl is unknown in the revision x-1 which is actually correct

1311778
16-bit	8bit
the basic use of stack is to store retrieve return addresses and on 8bit processor these are actually 16-bit value

1311778
16-bit	8bit
pushes a 16-bit value the contents of the two 8bit registers h and l onto stack

1311789
python	php
i m thinking of switching from using php to python for web-applications but i was wondering if python is as adept as weaving in and out of html as php is

1311789
python	php
fundamentally the question is is working with html with python similar to working with html with php in terms of ease-of-use

1311789
python	php
edit i guess to help clear up some of the confusion in the comments below i get the intuition that php would be better than python at organizing the front-end presentation part of a website while python would excel at the back-end part the actual programming...

1311789
python	php
the question is - am i wrong and is python just as good as php for front-end

1311789
python	php
and in that scenario php and python are on an even fighting field and it s probably up to my own programming language tastes

1311823
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
write oracle mysql sql-server etc. plugins as necessary for the individual database platform you want to support

1311823
stored-procedures	ado.net
ado.net makes it fairly easy to wrap sprocs .so you might be able to move the platform dependent layer down into .some stored-procedures presenting a more-or-less consitent api to the middle tier

1311828
python	php
that said python is much easier than php

1311828
python	php
if you want php nothing is more php than php itself and python takes different approaches .so maybe you re going to be frustrated because things are not like you re used to

1311855
factory-method	decorator
this required a factory-method which decorator is

1311866
textbox	onblur
it involves adding a custom event to a textbox subclassing and registering a client scripting which call the server-side event in the onblur javascripting client event

1311885
value	field
is there any way populate an access form s text field s value using sql

1311895
.when	ready
to get around this i would do the parsing on a background-thread this should allow your indicator to appear .when the parsing is done ahve the parsing object send a messages to your viewcontroller .so i t knows its ready to show the tableview

1311899
16-bit	8bit
note that the terms 8bit 16-bit etc are a little arbitrary and aren t really tight definitions .so this complicates any attempted definition of width

1311906
value	field
if the new field value indicate that the caching entity differs from the current entity as would be indicated by a change in content-length content-md5 etag or last-modified then the caching must treat the caching entry as stale

1311908
python	php
if you were to progress onto a asp.net-mvc web framework you would find that actually both php and python use html in a similar way

1311918
required	checked
- implements ionexception-handlingaspect and implements onexception-handling to checked exception-handling types and if retry is required use the methods invocation eventargs object from the original call

1311922
value	field
value of a list of field named

1311946
perl	c++
i don t know whether a similar strategy would work in c++ but the following perl code does work

1311964
flash-video	flowplayer
i have a web .app with flash-video on it using flowplayer and it doesn t work on mobile-phones

1311970
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
my asp.net web application works fine in internet-explorer but in firefox and google-chrome i have a problem where httpcontext.current is defined but httpcontext.current.session is null

1311973
firefox	safari
if i m not using the css grid-system i use a css-reset the one provided by eric meyer as it gives you the best possible starting points and the least trouble .when trying to develop for ie7 ie8 safari firefox

1311980
python	php
you can t easily compare php and python

1311980
python	php
the use to put php where i want is not really an appropriate way to judge python as language for building web-applications

1311980
pylons	django	turbogears	django	turbogears	pylons
a framework like pylons django turbogears etc. separates the presentation html templates from programming from database access

1311980
python	php
if you want to switching from php to python you must do the following

1311980
python	php	python	java
folks who ask questions like python - substring java and python equivalent of php #39

1311980
python	php
s foreach arrays as key-value what is python equivalent to php _server

1311980
python	php
are sometimes trying to map their php knowledge to python

1311980
put	get
beyond that it starts to get murky how much power should be put into the tag language

1311980
template-engine	mako
is the middle are jinja and mako where the template-engine can do a great deal

1311987
exception-handling	try-catch
.so it appears that the jvm needs all exception-handling classes to be defined .when the program starts running and not .when they re needed .when that particular try-catch block is reached

1312007
floating	margins
see the specifications for full details but things like absolute positioning floating and a few other things will prevent margins from collapsing

1312007
floating	margins
note that floating and the other cases prevent margins from collapsing to simplify the specifications you re entering complex territory for little gain

1312007
margins	padding
your fallback option of using padding instead of margins or applying any kind of intermediate spacing like the 1px padding i describe earlier are better choices

1312013
directory	folder
the rea.son for this is that .some maven plugins can t cope with a directory that is outside of target .so the m2e devs force the folder for compiled classes to be target classes and target test-classes no matter what you configure in eclipse

1312026
directory	folder
.when you packaged your code into dynamictestjar.jar star wars fan you are you didn t get the path right because you didn t zip up the directory contains the folder dynamictestjar .so the path that the classloader sees is incorrect

1312036
debugging	trace
to test the second case create your soap-client with the trace option set to true inorder to gain access to the actual xml answer from the server via client- __getlastresponse afterwards you can use this for request debugging also via __getlastrequest

1312043
expander	grid
i would like the grid to stretch to accommodate the expander and i would like the listbox only to fill the grid

1312055
children	nodes
find the numbers of all children of the current p nodes

1312077
network-interface	lan
opening up perfmon i can see that it has a performance counter called network-interfaces which can be used to collect stats on a chosen network-interface mostly lan cards but i cannot see my dial up connection in the list here

1312080
culture	locale
working in terms of culture rather than locale is an attempt at finding the correct level of abstraction mdash

1312080
culture	locale
they re similar in intent just culture is trying to find the abstraction sweet spot that locale dramatically missed

1312087
http-get	put
using http-get .post put and delete we can operate on these resources

1312098
32-bit	64bit
it s not too hard to start the 32-bit versioning by default checked if you are on a 64bit systemd and then restart the 64bit versioning

1312100
document	editing
i m editing a vb.net .app for a mate and part of the requirements are to copy merge field from one words document to another

1312109
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i added a clientaccesspolicy.xml and a crossdomain.xml to the webroot c inetpub wwwroot

1312112
32-bit	16-bit
wchar_t is a c++ defined types that is 16-bit in visual-studio but is 32-bit in various gcc compilers

1312113
default	reset
you can modify the bounds to over maximize which is handy for custom google-chrome windows with shadow and you can also set the application to reset to a default size if the maximize button is click .when it s already maximize or do nothing

1312114
value	field
make sure you ve got the right data types on the field and that you can successfully run an insert-into that table using just those two value

1312137
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

1312144
arrays	map
get all the input map the arrays to just get the value change the arrays to a javascript arrays and join

1312158
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

1312167

web-services	security
that is .software libs to handle things that are horizontal to all the development teams in our department security web-services logging messaging and .so on

1312396
put	get
you could possibly create your own subclassing of properties which overrides setproperty and possibly put but it would probably get very implementation-specific.

1312401
arrays	loops
remove the generics arguments from your arrays and your loops should work although you ll get a warning

1312416
constructor	private
there are a few different options about creating singleton mainly due to as3 not having private constructor

1312418
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox

this will required the belongs_to associations to be set up on the building and company model

1312546
authentication	login
assuming you re using asp.net application service to perform user authentication it s the only tech i know of that ll work here your basic strategy could be to call the validateuser methods which will perform a login and instruct the silverlight control to include that user session info in the soap headers then make call to wcf service

a network request such as yours would mean you have to wait for the image to load which would hang the user-interface while waiting and thus annoying the user

1312648
value	field
i assumed that the key-value for the validation dictionary needed to correspond with the value that is provided for the field releasedate in this case but that does not seem to be happening for me

1312652
contains	elements
the local.config should then just contains an appsettings elements

1312704
versioning	upgrade

i strongly agree with cutrisk - stage the whole thing somewhere else first install release versioning upgrade to beta open it for internal testing etc. then carefully roll it out to customers

1312855
controllers	routes
this is likely due to some file types not mapping to a controllers in your routes

1312855

1313054
spaces	output
the only spaces we use is what is required for storing the output o c + r

1313054
spaces	output
therefore the algorithm takes time linear in the size of the matrix and uses spaces linear in the size of the output

1313056
exception-handling	try-catch
at the points .when the exception-handling is being throw you should have a call stack available to you in the debugger -- by looking at each stack frame from the points of the throw to main you should be able to find the first frame with a try-catch block wrapping the call to the next routine in the frame

1313056
exception-handling	try-catch
as long as that try-catch block handles the types of exception-handling being throw that s where it ll land

.net 3.0 was mostly a few new dlls wpf wcf and wf added into .net 2.0

1313101
.net	wcf
is there any reason you have to use wcf instead of the plain soap web-services that .net 2.0 supports out of the box

1313101
.net	wcf
while i understand it s frustrating to use the older technology i suspect you ll have fewer problems by going down the relatively mainstream path than somehow cobbling together a wcf implementation on .net 2.0

1313285
constructor	object
once i got that it was a few more mins to figure out i had to set my object to a string or something else but i m opting for a string since i m just going to spit it back out into a textbox anyway since an object doesn t take a constructor

1313310
ip-address	hostname
you could drill down to more specific details like udp ports 53 and mx recording or you could go sideways with terms like ip-address hostname and url

1313311
postgresql	mysql
to further elaborate on this points say most of my development is done with mysql as the underlying storage mechanism for my data if i avoided vendor specific functions -- unix_timestamp -- in the construction of mysql statements and used a abstract db object that has a common interface moving between mysql and maybe postgresql or mysql and sqlite should be a simple process

1313311
arrays	loops
why do this if in your controllers your creating another loops to iterate over that arrays and assign it to the view

1313333
.when	ready
.when the data needed for one action is ready then that action continue

1313334
double-quotes	single-quotes
another points of view i ve come across but i m not sure i subscribe to is to use single-quotes for characters which are strings but ord chr are quick picky and to use double-quotes for strings

javascript	dom
is there a libs which has all that but which works fine with 3rd party javascript libs that are sensitive to dom extensions

1313429
perl	php
what i m wondering is whether your webserver is correctly configure to run php but not correctly configure to run perl

1313450
platform	anycpu
note that if you have one for anycpu you probably want to remove that platform altogether as it won t be safe

1313478

in my source file i create the constructor for my class and i d like to initializer all the object in my arrays

1313579
constructor	object
if these object are not being construct with a zero-parameter constructor i am told these need to be put in my initialization list

1313579
arrays	loops
my question is if i want to use a loops to initializer this possibly large arrays of object that wouldn t go in the initialization list would it

now the feature creep is asking if i can hide or show tabs and other controls based on the user s database permissions

1313604
constructor	object
you are not able to loops in an initializer-list however there is no issue with loopsing in the constructor body .so long as the object types has a valid assignment-operator

1313604
constructor	object
the object in the arrays will be first initializer using their zero-parameter constructor before the constructor body

1313604
constructor	object
also note that if each object in the arrays is to be initializer using the same non-zero parameter constructor you can use an std vector types and in the initializer-list specify the default non-zero constructor to be used .when allocation the internal arrays ie

1313608
directory	folder

1313954
ggplot2	lattice
i ve been experimenting with both ggplot2 and lattice to graphing panels of data

1313956
python	java
all this kind of makes me wish that python exception-handling had the cause attributes by default as in java which lets you pass exception-handling into new exception-handling .so that you can rethrow all you want and never lose the original .source of the problem.

1313969
output	mode
the plant can run in one mode per day .so i am writing a function that will add up the different modes chosen each day that best maximize the plantâ s output and best aligns with the sales forecast numbers provided

double	int
by reading the text i am getting an impression that unless you explicit specify the arguments types by either using cast or function-prototypess function argumentss will always be passed as either passed as int or double

1314060
double	int
my guess is c and numbers were both converted to int and double on the function-call and were then converted back to-char and float

1314061

1314086
double	int
based on the promotion rules you quoted earlier it promoted char to int and float to double and decided that the signature is

1314094
double	int
as for char and short becoming int and float becoming double that refers to the default types for implicit function-prototypes

1314094
double	int
it default to int for int value and double for floating-point value

1314095
beautifulsoup	mechanize
you might also try beautifulsoup in addition to mechanize

not much experience with windows 7 but i can tell you that it took some time to get the installation procedure for windows-xp and the associated development tools documented on our team

1314189
display	outline
however .when this is display i can still see the outline of my gridview

1314206
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl	erlang	perl	erlang	python
python php ruby erlang perl

1314210
contains	set
hide the control itself with the visible properties set to false or hide its parent control the contains panels

1314214
document	editing
one of the requirements of the document is it be protected to avoid editing

1314254
configuration	installation
i can imagine installation will be done this way in future as complicated security configuration can be done automatically

1314270
teamcity	msbuild
i m aware of .some of the build-tools out there cruisecontrol.net teamcity and .so on and al.so that vs project .csproj etc are just msbuild files

1314282
.when	ready
passing a function to lets you supply code to be run .when the document is ready meaning .when the page itself has loaded without necessarily having loaded external resources like images stylesheets et cetera for which you wouldn t want to have to wait

1314287
push	pull
now the developers push and pull from their own local git repo to the central subversion repoitory but still get all the cool power of git

1314291
build-server	msbuild
also just to clarify we also use an automated build-server hudson with .net plugins that uses msbuild to automate the process

1314300
code-coverage	build-process
it makes like a lot easier and it can do extra stuff like run until tests or code-coverage tools or whatever as part of the build-process

1314301
command-line	tasklist
perhaps you could execute tasklist on the command-line and parsing the arrays of line it output

1314326
contains	any
and if you are now saying to yourself but application xml doesn t contains any information about available hyperlink then i say bingo

1314326
json	xml
that s why i don t think application xml and application json are appropriate media-types for rest

1314326
json	xml
i m not saying don t use xml or json just don t use the generics media typename

1314336
firefox	safari
as far as i know both firefox and safari can not work with kerberos in a sharepoint context for the time being but why is that and should we expect that both firefox and safari will play ball in the sharepoint 2010 timeframe

1314339
authentication	login	button	popup
.when i click the button a user authentication request login popup requiring an additional login to conclude the operation

1314345
shell	bash
in bash shell create a function in your .bashrc file

1314350
arguments	default
as far as i can tell the queryset arguments which default to yourmodel.objects.all overrides this ability for initial empty forms to be created

1314351
postgresql	oracle
the closest i ve heard is enterprisedb where they have built a layer on top of postgresql .so it looks more like oracle

1314351
sql-server	ms-access	sql-server	oracle	ms-access	oracle
for example ms-access wouldn t be able to imitate much of the functionality for oracle or sql-server whereas there s a much better chance of sql-server imitating a simpler db like access

1314382
contains	any
would any of you know why javascript can t find and replace strings contains spaces in the url

1314385
value	field
in these cases the field username is only going to have a value if one is set

1314390
spaces	output
passing the output of find loses the distinction between spaces in file named and separate files

1314410
hash	md5
a non-optimal solution would be to have a database of md5 hash of all or selected important files and verify it again at startup

1314416
environment	building
the reasons upgrade from cc or hudson to ahp vary from company to company but some typical answers include the ability to setup self-service deployment with access-control by environment the desire to chaining multiple building workflows together the built-in dependency-management the artifact repository or the ability to pull together data from a bunch of different tools building across the lifecycle

1314418
value	field
you re calling removecriterion with the value for the field but the regex is looking for

1314418
key-value	key
+ criteriontext which will only match on the key for the key-value pair

1314426
any	set
you can configure it .so it runs the django test server for you and you can set breakpoints on any line in django .source or your own code

1314426
python	c++	python	java
the thing i like about eclipse is that once you get used to the environment you can also it for c++ java javascript python and flex coding

1314426
bazaar	git
at some points .when i can figure out a good mirroring scheme i ll switching to mercurial git or bazaar but for now this works pretty well

1314427
value	field
you should generally be able to do an outer-join from parent to child and checked for a null value in a field in the child that is not nullable

1314430
lookup	any
there also does not appear to be any way to lookup a contact individually based on its phone-number

1314435
loading	png
with this change i began to use setimageresource setimagedrawable for the dynamic loading of the new image in my 2 imageview before sliding through pages i am using png files sized for hvga display

1314439
gethashcode	equals
note .when overridess equals you also have to overrides gethashcode

1314441
bazaar	git
mercurial with hgsubversion git with git-svn and bazaar bazaar-svn all have an option to synchronized with an upstream svn repository

1314483
arrays	loops
.so why not read it at top of your code into an arrays and loops through this arrays to building the thumbnail list

1314484
expression	evaluation
need to use an expression evaluation engine for a .net project

1314487
authentication	login	authentication	logout	logout	login
all this stuff compiles clean and the authentication stuff works login logout register

1314512
linux	osx
lastly i m on osx .so you can treat this as a linux problem if that helps

1314530
temporary	copy
as it is the compiler is able to elide the copy .when you are passing a temporary object

1314530
temporary	copy
if operator+ has pass-by-value semantics the compiler can elide the pass-by-value copy the compiler knows that the temporary will get destructed right after the second operator+ call and does not need to create a different copy to pass in

1314544
blacklist	whitelist
have you checked your application-settings for server whitelist blacklist stuff

1314545
keydown	keyup
if i add a handler for keyup and keydown to the button itself and set the event to handled it will swallow the event if i hold down the spaces and let go but not if i just tap it

1314549
execute	prepare
the way query parameters work is that the query is sent to the database server .when you called prepare and parameter value are sent later .when you called execute

1314559
function-pointers	virtual-functions
i d guess they re either talking about the non-virtual interface idiom nvi or they re talking about building a dispatcher table of function-pointers which is how one might implements polymorphism virtual-functions in c and in fact is how c++ compilers do it behind the scenes

1314566
ioexception	writer
in this case as the methods writer you ve broken your end of the contract because the user gave you valid input but you couldn t complete their request due to an ioexception

1314587
required	checked
the alternative would required that choosing permutation i involved looking for permutation i+1..n to checked if permutation i is part of the solution consisting of the maximal numbers of permutation

1314587
required	checked
that d required enumerating all permutation to checked at each step which is prohibitively expensive

1314596
pyside	pyqt
pyqt s license isn t compatible with the project and pyside isn t compiled cross-platform yet

1314602
value	field
instead i thought it d work to set the value of the input-field to blank if the field was focused

1314648
.when	ready
i then commit to svn using git-svn dcommit .when the whole big changes is ready

1314649
binary	hex
the input file is read in binary and the output file is written as ascii hex

1314653
highlight	selected
afterwards i d like for the person and properties that they selected to fade out not be highlight

1314662
capture	player
i m assuming that the onclientclick event should change the height and width properties defined in the and tags but since the object is flash i assume the flash player capture the click rather than report them to the browser

1314721
virtualenv	fabric
you can use python virtualenv and pip see also tools of the modern python hacker virtualenv fabric and pip

1314729
any	set
is this simply any class that represents business rules - since the words domain usually means rules that are specific to some local problem set such as how to calculate income taxes

1314732
groovy	scala
can someone please explain the major difference between scala groovy and clojure

1314740
findstr	cmd
you can use the built-in cmd findstr to match the

1314749
dependency-injection	inject
by using dependency-injection i can inject this into each component that required it

1314760
groovy	java
groovy is a bit like scripting versioning of java

1314760
python	ruby
scala is an object oriented and functional-programming language and ruby or python programmers may feel more closer to this one

1314760
haskell	scheme	haskell	lisp	scheme	lisp
clojure is a dialect of the lisp programming language .so lisp scheme or haskell developers may feel at home while developing with this language

1314765
any	set
the solution turned out to be very simple and was set as the default operators and if any of the n-gram didn t match the whole query failed

1314767
arguments	default
in iso c an iso-syntax prototype overrides default arguments promotion

1314768
groovy	java
obviously the syntax are completely different groovy is closest to java but i suppose that is not what you are asking for

1314768
scala	java	groovy	java	groovy	scala
if you are interested in using them to scripting a java application scala is probably not a good choice as there is no easy way to evaluate it from java whereas groovy is especially suited for that purpose

1314794
stderr	stdout
0 1 and 2 will refer to its own private stdin stdout and stderr streaming respectively

1314796
keyboard	hid
the scanner is configure as hid human interface device and emulation keyboard

1314804
32-bit	64bit
turns out that visual basic components built-in 64bit windows silently fail to run on 32-bit operating systemd vista xp windows 7

1314804
32-bit	64bit	environment	building
don t know whether it is the vb compiler the cab generator or signtool but if you building it on 64bit it will run fine in a 64bit environment but fail to install with no messages in a 32-bit environment

1314812
32-bit	64bit
sse sse2 etc will have 64bit registers and 128bit registers even on a 32-bit systemd

1314832
execute	prepare
i store the question of the user and use the following functions to sanitize the user data prepare it and execute the sql cmd respectively

1314834
put	get
edit you can get the binding of any of the methods as follows but even with it i m not able to eval successfully be sure to put this at the top

1314835
xsd	xml
this wouldn t be a problem in other case but my xml must adhere to a strict xsd schema .so i need to do it like that

1314837
constructor	private
if you have access to cryptoapi on windows the idea is that you use cryptoapi call to generator rsa public and private key sign and encode a new x509 put it in a memory-only certificate store and then use pfxexportcertstore to generator the .pfx bytes which you can then pass to x509certificate2 constructor

1314842
hide	show
you do not lose much by doing this as most things that do not support icommand cannot leverage the hide show enable disable anyway

1314874
boolean	int
any difference in size between and int and a native boolean types is really going to make little or no difference to your application s performance or the kb size of your database

1314883
variables	boolean
if you create a boolean variables for every button and updates it with mouse pressed release events then you could just look at the value of the relevant boolean .when the timer goes off

1314891
difference	count
counted_ptr may or may not delete itself .when the reference count reaches 0 another potential difference from objective-c

1314902
background-position	background-image
set it as a background-image and manipule the background-position

1314915
any	set
any request that achieves a writer lock through enablesessionstate being set to true though will block writes and reads on the session state information until the request holding the writer lock completes

1314931
set	bag
one alternate approach i would suggest is that once the validation is successful set a flag in the session properties bag of the list with the document guid as the key and in the final landing page deploy a custom web part that will checked for the this guid and if there is a value then it will display the messages

1314935
file-descriptor	pipe
as to what is a file-descriptor at a very high level it s typically just an int that the os translation into a way to communication with a file object or a socket object for network communication or a pipe to communication between processes.

1314936
keyboard	mouse
most of the keyboard mouse or basic user-input events are awtevents

1314946
mime	rfc
you need to use mime mail header extension defined in this rfc

1314952
swing	awt
more to the points awtevent is as the named implies the superclass of all the built-in awt event classes while event classess in other parts of the standards libs including swing descend from eventobject directly

1314953
processor	cpu
you should really be focusing more on learning how to program than about the internal workings of your processor and why you can t access more than 4 gb of ram on your 32-bit cpu

1314963
exception-handling	try-catch
the try-catch block is the correct solution though you want to catch ioexception not all exception-handling

1314969
updating	updates
you could verify this by updating the db from within your .app then checked for those updates with the cli

1314971
groovy	java
groovy is a dynamically typed language whose syntax is very close to java with a numbers of syntax improvements that allow for lighter code and less boilerplate

1314971
scala	java
scala is a fully object oriented language more .so than java with one of the most advanced types-systemds available on non-research languages and certainly the most advanced types systemd on the jvm

1314971
scala	java
scala can compete directly with java and give it a run for its money on almost all aspects

1314998
executable	jar
how does the jvm make it s windows i know it has it s jar files and the executable etc..

1315001
any	set
you ll also want to thoroughly checked any user-roles and permissions that can be set with in the application its self

1315003
export	csv
does any one know what software will produce a .db file and what software will allow me to open it and export it as a csv or mysql file

1315004
swing	awt
the two official java gui apis are swing and awt

1315004
swing	awt
swing is built on top of awt but is a far more extensive api for designing usually desktop applications

1315005
positioning	sidebar
or should there be no sidebar div doesn t that imply styles positioning anyway

1315008
postgresql	mysql
it might be mysql might be postgresql might be sqlite -- file will tell you

1315014
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp	windows-server	windows	windows-server	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-vista
on windows 7 windows-server 2008 r2 windows-vista and windows-xp with service pack 2 sp2 the ability to send traffic over raw-sockets has been restrict in several ways

1315014
windows-server	windows-xp
these above restrictions do not apply to windows-server 2008 windows-server 2003 or to versioning of the operating systemd earlier than windows-xp with sp2

1315017
annotations	mapping
as far as mapping goes jointable annotations is mostly used for many-to-many mapping or somewhat uncommon unidirectional one-to-many mapping

1315024
base	zero
you can simply value-initialization the base and all its members will be zero ed out

1315041
enumerator	any
often .when iterator through a string or any enumerator object we are not only interested in the current value but also the positioning index

1315046
python	ruby
you ll more than likely find similar results for other languages python ruby and others

1315054
synchronous	.when
but .when clients are expecting the results to return synchronous most of the time synchronous stateless service components are just fine for the job

1315060
short	zero
each fork is labeled with a zero or one which the planning commission call the binville intersection tracer or bit for short

1315060
32-bit	64bit
worse .some citizens hadn t yet updates their addresses to use the new 64bit format .so they were forced into a walled-off section of the city reserved specifically for those still using 32-bit addresses

1315063
jquery	.post
either jquery or proxy.php isn t happy about mixing .post and get parameters

1315073
contains	elements
i think the best methods is to contains the elements in a block level elements and do

1315079
google-chrome	firefox
if http 1.1 403 then web browser firefox ie google-chrome ... will ignore whatever

1315079
google-chrome	firefox
if http 1.1 403 then web browser firefox ie google-chrome ... will ignore whatever

1315081
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
for this i placed all the release in dealloc and didreceivememorywarning with a nil checked to avoid releasing nil

1315108
jquery	.post
jquery s ..post methods encapsultes an .ajax call with the types option set to .post

1315134
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	opera
looks and works perfect in opera but as for internet-explorer it looks terrible and it looks fairly good in firefox

1315147
ubuntu	debian
for debian and ubuntu systemd you would similarly edit etc apache2 envvars

1315155
unique	words
how can you search only unique words with php such that i can learn the basic in making the search

1315156
shutdown	exit
the idea is that my thread will wait in waitforsingleobject instead of in readfile and .when the main thread wants the slave thread to go away it will signals on that object the slave thread will wake up and exit and then the main thread can continue its shutdown sequences

1315157
value	field
if you don t wish to specify a value for a field just place a in the

1315159
hyperlink	external
i got it working for the file types but how do i redirect to an external link like www.yahoo.com if it s an hyperlink

1315179
textbox	button
for example if you had 2 textbox and one button on your form than you would defined an iviewinterface with two properties for textbox and upon a button click event you forwarding the call to presenter and the presenter can have access to those two properties

1315184
telnet	tcp
can you telnet from the offending workstations to the tcp ports that the sql-server is listening on

1315209
silverlight	wpf
i spend most of my time doing silverlight control development now .so this properties works in wpf and silverlight-land and doesn t use coercian or anything fun like that

1315249
uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
i have a stack of uitableview managed by a uinavigationcontroller

1315280
any	set
they are a logical set of functionality business-logic that isn t related a instances of any particular types

1315280
configuration	environment	configuration	logging
service provided by the environment context eg logging configuration sometimes

1315286
contains	elements
the useful thing here is that the arrays class knows how to search through all its elements and create a new arrays contains only the elements that match

1315297
contains	set
the silverlight-toolkit is a separate package contains a larger set of controls that don t ship in the sdk partly because they re less mature and partly because the toolkit updates more often

1315314
licensing	gpl
is there any technical and or legal solution to embed a standalone gpl component in an iphone application without licensing the whole application with a gpl license

1315317
linux	unix
to be able to have access to all the unix tools at least under linux macosx from inside the r environment has rapidly become invaluable in my daily workflow

1315328
background-image	background-color
you should be able to supply both a css background-image and background-color

1315329
lightbox	jquery
jquery lightbox

1315346
directory	folder
also suppose you want the folder c dev to be your source code directory on each of the windows installation

1315346
configuration	installation
that will free up your disk configuration and avoid test software interfering with your windows installation s

1315355
background-image	background-color	background-image	transparency	background-color	transparency
as i remember if you set background-color and background-image that would not work with transparency pngs over the transparency you will see background-color

1315361
udp	tcp
technically udp can be fragmentation into multiple ip packets - but lose one of those and the entire udp is lost as opposed to tcp which will re-try

1315361
any	set
.so any udp packets that you sent a may get lost b may be split into multiple mtu-sized ip packetss and c if one of those packetss is lost then you will automatically lose the entire set

1315367
response	timeout
the client only closes the socket as a result-of a timeout or the underlying network connection being disconnect or in response to user action that required that the socket is closed application is closed page is refreshed stop button pushed etc.

1315370
carbon	cocoa
in os x there exist several environment cocoa carbon java x11 and each environment has its own apis

1315370
carbon	cocoa
cocoa and java are object oriented apis whereas carbon and x11 are based on functions

1315371
order	add
.when you use the sortable you will have to add a custom handler for the event updates which sortable offers here you will then have to get the order value of item that was move and those below it and then updates them in the database using an ajax call

1315396
lookup	any
the systemd call implementation to lookup a file-descriptor should be fairly efficient if the systemd is any good

1315431
hidden	reset
you could work with the visual tab order to either put your hidden focus-capturing control before or after the reset button

1315448
scheme	lisp
lisp scheme was what we were tasked with using back in uni

1315473
blacklist	whitelist
remember though it s not just elements but also attributes on allowed elements you need to allow of course you should work to an allowed whitelist of elements and their attributes rather than try to stripes things that might be dodgy via a blacklist

1315473
owasp	xss
there s also the owasp antisamy project which is an ongoing work in progress - they also have a test site you can try to xss

1315479
tokenize	parsing
if your aim is to learn the techniques behind parsing and tokenize maybe it s better to write one yourself from scratch

1315487
vhdl	ada
ada and its cousin vhdl directly support the concept of units

1315491
contains	elements
notice the youarehere class attached to the li elements contains the questions text

1315517
any	set
can you set any kind of memory hardware breakpoints on the value

1315534
derived-class	base-class
i have a base-class a and a derived-class b

1315535
order	join
generally any column in a large table that is frequently used in where order by or especially join clauses should have an index

1315586
order	add
as i said my example does not add up 2x9+48 523 5 doesn t result in 29485235 but i wondered if there is an algorithm that would actually allow me to find such a formula consisting of the source numbers s digits in their original order which would upon calculation yield the original numbers

1315586
sqrt	pow
on the types of math used i d say parentheses and add sub mul div pow sqrt

1315596
factors	primes
a partials solution solving some cases would be to factorize the numbers into its primes factors

1315596
factors	digits	factors	primes
if its primes factorss are all the same and the exponent and factors are both present in the digits of the numbers such as is the case with 25 you have a specific solution

1315601
contains	any
you cannot use the contains gpl executable in any other way than with your application

1315616
factors	primes
if the divisor is not a power of 2 in general contains primes factors not shared with the base of representation

1315616
factors	primes
repeat cycle length will be driven by the largest primes factors of the dividend but not connect with the length of the representation of that factors -- see 1 7 in decimal but the first cycle length may differ from the repeat unit 11 28 1 4+1 7 in decimal

1315631
windows-server	windows
kerberos is supported by the product but its actual behavior within a windows network is determined by the current implementation used in windows-server today

1315631
firefox	safari
for the client side that s entirely dependent on the development priorities in the firefox and safari teams

1315636
factors	primes
i can give a hint - repeat decimal in base ten are all fractions with the denominator having at least one primes factors other than two and five

1315636
factors	primes
if the denominator contains no primes factors two or five they can always be represented with a denominator of all nines

1315636
factors	primes
if there are primes factors two or five in the denominator the repeat part starts not at the first positioning

1315663
digits	base
2 9 4 8 is far too large to store all the digits directly although in base 2 it s pretty obvious what they are

1315673
python	perl
for very simple parsing where speed isn t a high priority i might hand-code the parsing in perl or python which have good text-manipulation facilities

1315673
bison	yacc
the most commonly-used ones are antlr coco r and lex yacc and the gnu implementation flex bison

1315677
python	perl
i have c# python and perl readily available

1315691
click	mouse
this way not only would you be saved from mass click but also the user would know that there is no points in killing the mouse

1315703
windows-server	windows-xp
64bit support comes from iis 6 which is part of windows-xp x64 and windows-server 2003

1315705
python	java
maybe python or java are better choises

1315741
python	java
i am not very familiar with java but i can say python is very well suited for the job

1315743
python	perl
but have you considered writing it in perl or python

1315753
python	ruby	python	java
if you are comfortable with ruby i see no reason to shell out to java python et el

1315758
any	set
i d like to know if there s any way to force the system.net.dns class to resolve hostname using a set of custom dns servers instead of using the ones that are associated with the main network connection

1315760
url-rewriting	rewrite
the mechanism behind this kind of behavior is called url-rewriting and can be implements in apache with the mod_rewrite -modules and in iis with either helicons isapi_rewrite lite or one of the non-free alternatives offered by helicon for iis 5.1 and 6 or with the microsoft url rewrite module for iis 7

1315760
httpd.conf	.htaccess
mod_rewrite .htaccess in your document-root directory or somewhere in your httpd.conf

1315779
htmlspecialchars	echo
for html output you can at least save some typing by defining a function with a short named that does echo htmlspecialchars ...

1315779
value	field
naturally there are domain-specific checked it is worth doing on particular field and there are useful cleanup tasks you can do like removing all control-characters from submitted value

1315782
groovy	java	python	java
if your scripting involves any text-manipulation or calculation you might want to consider groovy or python instead of the shell or java

1315784
directory	folder
.when i run the file inputfile is null - this suggests that the directory contains the test folder is not in the classpath

1315789
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
doing the same with an existing database systemd like sql-server oracle interbase or mysql would performance still be high enough

1315800
value	field
the field should only validation .when the value is-empty or exactly 3 uppercase letters

1315800
value	field
if i enter cba which should work i m getting this expression as the errormessage where abc is the value the field has from the datasource

1315829
expression	evaluation
but it is easy to building a recursive-descent parsing by hand for boolean expression that computes and returns the results of evaluation the expression

1315846
duplicates	contains
since entities are uniquely identified by their partitionkey rowkey combinations a context like the tables cannot contains duplicates partitionkey rowkey combinationss

1315858
shutdown	restart
or is there any other way in windows-server to send email about shutdown restart event with getting the reason entered by user

1315874
development-environment	enterprise
on large-scale java .net enterprise project does every developer need to have all the components libs dependencies in their classpath local development-environment inorder to make it building

1315877
deployment	install
small executable easy deployment msvcrt is there since win98 and i don t have to bundle few mb c runtime with my install

1315879
endpoint	uri
that being said there are plenty of reasons why you might want to have some of your configuration in an external xml file not the least of which is in the use case of configuring your service destinations and endpoint where you may have a need to be able to change the endpoint uri without having to recompile your application

1315886
classnotfoundexception	classpath
your question isn t very clear but i think the answer is that every class your application needs has to be in the classpath or the classloader with throw a classnotfoundexception

1315901
uiscrollview	subviews
to display these newly created views in your uiscrollview you have to add them to it as subviews

1315907
httpd.conf	.htaccess
just add an include directive in your httpd.conf file or use .htaccess to your project s apache configuration

1315921
distance	polygons
my first thought was to get the bounding-box of the polygons then measure the distance of each vertex from the corners of the bounding-box

1315942
conditional	operators
if a race conditional occurs calling ++i then internal operations of the ++ operators will look something like -

1315950
local-variables	function-call
once you make a function-call the program counter gets stored on stack alongside your own local-variables .so that .when the called function returns the calling function will know where it left off.

1315962
contains	set
on a site like wikipedia for example the greek versioning contains its own complete set of articles and the english versioning contains another set of articles

1315977
autoscroll	panels
you could put a picturebox of whatever overall size required onto a panels with autoscroll set to true and then draw everything you need at once onto the picturebox using a graphics object

1315978
nhibernate	ado.net
this is done by getting nhibernate to create an idbcommand for you filling it with parameters and calling its executenonquery methods in the usual ado.net way

1315979
pointers	stack
others include stack or frame pointers the current location of the execution function s stack frame the program status words information about the results of the current instruction and data registers

1315979
low-level	hardware
there is a lot more that goes into running your program and i ve only skimmed the surface of the low-level hardware bits but the questions you raise really required a textbook for a complete understanding

1315995
bgi	sdl
this is the bgi over sdl subsystem

1316005
windows	ms-dos
the introduction of windows added another header to the format to tell ms-dos that it couldn t execute the executable since it needed to run under windows

1316005
executable	upx
it would be at a size where upx would actually result in bigger executable

1316005
windows	ms-dos
next is the pe header which windows will recognise and use instead of the ms-dos header

1316009
difference	zero
.so the answer is in cases simple enough for the compiler to figure them out and optimize it makes zero difference

1316035
paintcomponent	draw
i need to draw a graphing over a jpanel by overrides the jpanel s paintcomponent methods

1316054
wamp	php
i have my php scripting running on the wamp server

1316056
scala	java	python	java
i m pretty ignorant of the java world i do mostly c python but scala looked interesting enough to pull me in

1316060
put	get
step 2 get the height and put in

1316062
python	c++
i haven t been using python for all that long but i try to handle specific exception-handling in a try block and use else to handle the other exception-handling i might not have expected similar to a default block in c++ switching blocks

1316078
web-config	app-config
and you must also register your new configuration section in web-config app-config

1316083
internet-explorer	firefox
the reason i asking this is because i was told internet-explorer renedering of the page is slightly different .in other words if i put img tag in a page and rendering it on internet exploerer and rendering on firefox maybe the coordinate of the img will slightly different because of margins page border

1316093
google-finance	yahoo-finance
i am building a web based trading systemd where buy and sell signals would be generator by reading quotes from either yahoo-finance google-finance or the exchange nse of india itself.my first preferences would be to fetch data from this url

1316099
installation	building
best approach building a patch by diff ing the changes in the repository by checked out a part of the repository and using svn diff then applying the patch to the files in your boost installation using patch unix tool

1316132
any	set
1 first of all i wait without any time limit for the event to be set

1316139
keyboard	mouse
there is a little more to it a buttonclick is originated by the button itself .when it handles and process mouse and or keyboard events

1316145
any	set
in relational-model any column or set of columns that is guaranteed to be both present and unique in the table can be called a candidate-key to the table

1316145
key-value	key
it also speeds up lookup based on the primary key-value and join between the primary key and a foreign key that references it

1316155
contains	any
it doesn t contains any reference to printing just a reference to the methods it must call

1316165
textbox	button
should i create a user-controls with two labels two textbox for user pass and a button for submit

1316168
communication	messages
i used the term external communication simply because i do not mind which methods i need to use to be able to send a simple messages like hey how s it going

1316193
mbunit	nunit
nunit is good mbunit is good

1316193
mocking	tdd
in my journey down the tdd path i purposely ignore mocking in the beginning

1316197
.net	wcf
in case you haven t seen it peer-to-peer programming with wcf and .net 3.5

1316198
python	java
python is not interpreter - it is tokenize just in time bytecode interpreter and it doesn t have a viewmodel like java does

1316198
python	java
not all the time though it depends on the problem and the libs but python is not slow this is a common misconception even among knowledgable people and that include deep java engine folks who have just not gone and tried python

1316201
.net	wcf
peer-to-peer programming with wcf in .net 3.5

1316206
jruby	mri
i personally use 5 mri yarv jruby ironruby and rubinius.

1316206
rubinius	jruby
the ffi api was first developed by evan phoenix as the native extension api for rubinius it was then adopted by charles oliver nutter and implements by wayne meissner for jruby

1316233
value	field
ultimately if you need to get the value of the unstored field you will have to make it stored

1316253
hide	show
all the data are already on the page .so the search simply show or hide relevant results without needing to retrieve any new information from the server

1316256
webforms	asp.net
one of the major concepts in asp.net webforms is that the entire site is contains within a single form

1316256
webforms	asp.net
the reason for this is because of viewstate a hidden form field in asp.net webforms which contains all the state information for every control on the page

1316258
textbox	button
below this is the textbox for the user to enter text and a send button to .post his response

1316308
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
the user will selected checkbox from a datagrid of rss feed on my site and .when pressing a button the heavy lifting will happen

1316308
checkbox	button
the datagrid will have a checkbox and pressing the button below this grid the code above will execute i have also got the code for the xml declarations etc

1316374
python	c++
.when i had this problem a few years back i wrote a python tool to execute python code embedded in text files .so that i could generator c++ code with python inside the c++

1316382
shell	bash
quite often i grep through my bash shell history to find old cmd filepath etc

1316420
bug-tracking	workitem
just stay professional and points out the problems in your bug-tracking code reviews or whatever means you have for tracking workitem and bugs

1316433
default	reset
in my opinion it s better to have no reset and just styles each elements on top of default styless offered by the browser

1316442
subclassing	base-class
i m sure i will see statements on thats how it is implements but i can understand if these return types were system.object s themselves and then a subclassing used the implemenations of string bool and other system.valuetypes to declare a new base-class

1316448
sql-server	mysql
i found mysql as a popular alternative to sql-server

1316448
ms-access	mysql
are there any databases similar to ms-access that is lightweight compared to mysql

1316464
postgresql	mysql
otherwise i recommend using postgresql over mysql since it is more standards compliant and has a nicer license

1316466
subclassing	base-class
it s no big deal a base-class can always reference subclassing

1316471
derived-class	base-class
i dont see the problem of a base-class returning a derived-class

1316481
ubuntu	linux
if you are working in ubuntu or any other linux platform provide

1316484
display	width
depending on your layout the image might end up behind the radio-button canvas and thus invisible if their is not enough spaces left within the windows to display the image alongside your control if the radio-button fills the entire width of a stackpanel row

1316484
radio-button	textbox
according to this assumptions i ve indeed been able to reproduce the issue presumably it is easily overlooked because width and or margins of a textbox are often provided explicit and visible either way due to the default textbox border while this is less common for a radio-button and its border is invisible by default

1316515
controllers	routes
from what i understand the correct way would be to move comments controllers functionality to its own controllers and access via standards restful routes

1316520
panels	grid
your ideal goal is a resourcedictionary that contains a canvas or grid panels that contains your vector image

1316520
panels	grid
then you could reference the dictionary in your windows.resources and simply add the image panels which is a canvas or grid to your top-level windows panels

1316524
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	c++
language is c++ and ruby php python

1316538
any	set
these two step together are likely to take less work than any solution that relies on the nested set representation

1316570
value	field	network-interface	packets
i have a program that sets the network-interface to promiscuous mode creates a socket that receives all incoming packetss and then enters a loops to read a packets into a buffering set a pointers to the location of the ip header and then printing the value of its ip_len field

1316578
controllers	routes
the correct way is to do a comments controllers and have it nested to your model giving a restful routes like this mymodelname 1 comments

1316580
ubuntu	debian
edit ubuntu which another poster has suggested is essentially an advanced debian customization towards desktop use

1316580
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than debian

1316594
environment	restart
just note that if you change the value of classpath the environment variables you ll have to restart fsc it s something that has bugged me for a while

1316596
selected	cell
you can selected the cell from a1 to kn then go to format conditional formatting

1316602
selected	button
my radio button to selected a payment methods

1316604
highlight	cell
in your case if i understand you right you would highlight all cell from a1 to k10 assuming a maximum of ten rows and then make the conditional formatting formula as follows

1316607
malloc	free
but ld has --wrap which you can use for anything like malloc or free or anything else i do this

1316609
sql-server	oracle
a similar question was asked here but seems to relate to a sql-server connection rather than oracle

1316627
callback	methods
assuming that the card and zone object are used for .some display purpose and don t callback methods in their parent .so that they won t interfere with the actual loading i ve rewritten a little the code with variables to hopefully make more sense

1316650
boost-gil	cimg
the cimg and boost-gil libs can assist with that

1316664
constructor	object
we pass in the searchresult object from the system.directory libs on the constructor of the person

1316690
contains	elements
often the menu will be contains in a div with headers being the menu section header and the unordered list elements comprising the menu items

1316706
network-interface	packets
it ll show you exactly what packets are entering and leaving your network-interface in near real time

1316712
environment	execution
if the code is user created you might want to setup a stripped-down php execution environment as a sandbox

1316716
debian	linux
also i ve seen project like alt linux hasher fedora mock debian pbuilder sbuild but never used any of them

1316731
versioning	upgrade
however the very latest oo 3.1 i believe comes on all platform with the very latest python 2.6.2 i believe .so if you can upgrade your openoffice.org to the very latest release versioning on all platform you should be just fine

1316736
malloc	free
these features include such trivia as malloc and free dlopen some string process and a whole bucketload of stuff that appears to have to do with locale and internationalization although i can t find any relevant manpage

1316739
environment	building
obviously this is a very rough overview of my approach to building multiple distros for a common environment

1316774
while-loop	loops
however i would adjust the while-loop to a do-while-loop you shouldn t test the atype at the beginning of loops because technically it is not initializer

1316777
onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove	onmousemove	onmouseup
what you ll need to do is provided on an onmousedown onmousemove onmouseup event to the form itself or some control in the form that updates the positioning of the control .when the user click and drag

1316807
signals	sigint
it traps signals sighup sigterm sigint and sigquit logs them using syslog and quits

1316816
instances	private
or if you do use dlls you ll have to implements them to cope with there being two separate instances of them it should use cross-process mutexes instead of in-process critical-section and cross-process shared-memory instead of in-process private heap memory

1316822
variables	boolean
you can change foo to accept a boolean variables which means reset or not

1316823
private-members	instances
static methods doesn t required an instances and may return one instead and is more or less like a global function except for it is put in class namespace and therefore avoid collision with other functions and has access to class private-members

1316833
context-free-language	regular-language
you can also prove it is context free by using the fact that a context-free-language intersect with a regular-language is context free

1316833
context-free-language	pumping-lemma
since it is a context-free-language according to the pumping-lemma for cfl s any string longer than the pumping length p should be able to be pumped

1316855
value	field
try setting serialversioninguid to a fixed value then defined a static final field for your versioning

1316862
groovy	java
the help docs od netbeans have a section enabling a java application to support groovy

1316875
uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
i need to create a login page that then provides access to a uitableview which will then be controlled by a uinavigationcontroller

1316882
margins	padding
click elements in question then look at it s layout. it ll tell you exactly where padding and margins are coming from

1316887
python	java
is there any efficient mass string concatenation methods in python like stringbuilder in c# or stringbuffer in java

1316903
average	max	average	min
test simply everything with value min max average usecases and do negativ tests - tests that have to fail if the software works correct

1316919
python	php
php css parsing python css parsing

1316936
contains	any
named of classes source files and any methods named contains an underscore.js or preceded by a hash character are automatically hyperlinked from comment text to their description

1316940
subtract	time
my methods for solving involved subtract the digits one at a time after converting to int and then making appropriate carries if the result was negative

1316941
installation	downgrade
in this case installing simbl can t really hurt -- the author doesn t updates simbl often at all these days .so it s very unlikely that you ll accidentally downgrade a user s simbl installation

1316950
execute	prepare
this is done as an potential optimization - if you know in advance that you will need to execute the statement many time in a row preparing it upfront can save some work on the database server since it does not have to re- prepare the statement for each call

1316950
execute	prepare
pg_query_params as well as its simpler versioning pg_query just execute the statement query directly forcing the database server to re prepare the statement each time the function gets called

1316950
execute	prepare
the only difference is that in the second case you still have the prepare statement ready to reuse for more call to pg_execute - which is why you can give it a named since that way you can have different prepare statements on the same connection that you can execute as you please many time in arbitrary order

1316980
ubuntu	osx
it is present on different machines running both ubuntu and osx and it is also present on all .app versioning on production and it is present on at least one other .application i ve tested

1316988
http	ssl
edit to add before i used ssl i used to detection this for plain http and put up an appropriate error messages

1316989
verilog	vhdl
it understands c++ c# cobol java ecmascript java xml verilog vhdl and a numbers of other languages

1316996
checkbox	button
in this code i have checkbox for each item that give user ability to delete multiple items at once but if the user press the remove button without checked any item it gives an error

1316997
verilog	vhdl
it understands c++ c# cobol java ecmascript java xml verilog vhdl and a numbers of other languages specifically including fortran

1317000
difference	zero
the only difference to your desired output is that it reindexes starting with zero - if you really need the index to start at one you can array_shift a dummy entry in first and array_unshift it afterwards

1317012
verilog	vhdl
it understands c++ c# cobol java ecmascript java xml verilog vhdl and a numbers of other languages

1317019
verilog	vhdl
it understands c++ c# cobol java ecmascript java xml verilog vhdl and a numbers of other languages

1317032
binary-tree	nodes
you have a binary-tree where each nodes contains a named and an amount can

1317045
linked-list	nodes	binary-tree	linked-list	binary-tree	nodes
a cons cell is closer to a binary-tree nodes than a linked-list nodes

1317054
latitude-longitude	location
where location is a geoloc instances contains the latitude-longitude city state and country code

1317055
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i can get my tests to work in firefox safari opera ie 8 but not google-chrome

1317055
google-chrome	firefox
this always loads up firefox though and not good google-chrome

1317059
button	popup
it would remove the multi-option popup button and show a new single-option button in its place

1317059
button	popup
.when it s time to show the multi-option popup button just do

1317061
temporary	rvalue
like you say the temporary is an rvalue and thus the move-constructor is selected because of a rules in 13.3.3.2 3 which says that a rvalue-reference bind to an rvalue better than an lvalue reference

1317069
arguments	default
array_walk passes 2 arguments by default

1317077
buffering	streaming
if streaming is a socketchannel and buffering is a bytebuffering you can do the following

1317096
versioning	upgrade
we use a visible versioning numbers .so that our admin sales team and customers can tell that the upgrade worked

1317116
thread-dump	jvm
a simple thread-dump from a test program show the following threads - one is the application thread and then you have 8 other jvm threads

1317117
emacs	vim
i strictly use vim but i was playing with emacs and really like ido-mode .when opening files

1317118
jvisualvm	jvm
jvisualvm is an excellent tool to examine a jvm at runtime

1317123
telnet	tcp
i m working my way through unix network-programming volume 1 by richard stevens and attempting to write a tcp echo client that uses the telnet protocols

1317131
google-chrome	firefox
.so the fact that it s firefox that is launchd and not google-chrome is normals

1317134
attributes	properties
i have to be able to upload physical media and i want to store the physical properties separately in the database .so that certain attributes can be queried outside of the application as easily as within in

1317139
contains	set
i ve got myself a project where i have to determine if a string contains set string

1317140
for-loop	arrays
to fix it keep tracking of the size of your arrays pass it to the function and then use a for-loop to iterate up to it rather than using pointers

1317140
double-pointer	pointers
still i d suggesting using a vector for big extra credit on your homework see if you can figure out how to implements your own vector using a double-pointer allocated as an arrays of pointers from the heap

1317146
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
written in a dynamic-languages like perl php python

1317149
g++	gcc
in recent mingw gcc g++ versioning 4.40 you can link against a shared dll rather than the default static libs by using the flag -shared-libstdc++

1317151
contains	any
if you have a tester or two who may have their own local copies and or a test server which is not always uptodate on the super latest code changes - having the versioning there will be useful for any bug report to contains to be able to tell if they are using a fixed in versioning or not

1317152
multibyte	strlen
all of the default string functions strlen strpos etc. should be replace with multibyte string functions that look at the character instead of the byte

1317158
contains	set
also ensure that permissions on the directory and pdf files it contains are correctly set - see this answer

1317162
ref	out
while using keyword ref calling code needs to initializer passed arguments but with keyword out we need not do .so

1317162
ref	out
please give example of a situation in which we need to use ref and can t use out

1317169
ref	out
addressed by out and ref are subtly

1317169
ref	out
both ref and out parameter-passing

1317169
ref	out
having both ref and out parameter

1317173
ref	out
out is a special form of ref where the referenced memory should not be initializer before the call

1317173
ref	out
two examples where out doesn t work but ref does

1317181
python	php
php doens t changes it s way to store strings in memory unlike python

1317193
revision	svn
one of the most used known revision control systemd is probably subversion svn

1317193
ubuntu	linux
on linux ubuntu the package bundled by ubuntu are ok too

1317193
bazaar	git
if you want something a distribute revision control software you can take a look at tools like bazaar mercurial and or git

1317193
bazaar	git
each one of those is used by some big project well at least for bazaar mysql uses it i think and git linux kernel uses it

1317215
ref	out
a contrived example of .when you d need to use ref and not out is as follows

1317217
ref	out
the equivalent is normals just the parameter ref parameter and out parameter

1317220
version-control	git
it sounds like you just want to have stuff under version-control this way you won t have to worry about the learning curve associated with git

1317220
google-code	bitbucket
if you do checkout mercurial you can use bitbucket and google-code as a hosts

1317236
streamreader	streamwriter
all the examples i m finding online use a streamreader or a streamwriter or a fflush or something

1317239
user-input	output
but at least the user-input cannot escape and do more harm in an inline sql statement or html output

1317239
contains	elements
for all you know the client may not even has used parsing your html document contains the form elements

1317254
httpd.conf	.htaccess
you can tell apache and php to issue the correct charset headers setting adddefaultcharset utf-8 in httpd.conf .htaccess and in php-ini respectively

1317260
cllocationmanager	locationmanager
void locationmanager cllocationmanager manager didupdatetolocation cllocation newlocation fromlocation cllocation oldlocation

1317276
eof	eol
it does not detection eof mark nor eol or some other special character

1317279
.net	wcf
this returned value is then capture by a wcf c# web service program which interop with my .dll and using .net xml libs serialization the result before sending the messages to the web service client

1317286
google-chrome	firefox
the one on my site definitely works in ie8 google-chrome 3.0 and firefox 2.0+

1317300
tcp-ip	ppp
if you have a full-blown computer at the other end of the serial line it would probably be far simpler just to set up an ppp link over the serial line and do the communication over tcp-ip

1317324
pointers	stack
saves the old frame pointers ebp register on stack .so it can be put back in-place .when this function ends

1317324
pointers	stack
ebp is often called the frame pointers it points at the top of stack value within the current frame function usually referring to variables on stack via ebp can help debuggers

1317324
pointers	stack
call will push the current instruction pointers on stack and jump to the address of ___main

1317324
pointers	stack
it undos the stuff done at the start of the function - restoring the frame pointers and stack to its former state

1317324
pointers	stack
it ll pop the instruction pointers from stack which a corresponding call instruction will have placed there and jump there

1317365
blender	maya
or else you ll want to create it in a model animation package like maya houdini max sketchup blender etc

1317380
silverlight	wpf
as a result we ended up with wpf e wpf everywhere which was later rename silverlight

1317380
silverlight	wpf
wpf vs silverlight

1317380
silverlight	wpf
think of it as the middle child between wpf and silverlight

1317380
silverlight	wpf
we are spending cycles ensuring wpf silverlight converge more in terms of a uniform api etc to enable you to graduate up down the technology experience without having to radically shift your logic

1317380
prism	mef
we ve got frameworks in-place today ie prism mef that will help you here but we are working hard to bring the two technologies back to parity for you all

1317387
firefox	gecko
this obscure function is actually implements in firefox 3.0 using the gecko layout engine

1317387
contains	elements
basically what that does is it goes through every single html elements there is in the document and tries to find one which contains the coordinate

1317388
selected	button
then .when you use the â backâ button the selected elements is in the wrong state points at the page you were going to instead of the page you came from which makes the action of changing it quite confusing it might reload the current page or fail to load the new page

1317404
aggregate	grouping
lastly since aggregate have been added it may be possible for you to write a custom aggregate class which would work as a kind of distinct and simply grouping by

1317413

you may want to loops through your results and generator an options arrays

1317415
dictionary	arrays
copy both dictionary into one dictionary arrays

1317415

1317465
google-chrome	firefox
i ve written a firefox extension to rig the windows title with this information but it became outdated and i need this for google-chrome now anyway

1317467
authentication	login
one thing to keep in mind though is due to the small form factors of phones key entry is difficult and .so authentication cookies should probably last longer .so users don t have to login whether with username+password or openid as frequently

1317475
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the code in this sample was with webforms in mind not asp.net-mvc .so you will need to adapt it but it should get you down the right path

1317496
display	width
floated elements are shrinkwrapped and take up only the width in which its necessary for the text inside to display

1317499
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera

1317511
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i started converting one of asp.net webforms project into asp.net-mvc

1317522
put	get
or at least imagine you are going to and get the project finished in such a way that you would not be shamed to put it out into the open

1317524
any	set
cookiess may be edited by the user .so here he could set his user cookies to get being recognized as any user he wants

1317526
python	ruby
another suggestion while reading up on applescript take a look at appscript which makes the apple event technology underneath applescript available in python ruby or even objective-c

1317526
python	ruby
many people find the applescript language itself lacking compared to more modern languages like python or ruby

1317536
worksheet	excel	selected	cell
ai have an excel 2007 workbook with about 150+ worksheet and i want to selected the data from the same same cell in all worksheet and copy the data it is all text from only those cell that contains data

you should be able to decorator the properties with an attributes and then call the reportpropertieschanging and reportpropertieschanged methods like .so

1317579
zend-framework	codeigniter
i have a similar situation to yours except i develop in zend-framework and doctrine instead of codeigniter

1317627
contains	set
the midpointmap variables is a hash set that can contains multiple value per key

1317638
postgresql	mysql	database-agnostic	schema	database-agnostic	postgresql
conceptual object that represents a block of data as steven said there s a difference in the benefits you get from being database-agnostic .so you can switching between mysql and postgresql if need be and being schema agnostic .so you have an object full of data that fits together well even if it came from different relational tables

1317647
populate	row
i have a tableviewcontroller where i populate some data from a sqlite db and for each row i downloading a file from a httpserver and caching it locally

1317659
delegation	dealloc
if you re releasing your delegation .when the view is dealloc ed you need to remove it unless you re also retaining the delegation in setdelegation

1317665
constructor	object
because i don t think you re talking about testing that the person object gets the properties set correct by the constructor right

1317701
removeclass	addclass
addclass and removeclass exist to save you from doing all that work yourself

1317702
png	gif
as for libs assets the optimal speed is achieved by setting jpegs to use import jpeg data and pngs gifs as loosless png gif

1317715

i.e. where the selection starts and ends within the contains elements

1317729
value	field
i have a field that has value like this.

if i attempt to animate the frame height of a tableview ex height - 200 the cell that appear in the last 200px disappear suddenly before the smooth animation of the frame completes

1317736
punctuation	words
again this doesn t take into account punctuation or anything and just assumes all words are separated by spaces

1317740
jquery-plugins	jquery
by that i mean that jquery-plugins normally operate on jquery object and the selection has nothing to do with any elements

1317742

1317754
textbox	button	listbox	textbox
i have a listbox that each of its items has a button i set all the textbox in the dataitem that the binding.updatesourcetrigger is explicit

1317773
constructor	private
incidentally you also probably want to make person s constructor private

1317778
delegation	dealloc
if the delegation may be release before you then it is the responsibility of the delegation to clear your reference before it is finished being deallocated eg in its dealloc

1317778
any	set
however if any properties is set to retain or copy then you would retain copy it in the setter or use synthesized setter which will do it for you and release it in dealloc to avoid leaking

1317794
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
you could get close by generator a uuid then hashing it with md5 then taking as many bits of that as you can and converting it into base 10+26+26 for case-sensitive or 10+26 for case-insensitive and taking the first 15 characters

1317797
.when	ready
.when you re ready to checked in some changes to the repo

1317833
selected	textbox
the dropdownlistfor s autopostback is true and .when i change the selected index of it based on what index i have selected a text is written in textbox1 and then because the autopostback of textbox1 is true 2 other textbox fill themselves based on the text written in textbox1

1317835
entity-framework	nhibernate
another example of this would probably be microsoft entity-framework v4.0 or nhibernate

pixels	line
i have a pixels matrix where line are made of 255 s black and 0 s white

1317879
opensolaris	linux	netbsd	linux
it s not linux but you can checkout the opensolaris source for ls or the netbsd ls.c online

1317880
python	php	python	c++	python	java
it supports java c# cobol c++ php python and many other languages

1317894
copy-constructor	rvalue
all return value are considered to be rvalue .so if the compiler doesn t implements return-value-optimization on this case it must use the move-constructor rather than the copy-constructor

1317917
.when	ready
but i .when i m ready to release a toolkit should compile the include files into a single html file

1317934
configuration	environment
but consider that if you have multiple deployment and different configuration you ll need to run your test against the right environment

1317949
temporary	copy
i would suggest trying to copy the executable to a temporary location and starting it from there possibly with delayed deletion

1317954
linux	osx
it s fully cross platform linux mac osx windows

1317954
python	ruby
it s supports running python ruby and javascript code in your application all concurrently integration with one anther in one application

are you using transactional and then forgetting to fflush commit them and they get rollback

1318082
input-field	selected
is there any way to make it .so a click on a selected input-field does not open the list of options

1318082
onmousedown	onfocus
i tried returning false from onmousedown and onclientclick i tried calling this.blur in onfocus i tried setting the readonly attributes none of this seems to work in firefox

1318082
selected	textbox
i guess i ll have to remove the selected and try to create something that looks like it from a textbox and an image

1318108
display	height
i want to limit a elements to display only 1 line of text with the remainder hidden overflow hidden without setting a specific height

1318119
tokenize	parsing
text parsing as html or xml is tokenize which means all runs of whitespaces are collapse to a single spaces character

1318143
any	set
in any case the normals way to break these kinds of dependencies is to abstract what is required by one project into a set of interfaces and encapsulate those in a separate assembly

1318144
reflection	runtime
or you could load the logic at runtime in the domain by reflection in the domain to access the dependent libs

1318145
tetris	pacman
what if you d implements tetris pacman or doom using canvas

1318168
mapping	unique
your interface guids need to be unique within the same scoping as the category-ids anyhow and having a 1 1 mapping seems a simple model for maintenance too. edit

1318206
instances	self
the current instances scoping is defined by the value of self

1318217
javascript	dom
i think the javascript has to be loaded after the content was loaded into the dom

1318224
triggers	insert
is it possible to fire a mysql triggers for both the insert and updates events of a table

1318233
triggers	insert
i was wondering how i would go about creating a triggers to updates the despatch table once a new sale has been insert into the sales table

google-chrome	firefox
it seems fine in firefox and ie but in google-chrome sometimes nothing show up

1318301
overwrite	copying
note that this is implements by execution a subshell using popen and copying the standards output to the current file specified in the bufferfile setting and then reading that file .so be careful you don t overwrite .something you don t intend to

1318303
value	field
it populate the form field with the correct bet_id and category_id value based on the value parsing from page 1

1318311
py2exe	exe
im looking for simple scripting that will compile to exe and i found py2exe

1318321
fwrite	fopen
save using the fopen and fwrite functions i m guessing your doing this bit anyway

1318324
innodb	myisam
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb

1318346
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
you should turn your checkbox to radio button .so that a user can only selected one country

1318372
py2exe	exe
potential problems in certain cases mostly if you use encoding you need to retest your application as an exe and make sure everything works as expected you may need to checked in the code to find out if you are running inside py2exe and do something special

1318380
peer	p2p
it s a p2p peer 2 peer router algorithm

1318389
sql-server	oracle
i have vs2008 with sp1 and i tried to add ado.net-entity-data-model but i couldn t generator the model from oracle connection it seems that it s just supporting sql-server

1318429
export	csv
by default it export to csv files but you can write a custom exporter class that export directly to a mysql database or any other format of your choosing

1318439
value	field
have a set field called country with value

1318465
highlight	tooltip	show	next
there is a single input-field but while the user types the input is analyzed and split and this analysis result it show to the user - subtle highlight with the field named next to it something similar to a tooltip

1318465
xsd	xml
maybe xsd xml or similar description languages could be ab used too

1318488
google-chrome	firefox
i would suggest modifying your selector slightly to ensure that it works on browsers that append a to tables like firefox and google-chrome

1318498
javascript	dom
although javascript will only start the next function .when the previous one has completed the browser is threaded .so you can t guarantee that any dom updates have completed just because the function that causes them has completed

1318510
cosine	sine
i ve tested this methods for sine and cosine and it s bloody fast

1318510
cos	sin
from my experience sin and cos are pretty expensive operations

1318530
temporary	copy
create each temporary file using file.create targetpath buffersize fileoptions.deleteonclose or one of the fstream constructor that takes a fileoptions parameter but make sure to hang onto the returned file instances until after the second copy is launchd in a

1318550
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it works great in firefox 3 + 3.5 ie 6 + 7 safari 4 google-chrome 2 + 3 and opera 9 + 10

1318558
arguments	undefined
for the error since e is an arguments of your function it already exists .so you don t need to declare it just assign a value to it if its null or undefined

1318594
postgresql	mysql
it uses mysqldump to backup mysql and pg_dump to backup postgresql

1318615
innodb	myisam
use -r to backup stored-procedures but also keep in mind that if you want a consistent dump of your database while its being modified you need to use --single-transaction if you only backup innodb or --lock-all-tables if you also need myisam tables

1318638
postgresql	mysql
checkout astrails-safe for mysql postgresql plain_files subversion backup with encryption and upload to s3 sftp

after asking here and trying both surf and sift neither of them seams to be efficient enough to generator interest points fast enough to tracking a streaming from the camera

1318700
32-bit	64bit
that s no worse than having a 64bit int as a key or two 32-bit int

1318711
treeset	treemap
if performance is important you can use a treeset or treemap to hold the country named and do the following can be used to identify countries that start with a given string

1318729
common-lisp	scheme	common-lisp	lisp	scheme	lisp
primarily i m a bit more interested in learning about some of the lisp that have been around a while like scheme or common-lisp

1318729
common-lisp	scheme
and do you think it s a good idea to say implements scheme in common-lisp or vice versa

1318740
interpreter	runtime
the python interpreter crash is different than just the python code itself erroring out with a runtime error

1318740
interpreter	runtime
for example infinite recursion with a default recursion limit set would cause a runtime error but the python interpreter would still be alive afterwards

1318751
common-lisp	scheme
both scheme and common-lisp are fine for your task

1318762
ruby	php
php is a programming language as ruby is for ruby-on-rails and provides no framework

1318762
cakephp	symfony	zend-framework	symfony	zend-framework	codeigniter	zend-framework	cakephp	codeigniter	symfony	codeigniter	cakephp
there are quite a few for php though codeigniter zend-framework symfony or cakephp to named a few

then to selected a radio-button simply use the following code

1318816
fluentvalidation	xval
validation framework for model binding validation xval or fluentvalidation

1318831
radio	click
the idea is whenever you click on a radio disable all the radio in all the grouping with that value except the one that was just click

1318838
configuration	environment
you can register new ones like this place this in your configuration environment.rb one of the configuration environment .rb files or in a file under configuration initializer

1318856
.war	jar
in the web-inf .lib of each application .war file there is a common jar that is shared by all applications

1318900
lighttpd	apache	webserver	nginx
webserver for php apache iis lighttpd nginx ...

1318912
malloc	free
however had you been storing malloc d memory inside your structure the key points is that you can t just free the structure and expect the other memory allocation to be free

1318918
malloc	free
this avoids at least one set of messing about with malloc and free

1318923
malloc	free
it is better to do the malloc and free at the same place

1318928
libxml-ruby	hpricot
alright switching from working hpricot to libxml-ruby due to speed and well the disappearance of _why looked at nokogiri for a second but decided to look at libxml-ruby for speed and longevity

1318928
libxml-ruby	hpricot
i just want to loops through the 150 entries and then grab out content and attributes but i m having a hell of a time with libxml-ruby had it working fine with hpricot

1318939
pyflakes	pylint
another option is pyflakes which i find a little less excessively-verbose i ve recently started using it in-place of pylint

1318939
pyflakes	pylint
it is mostly enforces stylistic things like correct whitespace it does not do much static-analysis of the code like pylint or pyflakes .so i use pep8.py in conjunction with either pylint or pyflakes

1318982
scala	java
i include scala as it compiles to java bytecode and i expect it will be cheapest for power

1318982
scala	java
php will probably win as apache and php seems to be lower on memory usage than java but i can t really compare scala and php

1318982
scala	java
at that points the jit for java should come into play and java or scala i would expect to be lower on power usage

1318982
scala	java
a big test imo would be to see if we can get the same performance as we reduce the size of the machine .so if you need 3 computers for php or java that are load balanced and 1 scala machine can have the same performance then scala using lift will win

1318987
debugging	trace
.so now .when i compile with omit trace actions my whole debugging is ignore as if i used trace simply

1318996
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp

1319089
keyboard	mouse
second keyboard second mouse of course

1319122
exception-handling	error-handling
beyond that custom-exception-handling and wrapping all your handler with a decorator that catches the exception-handling and gives proper error messages is an excellent architecture though it s more invasive required more rework of your code than the simple refactoring i just mentioned the extra investment right now may well be worthwhile in preventing repetitious and boilerplatey error-handling spread all over your application level code

1319134
communication	messages
c it adds an extra layer ontop of the communication .so you need to keep it clear for yourself in your head and prefereably in code .when you are dealing with the infrastructure bits and .when you are dealing with the actual protocols clienta and clientb speak to each other in the messages object

1319135

put	get
i need to get the current xls filename .so that i can put that at the end of my static path

1319150
boost-python	ctypes
however there is no doubt that the runtime overhead is much more significant for ctypes than for swig and sip and boost-python and other wrapping approaches .so i think of ctypes as a convenient way to reach for a few functions within a dll .when the call happen outside of a key bottleneck not as a way to make large c libs available to python in performance-critical situations

1319161
temporary	copy
if the object created using clone keeps information on the image source a handle on the original file or you can t otherwise unlock the file while using the bitmap instances then you ll probably have to either save to a new file or open from a temporary copy of the original

1319185
contains	elements
the filteringing arrays contains one entry per filtering with varying elements depending on the filtering types

1319234
32-bit	64bit
it s obvious that the time stamp corresponds to the 32-bit unix time at the time of the crash but what does the 64bit application-start time mean

1319245
chown	chmod
what i ended up doing was creating an objective-c methods i was planning on using this in a cocoa .app anyways that finds out the permissions of a file using a perl scripting then uses chmod chown to .apply those permissions

1319252
keyboard	mouse
polling mouse or keyboard states works in a game where you have direct access to updates methods that are the heartbeat of the application

if you are writing an application that required that you write data to a database or a text file then you will need to checked and if necessary change the permissions on the server .so that you have write as well as read permissions on the directory and database or text file you wish to write too. this is only possible if you have full control over these things of course

1323251

i can comment on how mysql and postgresql compare in a few areas that might be important but without information it s hard to say which of these actually matter to you

1323404
postgresql	mysql
i ve written up a bunch more background information on this topic at why postgresql instead of mysql comparing reliability and speed

1323404
postgresql	mysql
mysql can do a good job with a small numbers of clients at higher client count the locking mechanism in postgresql might do a better job

1323404
postgresql	mysql
if not it s easier to turn more of those features off in mysql which gives it a significant speed advantage compared to postgresql

1323430
spaces	output
to reduce collision you might try something like using the two hash independently to create a 64bit output spaces

1323440
widget	button
but if the numbers is modest as you say then you can just give him a screens listing all the widget and either let him types in the order numbers or display them inorder and put up and down button beside each of if you want to be fancy give him a way to drag and drop

1323445
shopping-cart	cart
i can just guess but do you want to building something like a shopping-cart with cart items having a quantity and a product

1323461
contains	any
if the entity a has a collections of b s which contains c s and .so on it doesn t try to delete any c s .when the collections of b s is-empty

1323463
sqldatasource	gridview
i made sure the gridview has the correct sqldatasource control as its source

1323511
buffering	streaming
if you don t read from that streaming the client s data will buffering up

1323521
sql-server	postgresql
sql-server and postgresql 8.4 implements this functionality using recursive cte s

1323532
python	c++
.so the ideal best of both is to write your main business-logic in a scripting language like python and use it to call dedicated power helpers written in c++

1323532
json	xml
for example if you replace xml with json you ll find you have the same functionality but at a fractions of the data size and resources required to parsing and reformat the data

1323556
tinyurl	bit.ly
the site i am working on wants to generator its own shortened urls rather than rely on a third party like tinyurl or bit.ly

1323576
short	base
.so in short all of the higher-level classes you use that are install .when you install the .net are part of the framework class-library but not necessarily part of the base class-library

1323586
uilabel	uifont
you can get more information from the uilabel and uifont documentation

1323587
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
note that this approach required that you building your application for the x86 platform since the flash player is currently 32-bit only and you cannot interact with its activex object from 64bit code

1323588
triggers	insert
you would want to setup insert and updates triggers on the table and have them call the msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail stored procedure

1323591
getter	setter
also if you create a properties on the object to handle this make sure to only implements a public getter in the properties and not a public setter

1323601
versioning	upgrade
.net versioning is 2.0 i can upgrade if its necessary but i dont think its the issue

1323606
any	set
if you set this for all of your grid and any controls that you don t need viewsate for it will significantly reduce the size

1323609
wordpress	blogs
wordpress is great for blogs and mid size simple website

1323622
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	gecko	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	gecko
dave hyatt who used to work on gecko used by firefox and others at mozilla and now works on webkit used by safari google-chrome and others has an old blog .post explaining some of the complexities of this process

1323647
any	set
with register_globals set to on any variables in is automatically inject as a vartiable in your application -- well actually this depends on the variabless_order configuration option but this one almost always include get .post and cookies at least

1323711
variables	boolean
you have a boolean variables named isdirty which starts at false

1323765
profiling	trace
if not then i m sure folks will recommend lots of good tools such as sql profiling visual-studio s profiling or simply using trace true on your asp.net pages

1323782
xlib	xcb
xcb which replace xlib at the moment

1323782
clutter	cairo
xrender cairo clutter that may do what you want already

1323788
lookup	any
after that you will access the right service from any application doing a normals service lookup specifying the correct properties

1323813
contains	elements
they can either be grouping as a collections of jquery object or as children of a contains elements

1323829
uilabel	uifont
what you want is the textcolor properties that belongs to uilabel -- uifont depends on other classes like uilabel to provide other gui-related properties like the color of the text

1323831
uilabel	uifont
instead of setting the color in a uifont you set the uilabel s textcolor properties which is a uicolor

1323838
sequences	unique
hibernate is perfectly capable of setting id columns automatically and it makes sense to me that it would be able to set some other column to a unique value according to a formula like max sortindex +1 or according to some increasing sequences generator value but i can t find a reference in the documentation to this sort of thing

1323844
value	field
you need to use nsurlmutablerequest here you can add headers for content-type and the sort here is a r eference once you set up your request you can add the value using this methods - void addvalue nsstring value forhttpheaderfield nsstring field something like

1323859
defined	declare
i declare a subclassing of a nsmanagedobject and defined a few properties some of them of types nsstring myobject.h is something like

1323878
16-bit	8bit
java is 16-bit characters normally and windows is either 8bit with code pages or utf-8 these days

1323883
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
for example button1 and button1 it compiles as case-sensitive but execute as case-insensitive

1323913
active-directory	adam
if you re up for the challenge you can set your application up to use adam active-directory application mode

1323936
sqldatasource	gridview
if i bind gridview via datasource attributes to sqldatasource and set selectcommand and updatecommand attributess then everything works perfectly

1323937
hash	md5
there are multiple implementation of md5 and sha1 available in javascript that turn any string into a hash string and that can easily be used with jquery

1323955
base-class	inherited
ideally you want all the controls to inherited from a base-class the base-class can then deal with all of this .when each control is initializer

1323958
virtual-memory	paging
the operating systemd is responsible for translating them into physical addresses through the virtual-memory and paging mechanism

1323969
any	set
looking at the code for mobile_fu show that any mobile request coming in will be set to mobile

1323999
stderr	stdout
if i wanted to use the same file for stdout and stderr or if i wanted to replace a file handle with some other numbers then i would need to call the dup2 systemd call to achieve that result

1324004
labview	matlab
my gripe against labview and matlab in this respect is that if you plan on embedding the code in anything other than x86 and labview has tools to put labview vis on arms then you ll have to throw as much horsepower at the problem as you can because it s inefficient

1324012
look-and-feel	nimbus
i have a simple-ish cell renderinging which is composed of a few jlabel s the renderinging itself extends jpanel and i m trying to get it to rendering sensibly in the nimbus look-and-feel

1324012
scala	java
edit if anyone is interested this turned out to be a problem with scala table cell rendering as i was actually using scala not java

1324030
simplemodal	thickbox
simplemodal looks great but i found it .so much harder to implements than facebox or thickbox

1324066
initializer	setter
this would have all the necessary setter and only initializer the target object .when spring has finished wiring up the circular dependencies

1324103
assign	add
you do that by re-creating the control assign it the exact same id add it to the sampe place on the page and finally in the viewstate loadedcontrol to the control types

1324113
constructor	object
as maxim pointed out the datacontractserializer behaves a little different from what you might expect it doesn t call any constructor to deserialize your object

1324120
getdate	dateadd
i m sure it s with a dateadd and getdate

1324140
getter	setter
the setter in myspecificclass shouldn t be a problem but the getter definitely is - internally a call to an instances of myspecificclass s status will be making a call to itself to see which value to return which will make a call to itself to see.

1324161
getdate	dateadd
selected dateadd yy datediff yy -1 getdate 0

1324165
click	mouse
it s been a while and the last time i did .something like this it was within my own wysiwyg editor .so i had full access to all fonts characteristics needed to calculate which words was click by the mouse

1324165
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
via the api i would look into hooking the keyboard and mouse messages .so that your .app can pre-process every mouse click on other .applications - start with setwindowshookex and read everything you can about hooking messages

1324165
textbox	button
in other cases the text may reside in the windows as text - the wm_gettext messages may return this text from some types of windowss textbox button etc. but for normals windowss this messages only return the title in the caption bar

1324169
arrays	map
you also have map and filtering in the arrays class

1324181
session-cookies	cookies
these are session-cookies not permanent cookies

1324181
session-cookies	cookies
what s more strange is if i ctrl+n to open a new windows from the popped-up windows that is missing the session-cookies then manually types in the url to the home page those cookies magically appear again

1324181
plugins	add-on
now i ve ensured that there are no browser add-on plugins toolbar etc

1324181
session-cookies	cookies
i m aware that i can try to set permanent cookies instead of session-cookies

1324199
contains	elements
the query is fine .when retrieving the row to put data in to the textbox but it returns an error sequences contains no elements .when used to retrieve the row inorder to edit it and put it back in to the database

1324223
uilabel	uifont	nsstring	uifont	nsstring	uilabel
i searched the documentation on this but it appears that shadow don t draw blurry and there s no methods in nsstring uifont or uilabel that could help to do it

1324238
jinja2	mako
jinja2 and mako are both apparently pretty fast

1324241
hashmap	trie
if it were a larger map in a situation where high-speed lookup was really critical i would suggest using some sort of trie rather than a hashmap

1324243
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby-on-rails django and other server-side frameworks all tend to use a particular versioning of asp.net-mvc

1324243
event-bus	mvp
google s mvp + event-bus

1324253
user-interface	look-and-feel
many of the controls that i use have to have a very specific user-interface look-and-feel .so they end up being custom

1324268
implements	abstract	getter	setter
the abstract properties declaration in the base-class just states derived classes must implements a properties called status with a getter and setter

1324271
expression	brackets
that regular expression have brackets

1324278
content-length	content-type
keep in mind that you also need to add proper headers like content-type content-length etc the readfile manual page has some examples

1324302
32-bit	64bit
however we do have some customers running on 32-bit and others running on 64bit oses

1324304
export	report
.when i export my ssrs report to excel pdf format i want to show my parameters

1324308
assign	add
add the dummy assignments first for the short s and the int then assign the byte s explicit from the arrays

1324342
configuration	logging
it is nice in that it allows easy configuration of multiple independent logging targets

1324348
pointers	stack
and the reference pointers to stack

1324369
entity-framework	nhibernate
it implements the unit of work pattern along with the repository-pattern with nhibernate linq-to-sql or the entity-framework

1324379
font-size	width
are there methods to calculate that width of the text .when a uifont and font-size is specified

1324388
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
i have built a business-logic-layer bll and a data-access-layer dal and i am extraction out the business-logic

1324390
random-seed	generator
.when running the tests the caller generator a random-seed it associates with the test run saves it in the results table then passed along the seed similar to this

1324391
contains	elements
embeddable components or composite elements whatever you want to call them usually contains more than one properties and thus are mapped to more than one column

1324394
touch	drag
have you connect this ibaction to more than one outlet of your single button -- touch up inside touch up outside touch drag inside touch drag outside etc

1324403
.when	ready
basically the machine has a few high level states cold a.k.a just started homing in setup ready to run running report reseting but .when the machine is running it kind of needs to have it s own little fsm implementation for loading lense locating edges measuring wedges measuring roundness and complete may be some more in there

1324405
export	csv
this is the solution i came up with to help in export a csv with my export options filename adjustment and file location with one click

1324412
put	get
i personally do not put the .text properties on my cmd simply because i get no reuse out of these cmd

1324412
selected	button
most button delegation you write will have to react to state in .some way service you talk to is down this data needs to be populate this way if the user selected this etc .so i don t really think it s wrong to have the delegation adapt to stateful information on the viewmodel

1324421
authentication	login
how do i send the username passwd using postdata on the login page and then downloading the actual page as an authentication user

1324425
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
write a perl python ruby your-choice-of-scriptinging-language-here scripting to do the job for you

1324444
nsxmlparser	nsdata
use the initwithcontentsoffile instances methods with nsdata and supply that to nsxmlparser s initwithdata methods

1324466
getter	setter
in ruby they are used for some meta-programming tasks like generator getter and setter for member variables for example attr_reader named to generator a getter for named

1324513
joomla	drupal
i ve had some limited experience with joomla and drupal

1324516
linux	osx
on linux and osx use zu

1324516
autotools	cmake	autotools	gnu
if your building-system is very complicated multiple building options generator sources etc. maintaining 3 separate makefile might get unwieldly and you are going to have to use some kind of advanced building-system like cmake or the gnu autotools

1324516
macros	basic
but the basic principles is the same-- use the build-system to defined platform-specific macros instead of putting platform-detection logic in your source files

1324558
radio-button	selected
i want to change the some_name value .when user selected this radio-button

1324564
scala	java
in contrast string s are only intern if they appear in literals form at least in java they are not entirely sure about scala

1324564
scala	java
in scala it might be useful as i mentioned if you combine it with a lot of deserialization .so the java string s don t get intern as well.

1324573
value	field
there seems to be a way i can calculate the value iteratively and then store them in a local field

1324582
plugins	add-on
you can use authlogic as the base authentication systemd with the authlogic ldap add-on plugins

1324588
affinity	cpu
you will not be able to do anything smarter than sql already does in regard to partition the data-access per cpu it simply has access to information you don t buffering pool fill state page lifetime expectancy cpu numa affinity etc

1324595
.when	ready
the dom ready fires .when all the dom nodes are available

1324619
hash	md5
i have some mysql tables that are currently using an md5 hash as a primary key

1324629
protected	public
how can i use public private protected internal

1324630
javascript	dom	.when	ready
to the best of my knowledge the ready event is fired .when the dom is loaded - which means that all the blocking request javascript have loaded and the dom tree is completely graphed

1324640
selected	listbox
in the designer of a module derived from basemodule i am presented with a combobox with the ability to just selected a single value html xml etc. i would like to be presented with a drop-down checked listbox .so i could selected which value i want

1324643
dictionary	arrays
and output it -- note arrays key unlike dictionary key are unordered

1324650
hash	md5
furthermore though very unlikely there is a chance that md5 hash of different strings could collider i seem to recall the probability as being 1 in 36 to the power of 32

1324669
contains	elements
1 add the class linksbelow to all the tr elements that contains a table.navitem immediately after a tr that containss a table.navheader within .nav table

1324670
pdf-viewer	acrobat
pdf-viewer control without acrobat reader install

1324671
selected	textbox
.so if an option of value -1 or 0 is selected a new textbox is not created

1324674
hash	md5
if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for int primary key

1324674
hash	md5
another question is what are the upsides of using an md5 hash

1324680
subtraction	addition
dear professor subtraction should be defined in terms of addition

1324680
complement	addition
i m using 9 s complement to simplify speed up the addition no pesky carry required

1324682
constructor	object
if you use the constructor in actionscript you get a bare-metal object where nothing but construction of the object itself has been completed

1324688
hash	md5
calculating an md5 hash and using it as a key for something that s already unique is redundant

1324688
hash	md5
on the other hand if named is not unique then the md5 hash won t be unique either and .so it s pointless that way too

1324688
hash	md5
generally you use an md5 hash .when you don t want to store the actual value of the column

1324688
hash	md5
for instances if you re storing passwd you generally only store the md5 hash of the passwd not the passwd itself .so that you can t see people s passwd just by looking at the table contents

1324702
prism	mef
to what extent if any is mef a replacement for prism

1324703
radio-button	button	radio-button	selected	selected	button
.when the user selected a button i would like to calculate the sum of each selected radio-button value and show this sum to the user

1324703
selected	button
.so far i have tried two ways of setting this up in the first methods i create a hidden-field for each grouping to hold the sum of the selected value inside it this hidden-field gets the value but the problem is that the total value will not updates .when a user selected a button

1324705
jquery	.post
however .when you make the request via jquery you need to pick either get or .post

1324720
.when	ready
note that the above is not even about actually rendering the css .so you may still see the screens change .when ready kicks in

1324720
firefox	safari	.when	ready
moving the stylesheet below all javascript indeed show that the javascript including the ready function runs much earlier but even then the jquery-applied class --which is yet unknown .when the javascript runs-- is used correctly in my quick tests in safari and firefox

1324724
jquery	.post
i am currently working on a project that lets users .post comments with jquery and ajax

1324742
prism	mef
take a look at this sparkling client podcast on mef and prism

1324748
subtract	time	subtract	add
assume i have 2 time intervals such as 16 30 - 20 00 and 15 00 - 19 00 i need to find the total time between these two intervals .so the result is 5 hours i add both intervals and subtract the intersection interval how can i write a generics function which al.so deals with all cases such as one interval inside other .so the result is the interval of the bigger one no intersection .so the result is the sum of both intervals

1324761
triggers	insert	sequences	unique
in one transactional i m insert one recording into a parent table which has a triggers and sequences to create a unique recordingid then that recordingid is used for the relationship to a child table for a variables numbers of insert to the child table

1324761
value	field
insert-into parenttable field list value data list

1324761
value	field
insert-into childtable recordid field list value recordid data list

1324761
value	field
insert-into childtable recordid field list value recordid data list

1324773
any	set
i don t have any code for this but i have seen where the shape was tesselated in this case using polygons triangulation .so you would have a nice set of triangles

1324785

exit is a libs function that does various forms of libs cleanup before exiting--for example it fflush stdio buffering to disk

1324873
formatting	printing
printing some additional formatting

1324878
prism	mef
consensus in the duplicates .post is that mef and prism provide the same basic set of functionality in different ways except that prism provides the event aggregator which is a pub-sub means of communication between application components

1324884
contains	elements
for example the elements contains a mapping between an error-code or exception-handling types and the path of a resource in the web application.

1324884

1324904
python	ruby
does the ruby python code get messy .when trying to include a bunch of .net compiled assemblies

1324904
ironpython	ironruby
i chose ironpython as the answer since it had the most support but i ll spend a bit of time with each of ironpython boo and ironruby to see what the testers would prefer to write scripting in

1324907
required	checked
being a .net application it would required .net to run thus you couldn t checked for .net prerequisites unless you coded a boot strap in c++

1324927
leksah	ghci
there s also the leksah ide which i haven t used yet as i m a vim and terminal user but it has a graphical frontend to the ghci debugger according to the manual

1324939
addition	division
addition and division are not defined on python lists

1324961

1324962
bitblt	gdi
will gdi and bitblt be better

1324964
scrollable	panels
write your own scrollbar scrollable panels

1324979
g++	gcc
in practice that means you can compile c++ programs using gcc instead of g++ but you ll need to add the -lstdc++ directive

1324983
directx	gdi
i have never had good luck with gdi to do high speed graphics .so i used directx but ms has dropped support for managed directx .so you may need to do this in unmanaged c++

1324984
ironpython	ironruby
while ironruby ironpython aren t strictly domain-specific they are full-featured and it would leave you to get on with your implementation

1325011

i ve heard somewhere i think it was one of the google io 2009 conferences that they were successfully testing their code with a fake dom in the jvm and not in javascript with the dom

1325074
getter	setter
edit i am aware that the map named comes from the getter- and setter- methods nameds. the only way i can think of to do it is within animalcontainer to have an attributes of each types of animal have setter and getter for all of them and enforce that only one is valued at a time

1325075
configuration	environment	any	set
i ve seen options for changing the command-line parameters or environment variables for tomcat but is there a way to set it that is self-contained in the .war file and not dependent on any tomcat configuration

clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
silverlight looks for clientaccesspolicy.xml which is specific to silverlight if thats not found it will fallback on crossdomain.xml which can also be used by flash for instances

1325184
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
lets stick with clientaccesspolicy.xml for now since there are less caveats and the crossdomain.xml support was only added to catch up with flash since public service like flickr already have one

1325206

constructor	object
a constructor is not a normals function i don t think it can actually return anything it is just here to initializer some data in the object upon its initializerr

1325228
constructor	object
a constructor s sole purpose is to initializer an object

1325228
constructor	object
in your example signup is your object it s not a return-value from the constructor

1325238
delta	diff
however if every time you publishing changes you scripting out the entire database including data to sql using the sql-server database publishinging wizard you should be able to extraction diff between the versioning and get your delta that way

then we ll modify the login code to authentication the login if the passwd is present and the ip-address is correct

1325251

1325268
json	xml
xml apis are another matter but the points of json is to be lightweight and map to native language construct

hash	md5
then make a hash md5 or sha1 from that string

1325316
attributes	properties
maybe worth noting that the properties value is generics and that .when the mapping is done using attributes it works perfect

1325333
dictionary	map
this can be done by using a rolling hash see wikipedia for rabin-karp string-matching algorithm to generator all n hash in linear time and using a hashtable bst or a map or dictionary or whatever your language call it to store the corresponding substring positioning

1325351
archive	backup
should i consider using file bits archive bit or something to differentiate between files that have been printed and take the chance that a backup program could run -or- increase the testing maintenance overhead of the application by creating a datasource for it cross-reference table in xml and introduce another moving piece

1325360
repository	entity
in most scenarios i have seen with linq2sql and using a repository types pattern you would have a generics types of entity returned and you would use partial-classes to extends the behavior of the linq2sql classes

1325363
erlang	scala
i m not sure in what state remote actors are in scala iirc they were rather dodgy but in the future .when them in-place symbols could well be very useful in much the same way as they are in erlang

1325364

the wpf xaml processor uses properties systemd methods for dependency-properties .when loading binary xaml and process attributes that are dependency-properties

1325432

1325454
dependency-injection	service-locator
my situation may be different than yours in that we already have a systemd designed for very flexible configuration .so adding dependency-injection to that configuration was almost trivial but it seems to me that using the service-locator pattern will not save you much configuration as you must still specify how to locate the service

1325454
dependency-injection	inject
being able to flexibly inject mock object for testing is an almost invaluable benefit to using dependency-injection .so i would say that configuration overhead may just be a cost of doing business you need to accept to gain the benefits

zend-debugger	xdebug
if changing log_errors_max_len in this sample code to 0 doesn t work but changing it to a numbers larger than 1024 has some effect then you are almost certainly loading a zend_extension somewhere that is overrides php s standards behavior such as zend-optimizer zend-debugger xdebug etc

entity-relationship	diagram
2 use entity-relationship uml model techniques to come up with a datamodel diagram design

1327132
ref	out
some subtleties exist if you re-use the variables in which case it can t necessarily be removed by the compiler and if that variables is capture by a lambda anon-method or used in a ref out

1327136
contains	elements
by default handler elements of the iis configuration contains

pdfsharp	migradoc
you say pdfsharp but you actually use migradoc

1327209
environment	building
ideally you would building a staging server which can be a virtual-machine as opposed to a real server which has exactly or as close as possible to the same environment as the production server

1327212
pdfsharp	migradoc
sounds like you re using migradoc not pdfsharp

1327224
testng	junit
i would recommend looking at the junit or testng xml report

1327257

dictionary	arrays
i have a nsdictionary object contains arrays of object for particular key problem is that i call a function in a class which populate this dictionary and return .when i access object for key it returns me an arrays contains same numbers of object as i insert but .when i try to access the individual object in this arrays i got an obj_msgsend error

1327287
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
you have not mentioned what database you use but all the ones that i have used oracle postgresql mysql have functions that give you any format you want in your selected statement

1327314
value	field
obviously because we have more than one matching elements we need more than just a classname .so that the date value gets returned to the originating field rather than just the first match

1327330
value	field
the getter just returns the value from a private field

1327349
freebsd	linux	solaris	freebsd	solaris	linux
the solution should work on linux freebsd and solaris

1327353
for-loop	loops
instead of a dummy criterion in the for-loop you can use the actual criterion that you want to use for loops

1327354
swing	swt
we re running swing and are using an swt bridge to get ahold of the swt browser

1327372
solaris	freebsd
the lsb also works fine if you program for freebsd and solaris

1327418
decrement	increment
whenever a process starts using memory it increment this count and before exiting it decrement the count.plus if the count becomes 0 free the memory

1327425
sequences	subset
the modification was to use a sliding windows over the target to ensure the subset sequences was found

1327434
freebsd	linux	solaris	freebsd	solaris	linux
it works on linux according to manpage works on solaris i am not sure about freebsd - look at the manpage and search for map_anon or map_anonymous

1327441
unicode	tamil
of course a more sensible solution in general is the use of unicode but i understand that the unicode people and tamil aren t really getting along well

1327447
arrays	loops
i d tend to use for if i m actually using the counter in loops say as an index into an arrays and as part of the criterion stop at the end of the arrays rather than just don t overflow

1327459
tostring	equals
moq hide unreleated methods such as equals tostring and .so on to make their fluent-interface even easier to use

1327463
jsonp	ajax
ajax libs usually use xmlhttprequest or jsonp to implements the http request

1327463
javascript	dom
most javascript frameworks now use an implementation of css or xslt selectors to query the dom

1327472
value	field
note that if field_name contains .some null value these won t contribute to the count .so it s best to use a column that never contains null value such as a primary key or other index field

1327475
triggers	insert
i think this can only be accomplished with an after insert and an after delete triggers

1327475
decrement	increment
in the after insert you increment the contentcount column in the after delete you decrement it

1327483
google-chrome	safari
tested on ff3 ie7 ie8 safari google-chrome

1327484
any	set
anyone have any advice on whether or not this is a good idea and if it is if there are tutorials set ways and patterns to doing this sort of thing

1327485
authentication	login
edit after some more playing around i think the setcredentials function is used .when the remote-server is expecting authentication information to login

1327516
selected	button
in fact import and export is 2 functions button in program on user-interface there is a grid that list lots of tables what i need to implements is to export selected tables s data to a disk file and import data back to database later

1327574
rhino-mocks	moq
i ve used both rhino-mocks and moq and they both have this functionality

1327576
gethashcode	equals
one caveat is that you also have to overrides gethashcode if you overrides equalss to ensure that two object that are equals also returns the same hashcode

1327580
for-loop	arrays
the problem is that you are overwriting the arrays in each iterator of your for-loop

1327588
any	set
my problem is i don t see cant set any properties value for the bean methodinvokingtask last one where i should have

1327613

in typemock the default is don t care for specific arguments

1327619
google-chrome	opera
which indicates what the other valid value are opera google-chrome iexplore etc

1327642
arrays	loops
the big issues have been with the arrays prototype people mistakenly thinking prototype break their for..in loops it doesn t

1327657
arrays	loops
since you specify the time interval that a messages is display for at maximum you could simply use a javascript settimeout to loops through an arrays at the same interval creating a new messages

1327706
linux	unix
to begin if you have access to a unix linux macos box there is a list in usr dictionary words or usr shared dictionary words

1327711
hide	show
what i want to happen is that .when you hover over an li the controls for that respective li show .when you move your mouse away they hide again

1327719
reflection	runtime
is there a way to find out the assembly named at design-time not using reflection or runtime apis such as system.reflection.assembly.getentryassembly from within visual-studio

1327719
reflection	runtime
please do not respond back with runtime apis that use reflection - there is no assembly file present at the time i need the assembly named - just the metadata of the assembly in the csproj file

1327736
contains	elements
i want to write a linq query that returns the first grouping elements that contains a sub-elements reference

1327777
authentication	login
i assume you are using windows-authentication - otherwise say if you were using form-based authentication you would also have to get the user to login again by redirecting to a login page

1327781
any	set
jquery works as well with asp.net as with any other server platform because it s just a set of client-side scripting

1327805
google-chrome	safari
this seems to be ok for ff3.5 ff3 ie8 ie7 ie6 google-chrome safari

1327808
selected	button
the button also only appears through ajax after a selected value has been selecteded on a previously display drop down

1327835
vb.net	vb6
i have converted a vb6 application to vb.net because eventually i want to convert it to c#

1327870
configuration	installation
that is you use a tool like puppet to install all the dependencies that the server has and run your install process before every installation .so that all the configuration is reset

1327879
value	field
the view should show a variables count field depending on the types and with a given attributes key as labels and value for the data

1327922
highlight	cell
now i also want to highlight all those cell for this datagrid column which are having data more than 8 characters

1327928
selected	listbox
there is a requirement that a user be able to selected an item from a listbox that could contains over 30 000 entries

1327946
selected	listbox
have you ever tried selected something from a listbox with 30 000 items

1327949
scp	ssh
alternative use wget to downloading the ftp-file to local machine then scp to target machine i suppose using public-key-authentication for ssh that scp does not need a passwd then it should end up simple like this

1327961
csv	xml	export	csv
you could also export into a file-format ie xml or csv and then parsing this from your c# program

1327981
selected	checkbox
paging of content optional with checkbox to selected items

1327998
python	c++
if you are interested as to why i want to do this it s because i wrote my program slider3.py in python and my partner wrote his in c++ gentest.cc and his needs to call mine

1328031
value	field
entries will return the fieldname and the value submitted for the field

1328031
value	field
is for retriving the that field entries labels value .

1328031

have you considered calling the python code directly from the c++

1328061
python	c++
here is a tutorial on using boost to call python functions from c++

1328073
listbox	textbox
i d suggest adding a textbox right above your listbox

1328092
updating	updates
of course .when i first updates the invoicesattachment table i ll get a foreign key violation from the sql-server .so i tried updating the attachment table first which will create the rows but will remove the attachment as.sociations in the invoiceattachment table

1328095
repository	entity
right now i have separate repository classes for each entity computerassetrepository deploymentrepository directoryrepository and .so on then i have a computerrepository that call each child repository and returns the result into the computer aggregate root entity

1328098
contains	any
it wouldn t be too tricky to create one myself but i was wondering if there were any accessible apps that could do this with the files contains the code

1328103
calayer	uiview
uiview is basically a wrapper for calayer

1328106
spaces	output
sets list output separator to spaces

1328113
configuration	installation
the installation program probably sets the necessary configuration value in the registry

1328121
string.format	stringbuilder
.when i need to join two strings i use string.format or stringbuilder if it happens in several places in the code

1328125
configuration	environment
and finally in configuration environment development.rb

1328145
msbuild	nant
for a local development-environment this is fine but if you want to deploy to a test or staging server than look at another solution such as the web-deployment-project or use nant or msbuild

1328146
shutdown	exit
at least one of these other process is also written in java and has a numbers of shutdown hooks as it automatically saves a preferences file on exit and kills process it has started itself such as

1328156
png	gif
basically once i ve created a png or gif file how do i get that show up in an mfc cview windows

1328173
xsd	xml
xml bulk-load - looks pretty good but i get the impression i am expected to write an xsd which details all the relationships

1328189
subtract	add
also this methods resolves collission for moving object giving also the momentum of collision resolve the relative angularjs velocity subtract velocity b from velocity a this way the problem is reduced to a moving object and a static one and add the velocity in the axis you are testing to the extent of the polygons a if they intersect rest the original extent of the polygons and you will get the momentum of collission

1328221
xquery	xslt
and i d positively love to see an xslt 2.0 xquery 1.0 implementation for .net

1328229
delphi	c++
bestcode.com tbcparsing - the math parsing for delphi and c++ builder versioning 3.5

1328259
sql-server	oracle
it still works for sql-server but fails in case of oracle

1328259
sql-server	oracle
i m unable to figure out the cause as the same odbc drivers are being used for both oracle and sql-server

1328265
user-interface	look-and-feel
this is nice but if one is developing a consistant look-and-feel to all ones applications having to drop a vendors toolbar makes this difficult as one now has this odd set of menu button that look and behave differently to the rest of my user-interface

1328270
contains	any
a view is a query over one or more base relations but does not actually contains any data itself

1328274
selected	button
in case you want to go back to the upper hyerarchical level you have to selected the back navigation button in the top bar blue one and the tab bar should disappear

1328287
callback	methods
my preferred methods of storing this types of client-side state is to set a callback which delivers the new state to the server via ajax

1328301
constructor	object
something else to consider that i use regularly would be passing the dictionary itself into the constructor for your object and to automcatically add the object to the dictionary as it comes in to keep your code encapsulated

1328303
firefox	opera
i ve tested in firefox and opera

1328306
selected	button
click the little arrow on the edges of the add button and selected add as link

1328310
compact-framework	.net
i am trying to connect to mysql database from a .net compact-framework using c#

1328320
authentication	login
i would publishing your custom plugins after the core joomla authentication plugins .so that normals users will be able to login faster

1328325
nsarraycontroller	nstreecontroller
leaving binding aside do nsarraycontroller and nstreecontroller have any other important advantage

1328325
nsarraycontroller	nstreecontroller
should i create a class that has an nsarraycontroller or nstreecontroller as instances and wrap the functionality of the c containers

1328365
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
the basic trick behind this code is to sort of peek the color in the upper left corner to determine whether the sip is already in regular keyboard or numeric mode and then to simulate a mouse click if necessary in the same corner to ensure that the sip is in the mode desired

1328407
jax-ws	cxf
this fails to parsing with wsdl2java in cxf a jax-ws implementation due to the soapenc arrays bit

1328440
contains	elements
also the filtering methods searches the elements contains in your jquery object not their children

1328457
data-structures	tree
unless your company is in the business of selling tree data-structures that is not a part of your core domain

1328457
data-structures	tree
now selling tree data-structures may sound stupid but there are actually companies that do that

1328457
data-structures	tree
for example the bcl team inside microsoft s developer division they actually sell well for certain definitions of sell anyway the .net s base-class libs which include among others tree data-structures

1328457
data-structures	tree
if however selling tree data-structures is your core domain then the named you listed are just fine

1328457
data-structures	tree
they are the named that subject matter experts programmers in this case use .when talking about the domain of tree data-structures

1328461
google-webmaster-tools	googlebot
register your site using the google-webmaster-tools which lets you set how often and how many request per second googlebot should try to index your site

1328486
constructor	private
.when you make a private no-arg constructor to prevent initializer of your utility classes you should have the constructor throw an exception-handling unsupportedoperationexception-handling

1328486
private-members	constructor
this is because you can actually access private-members including constructor through reflection

1328486
abstract	extends
making the utility class abstract is not a good idea because it makes the class look like it is intended to be extendsed and furthermore you can extends the class and thereby initializer it

1328490
updating	updates
i am trying to figure out a way to updates my web-config for different environment by updating the configsource for the appsettings elements in the web-config

1328504
callback	methods
another way is to re-bind using the callback of whichever of jquery s ajax methods you have opted to use example

1328518
string.format	stringbuilder
back then if you had some process that was going to hit a line of code that was concatenation strings a few million time you could get a huge speed increase by using string.concat string.format or stringbuilder

1328528
radians	cos	radians	sin	cos	sin
rotation for the the cos and sin methods should be in radians but i think draw should be in degrees if i remember correctly

1328536
decimal	hex
of the available hash i had these are the ones i could convert between decimal and hex

1328592
google-webmaster-tools	googlebot
register at google-webmaster-tools verify your site and throttle googlebot down

1328601
sql-server	postgresql
my question here really is is it possible to use dbi-link postgresql tool to connect to sql-server 2008

1328601
sql-server	postgresql
it s just a matter of reading from postgresql a view inside sql-server 2008 a simple view such as

1328646
updatepanel	gridview
my current solution is to use asp.net s gridview control with asp.net s ajax updatepanel to give it that ajax feel

1328652
32-bit	x86
i can t seem to get mysql 5.0.32 on 32-bit x86 debian to honour transaction-isolation levels

1328658
value	field
if you decided to add a value # testbean.myselectitem it would not change the outputted html in any way but the jsf implementation would know that the getter properties for the myselectitem field should be used on this

1328658
value	field	getter	setter
the value properties of the selectitem bind the selectitem to an selectitem field in the managed-bean via getter and setter properties

1328658
value	field
the itemvalue will then be stored in the h selectoneradio s value which hopefully you have bound up to a string field like this

1328664
xcopy	cmd
error 1 the cmd xcopy f asoadmin_ml_view leaf console bin debugging console

1328681
arrays	map
its also nice to remember that the f selectitems can points to a selectitem an arrays or collections of selectitem object or a map mapping labels to value

1328690
firefox	safari
ie 6 7 8 and firefox 2 3 3.5 behave the way you describe safari for windows 3 4 rendering nothing .when you comment out the second document.write or do something like document.write abc

1328691
xcopy	cmd
your building-process likely has a pre .post building step associated with it that is execution the xcopy cmd

1328691
command-line	cmd
to diagnose these cmd try running them from the command-line after you building your project

1328708
restart	reload
it will not automatically be reload unless your application specifically supports reload or if your web containers restart the web application during hot deployment

1328751
mousedown	mouseup
try replacing the click action with mousedown and mouseup one after the other using your locator as the parameter

1328765
subtract	time
the problem is that .when the database that is located in a separate time zone is updates with a date value the database automatically subtract 1 00 hour from the date it was passed

1328766
base-class	inherited
any class can be a delegation it s informal protocols meaning you don t need to declare any interface nor inherited any base-class you can simply write your own delegation methods

1328770
google-chrome	safari
i had some kind of similar problem where my draggable elements were absolutely positioning and became relatively positioning in google-chrome and safari

1328778
configuration	environment	environment	building
the general approach we use to solving this problem is to set up the building scripting to read the database connection strings from a configuration file and then set up one file per environment

1328778
configuration	environment	environment	building
then you set up the building scripting to read the configuration file based on the specified environment

1328778
configuration	environment	environment	building
.so building running on a developer workstation run using the workstation configuration and building running in the codeigniter environment use the codeigniter settings

1328796
put	get
.when you need to access the buffering in terms of bytes you may use the get and put methods

1328796
put	get
bytebuffer also has an asintbuffer methods which changes the default get and put behavior to int instead of byte

1328812
defined	declare
any functions or classes defined in include files are declare in the global scoping

1328813
grouping	sorting
configure the control for things like sorting searching expanding grouping paging etc use the api reference

1328816
required	checked
i would checked the documentation for the mcwebservicecomwrapper.daterange object and see if you are required to initializer it with value before you can use it

1328824
any	set
create an event handler for the keypress event of the form and in there you can set the handled properties of the keypresseventargs to true to prevent the key stroke from being passed to any of the controls

1328857
32-bit	64bit
if you are running in a 64bit environment try switching to 32-bit

1328866
selected	button
click on the selected button next to the attach to box and make sure it is set to automatically determine the types of code to debugging and that transport is set to default

1328871
logging	trace
you could incorporate a logging mechanism and get these log files alongside stack trace

1328872
subclassing	nsobject
your controllers for now should be a subclassing of nsobject

1329001
shutdown	restart
is there any way to detection shutdown restart event and prevent system-shutdown restart

1329001
shutdown	restart
it is not important that the event is shutdown or restart both of them must be cancelled

1329033
selected	button
i would try selected the options button on the solver parameters dialogue box and then increase the precision say from the default of 0.000001 to 0.00000001

1329053
nested-lists	tree
forum discussions if anything are nested-lists tree .so to be really correct they should be modelled as nested elements in tree discussions or as s definition lists which basically as.sociates several value answers with one key question to reflect stack overflowâ s question-answer form

1329085
wamp	php
here s my configuration wamp 2.0g php 5.2.9 apache 2.2.11 netbeans 6.7.1

1329087
for-loop	loops
then for loops you need a plain for-loop rather than a for each

1329098
32-bit	64bit
i just recently move a sql db from sql2005 32-bit -- 64bit

1329110
itemscontrol	textblock
the strings are display in textblock i ve declare in the itemscontrol templates

1329113
digits	zero	digits	base	base	zero
because octal base 8 only has digits 0-7 08 is invalid and treated as zero

1329128
shutdown	restart
because allowing programs to prevent shutdown restart would be somewhat of a security vulnerability don t you think

1329128
shutdown	restart
if the user tells the systemd to shutdown or restart that s what s going to happen

1329134
subtraction	addition
i don t get my date addition and subtraction very easily but it was much easier to get the data in there in the format i wanted

1329143
protected	public
the class itself is public but some of its properties are protected internal abstract like

1329149
jndi	jms
however you ll need to know how to get to the jms provider directly -- without using jndi since that is provided by the javaee application-server

1329159
identifier	temporary
also don t forget that you can temporary disable the identityinsert functionality and perform insert including of the identifier and then re-enable the identity insert function which is what generator the auto-incrementing identifier field and that will allow you to get rid of the archivepresql table entirely

1329163
unsigned	short
how can i write 23 .so that it is clear it is an unsigned short int

1329178
unsigned	short
numeric literals cannot have short or unsigned short types

1329178
unsigned	short
of course inorder to assign to bar the value of the literals is implicit converted to unsigned short

1329178
unsigned	short
casting is potentially worse since with some compilers it will quell any warnings that would be issued if the literals value is outside the range of an unsigned short

1329178
unsigned	short
if nothing else this only works if the unsigned short versioning actually exists whereas a call with the cast performs the usual overload-resolution to find the most compatible versioning available

1329195
webforms	asp.net
my experience comes from asp.net webforms but i would go with the layout proposed in the link you gave

1329198
display	width
.when the width is an odd numbers i do not see the right hand grey colour of the tab and the div is display as expected

1329203
any	set
typicaly you put the dll in any directory and set up a reference to it

1329204
return-value	arguments
leaving test_input_a and test_input_b as functions that take a single messages arguments with the return-value arguments already bound

1329207
put	get
both project have had allot of effort put into them by different people to get a good sepperation of concerns in the context of asp.net-mvc and domain-driven-design

1329227
textbox	button
to avoid these types of things you should really bind your textbox to public properties then bind your button isenabled to another public properties that in the getter will checked if the textbox are empty by checkeded the properties they are bound to

1329238
value	field
selected click here to add a new clause then choose your field named again and enter your unique value as starbucks and click ok you can repeat this process for other field you want the totals on

haskell	c++
you can abuse either of these three to do the same thing as any of the others since ultimately they are just iterator over an iterator except for transform s form that takes two iterator as input. the points is that for_each is not a replacement for map folding - that should be done by transform accumulate - although c++ doesn t natively have something that expresses the map folding concept as well as haskell does - but both gcc and vc++ support openmp which has a much better analogue in #pragma openmp parallel.for

malloc	free
if you use malloc the spaces is allocated on the heap which must be explicit free

1335245
malloc	free
if you don t malloc it then you can t free it as far as i remember

1335246
malloc	free
good rules of thumb if you malloc you must free

1335247
malloc	free
note that you only free what you malloc

1335249
malloc	free
compare this to memory allocated on the heap via malloc which you must explicit free

1335252
contains	elements
i know that i can get the currently selected text but how can i get the dom elements which contains the start or end of the current selection

1335260
installation	building
i m using wix3 to building a setup file i would like to know whether the outlook is running during the installation

innodb	myisam
as a key the row_pointer being a file offset for myisam or the value of the row s primary key for innodb

1335345
sql-server	mysql
this is less of the case for mysql but more advanced optimizers sql-server for instances can utilize the fact the data are unique and building a more efficient plan

1335383
value	field
why are you trying to put a value into an identity field

1335414
contains	any
i want to maintain the named of the images and i can t have any false postives as the original text will contains other urls i want to leave alone

1335421
duplicates	contains
instead of creating full views create a partials view an .ascx file and have it contains the duplicates code and markup

1335422
solaris	freebsd
similar mechanisms freebsd has kqueue and solaris has dev poll

1335428
rollback	commit
imo autonomous transactionalal are particularly adapted to logging they run independently from the main session meaning you can write in a table commit or rollback changes without affecting the main transactional

1335454
temporary	copy
you can however use the unpack goal to unpack the archive to a temporary folder then use the maven-antrun-plugin to copy the required subfolders to their final resting places

1335461
toggle	slider
i tried to slider in and out a div with the toggle function of jquery but the result is always jumpy at the start and or end of the animation

1335461
margins	padding
i did more search and i found that s an old bug in jquery with margins and padding applied to the div

1335461
margins	padding
.so if i switching the margins to padding it fix the problem

1335461
margins	padding
if i want to use one of the simplest effect in jquery i have to not use the proper function slidetoggle but instead use some hand made code and wrap the div in another div and switching margins to padding messing my layout

1335490
png	gif
this will now replace the first part of the path for jpg png and gif and keep the filename

1335492
nsmutablestring	nsstring
problem ehre assuming you initing your arrays properly could be that foobar assings an nsstring not an nsmutablestring .so its failing because if distinct types you should do

1335532
visitor-pattern	visitor
for example if you want to create html output for a graphing of object you could a write a htmlstring methods on each object and call it for each object or b use the visitor-pattern and create a concrete visitor that knows how to produce html output for each nodes it visits

1335575
value	field
i need to create a table-variable with an identity seed that starts with the max value of a field in another table

1335579
radio	click
the idea is the user pick 1 of the 5 radio button and then click the button

1335579
selected	button
upon click the button i verify not using form validation because i wanted a different feel that a button is checked and then store the selected option in a database

1335583
lightbox	jquery
looking for a lightbox which is jquery based compatible with ier and naturally all major browsers lightweight and easy to customize like border thickness and color and be used for submission forms

1335589
exception-handling	error-handling
and not you should not really be using exception-handling for general error-handling

1335590
environment	building
i know there are many other questions out there but they all the best solutions required above .net 2.0 which is the current building environment i m working in

1335595
anonymous-function	function-call
.so the situation is less than ideal but if you want to access the calling function in javascript across all major browsentity-relationships you can use the function-call entity-relationship propentity-relationshipties eithentity-relationship accessed directly on a named function refentity-relationshipence or from within an anonymous-function via the arguments.call ee propentity-relationshipties

1335599
traversal	parent
you could batch-file the parent traversal

1335599
children	nodes
this isn t recommended but if you limit say each nodes to having 100 children you could say that nodes with an id 10030711 has path of 10 - 03 - 07 - 11

1335616
streamwriter	stringwriter
for example i types writer - and completion show me all writer textwriter stringwriter streamwriter - etc

1335618
contains	elements
the zip function returns a list of tupless where the i-th tuples contains the i-th elements from each of the arguments sequences or iterable

1335621
any	set
i want to set it .so that applet wil not be caching at all as any bugs can easilly be ironed out

1335648
contact	submit
after someone submit the form the html in that div gets replace with a success messages instead of the entire page reload the reasons for doing this aren t too relevant...but basically this contact form is way below the folding and i don t want the page to refresh back to the top if there are any errors success messagess etc

1335648
contact	submit
i m trying to tracking google adwords conversions to see how many visitor submit a contact form

1335669
directory	folder
make sure you change the c my directory and c destination folder to their correct value

1335670
streamwriter	stringwriter
many class have different implementsation for the same feature thing streamwriter stringwriter xmlwriter ..you do not need to worry about how they implements the writing you just need to call it

1335682
fancybox	lightbox
fancybox is a really good alternative to other lightbox

1335726
any	set
any time you ve got a standards set of icons - especially if they re of uniform size and unlikely to change

1335729
attributes	properties	value	field
i recommend you to do a simple for-loop since for..in is meant to iterate over object properties also note that you need to checked the value attributes of the field

1335731
restart	reload
are you sure you did restart or reload of postgresql after pg_hba.conf change

1335737
google-chrome	firefox
i currently use google-chrome firefox for my web development

1335763
selection	highlight
using this same tool highlight elements you would like to see the generator source for and then right click to see view selection source

1335774
postgresql	firebird
but in stored-procedures firebird is much more powerful than postgresql

1335774
firebird	mysql
two or three years any linux distribution not including firebird only mysql and postgresl

1335774
opensuse	ubuntu
not for nothing today but tradicionesles distributions ubuntu opensuse fedora centos etc etc and

1335774
postgresql	firebird
postgresql do not say that is worse than firebird firebird is not that much better than postgresql

1335774
postgresql	firebird
but without hesitation i say that firebird has nothing to envy to postgresql and in many ways is more powerful

1335822
base-class	inherited
using virtual inherited from your exception-handling s base-class es prevents ambiguity problems at the catch-site in case someone throw an exception-handling derived from multiple base which have a base-class in common

1335823
rollback	commit
after you commit or rollback the transactional or disconnect and reconnect the data vanishes

1335836
pointers	stack
defined a pointers that lives in the current scoping s stack spaces but that references memory elsewhere in this one now is the time is stored elsewhere in memory commonly a string table

1335836
pointers	stack
also note that because the data belonging to the second definition the explicit pointers is not stored in the current scoping s stack spaces it is unspecified exactly where it will be stored and should not be modified

1335850
any	set
in any case you just set up a pipeline with multiple concurrent readers on the same writer which yield mostly undeterministic results

1335857
contains	elements
an arrays contains the elements

1335860
xsd	xml
from c# we are initializer this report and populating it with an xml file that conforms to this xsd and has been validation against it

1335867
background-color	transparency
i changed the background-color of the panels to red and the background-color of the groupbox to transparency and those ares of the groupbox are properly transparency

1335868
authentication	login
in this example if the user hasn t been authentication they will be redirected to a login page and if they have been the action methods is using the user.identity.named which is the usernamed they logged in with or their windows login to lookup and return an instances of a myuser object from your database and puts the user s full named in viewdata to be display

1335888
debugging	trace
otherwise you ll lose your stack trace and debugging will be more painful than it needs to be

1335888
exception-handling	try-catch
since the methods already throw exception-handling there s no need to re-wrap whatever s throw by csvreader and the nullpointerexception-handling will be caught in the calling try-catch just as well as anything else

1335892
silverlight	wpf
i am thinking about the design of a wpf or silverlight application

1335916
subclassing	inherited
but the second - and maybe more important - is that inherited required you to understand the workings of not only the parent class but all of the ancestry classes which makes extension harder but also more brittle because a change in the parent class implementation could easily break the subclassing

1335945
system.data	.net
i m targeting .net 3.5 but cannot get system.data to come up in intellisense

1335948
configuration	environment	environment	building
you will have to specify each of the environment variables and the value that you want passed to ant in the configuration of the building file within eclipse

1335954
contains	set
this will set the cause of the exception-handling .so the entire stack-trace will al.so contains a stack-trace of the original exception-handling

1335966
build-process	ant
if you re running from within eclipse or an eclipse-like environment eclipse can be kind of weird in that depending on how you launchd it it s startup scripting won t make your environment natively available to your in-ide ant build-process

1335966
environment	building
with my eclipse-based ant building i had to manually set the environment

1335966
environment	building
even if you re not using eclipse exactly like i was poke around in the building properties and you should be able to find a way to specify environment variables and make them available to the building-process

1335982
value	field
the hook_view and its nodes_save are below the rest of the code is in a computed field in the project content-type summing up value from another nodes

1335988
value	field
do use a plural typename for an enumerator with bit field as value also called a flags enum

1335989
lightbox	thickbox
if you use thickbox to display the lightbox it is as simple as adding a css class to the link to make it open in a lightbox

1335989
webforms	asp.net
do use the iframe mode of thickbox since the ajax mode can give some problems in conjunction with asp.net webforms

1336041
postgresql	firebird	postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	firebird	oracle	firebird	mysql	oracle	mysql
i ve been working with postgresql firebird oracle mysql mssql more than 6 years ago and my preferred are firebird and postgresql

1336041
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
postgresql is better in web sites and internet applications developed in php python and ruby but i think that this will not be for much time

1336052
exception-handling	try-catch
generally you don t want to do anything more than log an exception-handling which happens .when closing a re.source .so it should really go in its own try-catch

1336056
debugging	trace	error-logging	trace
i ve already disabled any types of error-logging as well as i removed debugging and trace symbols

1336068
attributes	properties	communication	messages
because you specify the retain attributes for the properties whenever it is assign a new value the retain messages will be sent to that new value communication to the memory manager that you don t want this object deallocated

1336078
cryptography	security
both strong naming and digital signature use public key cryptography to provide evidence about the origin of an assembly .so that you can apply security policy to determine what permissions are granted to the assembly

1336097
.net	wcf
i am making a business specific messaging application it is going to connect between 5000 and 10 000 machines back to our datacenter via wcf no vpns all over the .net

1336110
derived-class	base-class
that aside the code-behind represents the base-class the aspx the derived-class

1336113
debugging	trace
if you use the second methods the stack-trace will now only trace back to your throw new exception-handling line and you ll be forced to do more debugging to figure out what caused that exception-handling to happen

1336115
height	frame
use a frameset on example.com with a 100 height frame of subdomain.mydomain.com

1336158
subclassing	base-class
that being said the normals polymorphism approach involves defining virtual methods within the base-class and overrides them appropriately in the subclassing

1336167
e-commerce	product
i ve been tasked with making an already existing e-commerce site se friendly - which in this case means amongst other things letting the user change the url-for each page product through the back end

1336172
executable	jar
even if it were a java application you d need to invoke the java executable since it knows how to parsing the jar file and access classes and resources within it

1336177
for-loop	loops
since we re changing data within the loops the current implementation needs a for-loop to prevent the exception-handling

1336184
cobertura	emma
there are plugins for many of the major report tools such as cobertura emma junit jdepend etc

1336204
executable	jar
you could just bundle the executable and jar into another zip

1336235
web-services	security
i m running the latest wso2 esb and i was wondering how can i implements a security layer over the existing .net web-services

1336244
ip-address	proxy
there could be a thousand users behind a single web proxy and thus ip-address

1336245
contains	elements
note that the fact that a b c is one arrays elements and that it contains an extra spaces is preserve

1336254
textbox	button
button gets disabled .when the value abc is entered in the textbox and then get enabled .when the value changes to something other then abc

1336262
credentials	account
the reason my workaround is temporary is because i need a solution that s generics and works for multiple users instead of using one user s credentials ive considered requesting a separate user account solely to do this but passwd change often and this technique needs to be deployed throughout a dozen or more sites

1336271
distance	altitude
the mean square distance between the altitude of the surface at the sample points and the actual measured altitude at that points

1336303
sql-server	mysql
further since you are already supporting sql-server you may be able to reuse some code rather than write new code mysql s versioning of sql is not the same as sql-server s versioning

1336318
children	tree
this needs to include the children of my children and going on down the tree

1336332
baud-rate	parity
for my scanner useful com settings baud-rate 9600 bytesize 8 stopbits 1 parity 0

.when the code is production ready tag-it with a unique named

1336344
.when	ready
i would points staging to production databases .when i am sure it is working and ready to be promoted

1336353
any	set
is there any way to set the selected item in a drop down box using the following types code

1336355
debian	linux
i am working on a game for an assignment for my college courses and am being forced essentially to use c# .so on my laptop i am using monodevelop with debian linux

1336376
arrays	loops
i usually find it neater to create an arrays of value and loops through that to create a dropdown

1336391
sql-server	oracle
sorry sql-server syntax i m not an oracle developer - but the concept would still apply

1336391
children	nodes
to get children of the middle nodes

1336398
exception-handling	error-handling
if you design and react to exception-handling with those category in mind realizing that not all api designers follow them - for example xml exception-handling are checked even though the behavior is deterministic for a given xml input and of course spring just decided to avoid checked-exception-handling altogether then you will have clear ways to think about what kind of error-handling you need

1336398
exception-handling	error-handling
once you are thinking in those terms what you do about exception-handling will flow more naturally from what types of error-handling and robustness you are trying to achieve

1336414
nested	assign
they will receive notifications if the address properties itself changes a different address object is assign but will not receive notifications if the data contains by the nested address object the city or street are changed

1336440
silverlight	wpf
while winforms and asp.net were always a struggle to get anything databound consistently and in a maintainable manner silverlight and wpf are built from the ground up for data binding pleasure

1336440
boolean	int
using converter which are dead-simple to write you can bind boolean to visibility settings strings to images int to background colors and .so on

1336440
silverlight	wpf
patterns such as mvvm are perfect for the rich data-binding support in wpf and silverlight

1336440
positioning	slider
together with converter this gives you impressive power to do things like bind the current positioning of a slider control to the selected index of a list control

1336458
linux	unix
coldfusion client variables storage default to the registry on windows and for unix linux platform it default to the cf.registry file

1336458
linux	unix
on unix linux it will only limp .so far then crash the process

1336460
droppable	draggable
i m using jquery s sortable not draggable or droppable and i was wondering how i could highlight the potential drop areas using css that a user has .when the user has begun sorting

1336480
document-database	couchdb
the above meshes more with document-database theory like couchdb

1336488
textbox	button
for instances if i have 6 textbox a b c d e and f and two button controls i d like to only call the validation on textbox a b and c if button 1 is click

1336488
textbox	button
if button 2 is click i d like to only call the validation on textbox d e and f

1336498
textbox	button
mark textbox a b c and button 1 as validationgrouping grouping 1 or something similar

1336498
textbox	button
do the same for textbox d e f and button 2 with a different grouping named

1336504
children	nodes
also you could try enumerating all the children of the my computer nodes - wpd devices usually show up there

1336504
children	nodes
start with the desktop and then enumerate the my computer nodes and then the children of that

1336507
valgrind	gprof
you should use a tool like qprof valgrind or gprof to .profile your code and see where the most execution-time is being spent

1336509
fflush	stdout
after all printf call use fflush stdout

1336513
protected	public
.so if you have any protected public variables declare inside partials code-behind class and you populate that variables with .some value in page_load and if you wants to printing on .aspx page using variablesname it should printing the value which is assign in page_load on webpage

1336525
shell	ifs
if ifs n then one char a pthreads shell doesn t interpreter n as linefeed

1336542
constructor	private
however that constructor need not be public it will use reflection if need be to invoke it .so you may be able to defined the required private constructor just for use by protobuf-net adding a comment as to why and deal with specific serialization related issues there

1336546
versioning	upgrade
..net 1.0 service pack 3 â messagebox â .net framework 1.0 sp 3 â the upgrade patch cannot be install by windows-installer service because the program to be upgrade may be missing or the upgrade may updates a different versioning of the program

1336557
perl	ruby
i m trying to write a command-line scripting to access apple sdk docsets like perldoc for perl or ri for ruby

1336569
constructor	object
if you initializer it in the constructor it will exist wherever the owning object is allocated

1336569
pointers	stack
in reality under the hood a pointers may be passed on stack to facilitate this

1336602
jdbctemplate	jdbc
i can make this dao subclassing hibernatedaosupport and use the session s connection to perform my jdbc but i d rather use jdbctemplate

1336628
javafx	swing
i am developing a swing application but i want to also use javafx with swing

1336634
contains	any
and if your database row contains single apostrophe you can display by assign that value to labels controls text properties and it should work without any issues

1336653
required	checked
you re on the right tracking but you can encapsulate all of the permission checked into a single methods like getproductforuser which takes a product user and the required permission

1336657
javafx	swing
the short story is that embedding javafx in swing is now possible and supported via jfxpanel but the other directions is not supported

1336681
arrays	loops
you could keep an arrays of the ornament named and loops through them adding them to the stage

1336684
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
youtube also uses javascript obfuscation that makes ajax reverse-engineering more difficult

1336689
value	field
i m building a custom control in silverlight and i want one of the field to animate to the value of a dependencyproperties .when that properties is changed

1336694
selected	listbox
and be given a collections of the items that were selected in the listbox

1336705
.when	ready
the ready function triggers .when the dom is registered by the browser

1336741
linux	bsd
i ve used it on linux bsd windows deployment and it worked beautifully

1336789
user-controls	ascx
i did a test on a chartsing control on a aspx page..and it works...but .when i move the code to a ascx user-controls the charts doesnt rendering

1336800
perl	php
here s something in perl i have in my libs and hey let s be honest i m not going to rig this up in php just to give you something working in that language this moment

1336845
qabstractitemmodel	qmodelindex
but since this signals as all qabstractitemmodel functions signalss slots work with a qmodelindex which is not persistent as the documentation clearly says am i supposed to store .somehow a mapping of my data to qpersistentmodelindex es .so .when my data change i will be able to find the corresponding qpersistenmodelindex and use that as arguments to the various qabstractitemmodel functions

1336864
callback	methods
this is a general problem .when using instances methods as callback in javascript

1336876
constructor	object
and using object_factory where i was trying to use the object constructor

1336879
document-ready	.when
this only happens .when i set a timeout on document-ready to focus the first textinput in the pop-up

1336879
firefox	opera
note this only happens in firefox and opera

1336880
eager-loading	one-to-many
at the moment datamapper can use strategic eager-loading sel for one-to-many relationships but not many-to-many where n+1 queries occur

1336884
hash	md5
assuming that a collision between two md5 hash is p 2 -128 this gives an expected numbers of 2 -59 for the numbers of collision

1336884
hash	md5
hence even the probability that the md5 hash collider for two input is already very small

1336905
portrait	screens
we have images that will be display on the default screens portrait mode 320 x 480

1336905
portrait	screens
anticipating that the android os will be appearing on netbooks with default landscape 16 9 screens format what is the best way to handle images that are in a portrait mode format

1336905
portrait	screens
in other words since you can t rotate the screens on these netbooks if you display a portrait mode image on landscape mode screens there will be large blank rectangles on either side of the image

1336909
ruby	php
i m trying to create an hmac in ruby and then verify it in php

1336911
sql-server	oracle
ps i m using oracle not sql-server

1336912
repository	entity
as you mention assembling the document this seems like the responsibility of a factory class that can correctly assemble a valid entity the factory can use the image types repository

1336924
rescue	throw
while i figure i could go ahead and wrap the get in a rescue and verify the exception-handling is throw myself and would hope there s a better methods for doing this

1336952
dictionary	for-loop
you are performing too little assignments inside the for-loop and therefore what you see there is the different time necessary to initializer a dictionary intrinsics object and a custom object

1336974
global-assembly-cache	gac
try putting the dll in the gac global-assembly-cache if you re working with wss

1336995
callback	methods
if you want to focus a textfield after the dialog is loaded the proper way to do it is to put your focus in a callback methods

1336998
any	set
this represents a collections of standardbindingelement which is the configuration class that has all the configuration properties that your binding will support in the .config file and would be responsible for creating your binding instances and setting any properties on it that were set in the .config file

1337025
linux	osx
on linux or osx i just save it as text_animate.cpp and run make text_animate

1337042
value	field
if you want to set the default initial value you should be defining initial like other form field except you set it to the id instead

1337068
jndi	jdbc
in more sophisticated jdbc you get involved with connection pool and the like and application servers often have their own way of registering drivers in jndi and you lookup a datasource from there and call getconnection on it

1337085
portrait	screens
in terms of image resources within the application such as is the case with background images it is a common practice to have different image set for landscape and portrait mode or even different screens sizes

1337085
height	frame
it will adapt the video frame height to landscape mode and it will play the video in the landscape mode whether or not a portrait mode is more suitable

1337095
subclassing	base-class
i ve got a base-class with some information that s shared amongst the subclassing and some data that are completely separate

1337116
simulator	platform
not sure why it still show both on simulator and on platform

1337125
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller visible at the same time

1337129
exception-handling	try-catch
i am using try-catch and logging the exception-handling caught but what i really want is to know which connection is failing

1337130
callback	methods
one approach that s worked well for me is to provide a callback methods that each thread uses to pass back results and status

1337138
silverlight	wpf
fortunately some companies have worked on product that support animaiton in this area but most are moving to the silverlight and wpf platform for those updates features

1337142
cos	sin
the thread here mentioned in another answer gives the parameterization formula for a 3d circle p r cos t u + r sin t nxu + c where u is a unit vector from the centering of the circle to any points on the circumference

1337153
administration	credentials
inetlab release a fixed versioning of mm7.net with a few limitations currently the application needs administration credentials to run properly

1337165

1337413
s#arp-architecture	nhibernate
i m using s#arp-architecture which uses nhibernate

1337414
environment	building
perl s building-tools and cpan do a great job of providing a cross-platform building environment and for distribution of the source code but compared to package-management tools in modern linux distributions they perform suboptimally simply because extra manual intervention is often required that is less easily automated across multiple machines than rolling up a package

1337429
google-chrome	safari

altering the encoding via the -d switching is going to affect all your default encoding mechanisms including redirected stdout stdin stderr

1337635
attributes	properties
how can i dynamically add attributes on those public properties

1337658
configuration	environment	shutdown	restart	environment	restart
a consequence of this .approach is that for java web .app in a customer environment administration deploy the package shutdown the .app server copy platform specific configuration over the top of those that were imbedded in the package and restart the .app server

1337663
if-statement	loops
for example rather than having your main code loops checked which os your using with if-statement then branch to create gui windows with different options for each os your main code would create an object from the factory which use the os to determine which os-specific concrete object to make

1337664
superclass	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	superclass
i think you want a concrete item superclass since it will likely have common field ie title copyright_date publisher etc and subclassing for each subtyping and further sub-sub-classes if you like ie from toy to actionfigure with number_of_joints field using multi-table inherited

1337665
directory	folder
edit i just turned on the ability for the images directory to be listed browsed to it and i was able to see all the previous images that were in the folder but not the new one

1337669

.so they produce different results if the .sources either contains any items in common or have any internal duplicates

1337727
environment	building
new building for each environment

1337727
environment	building
my opinion option 1 required new building for each environment this just doesn t fit my thought about promotaing apps through stages of test

1337736
any	set
is there any way to set the current object as one of the items in the list

1337740
debugging	trace
at the end you can checked if the stringbuilder is-empty and then write it to console debugging trace whatever your unit-testing framework is automatically collecting and let the test fail via assert.fail or similar

1337748
constructor	object
even if the constructor of the object fails and the allocated memory is quickly garbage collected room for the new object is allocated temporary

1337748

1337785
attributes	properties
websitesettings has attributes on its properties .so ninject is trying to re.solve a binding from system.string to inject a value into the properties

1337785
attributes	properties
since you re using a custom provider to activate websitesettings instances you don t need attributes on its properties

1337786
triggers	insert
i have the test.jsp file just the default jsp templates that gets created in eclipse ie insert title here at the webcontent level and the welcome page which triggers the action is index.jsp is also at that same level and gets display at program startup

1337786
websphere	ibm
after some trying i was able to get this up and running on eclipse ganymede on mac os x 10.5.6 using glassfish but i m still having no luck with ibm websphere and application-server toolkit an eclipse derivative on windows-xp

1337791
attributes	properties
by placing the inject attributes on my properties i was causing ninject to try to assign value that i never bound

1337801

1337858
ref	out
.when debugging and stepping to the line marked ref #1 the debugger jumps out of the methods and continue on to something else as if the methods was complete

1337871
subclassing	inherited
joined table inherited enables you to have foreign key to subclassinging enforced by the database it s a lot simpler to have non-null constraints for subclassing field

1337878
triggers	insert
i have a table let s call is mytable with an for insert updates triggers

1337878
triggers	insert
since triggers execute after the changes are made the stored procedure has no need to access the insert or deleted metatables

1337878
triggers	insert
that way i can have a single after insert updates triggers that only if the user initiates the insert updates adds an audit recording to the other table and call the sp

1337878
triggers	insert
the disadvantage of the first .solution is that i have to maintain a column list in the triggers .so the instead of updates actually does the work intended since i m adding a column to the list modifieddate i can t just insert-into tbl from insert i have to specify columns

1337882
subtract	add
the subi instruction sets c carry and h half-carry cpu flags for use with subsequent instructions there is no addi in 8bit avr btw .so to add an immediate value of x we subtract -x from it whereas inc does not

integration	payment
the systemd usually has well defined points where that needs to happen entering or integration payment creating modifying an order

1337971
normals	vbo
for opengl-es on the iphone apple recommends that you place all of the vertices that you can draw at one time in a vertex-buffering object vbo and that you interleave the vertex normals color and textures information within that buffering in that order

1337994
response	timeout
you never know .when the server is going to get around to process your request though it is usually within a couple hundred milliseconds or less .so you won t know if .something timeout failed or if you were going to receive a different response than expected unless you wait

1338000
show	next
you call this which tells your .app to show the windows but then it immediately execute the next line setting the passwd to nil since it hasn t been set yet

1338007
profiling	debugging
great if you want to analyse a program in some way ie for debugging or profiling purposes

1338019
arrays	loops
as you can see i also did a couple of other micro-optimization caching the .length properties in loops and use an arrays as a string buffering

1338021
value	field
if found move the barcode out of that field and move the value over to the barcode field

1338026
while-loop	for-loop
im not sure what you are trying to accomplish with the for while-loop but here is an example of a basic for-loop that creates a bunch of loader variables

1338044
getter	setter
you can call methodss on this within the constructor and properties setter getter are just syntactic-sugar for methods call

1338046
constructor	object

1338091
value	field
yes you can i assume you have a field with the date value you want to filtering on

1338105
python	ruby	python	java	interpreter	runtime
no it s apple s deliberate policy decision no doubt with .some technical underpinnings to not support interpreter runtime on iphone for most languages -- objective-c and javascript within safari is what apple wants you to use not python java ruby and .so forth

1338116
udp	tcp	ethernet	packets
for ethernet assuming the 5000 byte payload is not encapsulated in an ip + tcp udp frame you will have 18 bytes of overhead for every packets sent

1338116
ethernet	packets
for example an ethernet packets sent with an ipv4 frame which contains a udp datagram will have an additional 28 bytes consumed by headers and not data 20 bytes in an ipv4 header and 8 in a udp header assuming no ip options

1338116
ethernet	packets
considering the original ethernet example this means the amount of data per packets becomes 1454 bytes which luckily still comes to 4 packetss the extra spills over into the smaller 4th packets with 144 bytes of overhead

1338193
private-members	private
you mentioned private acces.sor .so i assumed that you are using reflection to expose .some private-members for unit-testing

1338193
web-config	app-config
places to look google for are the machine.config settings on the build-server cruisecontrol.net s own web-config not sure if it has one since i ve not used cc for a long time and lastly and least probably the app-config file of both the test runner and the application under test itself

1338235
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
this set contains rows where for any 2 given value a and b there is a row with a and b in columns x and y respectivly and there will be a second row with b and a in columns x and y respectivly

uppercase	ends-with
section 2 always start with s uppercase or lowercase and ends-with one or more decimal digits

1338358
arrays	loops
i m not sure this is exactly what you are asking b c it seems like the answer is just loops through the currentstate arrays and compare to the previousstate arrays for the same index value

1338387
registration	login
if you just hit the site and see the main page there s supposed to be a login registration area that display along with a teaser for the site

1338387

1338412
sqldatasource	gridview
i have an asp.net gridview that is originally bound to a sqldatasource control but .when the user presses an external button it instead gets the contents of a datatable rather than a sqldatasource control

1338412
postback	ajax
this worked beautifully until i added an ajax updatepanel .so the whole page wouldn t postback every time it paged and paging stopped working

1338413
subclassing	base-class
if all the other difference in modes for your maps are similar in nature you might not have to subclassing the map at all although subclassinging the different components have a spawn_strategy base-class and subclassing the three types of spawn from that or at least giving them a common interface will probably be necessary

1338427
contains	any
yes any abstract-class that contains no implementation and consists of abstract-methods only would be equivalent to interface

1338435
linked-list	arrays
the list interface could be implements as a linked-list or a wrapped up arrays or anything you want as long as it defined those methods in the interface

1338438
substitution	replace
as the liskov substitution principles states if s is a subtyping of t then object of types t in a program may be replace with object of types s without altering any of the desirable properties of that program

your example rendering the same for me in ie firefox opera google-chrome and safari

1338455
attributes	properties
i believe you are looking for the readonly attributes on the properties

1338483
append	input
one partials solution is to detection the key pressed and then append it to the input s value but this doesn t work in all cases such as if you have the text in the input highlight and then you press a key

1338497
value	field
you can work around this limitation by giving the browser a chance to updates the field s contents before grabbing its value - the simplest way is to use a small timeout before checked the value

1338508
updating	updates
if the another proc is updating the table again you could possibly move those updates

1338512
digits	base
if you take the -log10 of 0.000195787019 you get 3.70821611 which is about the numbers of leading base 10 digits all the examples have in common

1338512
any	set
for example if i knew that x and y were the result-of about 1000 summations and did not know any bounds on the numbers being summed i would set error_factor to about 100

1338515
hashtable	sorted
better average time-complexity than with a sorted list can be obtained using hashtable

1338524
stderr	stdout
add for each context .so stdout stderr will go to your own log

i have a binary-tree for a mathematical expression infix i want to convert directly this tree to a postfix stack

1339648
margins	padding
each browsers stylesheet isn t exactly the same .so for example while one browser sets padding on the body another will set margins on the body elements

1339648

if you rely on a css-reset you basically attempt to gain more control by explicit setting certain properties to a consistent value such as margins and padding on all elements to 0 which isn t preferred for form controls

1339655
base-class	inherited
although we have several classes that inherited from this base-class only one of them fails to serialization without the xmlinclude and that is a class that has no serialization properties or data and does not call any methods on the base-class

webserver	upload
let your customers do the upload to server1 the webserver and push the files from server1 to server2 the video server

1339764
ftp	ssh
if you really want to transfer the files directly to the video server you should look into using secure ftp or ssh ftp

1339804
stderr	stdout
as far as i know i cannot see the dump.. this happens by piping the stdout and stderr into the dumpfile

1339821
derived-class	base-class
presumably because something in the base-class or the derived-class is causing a list of items to be serialization that you didnt explicit mention in your interface this class itself doesnt expose anything that would direcly lead to the issue

1339826
streamreader	streamwriter
and if you are using streamreader streamwriter then you don t have any access to file positioning .so your only choice is to rewrite the whole file

1339913
contains	any
it s a string and the contains methods is linqs extension methods if that makes any difference but can t see why -

1339922
allocation	deep
for all classes that carry out memory allocation and where copying is required make sure that the copy-constructor and assignment-operator carry out deep copying rather than shallow copying

1339926
silverlight	wpf
or for more features there are a few articles around that recreate the deepzoom feature from silverlight in wpf - this one for a start

1339946
silverlight	wpf
many of the wpf apis are available for silverlight apps

1339946
silverlight	wpf
there are of course many other apis besides wpf that are available under silverlight since sl apps will need to do a lot more than just draw on the screens

1339947
deep-copy	object	copy-constructor	deep-copy
yes making assignment-operator and copy-constructor private will prevent you from creating any copy of object using standards methodss but if you really need a copy of an object you can implements for example copy methods which will perform deep-copy

1339969
contains	any
a leaf object can be considered a base component and contains no collections of any other object

1339972
click	mouse
of course this is only going to trap the mouse click if it hits the form surface

1339976
any	set
is there a simpler way to checked if any of the flags of a combined flag constants are set than the following

1339983
csv	xml
process that csv file and generator the xml

1339995
assignment-operator	ternary-operator
maybe it will help to specifically tell the assignment-operator that the return from the ternary-operator is guid

1340007
value	field
it looks like you will need to defined a custom widget that implements a rendering methods that takes the decimal field value and output it as you want

1340018
.when	ready
i think your problem is you re running the code within document .ready which is called .when the document is ready - ie

1340024
any	set
is there a simpler way to checked if any of the flags of a combined flag constants are set than the following

1340024
any	set
this checked that both a and b are set and ignore whether any other flags are set

1340024
any	set
this checked that either a or b is set and ignore whether any other flags are set or not

1340040
constructor	private	constructor	object
i suppose that i could also provide some markup in the attributes to say just create a raw object via formatterservices but this feels unnecessary compared with a private parameterless constructor and may not work on all platform silverlight cf etc - being likely problems

1340061
any	set
there are two aproaches that i can see that would work for checked for any bit being set

1340066
valgrind	gprof
gprof would be the obvious choice if you are using gcc and i suppose valgrind should work too

1340078
python	php
i am not aware of any such libs in php but you can have a look at the project size of something you would use in python

1340084
button	popup
i have created a macros for excel which will popup form that contains button and textfield

1340088
scala	java	visualvm	jvm
given that scala runs on the java virtual-machine jvm you can use the jvm tools jconsole and visualvm to .profile the application

1340090
export	report
the users will need to export this data from the plugins for analysis and report

1340090

can i have one xml schema xsd include another xml-schema

1340180
buffering	streaming
binary write the buffering of the bytearray to the response streaming

1340180
json	xml
the cool thing with taking the detour around a typed dto is that we can use regular xml or json serialization on it making the format versioning extremely simple

1340194
32-bit	64bit
try the 32-bit versioning of mysqlâ it should install directly over the 64bit versioning i think

visual-studio	sharpdevelop
sharpdevelop or visual-studio 2008 express for an ide

1340207

in neither case does your executable contains any part of the standard-library that you do not use

1340233
contains	any
as for how to compile them never put .h files on the compiler command-line since they should not contains any compile-able code only declarations

1340238
scp	ssh
i assume you mean you don t want to interactive login and create directory by hand rather than that you want to avoid using ssh altogether since you still need a passwd or public key with scp

1340251
constructor	object
however it would probably be better to pass logger into the constructor of every object which needs to use it

1340253
hide	show
now i need to show tooltip .when button is pressed and hide tooltip for example .when 3 seconds has passed

1340262

a sure shot workaround is to navigate to the jre installation directory c program files java navigate to the bin folder from command-prompt and then run java -version

1340305
duplicates	contains
in sql its possible to have field that cannot contains duplicates data

1340325
logout	login
my intention is to create a web login logout and run a function after successful completion of the event

1340348
value	field
.so in such cases we had to save these field value in our list to be able to search for crap i know

1340360
thickbox	jquery
if you are using jquery i would strongly suggest using thickbox we use it in every single project we do and it work very weel and it s easy to modify to have it do what you want

1340370
contains	any
there s various sorts of introspection you can perform on any object at runtime contains within the nsobject protocols

1340372
64bit	x86
also bear in mind that many programs exist in the c program files x86 folder on 64bit versioning of windows

1340373

1340395
click	mouse
click mouse on colorzilla

1340432
vbscript	basic

versioning	upgrade
but it only work with php 5.3 and i don t have the power to upgrade the php versioning 5.2

1340440
32-bit	64bit
the normals length numbers 32-bit and 64bit are added by the cpu as a single operation

1340441
order	add
you d have to test to see if this will work or not - be aware that it is possibly not enough to just add an index hint because the optimiser may find a way to honour the hint while not accessing the index in the right order

1340441
order	join
and if the query join to other tables the order might be lost anyway

1340452
cvs	git
if you re using cvs git or subversion for your source files then this plugins scripting will do what you want vim svndiff

there is no server present for messages router and .when checked through netstat cmd in cmd it does not show any details like what protocols and ports it is using to communication

1340491

1340564
zend-paginator	zend-db
i am rewriting it using zend-db as i wish to use the zend-paginator functionality

1340585

1340590
textbox	button
i also have a textbox and button to add a new comment

1340656
double	int
for c objective-c you have the basic datatypes you would expect int float double char

1340667
pixels	line
is there a way to determine the length of the text in pixels such that the line can appropriately be draw

1340669
dfa	nfa
the nfa dfa part comes into play in the implementation of the accept methods

1340685
hprof	jvm
i m not certain but i believe this is because hprof attaches to the jvm right from the start and keeps its own tracking of object allowing it to produce consistent ids across multiple dump

1340697
triggers	insert
assuming that your are using a relational-database you could simply code triggers on insert updates and delete events to write an action or .so within another table

1340724
directory	folder
go to the bin debugging directory folder and right click on the directory

1340739
json	xml
additionally javafx has native support for calling rest service and parsing xml or json

1340742
xsd	xml
what we needed to do was before populating the created dataset from the xml file to pass to the report we read the xsd into the dataset .so that it was then strong typed and contains all the data-typing information al.so

1340757
alignment	layout
there s something better than alignment layout

1340763

serialization	marshalling
you could serialization the content using for example to_yaml or use the older marshalling .#dump and #load

1340836
required	checked
checked the documentation and make sure you link to the required libs -lgdi32

1340846
subclassing	base-class
even though you can t create an instances of your base-class directly you can still unit test it by deriving a test-specific subclassing that can be tested

1340853
subclassing	base-class
i know i know it means that if you decide that one of your partially covered subclassing has to use another base-class or if that behavior you tested end up bubbling up to subclassing you will have uncovered code

1340853
subclassing	superclass
.when you do that kind of refactoring you don t lose any coverage on the account of having only one of your subclassing tested for its superclass behavior

1340853
subclassing	superclass
therefore i m of the opinion that it s generally ok to test just one of your subclassing inorder to test a superclass behavior

1340874
constructor	object
for example if weâ re creating a constructor function weâ ll need to declare the objectâ s methods and then assign them to the objectâ s properties .so they can be called outside the object

1340883
authentication	login
you would need to find write a role provider that supports hierarchies - i d recommend this route over something completely different as you will get some benefits from it such as the other aspects of the framework that work with these providers login controls configuration settings for authentication access etc

1340889
jquery	dojo
this are heavily used by ajax toolkits like jquery dojo etc to performs load-time magic and workaround many browser quirks and shortcomings

if you have freedom to switching from apache to lighttpd then the most straightforward solution would be to use mod_secdownload which would do exactly what you want that is provide application authentication while serving the actual files via webserver

1341034
python	php
however if you are stuck with apache then i suggest mod_auth_token here they mention php but you can generator the token in python or any other language

you can query the processor affinity with getprocessaffinitymask

1341425
processor	affinity
if you haven t set processor affinity i m unsure how useful the result will be though as the thread can flit between processor

1341426
implements	super
there s al.so a myriad of ways you could either call this via ajax or web-service from the parent blog or implements a memcachingd .solution .so that this data can be centrally stored and managed if this becomes an issue but i think if you use the object caching here with .something like wordpress super caching on the front end you should be fine

the example code would go better with the question .when to use properties and .when to use parameters on a constructor or methods to set object state

1341531
constructor	object
i know there is a section on this in the .net guidelines where it discusses the component base pattern lots of properties and the components internal state might be invalid inbetween the first and last assignment vs the other pattern lots of constructor parameters and methods parameters and the object internal state is valid after each line of code execute

what do i need to do if i want to examine the dump from a 64bit process on a 32-bit machine

1342105
toolchain	gnu
optimization takes two major forms peephole optimization can occur very late because it works on a few assembly instructions at a time i presume that in the gnu toolchain the assembler is responsible for this step but the big gains are in structural optimizations that are generally accomplished by re-writing the abstract syntax tree ast which is only possible during compilation

1342112
click	mouse
.when you click or move the mouse on the tag you have to remember that your is sitting inside an which is inside a in a in which is inside the document

it does need iis and it has been deprecated with the introduction of wcf but works well with plain .net 2.0 and should be deployable with mono xsp

1342142
json	xml	http-get	put
by rest styles that means using http-get put delete .post instead of sql dml and for returning results it uses json and atom-editor pub an xml format kind-of similar to rss instead of a binary result structure and protocols like microsoft sql servers tds the protocols used for sending tables back to clients

1342142

the reason for asking is that i need my foo class to access other object and it would make sense to initializer them in my constructor

1342218
foreground	z-order
from what i could discern it seems that using setwindowspos and setting a windows to hwnd_top will make it top of the z-order following the foreground windows

1342224
value	field
i m creating a function in c to convert an index value into a string which is a verbose description of the field represented by the index

1342231

1342249
spring	jsf
you can also use spring but i think that using jboss-seam makes the use of jsf much easier

1342268
hash	md5
the way i have always done it is to concat the user-agent and ip-address into an md5 hash in some cases this will allow people from the same ip to vote long as they are using different browsers and store that as a fingerprint for the vote the the database and add a unique-key to it

1342275
key-value	key
.when creating a new entity object that has a foreign key-value i need to create a new entity key entity-framework in .net 3.5 for the object but i m having trouble deciding where in my application i should do this

are there any problems with this or should i be passing the object plus the userid to the repository service-layer and have it deal with the entity key creation

1342283
atomicity	deadlock
where key in selected ... is usually deadlock because the operation is not atomicity

1342308
jquery	.post
what i really want to know is how am i going to load some data .when i .post or .get some data through jquery

1342312
arrays	loops
extends the javascript arrays object is a really bad idea because you introduce new properties your custom methods into for-in loops which can break existing scripting

1342339
repository	entity
you would pass the object plus userid to a builder which would then provide you with a fully built entity that could then be passed on to a repository

1342361
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately the default debian ubuntu installation initializer the system-wide package for cedet and ecb before my .emacs file is called and the 1.0pre6 files i then try to load throw errors trying to use symbols not defined in 1.0pre4

second delay1 || delay2 || delay3 will convert double to boolean value and then logical-or them together

1342506
webserver	upload
why is required .when upload a file to a webserver

should a value always be stored in a database using a specific unit meters or should the unit be settable using an additional field or table

1342546
hide	show
i want to change the toggle function .so that it changes the text of the link to say show hide or expand collapse

1342546
hide	show
it would do a replacement of the show string by hide and show the div

1342566
digital-signature	signing
secondly how would i add a digital-signature to the outgoing messages signing the body only

1342597
spawn	exit

1342618
execute	prepare
abstract out the database prepare execute etc

1342631
archive	backup
limit the size of your logs and try using a custom appender to archive logs to a backup machine with lots of disk spaces

1342632
shadowbox	jquery

1342658
google-chrome	firefox

1342756
malloc	free
.when you do malloc since malloc guarantees that it returns a continuos block of memory the crt will try to find 1 gb of continuos free memory which may not be avaiable hence the malloc fails

1342817
attributes	properties
the first is to create a methods to look it up dynamically but use the properties decorator .so that other code can still use straight attributes access

1342817
attributes	properties
you can get set the properties exactly as you would an attributes

1342840
32-bit	64bit
upgrade to a 64bit os you can still compile 32-bit code but you will have up to 4gb for user mode memory - remember to turn on the large memory aware compiler flag

1342840
32-bit	64bit
if you compile 64bit code it won t run at all on a 32-bit os but the memory limit is much higher than 4gb

1342856

as far as the code part i ve been a fan of using implode to join arrays of field value together

1342945
implements	extends
it woudln t have been my first choice to implements it this way but given what s there i want to extends it to cover .js too instead of including another different redirection rewrite methods iis redirection configuration a rewrite module etc. which may complicate deployment and testing of the .app especially on iis6

1343188
python	java
note that the arguments is a pointers which is most similar to references in java and python

1343191
python	ruby	python	lua
if you want to convince him that not everything microsoft is evil and he is adamant about not learning c# get him to learn python or ruby or lua or whatever until he is competent and then introduce him to c# and get him to make his own judgement - i m fairly in favour of open source and am far from a rabid microsoft supporter but i tried c# and found i quite liked it

1343215
allocation	deep
if you re concerned about overflowing that because you re allocation 1k of memory on each stack frame and going 1000 recursive call deep the fix is not to try to coax the compiler to save some spaces off of each stack frame

1343218
triggers	insert
if you have set a sequences for your table primary key you al.so have to write a triggers that will insert the sequences.nextvalue or .so into your primary key field

to combat the issue i edited the wsdl and replace references to any abstract types with references to the concrete types that extends them

1343260
dictionary	arrays
the global object in your plist is an arrays not a dictionary .so .when you load it into the dictionaryionary it doesn t know what to do incompatable types .so you re getting an empty dictionaryionary

1343260
dictionary	arrays
looping through the arrays of dictionary

1343270

also if your application gets a lot of use and needs a serious database you can always upgrade to the regular versioning of sql-server

1343297
javadoc	doxygen
i switched to using javadoc doxygen styles comments consistently

1343310
frame-rate	fps
i ve written this application wav data viewer many time and usually gdi+ is more than fast enough to rendering portions even large portions of wav data in realtime with a high frame-rate above 30 fps which produces perfectly smooth animation

1343310
pixels	line
what you want to do is for each pixels on your x axis scan the corresponding chunks of wav samples to get the minimimum and maximum sample value and then rendering a single line between these value

it s easier to just upgrade the hardware move to oracle sql-server or interbase use a dedicated database server use faster hard disks install more memory upgrade to a 64bit systemd

1343333
execute	declare
declare begins a pl sql block which won t be execute until a forwarding slash is entered on a newline

1343400
default-value	arguments
2 unspecified arguments receive the default-value as specified in the cmdspec binding

1343436
credentials	security
also you ll need to use a binding like wshttp or net.tcp that allows and supports windows credentials by default and you need to make sure to use and configure a binding security configuration that transports the windows credentials across from the client to the server

1343436
credentials	security
wshttpbinding and nettcpbinding both default to using windows client credentials .so out of the box unless you ve turned security off completely you should get windows credentials support in those two binding

1343462
redmine	trac
think sharepoint redmine trac basecamp etc

1343471
stderr	stdout
i have a bash scripting that simply call different call and redirect stdout and stderr output to different files

1343471
stderr	stdout
i thought i should see no output on screens because i m redirecting both stdout and stderr to files

checkbox	button
some browsers won t let you change much or in some cases anything about how things like checkbox or radio button are rendering and in any case are inconsistent across browsers

1343566
derived-class	base-class
the other thing i tried was something like this where i d have a base-class for everything and a derived-class that made the set useless

1343588
conditional	operators
once you ve identified what types of error you re looking for you can use something like hasattr or the in operators or many other things that will test for your conditional before you have to deal with exception-handling

1343593
duplicates	contains
it can t create a unique .when these columns already contains duplicates

1343596
protected	public
but that can be anything - a field a properties and of any visibility private protected public

1343597

1343638
.net	wcf
- in wcf 4 with .net 4.0 - sometime later this year 2009 you ll be able to defined default binding configuration without having to explicit named and reference them - but for now you need to create a link between your endpoint and its binding and any binding or behavior configuration you have

1343655
cakephp	symfony	zend-framework	symfony	zend-framework	cakephp
but if you want real-world object-oriented php code the zend-framework or symfony or maybe cakephp is probably the way to go

1343665

1343823
python	c++	python	java
i disagree with the key suggestion in the existing answers which basically boils down to treating exception-handling-handling in python as you would in say c++ or java -- that s not the preferred styles in python where often the good old idea that it s better to ask forgiveness than permission attempt an operation and deal with the exception-handling if any rather than obscuring your code s main flow and incurring overhead by thorough preliminary checked

1343961
required	checked
else if a is checked and b is checked then field 1 3 and 8 are required

1343961
value	field	required	checked
is it better to have if switching statements like the above in code or to create an exception-handling table where you would pass the conditional selected where a is checked and the return value indicate which field are required this is a simple example .

as a matter of course you should make sure to release any properties set to retain in your dealloc methods for all classes

1345265
entity-framework	ado.net
in such a case as soon as you have domain-object inherited and other things that need to be mapped to database tables you re best bet would be to checkout ado.net entity-framework instead

1345282
value	field
for instances if there was a date field in my form it would submit fine and rendering on the results page just fine but if i wanted that value to be include in an email it would show up as arrays within the text of the email instead of showing the date

1345324
minimum	max
you can use the max min functions as they will return an arrays contains the maximum minimum of each index

1345331
value	field
i simply created a variables on the count field and if the new one was greater than the old one changed it to the new value see the if-statement in the following code

callback	methods
you should place your code in load methods callback .so it s execute after ajax request completes his work

1345501
linux	bsd	decompression	tar
once you have pulled the file the tar operation will work as expected most modern versioning of linux bsd have a smart tar which doesn t need the z cmd to specify that the tar file is compressed - they ll figure out that the tarball is compressed on their own and uncompress it automatically providing the appropriate compression decompression tool is on the systemd bzip2 for .jz files gzip for .gz files

pass-through authentication will be used anyway for auditability .so the overhead of managing multiple login account is not an issue

1345685
xsd	xml
however the code below is really very handy for validation an xml file which references it s xsd like this

1345685
xsd	xml
even if i stored the xsd locally it still wouldn t be quite right as the xml file could be written with a schema location like

1345685
xsd	xml
for the purposes of this question i have pinched the code below from validation an xml against referenced xsd in c#

1345691
http	ssl
both the credentials and the data in this session is transmitted via http ssl

1345695
variables	boolean
typically boolean value that are used in branches immediately after they re calculated like this are never actually stored in variables

1345744
xsd	xml
i have this code to validation an xml file against an xsd file

1345753
getter	setter
why not then make the variables public itself other than cases like spring which depends on getter setter for inversion-of-control etc

1345760
getter	setter
getter and setter are used to provide a defined interface to a classes

1345763
getter	setter
these are really just getter setter under the hood but with a more concise syntax

1345766
getter	setter
even back in 2003 it was known that getter and setter methods are evil

1345771
getter	setter
this is done .so you can change the getter or setter implementation in your public api after you release it

1345771
value	field
using public field you wouldn t be able to checked value for validity

1345772
tiff	bmp
this really depends on the extension - a bmp is totally different to a tiff or whatsoever.

1345789
getter	setter
it s part of encapsulation abstracting a class s interface the getter and setter from its implementation using an instances variables

1345793
loading	png
i ve read here that loading a bitmap loses the alpha value but it post to a solution which is for another file types and i don t understand enough of the example to get it working with the png

1345805
gridview	listview	contains	elements
i have a gridview in a listview contains in a scrollviewer elements

1345810
scala	java
i am not sure you can easily use scala in your java programs as in call a scala class from a java class

1345810
scala	java
you can try following the article mixing java and scala

1345810
scala	java
the problem is that the java and scala compilation step are separate you can t compile both java and scala files in one go

1345810
scala	java
if none of your java files reference any scala classes you can first compile all your java classes then compile your scala classes

1345810
scala	java
or if none of your scala files reference any java classes you can do it the other way around

1345810
scala	java
but if you want your java classes to have access to your scala classes and also have scala classes have access to your java classes that s a problem

1345810
scala	java
scala code can easily call directly into java code but sometimes calling scala code from java code is trickier since the translation from scala into bytecode is not quite as straightforward as for java

1345810
scala	java
sometimes the scala compiler adds characters to symbols or makes other changes that must be explicit handled .when calling from java

1345810
scala	java
but a scala class can implements a java interface and an instances of that class can be passed to a java methods expecting an instances of the interface

1345810
scala	java
the opposite is possible of course as describe in roundup scala for java refugees from daniel spiewak

1345841
updating	updates
updates #1 the issue seems to be related to the collectionviewsource and the filtering not updating the menuitem.tag binding after filteringing has occurred and removed the item

1345842
push	pull
an alternative is to switching to using the stax parsing see pull vs push

1345853
export	report
.when i export the report to pdf and the contents of the list are less that one full page - my letterhead is display on the first page the rest of the page is-empty and the list content gets move to the second page

1345859
removeclass	addclass
also the addclass removeclass stuff in the tabs.js file doesn t scale too well

1345861
getter	setter
the most and foremost use for getter and setter in java is to annoy the developers

1345861
modifiers	final
in delphi for example you have read and write modifiers for field just like private static or final in java

1345861
getter	setter
the defined if you ll have a getter or setter generator for you

1345861
getter	setter
.so the only .solution was to force people to write all the getter and setter manually

1345865
getter	setter
getter and setter may very well be the greatest lie ever told

1345865
getter	setter
new programmers should be taught proper encapsulation not to write dumb data carrier classes that contains nothing but getter and setter

1345865
getter	setter
the idea that you need getter and setter to future-proof your code if you want to change the implementation later on is an obvious case of yagni

1345871
locale	french
make a locale folder entitled en.lproj for english de.lproj for german fr.lproj for french etc

1345873
configuration	logging
php ssh2 is a probably a wrapper around the libssh2 .so if you are looking for logs then checked your syslog configuration file if ssh logging is not enabled in there then ssh logs the activity in apache log files

1345876
getter	setter
.when the developer believes that encapsulating stuff really just means getter setter rather than encapsulating behavior

1345876
getter	setter
the valid reasons for having getter setter are

1345879
getter	setter
hence to access a field through an interface you need to have the getter and setter

1345900
buffering	streaming
if you don t set content-length httpwebrequest will buffering the headers until the streaming is closed .so that it can set content-length appropriately alternately you can use sendchunked but that won t work for you here

1345932
dom4j	jdom
i find dom4j to come out on top of anything else i ve used especially jdom which i find to have a particularly poor api

1345967
contains	lookup
if however your prioritization is based on some specific order lookup table etc you will need a different solution where you have a separate table contains the priorities and joined into the main query as astander answered

1345974
getter	setter
in the case in question there is no need for getter and setter if the value is simply read or written

1345981
children	nodes
i am using dynamical loading in treeview however i want it to load children nodess .when click the plus icons instead of click labels i tried to overrides lableclick event and preventdefault event but it didn t work yui still load the children nodes .when i click labels

1345985
libjpeg	libpng
luckily for most formats you can find libs that do it for you like libpng or libjpeg

1346003
any	set
you ll most likely never need to set any .socketflags .so don t worry about these

1346045
sql-server	mysql
i ve created a simple sql frontend and out of habit from sql-server mgmt studio i keep pressing f5 .when i m done typing my query but that always refreshes the browser instead of execution mysql query -

1346045
textbox	button
txtquery is the asp.net textbox where i types my query and btnexecute is the asp.net button which will send that query to sql-server to be execute

1346060

1346081
audio-player	jplayer
jplayer is a jquery-based inline audio-player

1346161
postback	ajax
if you want to do a server-side call from the client you ll either need to use some javascript to initiate a postback or perform an ajax call to your application

1346161
keydown	keyup
to capture function key reliably across all modern browsers you ll have to look at using keydown and keyup events

1346170
value	field
have you verified that the field in the structure that are located before usbdevicedescr status bexcludedevice bsharedmanually uldeviceid and ulclientaddr get their correct value

1346176
sql-server-express	sql-server
you might like to consider sql-server instead - sql-server-express is free

1346188
push	pull
there are two kinds of streaming api - push and pull

1346188
jdom	xom
there are several more convenient dom-like apis such as xom my favourite for the same reasons that adam batkin gives above or jdom

1346188
annotations	mapping
mapping apis jaxb is a jsr standards but i prefer xstream because i can more easily separate the mapping configuration from the mapped classes no need for annotations or xml-configuration and it maps object to from other data formats

1346196
version-control	git
but i really detailed the major pain points in installing git in enterprise in distribute version-control systemd and the enterprise - a good mix

1346196
push	pull
plus you will need your own ssh and httpd for your user to push pull to from that server

1346196
push	pull
git itself didn t include smart http which meant the only protocols with authentication for pull clone and push operations was ssh convincing users to generator and manage public private key is.

1346196
gitolite	gitosis
authentication layer was clunky gitosis and gitolite was barely starting

1346197
button	popup
does anyone know what the minimum we have to do is to get the user to be able to press a button in our .app and have the report popup in an html control delphi .app with no further input from the user

1346198
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
after uninstaller resharper 4.5 from vs2008 the normals code editor context-menu mouse right click doesn t work the way to let it work just one time is to let it appear by click the keyboard key near the altgr key and the click again the mouse right button

1346199
nhibernate	ado.net
unless you have a specific reason to do raw ado.net i would have a look at using an orm object relational mapper like nhibernate or linq-to-sql

1346262
basichttpbinding	was
in the end basichttpbinding was perfectly fine i didn t need to resort to a custom-binding

1346264
click	mouse
what i need is to add event listener for mouse movement over the web browser as well as mouse click

1346267
private-members	private	private-members	object
you are accessing overrides s own methods even if the object is derived because as per scoping rules the private-members of class are considered first and as its written in scoping of overrides it is referencing the private f and since its private its not overridess in derived-class at all they will only overrides if methods-signature is same

1346283
order	add
if i add an identity-column to my output with a named following that form i can order by it in my external selected but it won t partake in the xml output if i use for xml explicit

1346292
derived-class	base-class
is it possible to get the base-class to recognise the parameter types but defined the value differently in each derived-class perhaps not using enums but keeping it strongly typesd not using an int

1346296
keydown	keyup
unfortunately depending on how the browser interpreter the function key it may required preventing keydown and keyup events being raised for that particular key in addition to the behavior here

1346304
reflection	runtime
this effectively means that your only option is to log this information at runtime which means either tediously adding manual tracing to each methods you want to log or taking the hit of using reflection as you describe

1346324
contains	elements
also if the combobox contains other elements you can get those elements through the use of something like

1346345
value	field
i am trying to find a mysql query that will find distinct-values in a particular field count the numbers of occurrences of that value and then order the results by the count

1346368
communication	messages

1346517
for-loop	loops	put	get
.so what i ve just decided to do is put it in a for-loop and once there are the right amount of files that have been downloading onto my hard-drive then i ll get myself out of loops

click	mouse
.when user click the mouse and keep pressed the application locks

1346544
thickbox	jquery
i m new to jquery thickbox

1346551
eventmachine	drb
apart from drb you should also look at eventmachine for the asynch capabilities you may need .when reading chapters and rabbitmq for the more general and looser coupling that a messaging systemd offers

1346568
implements	extends
for example there is a possibility that author of the parent class that i m extends will decide to implements some side-effect in the methods that i m overrides and without that side-effect the state of the object will be incorrect

1346626
http-get	get
and i want to get the wsdl file which should be possible with a http-get request like this

1346651
abstract-class	derived-class	implements	abstract
in an abstract-class if a methods is marked as abstract then it must be implements in the derived-class

1346651
abstract-class	derived-class
you should use an abstract-class .when the set of derived-class have some shared behavior

1346671
exception-handling	try-catch
maybe worth putting a try-catch around your web service call and see what exception-handling is throw to help further debugging this issue as web-services that work ok in browser should work out-of-browser as far as i m aware

1346697
virtual-functions	base-class
this way base-class designer may also attain alexandrescu s recommendation of not making virtual-functions public

1346702
websphere	ibm
typically these would be provided by an application-server vendor ibm websphere or jboss

1346705
constructor	object
iirc the color class in java is immutable - .so there is simply no points in providing a constructor that would create a copy of an existing color object

1346712
arrays	loops
therefore logically .when you exit loops selectedformid will be the last item in the arrays

1346733

1346744
arguments	default	required	checked
this happens by default if the arguments isn t specified as cmake doesn t checked the numbers of parameters required for a macros

1346748
winlogon	gina
but you need to implements your own gina dll which is loaded by winlogon

1346755
hashmap	arrays
either hold a static object arrayslist hashmap and the like with all the data items for each types of data an arrays for employees another for departments and .so on or use the server caching and store those data containers within it using your own defined key

account	api
i am using javax.mail api to access a gmail account not fixed

1346838
emacs	vim
the efficiency provided from vim emacs is mostly afforded by their heavy keyboard use

1346838
keyboard	mouse
in these programs you can do most anything directly from the keyboard rather than having to stop and use the mouse

1346855
attributes	properties
it s a hassle having to inherited of every types of control i want to specify custom properties for not to mention overrides shadow the properties and setting the default-value attributes

1346856
emacs	vim	text-editor	editor
i d say the actual vim emacs editor are far superior to the eclipse text-editor in terms of the shortcuts they offer

1346865
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms support themes and profiling

1346897
javascript	dom
the problem comes next .when i realized that although i have removed the elements from the dom the javascript that was previously evaluated is still available for execution

1346909
put	get
for example if your rest api has a resource named mailboxes which supports get .post put and delete and accepts and returns representations of types application json you could model the resource and its methods by creating the following soap methods

1346911
attributes	properties
you could recursivly visit all controls in a form .when it is created look at the properties compare to the default-value using reflection to get the default-value attributes and if they don t match that is the value has been overrides in the designer load your default-value from some file or in-memory store and apply it

1346917
emacs	vim
vim emacs

1346919
authentication	impersonation
how may i authentication the account impersonated given the fact that the server only got the impersonation token inorder to gain access to the executable

1346922
put	get
or put differently can i get my example below to rendering the same in all viewers without abandoning absolute units at all

1346945
attributes	properties
specific contract declarations allow you to control how classes are serialization on the wire allowing you to hide attributes reorder the properties in the messages make some properties optional some mandatory and control the namespace of the datacontract

1346979
configuration	installation
i need .something simple that i can deploy .so that if i can minimize unnecessary configuration and installation maybe peoople that will be using the excel won t have admin rights on the pc .so they can t install .software

1346989
double	int
how do i checked if a result is of the right types int float double etc. and then throw and catch an exception-handling in case it s not

1347019
contains	any
.when any of them contains swedish characters ã ã or ã and probably others as well i get a soapfault looks like we got no xml document

1347022
click	mouse
since it appears silverlight does not support the middle mouse button click event is there a way to capture this event in javascript .when the user middle button click on the silverlight control

1347024
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works in firefox ie 8 and google-chrome

1347040
contains	any
in any case you need to either count invocations use multiple try blocks or do that and defined your own exception-handling which contains the missing information and the old exception-handling because it s a subclassing and then rethrow it

1347082
directory	folder
2 to get a list of all the systemd directory issue the cmd reg query hkey_local_machine software windows currentversion explorer shell folder and read the line

1347084
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this is suitable for asp.net-mvc and webforms also

1347124
droppable	draggable
for example i have two list of members in two divs i want them to be draggable n droppable in across the divs

1347189
object-reference	instances
i am getting error object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

1347206
droppable	draggable
have you tried to set both divs draggable and droppable

1347212
attributes	properties
however there is a possibility to serialization properties with an internal set you need to generator the xmlserializationr assembly and declare it as a friend assembly using the internalsvisibleto attributes

1347218
droppable	draggable
you can make the containers divs droppable and the list elements divs draggable

1347219
silverlight	wpf
i am aware of fluent silverlight but i can t seem to find anything equivalent for wpf

1347226
sql-server	mysql
i have a domain model in my head and i am having problems building a subsonic compatible db schema it would realy help me get started if you could tell me how you would go at it for this example with 3 entities could be sql-server or mysql doesn t matter to me

1347259
contains	any
.net generator .dll files do not contains any machine-code they contains il intermediate-language that is compiled at runtime called just-in-time compilation or jit

1347274
indexof	equals
i guess this is done to avoid problems .when you overrides equals in object you re feeding into indexof

1347341
constructor	object
constructor create object they don t return data

1347350
constructor	private
to do this you make the constructor of cubegui private and then add a methods to cubegui like this

1347350
constructor	object
.so if at all possible pass the object in as a parameter either to the constructor or to the methods

1347356
constructor	object
for instances if you have class sampleclass constructor can return only object of class sampleclass

1347358
constructor	object
a constructor can only return an instances of object that it construct - otherwise you have no reference against which to hang on to the object you just created

1347371
constructor	private
the private constructor makes it .so that arionfileextractor can only be used statically and cannot be initializer

1347400
arguments	default
as much as this is surprising the code you made has a default no arguments constructor

1347401
any	set
in any case as micheal says you should not be relying on the compiler to prevent stack overflows because you might just be pushing the problem to later .when normals code maintenance or a different set of input is used and it will crash much further in the pipeline maybe in the hands of the user

1347407
margins	padding
i find adding padding to the box then adding margins to the containers i get what i desire

1347421
jquery-sortable	sortable
i m not sure if this is what you mean but if you are using the jquery-sortable to make each div content sortable you can use the properties connectwith to specify the other sortable list you want to be able to drag items to

1347424
output	mode
edit i think i found the problem here s an excerpt of the linker s output in verbose mode adding -wl --verbose to the compile cmd

1347429
static-classes	inherited
but of course you can t inherited static-classes or even make abstract

1347457
python	perl
please suggests me any way such as python perl or any unix tool which can decrease the numbers of step

1347470
contains	elements
you re placing the header ab.solutely .so it s being offset from the contains block body not the parent elements

1347497
contains	any
code pages could be determined by a statistical analysis of the text frequency of character pairs and triplets contains non-ascii characters or words lists in different languages but i haven t found any suitable approach trying that

1347508
sql-server	mysql
i ve tried to use the db sql-server and mysql to store medium 5mb files and what i got was tons of trouble

1347554
authentication	login
because the controllers is marked with the authentication attributes a call to the action methods after the expiration timeout redirects the user to the login page

1347569
contains	any
this didn t really cause any problems though it just meant that intellisense would provide a list contains both static and instances methods after you hit the . after the variables named

1347571
fopen	fread
has someone maybe a good source where all available file operations like fopen fread mkdir etc are describe

1347578
python	ruby	haskell	python
here is a special haskell program which output a python program that output a ruby program that output the original haskell program from

1347579
highlight	selected	selection	highlight
how can i make it .so that .when you move throughout the options of a selection everything you ve gone through stays highlight .so you know which options you ve selected to get where you are

1347583
value	field
i need to conditional format the cell of a datagrid but the conditional part needs to be based upon the value of several different field properties in the datasource

1347591
attributes	properties
the pep 224 on attributes docstrings was rejected long time ago .so this is a problem for me as well .sometimes i don t know to choose a class attributes or an instances properties -- the second can have a docstring

1347596
response	timeout
it also has a simple solution - in the part of the javascript which is handling the ajax response checked for a timeout before using the response

1347604
perl	awk	python	perl
in python or perl awk c you can reasonably do it in a single stand-alone pass -- i m not sure what you mean by too many curly-brackets but you can surely count curly use per file

1347615
fopen	fread
man fopen man fread man mkdir etc. will describe the usage of those functions

1347617
highlight	selected
i want to highlight the one that is selected

1347625
perforce	cvs
i use perforce at work having previously used cvs at my last job

1347625
perforce	cvs
it s probably easier to learn from scratch than cvs but i don t have experience that way. if someone needed a centralized source-control systemd i would recommend perforce as long as they had the resources to license it

1347625
bazaar	git
on the other hand i ve recently been looking at some distribute source-control systemd git mercurial and bazaar specifically

1347646
postgresql	mysql
i get the following error .when insert data from mysql into postgresql

1347652
playlist	playing
later we are creating publishing pointss on a windows media server to play a smil playlist we then have to announce the files and formats to the publishing points .when the publishing points starts playing it expects a jpg file because that is the extension of the file and the content is actually a png

1347658
radio	click
because you activate the function only on the click radio

1347658
radio	click
in this way you remove the chosen class from all radio and then you assign the class only on the click one

1347661
entity-framework	ado.net
i have an ado.net data service that exposes an entity-framework datamodel .edmx

1347666
getter	setter
you wont see the synthesize call being invoked synthesize just generator getter and setter for your properties how are you declaring the properties

1347674
revision	svn
i use the msbuild community tasks project which has a tool to retrieve the svn revision numbers and add it to your assemblyinfo.vb

1347675
display	height	display	width
or in the likely event that this is not possible is it possible to at least say display this image at 50 of its normals width and height

1347683
fopen	fread	chown	mkdir
the functions you re asking about actually fall under several category - file streaming i o fopen fread etc. low-level file-descriptor i o open read etc. and filesystems directory manipulation chown mkdir etc.

1347694
revision	svn
with svn it is possible to see who last changed a line and in which revision svn blame

1347694
bug-tracking	trac
trac for bug-tracking

1347694
plugins	add-on
tons of plugins add-on for this at

1347702
show	next
but there is no option to tell class just show next and previous link

1347702
show	next
please see this image i want to show result paged plus i d like to use to link for next and previous instead of numeric links and .when the user click on the next button i ll use ajax to retrieve request i don t have problem with ajax call in paginator in numeric links but i want to just show this to link

1347711
64bit	x86
i m assuming you mean x86 and x86_64 here .when you talk about 64bit

1347714
parentheses	macros
your macros should probably have parentheses around it for safety

1347717
any	set
1 .when the libs code execute environment.getcommandlineargs it does not see any of the default-arguments i have set

1347722
oracle	mysql
i know oracle can do this -- mysql might be able to with some expert configuration

1347728
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m in the process of adding some user-interface functionality to a hybrid webforms asp.net-mvc site

1347728
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in this case i m adding some ajax user-interface features to a webforms page via jquery and the data is coming from an asp.net-mvc jsonresult

1347728
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have used it in combinations with the validateantiforgerytoken attributes on my pure asp.net-mvc applications but would like to know how to implements the html.antiforgerytoken methods in webforms

1347728
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m looking to retrieve the antiforgerytoken from my webforms page not from the asp.net-mvc jsonresult

1347731
stax	sax
i think you should use stax instead which is faster and easier to use than sax

1347734
contains	any
there don t seem to be any other remotely viable functions to call on the menu item its parent toolstrip or the parent form that contains the menu systemd

1347738
associations	model
thumbnails must be defined in the user model as an associations like revgum has show in his answer

1347745
contains	set
even standards asp.net web form controls contains a cssclass properties that can be set and used for formatting the web form controls

1347748
radio-button	selected
first of all you do not need to have radio-button as a class because you can selected them via attributes like this.

1347753
value	field
you need to specify which value goes to which field

1347756
compact-framework	.net
under the .net 2.0 .profile i was able to identify driveinfo class but in the previous versioning 1.0 1.1 and compact-framework which i would like to support there s nothing like this

1347758
identity-column	sql-server
it cannot insert a value into an identity-column - that column will be set automatically by sql-server upon insert a new row and is guaranteed to be unique

1347780
constructor	private
and of course you can use private constructor to prevent subclassing

1347795
mta	sta
in .net 2.0 and later the default thread apartment types switched from sta to mta

1347796
contains	elements
it s contains elements will work fine but i get ugly corners sticking out

1347801
constructor	private	subclassing	base-class
if one can prevent subclassing by declaring private constructor in the base-class why do we need sealed keyword

1347809
compatibility	platform
browser compatibility - not all browsers platform have flash support iphone but you can usually expect flash functionality to operate the same across browsers platform unlike javascript

1347820
annotations	mapping
.when tried to access the given url spring is throw a warning org.springframework.web.servlet.pagenotfound - no mapping found for http-request with uri learn annotations first.ftl in dispatcherservlet with named springapp

1347832
value	field
then assuming the rating field is set up somehow to be some value that represents the average rating post.comments.first would give you the highest rated comment not the first to be added

1347846
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
i want the user to selected the checkbox click the register button outside the gridview and have a title from the selecteded row display

1347846
selected	checkbox
i have done .so but apparently the only time it enters that event is at page load and right before the page loads all the selected checkbox are wiped

1347848
exception-handling	try-catch
i d like to know if there is any runtime slow-down from simply having a try-catch block in-place which never catches an exception-handling unless the program will have to end anyway

1347850
webrequest	webclient
use the webclient class or the underlying webrequest based classes if you need to programmically make request

1347863
png	gif
if your image is some sort of png gif on a solid background you may be able to do something like this

1347876
macros	vba
and additionally i insert a vba function to force users to open the excel file in macros

1347879
xsd	xml
one last clarification before i selected an answer and thanks for your effort if i only need 5 predictable field out of the static-length xml file does something like this leave loopholes that creating an xsd overcomes

1347902
xsd	xml
to validation xml you validation it against a schema usually kept in an xsd file

1347904
println	output
the theory is that during the first attempt to output the string using println it s sending an escape character of some sort eating the rest of the string

1347925
exception-handling	try-catch
do try-catch blocks hurt performance .when exception-handling are not throw

1347933
precompiled-headers	header-files
updates forgot to mention you may need to do a rebuild of the project after you change the include-path if the precompiled-headers were already generator with the missing header-files

1347946
order	join
create another table with your sort order join on column a to the new table which would be something like term as string sortorder as int

1347952
order	add
if you have alot of elements with custom order you could add those elements to a table and give them a value

1347952
order	join
join with the table and each column can have a custom order value

1347965
decrement	increment
if you cannot determine the maximum possible height of the algorithm or if you need to calculate the actual height of the tree at runtime you can use a variables global to the recursive function increment it upon the entry to the function and decrement it upon the function exit

1347996
primitive	int
under java 5 an int or any primitive types will be autoboxing into an int or other corresponding types .when you add it to a collections

1348009
arrays	loops
also but depending on the amount of data you re expecting you could just fetchall and loops over a php arrays

1348018
linkedhashmap	treemap
this makes it much easier to change implementation to a treemap or a linkedhashmap in the future

1348018
type-safety	generics
you can use generics to ensure a certain level of type-safety

1348018
primitive	int
by the way .when you add an int or other primitive java is autoboxing it

1348023
keyboard	mouse
this class is used to generator native systemd input events for the purposes of test automation self-running demos and other applications where control of the mouse and keyboard is needed.

1348032
pointers	stack
one pointers s worth of memory is used on stack

1348032
32-bit	64bit
that should be 32-bit 4 bytes unless your machine s in 64bit mode

1348032
pointers	stack
the pointers itself is in stack though of course what it points to will be on the heap

1348039
32-bit	64bit
technically references are usually as big as the machine s words size 32-bit on a 32-bit machine and 64bit on a 64bit machine though some 64bit jvms use special magic to allow 32-bit references

1348067
checkbox	textbox
q1 .when someone checked a checkbox i want the textbox within the same div.selectitem to have a 1 put into it

1348067
checkbox	textbox
q2 i also want the checkbox to be checked if a value is entered into the textbox and unchecked if the textbox is blank

1348077
addition	division	addition	modulo	division	modulo
performing addition on this slightly larger types will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the types itself

1348077
32-bit	64bit	addition	division	addition	modulo	division	modulo
for example on most 32-bit systemd 64bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

1348099
constructor	private
the goal should be that you get your data in your constructor at least the starting points and remove the parameters that used to receive the data manually and replace them with references to that now private data

1348101
arrays	map
the prior poster is incorrect about the arrays in a map

1348108
groovy	java
if you already know java i highly recommend programming groovy

1348109
children	tree
another possible approach is to add inflation level parameter to your soap api call something along the line of self direct properties only children direct children full full object tree which would cause only appropriate properties to be initializer

1348114
boost	stl
however stl containers are preferred for another very practical reason many third-party libs boost arabica crypto++ utf-cpp... are designed to work with stl but know nothing about mfc containers

1348123
contains	any
if your passwd contains any of those characters use single-quotes instead

1348127
value	field
can get all triples with value null in specific field

1348173
membership	guid
i ve considered just leaving the post.userid field as a guid and then requiring that any code that needs to know the username use that guid to get the user from the membership but that seems ineligant

1348183
domain-object	repository
the second is that the repository acquires finding responsibilities that might not belong to the domain-object repository proper finding projection that are less about the requested domain-object than the related data

1348183
repository	entity
1 use the entity s repository to find the specified entities and project map to a flattened view

1348183
domain-object	repository
in a pure implementation the client can t provide context for how the domain-object will be used .so you can t tell the repository hey i m just going to change the customer.name properties .so don t bother getting those eager-loaded references. on the flip side the question is whether a client should know about that stuff

1348188
ironpython	ironruby
thanks to suggestions from a previous question i m busy trying out ironpython ironruby and boo to create a dsl for my c# .app

1348217
windows-server	windows
on windows-server 2008 64bit i need an .msi install file to write some files to windows system32 inetsrv folder

1348219
perl	php
to use it in your site you would need some kind of dynamic page generator such as asp asp.net php or perl

1348228
subclassing	accessor
the class has a couple of internal maps of string- object which it shared via accessor methods with subclassing

1348230
put	get
this interface is a contract saying that the object maps key to value and supports various operations put get

1348248
positioning	slider
use a slider to manipulate the positioning of content on the page

1348263
xsd	xml
xsd xml schema is mostly useful for validation and describing xml formats

1348266
actionscript	mxml
i m using ant and mxmlc to compile actionscript classes and mxml into swfs while maintaining the default organization of a flex builder flash-builder project

1348277
constructor	object
yes.only string class constructor can return string object out of it

1348277
constructor	object
this basically means that the constructor creates the object of the class you are calling

1348291
environment	execution
this msdn magazine article is probably the best one that i ve seen describing the technical requirements the constrained execution environment was built for

1348295
constructor	object
i can t pass it as part of the constructor because the object constructing it does not know the parameters of the constructor

1348306
contains	any
how do i use adplus or any other tool to generator the memory-dump and how do i make sure the memory-dump contains the information i need to debugging this

1348315
contains	any
.so what i would like is a pickling function that automatically replace modules and any other hard-to-pickle object with facades that contains their attributes

1348326
linked-list	queue
a linked-list makes a good stack or queue an arraylist makes a good stack but a horrific queue again a remove would cause a shift of the entire list .so linked-list implements the queue interface arraylist does not

1348327
firefox	opera
if you need to access the line numbers of something in javascript as long as you are using firefox or opera just access new error .linenumbers

1348341
defined	declare
declare dependencies on interfaces defined in contracts assembly for instances imenuregistry

1348363
any	set
but in xml there could be any arbitrary set of attributes

1348371
subclassing	superclass
if a superclass and a subclassing both have an entry in their tables for the same method-signature the subclassing s versioning is encountered first and the superclass s versioning is never used mdash

1348382
hide	show
is there a better way to encapsulate the notion that these elements are paired and should show hide opposite each other

1348411
ubuntu	linux	netbsd	linux	opensuse	ubuntu	opensuse	netbsd
i ve had good luck with monit on linux ubuntu opensuse and fedora building - all 2.6 kernel mac os x 10.5 never tried older and netbsd

1348414
put	get
if i put a breakpoints on the contains data flow task in the control flow diagram it stops but .when i try to step into it i get the error messages unable to step

1348434
.net	wcf
if you have .net 3.5 or newer you can also set up a wcf service

1348435
droppable	draggable
however i just created some droppable elements outside of the scrollable div and my draggable elements can t leave the scrollable div

1348445
expression-blend	designer
the arguments for are primarily about making uis blendable being able to design them in expression-blend by a designer in addition to the testability of your code

1348458
udp	tcp
2 use udp instead of tcp

1348458
udp	tcp
whether you use tcp or udp if you are concerned about every block of data arriving at its destination you should building some application level checked that all blocks arrived inorder and uncorrupted.

1348463
profiling	trace
the problem is that a sql profiling trace reveals that tempresettimeout is called in our session state db for every image served via this mechanism

1348478
constructor	object
i would try either creating an interface for the two controls to implements or just changing the types on the constructor to just object or user-controls .so that it s not a registered types

1348479
binary	hex
i need a fast decompression routine optimized for restrict resource environment like embedded systemd on binary hex data that has following characteristics

1348528
maya	mel
the mel procedure that the maya user-interface uses to create and set the notes attributes is called

1348546
google-chrome	safari
however safari and google-chrome need some extra work

1348558
uninstaller	inno-setup
the inno-setup uninstallerer only knows to uninstaller files by named that it originally put there at install time

1348568
push	pull
i ve been performing all of my transactional clone push pull etc through ssh but recently ran git-update-server-info because i wanted to experiment with running git-clone over http

1348594
any	set
i m attempting to set up a cartesian coordinate system.in c# but i don t want to restrict myself to any one numerical types for my coordinate value

1348606
double	int
arithmetic types like int double decimal should implements iarithmetic

1348635
content-length	http-headers
are there any useful metadata in the http-headers content-length cache-control directives etags etc

1348639
stderr	stdout
it s run by crontab .so inorder to not leave a zombie around i shut down stdin stdout and stderr

1348646
scala	java
he found that it is on average 30 faster to comprehend algorithms that use for-comprehension and maps as in scala rather than those with the imperative while-loops of java

1348658
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
you can set up a proxy repository for proxy central .so any request that would normally go to central are instead sent to your proxy repository or a repository grouping contains the proxy and subsequent request are caching in the internal repository manager

1348668
python	java
since multiple versioninging of the same .app shared the same datastore - even across runtime - the data upload with the python versioning will be accessible to the java one

1348684
if-statement	arrays
without a border you d have to have if-statement along the edges squares that says well if you re in the top row don t search up and walk off the arrays

1348687
export	report
i am trying to figure out how to export a crystal report into a pdf file from an asp.net application

1348692
absolute-value	sqrt
specifically the c++ standard-library defined norm for complex-numberss to be the square of the modulo or absolute-value where the modulo is sqrt a 2 + b 2 .when the complex numbers is in the form a + i b

1348753
value	field
the field answer is expecting at most one value

1348762

1348767
scp	ssh
it gave us scp ssh and sshd support with a 300k executable

1348780
repository	entity
a particular repository implementation for a someclass entity might thus look like the following

1348787
assign	add
it s more of a guess but you could try to add the following line after assign the text to bodyl

1348797
toast	alert
another example of messenger toast is the messages display .when a user receives an alert from the .net alert service

1348823
hash	md5
my suggestion is that you are not computing md5 hash since md5 produces a fixed length output of 32 hex numbers

1348844
jqmodal	jquery
i m hoping someone can points a relative jquery jqmodal newbie in the right directions for debugging this error

1348844
modal-dialog	jqmodal
i m loading an html fragment into a div and then use jqmodal to display that div as a modal-dialog

1348844
jqmodal	jquery
i m showing my jqmodal dialog in the response from a jquery call function foo is called from an onclientclick event

1348850
authentication	login
the test client has a mock login setup which uses the clientformsauthenticationmembershipprovider provider to ask the authenticator website to authentication the credentials given on the test client

1348870
textbox	button
i created a form application with 1 button and 1 textbox to see if i could recreate this error and i did

1348880
entity-framework	ado.net
if you meant ado.net entity-framework you are again out of luck as it also does not support ms-access

1348884
twitter	tweets
and you can then use twitter tools a wordpress-plugin which automatically archive all your tweets daily and weekly see

1348890
show	next
i can t remember exactly where i ve seen this strange 1 single-tick and the numbers 1 appearing next to classname but it s show up .when inspector variables value while debugging and most recently in the answer to this question

1348892
double	int
i need to get the left hand side int value from a decimal or double

1348903
malloc	free
it is not the c runtime that python links with .so you shouldn t call the malloc free from msvcrt

1348911
double	int
i can see how the msdn article can be misleading they should have specified that while the result is an int in this case meaning whole numbers it is still of types double

1348917
double	int
don t cast the original double as an int because the rules for floor are different iirc for negative numbers

1348919
python	java
if that fails there are always several xml parsing implementation in python and java

1348952
document	editing
many of the people who will be using this are not programmers or even that computer savvy .so we re al.so looking for a systemd that let s people simply add document to the repository checkedout and edit a document unless .someone else is currently editing it and checked it back in with a minimum of fuss

1348958
double	int
the range of double is much wider than the range of int or long

1348997
javadoc	phpdoc
the phpdoc comment api formatting is based on a the javadoc format

1349002
contains	elements
if i examine the entire form collections in the debugger i see the proper value laid out separated by and none of the important data elements is null but strangely the data contains a plus sign in front of the equals sign

1349003
appfuse	spring
everyone talks about how jsp is harder to get set up then php this maybe true but you should look into appfuse lite it will help you get your spring ibatis setup running in about 15 minutes

1349004
python	php	python	c++	python	java
c++ c# java python php javascript

1349017
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
the two basic algorithms for detection connect of a graphing is depth-first-search and breadth-first-search

1349019
vb.net	vba
also just to note that vb vba and vb.net are all three different languages even though they might shared some similar syntax

1349019
vb.net	vba
there s no real difference between vb.net and c# besides the keyword syntax .so we shouldn t lump vb 6 and before and vba in with vb.net

1349036
stored-procedures	ado.net
the data-layer is ado.net that call stored-procedures

1349039
radio-button	selected	selected	listbox	listboxitem	selected
i want the children items to have a radio-button that is selected .when the listboxitem is selected and .when the listbox has focus the inner listbox

1349039
radio-button	selected	selected	listbox
currently the isselected portion of the above is working great however .when i move from one viewmodel to the other the first listbox loses focus the radio-button on the first listbox remains selected

1349039
radio-button	selected
the isselected part of this works great only one item in the list has the radio-button selected at any time

1349039
radio-button	selected
however .when the control looses focus the selected item s radio-button is still selected not what i want

1349056
stored-procedures	ado.net
ado.net + stored-procedures is a great choice

1349076
credentials	security	administration	credentials
this occurs even though the security credentials used are members of the administration grouping - and i have not been able to find a way to specify the elevated priviledge level

1349093
properties-file	jar
then you can use the properties to selected the appropriate jar and properties-file for example

1349094
content-disposition	content-type
these are usually after the body and will have a content-type header that will tell you how to decode the attachment and some info about it as well as possibly a content-disposition header that provides some metadata about the attachment

1349096
nsimage	appkit
please see the appkit release notes for details of the nsimage changes

1349120
contains	any
indeed my loader appears to work fine with a simple assembly executable that does not contains any data

1349142
getter	setter
i started a discussion about encapsulation on a forum in which i asked whether you should always clone object inside setter and or getter as to preserve the above rules of encapsulation

1349143
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms hyperlink elements

1349145
vbscript	vb6	vbscript	vba	vba	vb6
vb6 vbscript and vba have the reputation because they just aren t industrial strength languages

1349145
vb.net	vba
fortunately vb.net and the latest versioning of vba fix everything above .so vb.net is on par with any other serious language in the marketplace

1349145
perl	c++
i d say perl lisp and c++ are worse on the eyes than vb

1349153
boolean	int
most of these properties are boolean only hold 0 or 1 around 12 are with int value and some are string

1349162
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i have a css dropdown menu which is working great in ie7 firefox safari and opera on pc haven t been able to test on mac yet

1349165
value	field
what s the best way to create in nodes additional status field that is a list of fixed string value and is visible to users but modifiable by admins only

1349198
value	field
for example if you had a field in a class that you wanted to encapsulate you could create a public methods that would be the single access points for getting the value that field contains

1349198
value	field
if you wish to change how that field s value is returned cloning etc. you are free to do .so since you know that you control the single avenue to that field

1349202
hide	show
i want to provide a checkbox option to show hide a plot s legend

1349204
any	set
do you have any forwarding set up somewhere that could be causing this issue

1349222
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i also have other asp.net webforms sites on the same webserver configure in the same fashion files from a network shared and they have no problems which makes me i think this is a bug in the asp.net-mvc framework specifically in the view lookup process

1349234
wamp	php	perl	php
presuming that wamp means windows apache mysql perl php you would use the mysql command-line client to apply the sql scripting

1349244
shell	bash
note that stripes is not a bash cmd though you may be running it from a bash shell

1349245
memcached	apc
if performance is really a problem and based on what you ve said it won t be then you might consider caching the results using something like apc memcached or xcache

1349260
constructor	object
each constructor would decrement this int before passing it to the constructor of the object it initializer

1349262
execution	jobs
headless execution with gui test automation the agent you execute the test on will required a gui desktop which has certain limitations .when attempting to farm out test jobs to other machines need to be logged on interactive screens not locked etc... .when coding to the api with a scripting engine this is not an issue

1349276
credentials	account
vs2008 uses your credentials to authentication to the db iis is using different account

1349295
any	set
my goal is to accept a set of these and generator a query that returns any rows that match any single inclusion filtering without matching any single exclusion filtering

1349301
exception-handling	error-handling
i even tried to mentor the guy .so that he would be familiar with oop exception-handling based error-handling etc

1349310
expression-blend	wpf
in some ways i prefer ib to things like expression-blend or xaml for wpf programming in .net

1349317
any	set
.so even if you set the positioning past the first frame you wont get any data rendering

1349355
perl	php
it s not php related but perl has both a rest interface and a dbi interface for integration with mysql

1349365
contains	set
you could create a mock whitelist collections that will contains a certain set of the phonecontacts and then call onincomingcall with phonecontacts that are or are not in the whitelist and then checked the callmonitor or the call object itself i suppose to see if the call is in the correct state

1349393
uitableview	uitextview	uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
you can use the built-in uitableview with a uinavigationcontroller to create a hierarchy of screens .so your users can drill down from say a list of player to the player s stats then perhaps a detail view or a uitextview or a uipickerview to change those stats

1349400
environment	building
qt does a good job of looking like modern c++ there are a few extras to handle the signals and slot event mechanism but these are more a complication to the building environment than to the code

1349405
implements	abstract
that idea being the use of interfaces to abstract the calling code from the concrete class that actually implements the functionality

1349411
user-controls	ascx
note that this is a user-controls with an ascx file

1349413
versioning	upgrade
the only downside unfortunately there s no good way around it at the moment is that if you upgrade django you ll have to be on the lookout for any changes to that index.html file and copy those changes over into your versioning as well

1349415
callback	methods
yes you can use the callback methods

1349421
shell	bash
it is a bad idea to perform each task by calling bash shell

1349438
order	add
the issue is that users can add delete images .so maintaining the order is important

1349444
virtual-machine	vmware
as mehrdad says virtual-machines don t really virtualize 3d hardware there is some work being done in this area by vmware but it s only older versioning of directx i think and wpf utilizes the gpu to rendering more efficiently thus it has to use software to rendering in a virtual-machine and that is significantly slower

1349454
lightbox	jquery
i just install the jquery lightbox plugins on my wordpress blog

1349454
background-color	height
the links are still the same height and changes background-color as they should have

1349476
shell	bash
opening up a single bash shell and sending cmd and properly parsing results shouldn t be bad

1349486
any	set
here s one way finding your single target bitstring can be reduced to finding any of a certain set of bytestrings

1349541
ifconfig	linux	shell	bash
i have a .socket server were i perform different operations using ifconfig by calling shell for example and i plan to integrated an client in a jsf application.because i m not experienced ant i intend to make it my graduation project but i m not .so sure if calling bash from java to configure a linux box is a good .solution

1349576
.war	jar
on the other hand if you want to shared code across multiple .war files then you would bundle the .wars into an ear and bundle the sharedd business-logic code in one or more jar files stored in that ear

1349594
32-bit	x86
advantage of the nature of 32-bit x86

1349595
32-bit	64bit
just like the size of pointers presumably the size would be that of a native int 32-bit on 32-bit platform and 64bit on a 64bit platform

1349613
exception-handling	try-catch
sometimes there are some isolated cases where it is known that this block of code occasionally throw exception-handling and i ve handled it in with a try-catch

1349613
any	set
i d like to be able to set an attributes on the methods something analogous to system.diagnostics.debuggerhiddenattributes which just ignore any exception-handling throw in the methods

1349618
user-interface	flicker
if it does flicker you re probably looking at screnario b or of course the user-interface issue cogwheel mentions

1349637
subclassing	base-class
.when you want to add a new database-table to the base layer you have to create a subclassing of this base-class and overrides some methods to defined individual behavior for using this table

1349642
webforms	asp.net
i m using asp.net and i have a save button on webforms

1349667
value	field
in wordpress i used a mysql query to make an empty custom field called description in all post of a test database and now i want to add the value test to that field

1349667
value	field
but i can t get this query to deal with the fact that the field has no value

1349707
gethashcode	equals
equals and gethashcode which even if resharper does it for me is extra needless code

1349719
attributes	properties
and if you re not you can add an attributes to the properties

1349764
indexof	equals
ps. i m not a c# programmer but i presume that .when indexof equals -1 it means not found

1349777
hide	show
right now i m able to show all 4 sub-divs at the same time where it should hide the currently visible one then show the new one

1349840
any	set
additionally after the filtering query set is built order may be applied by any of the field

1349840
contains	set
my current solution is to use a filteringpec class contains a collections of filtering along with an initial query set

1349871
export	csv
that said you can import csv files as nick explains which you should be able to export from mysql fairly easily

1349871
python	java
gae supports java and python at the same time using the versioning mechanism

1349871
python	java
.so you can set up your data store in python and then run against it for your application in java

1349877
scala	java
however given that scala provides a very different way to do thing than java

1349923
authentication	access-token
an arbitrary oauth access-token can t be used for authentication because the meaning of the token is outside of the oauth core specifications

1349928
recording	playing
but after lots of testing i m pretty sure it s not possible to recording sound while playing music with the mediaplayer api although if you use a different api to play sound avaudioplayer it usually does work

1349930
arguments	default
now have a default arguments that you use which has typedef for the default-argumentss you want provide

1349930
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
where a derived-class of virtualroot hide a member from the base that member of the derived-class is dominant over the member of the base and will be used even though the base-class member can be reached by other path in the inherited tree

1349932
python	php
i have a basic understanding of coding and have done a smattering of scripting in python and php

1349935
keyboard	mouse
inorder to do anything that invokes a prompt flash required user integration like keyboard or mouse input

1349961
base-class	inherited
i have base-class base-class and derived classes deriveda derivedb and derivedc that all inherited base-class

1349961
derived-class	base-class
i have another class externalclass with a methods that accepts a parameter of types base-class but is actually passed a derived-class

1349966
derived-class	base-class
you should consider making the behavior a methods of base-class and overrides it in each derived-class

1349973
subclassing	base-class
this communication to humans and to compilers that all subclassing of base-class need to implements that operation

1349979
reliability	scalability
this means that the vendor of cloud based resources is taking responsibility for the performance reliability scalability of the computing environment

1349979
hardware	monitor
from an application developers points of view this can be a tremendous advantage as procuring maintaining tuning monitor and scaling hardware to meet the demands of growth is both difficult and expensive

1349979
lan	wan
however it seems to me that this roadblock is evaporating as new technologies and robust api s eliminate many integration difficulties created .when running applications outside the lan wan

1349982
display	height	display	width
the height and the width are only used to modify the image dimension as the browser automatically display s the actual size

1349998
rollback	commit
rollback changes i made in file b for commit 2

1349999
macros	vba
per michael dillon s answer saveastext does save the cmd in a macros without having to go through converting to vba

1349999
macros	vba
but if you just want to evaluate what the macros do one alternative would be to convert them to vba which can be done programmatically thus

1350013
httpwebrequest	webclient
httpwebrequest response and webclient will catch most of the redirects but not all of them since there are pages that do the redirect via javascript

1350034
webserver	upload
we also have a staging server which we usually sync upload files to and then from there rsync them all out via a bash scripting to the other webserver

1350039
local-variables	class-members
most of the time you can refactor those local-variables as class-members initializer them only once and keeping only the updates to dbparameters inside the methods

1350043
ftp	ssh
among ftp http ssh etc

1350079
ftp	scp
if you are simply using ftp or scp to copy up files in to staging directory then the solution there is two have two process

1350080
oodbms	rdbms
if they were to use oodbms they would still need access to rdbms for certain functions

1350080
sql-server	oracle
.when you have big named like oracle and sql-server in the oodbms world and proven performance in a variety of environment then you ll see more project using them

1350083
rendering	redraw	drawstring	draw
if you redraw the text using the system.drawing.graphics object s drawstring methods then you should use the same object s measurestring methods to get the pixels length of the string beforedraw and then offset the draw positioning accordingly offset it by half the difference between the string s width and the width of the rectangle you re rendering it into

1350086
sftp	scp
ssh-based tools sftp scp are pretty good but some isps have been known to throttle or otherwise interfere with encrypted traffic comcast i m lookin at you

1350089
base-class	inherited
i have a class which inherited from another and i want to make use of one of the base-class functions...but i am running into a problem where calling the base function does not return the member variables from the inherited class as i had hoped

1350098
subclassing	base-class
you can overrides the object by making it virtual in the base-class and overrides in the subclassing but the object has to keep its types

1350102
http	ssl
if you mean ssl it is also not a transfer protocols its a security layer commonly used encapsulating http sessions

1350103
stderr	stdout
you can close stdout stderr stdin in just the child-process if

1350120
error-code	hresult
systemd.runtime.interopservices.comexception-handling was unhandled messages invalid formatetc structure exception-handling from hresult 0x80040064 dv_e_formatetc source systemd error-code -2147221404 stack-trace at systemd.runtime.interopservices.comtypes.idataobject.getdata formatetc format stgmedium medium

1350135
oodbms	rdbms
but it s also true that oodbms don t solve the same set of problems that rdbms are good at solving

1350148
show	next
next list_comp_join versus list_comp show that join is pretty fast it takes about 1.7 or only 10 of list_comp_join s time

1350155
udp	tcp	packets	lan
with socket.sendfile since sockets are by definition protocol-agnostic you could potentially send the file via udp or tcp with the same code but i would only recommend that if you re sending via a lan where packets loss is virtually 0

1350164
hide	show
.so here s my question how to i load unload or show hide views

1350166
linux	unix
for example if you need to do things to compensate for difference in the different flavours of linux unix or maybe even windows

1350171
protected	public
if i have a java class which is package-private declare with class not public class there is really no difference if the methods inside are declare public or protected or package-private right

1350183
mouseleave	mouseenter
the pseudo-event-name hover is used as a shorthand for mouseenter mouseleave but was handled differently in earlier jquery versioning

1350183
mouseleave	mouseenter
still a popular question .so it s worth drawing attention to dennis98 s points in the comments below that in jquery 1.9+ the hover event was deprecated in favour of the standards mouseenter mouseleave call

1350185
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
it looks to me like ere syntax is mostly upward-compatible with .net s regex flavor as it is with most other perl-compatible flavors perl php python javascript ruby java...

1350185
expression	brackets
the only major exception-handling i can see is in the area of pthreads brackets expression

1350192
protected	public
if i have a java class which is package-private declare with class not public class there is really no difference if the methods inside are declare public or protected or package-private right

1350192
protected	public
but if you then or in the future declare a protected or public class that inherited from the package-private class then the visibility of the members of the original class do matter

1350195
put	get
i m trying to get data from isnare and put them into mysql table

1350209
websphere	ibm
this is more or less born out of frustration with the jax-ws 2.0 implementation in the web-services feature pack for ibm websphere 6.1 - apparently wsdls are not generator for jax-ws web-services if they have a soap 1.2 binding defined using the bindingtype annotations

1350216
value	field
also is there any way to compute it s value based on the value of other form field

1350216
value	field
i understand that __viewstate as the named suggests maintains the value of form field value in webpage however what i m interested in knowing is how this state the string is generator

1350216
value	field
i was hoping i could prefill the form initial value using the web service data and then calculate the __viewstate to access the last field that show up on the last stage of the form it would make the whole process a lot faster

1350222
32-bit	64bit
in the second case you ll have to create a separate 32-bit helpers wrapper process that links to the 32-bit libs and takes request to call the libs from the 64bit process through an ipc mechanism returning the results

1350222
32-bit	64bit
your 64bit process will have to kick off the 32-bit helpers process .when it starts up and make sure the helpers process knows to exit .when the parent process disappears

1350224
value	field
assume that it is a compressed actually base64 encode pair of your form field value in text form which gets serialization into server side object for you to work with

1350228
sql-server	ms-access
i have single bigtable in ms-access 2k daabase and i need a way to copy this table and then populate my two already ready tables on sql-server

1350228
sql-server	ms-access	selected	button
what i am thinking is to create a form in ms-access which should have a browse button for selected my source access mdb file and then another button for process on click the table specified above by browse button should be import into sql-server

1350231
actionscript	mxml
in actionscript and mxml the whole concept of fluid layout

1350241
sql-server	ms-access
i have single bigtable in ms-access 2k database and i need a way to copy this table and then populate my two already ready tables on sql-server

1350244
sql-server	ms-access
you could create an access project .adp to the sql-server and then use the file-import menu in ms-access in the .adp to import your table into the .adp and thus sql-server

1350264
exception-handling	try-catch
this article on msdn states that you can use as many try-catch blocks as you want and not incur any performance cost as long no actual exception-handling is throw

1350264
exception-handling	try-catch
since i always believed that a try-catch always takes a small performance hit even .when not throw the exception-handling i made a little test

1350266
any	set
i haven t seen an expiration date on any rss or atom-editor standards but one thing i learned is that another set or many sets of eyes can read things differently

1350277
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
loki is a plugins built by skyhook which works on internet-explorer 6 internet-explorer 7 firefox 2 firefox 3 safari and opera

1350277
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari	opera-mobile	safari
you can install google-gears on internet-explorer 6+ firefox 1.5+ safari opera-mobile and ie mobile

1350282
where-clause	sql
you can either add a more specific where-clause in your original sql or if that s infeasible you could do this

1350298
contains	set
each one of those items can contains another set of items

1350298
data-structures	tree
i would be writing the implementation of this algorithm in c# .so it would be nice to avoid data-structures that don t exist in it such as binary tree linked lists etc

1350310
instances	destroy
there is only ever one copy of that function regardless of how many foo instances you might create or destroy

1350311
postorder	inorder
why is it necessary to keep visited flag for imperative postorder traversal and not for inorder or pre order imperative traversal and is it possible to do postorder traversal without keeping visited flag

1350322
response	timeout
if the given request is a ajax request the response will be json data which will have status 403 and it will contains a key called timeout with value true

1350330
xsd	xml
xml using the xsd and class generator above

1350332
unsigned	short
i ll bet they re doing a + on an unsigned short

1350332
unsigned	short
the result-of the addition gets cast to an int implicit then needs to be downcasting back to an unsigned short for the assignment

1350335
setinterval	settimeout
flex has enter_frame events timer calllater settimeout setinterval all which delay call and create new execution stack

1350335
push	pull
the idea being that you push functions closures into an arrays and the active object controllers pull the next one off the list .when the previous one has run to completion

1350345
required	checked
there may be some additional assembly load cost and initial types access cost as each new assembly will required those initial security checked

1350346
value	field
.when i want to insert the value of input field into database i use this code

1350346
put	get
.so i get only the last value insert in the database but .when i put the query line inside foreach loops like

1350346

1351895
rubinius	jruby
the only ruby implementation that contains a significant amount of ruby code are rubinius about 70 ruby 30 c++ and maglev unknown amounts of ruby and smalltalk . and naturally xruby and jruby are implements 100 in java

1351895
groovy	scala
charlie was looking at the available options scala groovy fan clojure nice but all of them had a significant disadvantage a fairly large language runtime

1351895
jruby	mri
the size of the jruby runtime is already a big problem in terms of memory consumption and startup latency especially compared to mri or yarv and even more .so if you actually include the jvm itself in your measurements and rewriting it in a language that adds its own runtime to that weight is simply a no-go

1351895
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
d cli and actionscript and ports of surinx to the dlr smalltalk parrot ecmascript python perl php and objectice-c

1351896

1351927
margins	padding
margins collapsing happens .when a child elements has a margins and the parent elements doesn t have padding or borders

1351927
margins	padding
use padding instead if possible or set a padding or a border on the parent to avoid the margins to collapse

1351929
division	modulo
modulo is the remainder not division

1351942
lookup	any
in jndi you can lookup and listen to any object not just datasource s assuming your jndi service provider supports it

spreadsheetgear for .net reads and writes csv xls xlsx and does more

1352070
xlsx	xls
spreadsheetgear for .net reads and writes csv xls xlsx and does more

1352082
implements	extends
this means that the most direct use of read macros is to implements the pre-defined data syntax and open up possibilities to change or extends the way lisp reads s-expression

1352082
common-lisp	scheme
an example would be a reader for scheme s-expression - which are slightly different from common-lisp

1352088
sqrt	sin	sqrt	cos	sqrt	exp	cos	sin	cos	exp	sin	exp
to be ord a types a just needs comparison-operators and to be an instances of floating a types a just needs to implements fractions and have the functions pi exp sqrt log sin cos .

1352111
enumerator	any
the underlying types of an enumerator must be able to store the value of any enumerator of course - and two enumerators that have the same underlying types are layout compatible this allows some flexibility in case a types mismatch occurs

1352111
enumerator	any
it is possible to defined an enumerator that has value not definedd by any of its enumerators

1352122
python	ruby	python	c++	haskell	python	haskell	c++
for almost all the other languages c++ ruby python haskell lisp... vi and emacs are better in my opinion

macports and fink both have gnu indentation package

1352144
exponent	modulo
i have a 128-byte 1024-bit modulo in a byte arrays format and my exponent also in a byte arrays format

1352144
exponent	modulo
according to wikipedia the public key consists of the modulo n and the public or encryption exponent e. but that doesn t tell me how to mix both

1352148
value	field
these field are hidden correctly but what is the best way of setting the hidden-field value

1352154
value	field
a field may be declare volatile in which case the java-memory-model â 17 ensures that all threads see a consistent value for the variables

1352182
exponent	modulo
the public key has two parts the exponent and the modulo

1352186
aggregate	grouping
it also seems to depend upon the numbers of grouping into which the items are aggregate where a greater numbers of grouping results in less performance

1352187
uiaccelerometer	shake
you should absolutely not be listening to uiaccelerometer directly with your own filtering to handle shake events

1352201
put	get	getter	setter
if you put the master passphrase and all related information into here and do the passwd generator then no other javascript code can get that information as you will create setter with no getter

1352216
locale	hebrew
because of that the following code will not output a correct iso date with a hebrew locale

1352218
audio	ogg	speex	flac
other audio codecs that can be used with ogg include speex for speech celt for ultra-low delay audio and flac for lossless audio compression

1352219
repository	entity
i would rather have repository methods like findcarbytypes and deal with one types of entity to reduce risk

1352234
contains	set
eitherway the folder that will contains the database must be writable by the scripting either by being the same user or by having write permission set to the php user

the site .lib directory is for things that have been added -- either by the distribution activeperl strawberry-perl etc. or by the user site administration install from cpan ppm etc.

1352300
ip-address	hostname
each a recording specifies the hostname like server2 and the ip-address

1352303
json	xml
if you want to ultimately serve the data as json i don t see how adding an extra xml conversion at both the database and web service sides would help

1352303
difference	factors
again i d urge you to measure the difference and bear other factors in mind before committing to one path or the other

1352311
licensing	eula
if the apps are commercial then be careful that you are not breaking any licensing eula terms by running them in this way

1352311
any	set
another alternative would be to set up a virtual-pc image and simply execute that on the hosts pc .so there is no need to worry about any special cases for each application

1352316
children	nodes
i loaded the top level object and display then in the treeview and put marker actually i put in tag of the nodes which i learned from some .net book or article i had read long ago but remembered .when use click on the nodes i loaded the immediate children

i m not an expert in il but we can see that an local exception-handling object is created on fourth line after that things are pretty same as for methods without try-catch till the line seventeen il_0021 leave.s il_002f

1352397
panels	grid
you likely need to find a way to bind the visibility properties to the root of your user-controls s visuals the grid panels

1352399
any	set
if the link master and child setting in the sub-form is set correctly then you not need to write any code and access will insert the personâ s id in the link field

1352402
json	xml
you should avoid unnecessary transformation such as serializing to xml and then re-serializing as json

1352402
json	xml
if you are going to send json to the client you should probably forget xml all together

1352402
managed-code	native-code
between sql-server and managed-code i would guess that sql-server is better simply because it is highly optimized for this scenario and it does it in native-code

1352410
initializer	getter
initializer either in a constructor or with a lazy-evaluation getter using a factory

1352420

it is more protected than public though

1352454
compact-framework	.net
binary seralization is not supported by .net compact-framework .so i am opting for xmlserializer

1352456
32-bit	64bit
edit i should clarify that wrt 64bit support the problem isn t in tkinter rather that the apple-supplied versioninging of tk in 10.5 and earlier were 32-bit only and .so there was code in setup.py to prevent attempting to building a 64bit versioning of tkinter on osx

1352488
self-contained	platform
math.net is a mathematical open source toolkit written in c# for the microsoft .net platform that aims to provide a self-contained clean framework for both numerical scientific and symbolic algebraic computations

click	mouse
you click the mouse your event handler gets called you can change what s display

1352511
silverlight	wpf
.so while silverlight looks like wpf in the browser it s really a very different styles of programming

it does this by providing a framework for doing things like providing the ability to shared .net types between client-server which can act in a stateful fashion on the client and transfer data back to the server using rest xml json service

1352526
multiplication	division
multiplication and division of pointers data types are only forbidden by the compiler

1352527

debian or ubuntu or the like -- but then i m not in purchasing nor in an it department nor do i work for a very traditional enterprise anyway

1352540
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
if this is sql-server oracle or postgresql yes you can use a check-constraint

1352541
perl	tcl	python	tcl	python	perl
activestate has a long tradition contributing windows support to python tcl and perl by hiring key developers like mark hammond for some time by fixing bugs specific to windows and having employees contribute fixed back and by being sponsors of the python software foundation

1352548
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
in oracle sql-server and postgresql use check-constraint

1352553
put	get
the put function works fine but the get function does not

1352556
contains	any	concat	where
in any case where the value you re trying to match contains both single and double-quotes you can construct an expression that uses concat to produce the text that it s going to match

1352558
keyboard	mouse
you can easily throw an image next to a textbox to indicate that it has options which allows both mouse driven or keyboard driven integration

1352558
selected	textbox
if you re interested in progressive-enhancement you may be best off with both a traditional selected input for accessibility that gets replace by an autocomplete textbox driven off the same data

1352558
selected	textbox
you could al.so leave the selected visible - which makes it more flexible but potentially more confusing - and hook an event handler to the selected box to updates the textbox as well .so that they stay in sync

1352559
filesystems	fat
and even then you may be out of luck if enough revision have been made or it s not a trivial filesystems like fat

1352560
selected	button
to see this button make sure that your project is selected in the solution-explorer

attributes	properties
in addition some of the properties tasks in ant-contrib like propertiesregex mentioned above have an optional overrides attributes which allow them to change the value of the target properties

1352595
value	field
for example if the involves a join or a grouping by it s not clear which row s would be affected if you change a value of a field in the row object

1352601
javascript	dom
my dom skills are weak and i can t work out why a javascript variables is assign this object pointers value rather than the string value itself

1352605

you can get this positioning with ftell and modify it with fseek

1352610
multiplication	division
multiplication and division of pointers data types are only forbidden by the compiler

1352681
python	c++
did you consider using python c++ qt

1352688
required	checked
it cannot do all that would be required in the final language feature depending on the final feature definition but provide some equivalent solutions for templates typechecking and other compile-time checked

1352688
language-features	typechecking
as suggested as the c++0x concept is a language-features it would allow to provide more elegant semantic and allow compiler to use informations not currently available to the program allowing more detailed or intelligent errors at compile-time as the concept first purpose is to allow abstract typechecking in templates

1352692
perl	ruby	perl	c++	python	ruby	python	c++	python	perl	python	java

i think that the code you have above is okay except that i usually provide a more descriptive messages to be just a little more explicit of course that s my preferences and what you are doing still communication the problem

1352824
subclassing	superclass
in c++ if a class might be subclassinging then its destructor should almost always be virtual because otherwise if it s not virtual and you invoke it by deleting a pointers to the superclass the destructor of the subclassing wouldn t be invoked

1352836
32-bit	64bit
here s the thing the kernel is not 64bit in snow leopard on my mac pro efi 32-bit

if the news title are not unique you have to get the value of the multi-lookup field using the web-services first which will be in this format id1

1353542
boolean	int
making ids a range of continuous int makes it possible to implements the storage of process permutation as a bit field or a boolean arrays

1353549
put	get
i would think you d get better results using the same kind of initializer you do .when you first put the slider s value into the cell that is

1353552
selected	cell
create a single uiwebview and depending on which cell gets selected load a nsurlrequest into the view using loadrequest

1353571
tree	trie
not relates directly to the question but as an alternative solution you may use trie tree as a lookup structure

1353571
tree	trie
trie tree are very good for strings operations its implementation relatively easy and it should be more faster max of n k where k is length of a key than hashset for a big amount of long strings

1353572
getter	setter
you can access the getter and setter methods through the propertydescriptor class in the javabeans api

1353582

1353670
pointers	stack
each function-call has its own stack frame and frame pointers

1353703
toolchain	platform
the real true advantage of gcc over turbo-c and visual c is it s availability on platform other than windows and it s ability of buildinging cross-platform binaries meaning you can set up a building toolchain to building windows binaries on a linux box with gcc or you can set up a similar toolchain to building some arm binaries on an intel box which is definitely nice since you might not have as much power in your arm device as you might have in you development rig

1353715
python	c++
he claimed that though you are programming python you still have to optimise the little bits of your software as much as possible as if you are writing an efficient algorithm in c++

postgresql	mysql
however these different systemd have different strengths postgresql has a ton more functionality than mysql and can handle some very specific tasks that mysql struggles with

1354521
sql-server	mysql
sql-server usually integrated with microsoft product very easily whereas mysql you d have to do some extra work to make them play together

1354521
oracle	mysql

1355625
subclassing	superclass
i don t think there s a way to dynamically choose whether to extends one class or another except if you made a program that can manipulate bytecode directly simple example hold the compiled bytecode for both versioning of the subclassing as strings and just use a classloader to load whichever one corresponds to the superclass you have available

1355686
python	ruby	python	java
there s a feeling of i could spend time and plot all this out in uml...or i could just write some python that actually implements the design and expresses it in a language i like to read and lots of people can read. java programs tend to feel heavier than their ruby or python counterparts â it s part of the design of the language

1355733
conditional	operators
having exactly the same numbers of call to the new excluding placement-new and delete operators is neither a necessary nor sufficient conditional of leak-free code

lgpl	gpl
you should better read the original lgpl text it s not that big as the text of gpl

1355807
required	checked	lgpl	gpl
the difference between it and gpl required you to provide a possibility for users to change the lgpl ed libs code for example upgrade it or fix bugs in the libs within your application without need to disassembly your program hack it and fight crash due to some kind of integrity checked

1355814
rollback	commit
before i even start trying to use a transactional with either commit or rollback could someone tell me if i can do the following in ms-access

1355861
python	c++
why does c++ need to have a main function but python doesn t

1355862
python	c++
as such it has many different design choices than does python because c++ has no environment which it can rely on to manage information like types and memory

1355862
python	c++
this is why c++ has no equivalent to python eval nor a means of determining members etc

1355862
environment	execution
of a class nor other features that required an execution environment or a massive overhead in the program itself instead of such an environment

1355862
python	c++
why does c++ need to have a main function but python doesn t

1357066
subclassing	superclass
why is the constructor of the superclass glyph calling the draw methods of the subclassing roundglyph

1357071
dhcp	arp
otherwise you d need to construct an arp request or some ip traffic say a p ing to get it in the caching - and note that due to dhcp and other network vagaries like a machine being turned off it is possible that converting ip to mac later will yield a different answer

1357087

1357382
click	mouse
of course this would be rather memory intensive i d be iterator a large numbers of hexes to see which hex a mouse click falls within... .so it might be better to use a mathematical formula to work out if a points is within a hex..

triggers	insert
if you are using the value statement in an insert in a triggers there is a stong possibility that you are doing the wrong thing

1357466
triggers	insert
triggers fire once for each batch-file of recording insert deleted or updates

1357466
triggers	insert
.so if ten recording were insert in one batch-file then the triggers fires once

1357496
instances	private
private to the instances and not the

1357506
instances	private
as you can see private doesn t protect the instances member from being accessed by another instances

1357511
percentile	min
min filtering zeroth percentile to enhance some types of edges

1357523
instances	private
if the assumption private member variables are private to the instances were correct the marked line would cause a compiler error because the other.value field is private and part of a different object than the one whose equals methods is being called

1357523
instances	private
but since in java and most other languages that have the visibility concept private visibility is per-class access to the field is allowed to all code of the mutableinteger irrelevant of what instances was used to invoke it

1357546
scriptaculous	jquery
im not too familiar with jquery - but id suggest using the prototype framework along with scriptaculous - within prototype you can definately achieve this effect

what i mean is on a page the user can enter one numbers or thirty numberss then he she presses the ok button and the next page show the arrays in the same order as it was entered one elements at a time

1357618
lookup	any
usually to do any kind of transformation and loading you need error-handling lookup etc that you will have to code yourself unless you use an off-the-shelf product

1357633
communication	messages
this makes some sense in lighting of mathematica s rather unusual semantics where it operates on expression with repeated rules rewrite but the default set of methods for communication with mathematica doesn t allow you to easily monitor those messages from within java or it appears .net though it is possible to write your own methods that do a better job of this

1357641
versioning	upgrade
as ie users upgrade to the newer versioning the need for ccs should decrease and hopefully one day may go away completely

1357648
value	field
remember that the other object may belong to a subclassing which could store the value in a different object field or in a file or database etc

1357659
contains	elements
this depends on the fact that input elements don t contains option elements but i think it s what you are looking for

1357661
variables	boolean
note if you specify numbers or true false value inside the arrays then the types of variables will be numeric or boolean instead of string

1357671
any	set

1357838
hashmap	arrays
.when using nonscalar arrays as key in a hashmap matlab will convert them to double but they ll be distinct java objecs .so they ll get this behavior

1357897
lookup	any
the fact that drive is external shouldn t make it any harder you can still open the disk the same way i showed maybe use a wmi tool to lookup the path once the drive is connect

1357927
subtract	time
worse your own count code will subtract from the amount of time your own process has thus you can execute less within one context cycle

1357928
listbox	textbox
you would need to place the listbox just beneath the textbox .so that they can see the entries available then remove the listbox .when they re done typing

1357932
any	set
sessionstate is set up on an application level .so the only way to disable session for any asp.net request is to put it in its own application in iis and turn session state off

1357962
type-erasure	reification
it has been decided that as a modification to the bytecode to support reification generics would break backwards-compatibility that generics would have to be implements via type-erasure

1357964
moss	wss
the most painless is going to be to run ssrs in native mode which it sounds like you re doing already then install the ssrs web-parts on your wss moss server

1357964
moss	wss
you will have to manage security and report source control using some other methods besides sharepoint however you don t have to deal with installing wss moss on your ssrs box and adding it to your sharepoint farm

rather a general protection exception-handling is generator and the os handler for said exception-handling may if the os is design this way work out what the process wants and service the request

1358024
logout	login
instead you should look at it vertically - what are the different features - it could be login logout display list of users display .some other data and .so on

1358034
value	field
i ve found it s really handy for pre-populating value into the form or providing a different experience than the sharepoint defined layout hidden field etc

1358038
order	join
an anti join methods used by both in and exists will just need to make sure that a recording does not exists once per each row in order .so it will eliminate all possible duplicates first

1358040
shell	bash
you mean assuming bash shell

1358041
show	next
now what happens is that .when the call returns from ajax the cursor show in the next textbox correctly but the keyboard no longer works

1358054
jmockit	junit
jmockit looked like it would work but is incompatibile with spring 2.5 and junit 4.4

32-bit	64bit
note that with the old stubs idea will run under 32-bit jvm while with the new stubs it will run under 64bit jvm

1358064
lookup	any
if you process them in that order then there is no need to do a lookup to see if you have already done any particular permutation

1358067
entity-framework	ado.net
only with ado.net entity-framework and should not use linq language

1358114
positioning	slider
this move the slider 100 pixels to the right of its current positioning

1358124
shell	bash
for example if your shell is bash checked .bashrc

any of the package which use the gdal ogr libs will most likely be able to handle the tin format you re using whether that s arcinfo s etc

1358139
exception-handling	error-handling
error-handling on the other hand the error-handling is much much better as you can switching to exception-handling instead of lousy fatals errors and .so on

1358140
digits	zero
1-9 0-9 0 2 one to three digits no leading zero followed by

1358140
digits	zero
0-9 3 a thousands separator and three digits zero or more time

1358140
decimal-point	digits
optional a decimal-point followed by exactly two digits

1358140
decimal-point	digits
if you know that the format is correct stripes out everything that is not a digits or a decimal-point and parsing it into a decimal in c# this would be using decimal.parsing or if there is no suitable parsing methods just split at the decimal-point parsing into to int and combine both numbers

1358158
mousemove	mouseover
mousemove mouseover events don t fire on the components i m dragging over because the mouse is constantly over the dragged component .so i would need .some .sort of stage.coordinate - visiblecomponentatthatcoordinate conversion

1358166
centering	fixed
note that the m for fixed with column is provided by the arrays package and will give you vertical centering if you don t want this just go back to p

1358175
selected	cell
i want my cell despite the fact that i m click around to stay selected

1358192
constructor	object
if an object has an exception-handling in the constructor then the destructor is called and the memory release

1358217
attributes	properties
this way allows you some flexibility in using attributes properties to customize the behavior

1358218
any	set
the answer i accepted was to use asenumerable on the result set thus forcing it to return all columns before doing any further calculations

1358231
perl	c++
in general you don t have to worry about memory-leaks in perl but you would be equally safe in this circumstance with a non-garbage-collecting language like c++

1358232
macros	basic
my basic understanding of macros is they re a simple search and replace that happens on your code prior to it being compiled

1358248
export	report

1358273
castle-monorail	asp.net-mvc
my project is using castle-monorail as a asp.net-mvc framework

1358279
function-call	inline
they are a way of eliminating function-call overhead because they are always expanded inline unlike the inline keyword which is an often-ignored hint to the compiler and didn t even exist in the standards prior to c99

1358279
function-call	inline
it would be annoying to write out the bit twiddling yourself every time and a function-call would be a lot of overhead for such a fast operation if it were not inline

1358287
google-checkout	payment-gateway
which payment-gateway should i choose from among authorize.net paypal google-checkout

1358329
crypto++	openssl

1358329
crypto++	openssl
i found the link above by searching google for these terms crypto++ rsa openssl

1358334
communication	messages
the best would be to use amf action messages format to communication to the flex application

1358341
any	set
weirdperson has significantly less data associated with it than any individual and i really don t want to set practically every field in individual to null for a weirdperson.

1358345
rollback	commit
our project use spring which provide out-of-the-box support for closing all hibernate sessions and the associated transactional with an additional feature for commit rollback

1358390
restart	exit
here is the code i have tried but it just exit and does not restart the .app

1358391
comma	words
make sure that the words in the texts you are going to index are separated with ascii separators spaces comma etc

1358413
insertion-sort	shellsort
in the latter case you don t because for the small cases the shellsort and insertion-sort will both outperform it

1358413
quicksort	shellsort
some of the best performing sorting routines i ve seen are hybrids quicksort that use a shellsort for small sections of the arrays

1358422
windows-vista	windows
i found out an application i wrote does not work properly under windows-vista 7 if uac is enabled at any level because it writes files to the install directory of the program default to c program files myprogram. if uac is disabled or on any other versioning of windows it works properly - i read that uac denies applications write access to the program files directory by default

1358442
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms

1358444
shell	bash
is there a way to do this with bash or any other commonly-available nix shell

1358447
put	get
i thought maybe by setting the default namespace properties in the project s application properties i could get the compiler to implicit put all pages into the specified namespace but this appears not to be the case

1358478
declarative	imperative
activities that you create from the activity types can be designed in a declarative fashion using xaml and donâ t allow for any imperative code

1358508
perl	c++
i find it odd that c++ doesn t allow for this as perl and some psuedo languages i m thinking in particular of autoit do

1358551
google-code	bitbucket
there are plenty of options for sharing your source code on the web depending on what versioning systemd you re most comfortable with you might have a look at such well know sites as google-code bitbucket github and many other

1358561
strncpy	strcpy
you wouldn t handle say char this way where you want the set to strncpy or strcpy the data

1358645
authentication	login
you can rather force the user to login using j2ee security .when they want to use a basket and then only store the jsession containers default id on the client browser user does t need to be authentication inorder to create a session

1358662
primitive	int
.net we have primitive datatypes like int and value-type like struct

1358678
mocking	stubs
.when the function returns something i use the mocking framework to create stubs

1358691
gethashcode	equals
value-type are derived from system.valuetype which among other things gives a default but slow implementation of gethashcode and equals

1358696
radio-button	textbox
one radio-button has a textbox and the other one doesn t

1358696
textbox	button
the radio button are named knowsnumberofpoeple and the textbox is named numberofpeople

radio-button	textbox
it just toggle the second radio-button the one without a textbox

1358719
packaging	building
we ve been having a numbers of problems using vsewss from the command-line to do building and packaging of all of our project

1358793
sql-server	oracle
is there any way i can get a similar behavior to sql-server s clustered index in oracle

1358826
font-size	width	letter-spacing	font-size
the calculation relies heavily on font-size letter-spacing and the width of textitem

1358833
base	zero
from what you ve describe a lighting application for a broad user base there is zero reason not to use boost

1358833
header-only	boost
the boost-any libs is like much of boost header-only and is simply compiled into your executable

1358847
extends	sealed
.so the problem with mocking httpresponse is that it s sealed .so you cant extends it and most mocking frameworks that mock concrete classes just overwrite virtual methods

1358849
contact	submit
i added a drop down to a php contact form which popup in a jquery it seems to work just fine with firefox but does not submit .when using ie

1358881

the original image is saved either as png or tiff to avoid quality loss due by saving and converted into the final types as the very last step

1358884
search-engine	seo
the option to use flash ajax and other technologies that are not considered to be search-engine friendly have come up numerous time in our meetings and each time we have to evaluate what kind of impact it would have on us from an seo perspective

double	int
since you didn t specify a types the compiler assumes int just as it assumes double .when you don t specify a types for 2.5

1358897
directory-structure	subdirectories
my current development basically has a libs directory-structure grouping classes into subdirectories by operation

1358919
configuration-files	xml-configuration
that said if it s acceptable to you to have some intermediary step which is what trippy was alluding to if i ve understood correctly you can have a single source xml-configuration file that you will then process via xslt or otherwise to derive 2 separate configuration-files from that will be then read by your applications

1358938
32-bit	64bit
the solution was to install a 32-bit jvm and tell eclipse to use it instead of the 64bit one

1358939
binaries	install
at present we always have to manually kick off a building on a shared mac that has the adhoc certificates install on the box and then .post the resulting test binaries some place where testers can pull them down and install them

1358945
asp.net-mvc	webforms
seeing that your view is actually a console application not a webforms application which was my original assumption i think that asp.net-mvc might actually be a better fit for your needs

1358945
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
mvp is a good solution for getting around the deficiencies of asp.net webforms but it is not as powerful or successful at helping separate concerns as asp.net-mvc is

1358963
anjuta	gnome
anjuta gnome ide

1358970
32-bit	64bit
in any mainstream compiler the emulation of 64bit int on a 32-bit platform will be about as efficient as doing the mutli-step math yourself

1358976
void	main
i tried putting static void main in a form within a class library-project and commented it out from program.cs

1358989
void	main
the static void main methods has to be within the exe assembly but you could have this methods make a call to your shared assembly s versioning of main

1358990
attributes	properties
the size of a textarea can be specified by the cols and rows attributes although it can be better controlled through the css height and width properties

1358991
dictionary	arrays
it s very likely that the frame drop is not because of using a hash list dictionary instead of an arrays

1359003
cairo	sdl
i m wondering if you will use sdl cairo or what

1359013
void	main
static void main doesn t make sense in a class-library however your snippet of code should do exactly what you want if placed in program.cs

1359022

1359022
fieldset	labels
fieldset h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 i ins kbd labels legend li object p pre q

1359039
radio-button	checkbox
if you re checked to see if a checkbox radio-button is checked use

1359039
radio-button	selected
shouldn t you just be reading a value from numberofpeople then selected the appropriate radio-button that way

1359042
keydown	keyup
you could bind to the keydown keyup events on the form and then look at the srcelement or target to find out which input was actually modified

1359046

1359137
credentials	security
the authorizationcontext would be created after authentication takes place - and this wouldn t happen every time the service is called because the client is connecting on a nettcpbinding on the same proxy with each call and i thought with the same open socket on the transport using transport security with windows credentials with a service session instances

1359141
any	set
since your tags don t have any dimension set the images need to load before your scripting can accurately detection their dimension

1359164
value	field
handscore would be a calculated field run off of a table or scalar value function

1359164
selection	overlap
by separating out those bits you avoid a great deal of the duplication but you will still have to worry about card selection and overlap

1359168
malloc	free
if the memory is allocated by new or malloc and free by delete or free the libs must provide some cleanup function to deal with this

1359168
malloc	free
the second function can return a string allocated by malloc or delete but the memory is not free automatically

1359173

1359246
spaces	output
works on named with spaces only output one numbers

1359255
background-image	width
i m rather new to jquery and i m trying to make a cool little menu effect where .when the user hovers over a elements #nav li it will animate to a larger width which will reveal the full background-image

1359255
subtract	add
.so basically i d like the variables chgwidth to return the width of the currently hovered #nav and then i would plug that variables into the animate except i would add 30px for instances or on the hover off i would subtract 30px

1359261
vba	vb6
most common error made by vb programmers in vb6 and vba

1359266
firefox	safari
i need to be able to send the content-type text xml to firefox and safari to allow them to rendering inline svg in one of my pages

1359270
innodb	myisam
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam

1359270
innodb	myisam
that said with innodb you wouldn t need to re-order the table but you would lose the blazing speed of myisam

1359287
slimdx	xna
i would checkout slimdx a much thinner directx wrapper than xna or wpf

1359292
contains	any
the repeater itself cannot tell you which control is selected because the item templates you specify could contains any combinations of controls and there might not be a way to specify one as selected

1359304
any	set
the problem i m having is that there doesn t appear to be any way to set a timeout on the call

1359314
void	main
public static void main string arguments

web-config	app-config
you don t use a web-config with a windows service you use app-config this gets move into the deployment directory .when you compile and rename to .config

1359336
attributes	properties
is there a way to prevent castle-windsor from automatically injecting dependencies into properties besides the donotwire attributes

1359356
children	nodes
however you can set the jtree s rootvisible properties to false and then the first level children will be show as top level nodes

1359385
spring	jsf
start boning up on spring jsf hibernate etc

1359399
32-bit	64bit
for decades the gold standards was a remarkably simple algorithm keep state x multiplying by constants a 32x32 64bit then add constants b then return the low 32-bit which also become the new x

1359401
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	heap
i believe code should be read like a story and .so it makes perfect sense to me that a grouping of cars and i don t care if its implements as an arrays a linked-list a heap set or whatever is named cars

1359412
any	set
consider the requirement to find a matched pair of set of characters and remove any characters between them as well as those characters delimiters

so...i basically want to be able to examine a list of object get the printingable properties based on the value of an attributes and printing the value for the printingable properties

1359484
attributes	properties
is there a more concise way to get a list of the properties that have the printme attributes then iterate through the list and act upon those properties

1359485
put	get
i have put captcha on my blog i still get spammers is there a scripting somewhere which allows them to do this or do they do this by hand

1359505
perl	php
and dean edwards s javascript packer has been ported to php perl .net and wsh .so if you re using any of those technologies you could actually have it running on your own server

1359507
safari	opera
i d guess safari and opera also support this properties

1359518
php-gettext	gettext
the zend-framework has a gettext zend_translate adaptor that doesn t required the php-gettext extention

1359565
contains	elements
that s because floated elements no longer stretch their contains elements

mochiweb and yaws both use gen_servers to bind to the listening ports and then spawn an unsupervised process to handle a new connection

1359575
revision	svn
we ve built one of the latest svn revision 2.2b with some customizations on leopard and just move over the site-packages folder

1359580
postgresql	mysql
if you are requiring activerecord you need some sort of activerecord adaptor drivers install or the gem corresponding to the db postgresql mysql sqlite-ruby as well as a connection set up to connect to said db

1359586
webforms	asp.net
since you used the term postback i assume you are using asp.net webforms

1359589
put	get
and .when you get to your spiffy new senior asp.net positioning your company won t put undo pressure on you because you don t have the knowledge coming in that they expected from a senior developer

1359618
expression	evaluation
could you give the order of n the complexity of a typical methods and the ratio of expression usually evaluation to true

1359623
revision	svn
it would be very helpful to include the svn revision numbers and messages in that email .so if the building break we know which revision to review

1359623
put	get
but i don t know how or if there is a way to get that revision s messages the messages put in by the commiter

1359640
protected	public
in php all public and protected functions are virtual

1359640
subclassing	base-class
in the design of the base-class i would think of behavior that subclassing would want to affect

1359640
subclassing	base-class
maybe an is_valid function which always returns true in the base-class and use the commentblock to describe what the consequences are .when a subclassing return false

1359665
firefox	safari
behavior definitely occurs in safari 3 + 4 and does not occur in firefox 3 or 4

1359669
asp.net-mvc	webforms	implements	final
edit as a final comment if you restart with a new project a chat is definitely much easier to implements in asp.net-asp.net-mvc than webforms as asp.net-mvc is in many ways easier to work with ajax call and updates

1359675
any	set
why is prev set to null and hence i can t access any of its value

1359680
vb.net	vba
i have been programming 10 years mostly in vba and vb.net but i know c# well enough to program what i normally do

1359690
directory	folder
where file is the protocols mynet is the server and folder image.jpg is the directory location under the shared

1359694
ruby	php
how do i pass php arrays s to ruby scripting as an arguments .so that ruby scripting can read php s arrays

1359697

i m new to jsf and el and was wondering if there is a way to use el to get the current value of an h inputtext field

1359749
digits	zero
i encrypted it by writing a program that took a string converted all the characters to the ascii code padded with zero as necessary to get a three digits numbers and then added a random digits to the beginning and the end of the 3 digits code

1359759
arrays	loops
if you want to read into an arrays just write a loops

1359769
spring	grails
grails is essentially a thin layer on top of the spring which many consider to be a very scalability framework in the enterprise world

1359769
groovy	java
if you run into performance bottlenecks in groovy you can always rewrite those parts in java

1359769
memcached	ehcache
that said there are some good caching solutions for grails apps ehcache memcached etc

1359770
value	field
nicolas correctly notes that this delimiter is also used for other composite field value including.

webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m adding some asp.net-mvc pages to an existing asp.net webforms project

1359786
data-members	private
or perhaps a hybrid where you throw an exception-handling that has a list of error object as a private data-members and an access methods that lets you iterate over the errors

1359788
order	join
on a simple query this cannot happen as any estimate for a seek or range seek will be lower than the one for a scan no matter how off the statistics are but on a complex query with join and filtering on multiple tables things are more complex and the plan may include a scan where a seek was expected because the query optimizer may choose plan on which the join evaluation order is reversed to what the observers expects

1359793
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
my question is almost the same but not the same because i would like to do this on windows using 7zip command-line or something similar inside a batch-file or ruby perl python scripting

1359822
firefox	opera
firefox uses w3c standards nodes textcontent but its behavior differs slightly from that of mshtml s proprietary innertext copy-paste by opera as well some time ago among dozens of other mshtml features

1359826
abstract-class	base-class
my idea was take all of those methods some are abstract from the base-class and plug them into a nested abstract-class within the base-class like this

1359834
any	set
if you only need to set text content and not retrieve here s a trivial dom versioning you can use on any browser

1359837
macros	basic
here s a basic loops that boxes each character actually each token .so it won t work if there are macros within that take arguments

nested	assign
i d like to be able to have multiple identical foo divs apart from the nested div s actual content of course and all i need to do is assign the contains div the foo class inorder to cause the contains anchor to show the contains div onclientclick

1359847
directory	folder
put them in folder in your project directory then add the top-level folder s to your project

1359848
nested-class	inherited	implements	abstract
simply making the nested-class abstract isn t enough to required that the inherited class actually implements them as you don t actually reference that class anywhere

1359848
instances	private
.net nested classes are similar to nested static-classes in java in that they have no reference to a specific instances of the contains class they re simply grouping for lack of a better term by the outer class and have access to the private protected and internal members of the contains class

1359848
nested-class	inherited	nested-class	base-class	base-class	inherited
while it isn t possible to absolutely enforce that every class that inherited from base-class provide a distinct implementation of the pdfoperations class this is enforced from a practical perspective because any class that inherited from pdfoperations will have to be a protected nested-class of the class that inherited from base-class

1359848
base-class	inherited
in pdfone and pdftwo there is an instances variables called instances that represents a reference to the contains object that inherited from base-class

1359856
gethashcode	tostring
ok to be clear what s confusing me is that i m starting with the assumption that even though int derives from system.valuetype that in turn derives from system.object because it contains tostring gethashcode etc

1359875
double	int	primitive	int
2 the bigdecimal consists of an arbitrary-precision int unscaled value and a non-negative 32-bit int scale while the double wrap a value of the primitive types double in an object

1359905
constructor	object
this is fairly simple since bigdecimal provides constructor to take in primitive value and string object

1359911
configuration	environment
it s the exact same process for all environment test demo prod except for a single configuration project that encapsulates versioning difference connection strings

1359911
configuration	environment
remember the only difference between each environment is one configuration project

1359921
linux	osx
why does the javac process keep running out-of-memory on osx .when the same code ant scripting works fine on linux

1359931
rad-controls	telerik
anyone know of a way to speed up the visual-studio ide .when you have telerik rad-controls either windows or web and jetbrains resharper install

1359951
ruby	php
i have a php scripting that execute this ruby scripting .when a user click a link

1359973
sql-server	mysql	multi-query	mysql
the vulnerable code has since been identified and is being corrected but it got me wondering about some of the difference between how mysql and sql-server process multi-query strings

1359973
sql-server	mysql
the vulnerable code is used on several dozen website two of which are are running on sql-server while the rest are on mysql

1359973
sql-server	mysql
testing this further i was able to verify that the mysql odbc 3.51 drivers will not allow two sql queries to be execute in the same statement .when an adodb.connection object call execute while sql-server native client 10.1 doesn t have any problem running two side-by-side queries

1359973
sql-server	mysql
is this in fact just a configuration of the provider that makes sql-server vulnerable in this fashion while mysql is not or does this stemming from somewhere else

1359977
required	checked
generator a particular types of messages load it into the systemd wait a few seconds then checked the required destination to ensure that the messages was forwarded correctly

1359991
.when	ready
rea.son #2 there are ways to target .net 2.0 using visual-studio 2008 and vs 2010 .so you can gain from the productivity goodies of those tools without abandoning .net 2.0 then move to .net 2+ .when you re ready

1360014
ready	live
cloud via azure or even live mesh computing is the next wave .so you ll probably want to be ready for network connect by knowing wcf

1360021
fwrite	fread
the only difference is that on one side i m providing the read and write methods from linux syscalls and on the other side i m using fread fwrite

1360029
bmp	gif	tiff	bmp	tiff	gif
compare jpeg gif tiff bmp and other file-format

1360034
buffering	streaming
fwrite works on streaming which are buffering

1360034
buffering	streaming
therefore many small bufferinging will be faster because it won t run a costly systemd call until the buffering fills up or you fflush it or close the streaming

1360034
buffering	streaming
with a 1024 byte streaming buffering and writing 1 byte bufferinging you re looking at 1024 write call for each kilobyte rather than 1024 fwrite call turning into one write - see the difference

1360053
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
however you may wish to take advantage of some css3 styles such as box-shadow which will work in safari google-chrome and firefox

1360054
prerequisites	installshield
i then went in and edited the .net 3.5 service pack 1 web downloading redistributable using installshield s prerequisites editor

1360055
any	set
set properties any to the xmlelement and serialization it

1360057
value	field
given that users must be able to defined their own field on an object and defined allowed value for these field - on-the-fly no compile - how would you solve this without using eav

1360075
selected	checkbox
selected one of the checkbox dialog

1360075
selected	checkbox
selected a checkbox dialog

1360095
linux	osx
one thing you might want to examine is the family of random devices available on some unix-like oses like linux and mac osx

1360095
linux	osx
note that while mac osx uses a different methods for it s prng and therefore does not block my personal benchmarking done in college have show it to be every-so-slightly less random than the linux kernel

1360097
return-type	arguments
i am overrides bindinvokemember in the metaobject i can see all the arguments types but no return-type

1360126
contains	any
also note that reference assemblies do not have to contains any code

1360148
activation	account
it depends on what you want to do - one-shot things like account activation or allowing a file to be downloading could be done with a view which looks up a hash checked a timestamp and performs an action or provides a file

1360158
ruby	php
i have a large php arrays encode to json and passing it to a ruby scripting

1360158
double-quotes	single-quotes
it is confused by the numerous double-quotes and single-quotes in the arrays

1360172
linked-list	arrays
you could read them directly into a linked-list and then .when finished reading move them into an arrays and free up the linked-list

1360173
realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free
use malloc to make one realloc to change the size of one and free .when you re done with it

1360210
variables	boolean
a quick look at the code for matcher.java show a bunch of member variables including the text that is being matched arrays for grouping a few indexes for maintain location and a few boolean s for other state

1360216
subclassing	superclass
in c# you can only cast to classes in a class hierarchy superclass subclassing

1360216
subclassing	superclass
but is neither a superclass nor a subclassing of even though decimal implements comparator

1360227
blacklist	whitelist
this is likely a reply from the smtp server because the machine attempting to send email has not been whitelist or is blacklist for spam

1360232
sqldatasource	gridview
i have a gridview and sqldatasource as gridview s datasource

1360238
any	set
to my understanding settimeout 0 is exactly same as calling a function directly because you dont set any delay

1360246
integrated-security	connection-string
your connection-string is saying that the database is on the same server as the webserver signified by . and that the database is mssql express using a named instances signified by . express integrated-security true means that the account running your webserver s aspx pages should be used to try to access the database

1360268
communication	messages
the only exception-handling is web worker but they run in a different file and the only way to communication between them is using event listener .so while you can send a messages while the other is working it won t receive that messages until it is done or it manually checked for messagess

1360277
javascript	dom
therefore the next javascript block would recognize the dom changes which is quite possible in your case

1360285
silverlight	wpf
silverlight - scale back versioning of wpf for web-facing applications

1360290
xsd	xml
if you want to go to a machine-readable definition you can use xsd if it is an xml messages format

compact-framework	.net
is there a way and if .so what is the easiest way to implements the most common http methods using the .net compact-framework

1360314
put	get
specifically we are hoping to use get .post put and delete

1360324
.net	wcf
all new web service development should be done using wcf - which is not available until .net 3.0 and gets quite mature and stable at .net 3.5

32-bit	64bit
suppose i ask the user do you want to run in 32-bit mode or 64bit mode and they pick 32-bit

1360337
credentials	account	authentication	impersonation
if you read the msdn page about the asp.net-identity impersonation you will notice that if the elements does not include credentials asp.net will impersonate the token passed to it by iis which can be either the identity of the request authentication user or the anonymous internet user account iusr_machinename

1360343
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate linq-to-sql and the entity-framework come to mind for .net

1360352

i m trying to teach myself how to write android apps and i m having trouble registering a button click and taking actions based on which radio-button is selected at the time

1360360
ms-access	mysql
were this mssql or mysql i would probably create a view contains the composite data from both tables but unfortunately i m stuck in ms-access where such novel concepts do not exist.

1360387
32-bit	64bit
i work on a massive .net web application developed on 32-bit machines and deployed to a 64bit server farm

1360388
order	join
join order o on o.buyerid b.buyerid

1360395
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
putting the favicon in the root works in firefox and google-chrome but not in internet-explorer

1360400
vba	vb6
that s mainly a carryover from old-school vb6 because vba is .so closely related

1360404
textchanged	textbox
i am binding a textbox to a properties on an object and would like the properties to be updates on the textchanged event and not the default lost-focus event

operands order add eax ebx means add ebx to eax and store the result in eax

1360412
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
in a complex web .app with numerous non-ab.solutely essential features and animation is it worthwhile to start thinking about cordoning them off for say these sets of features should work in all browsers and these sets of features only in google-chrome and safari and these in firefox and google-chrome and safari and opera and .so on because enabling certain features in certain browsers would be too slow

1360420
selected	button
i have a jlist and a jbutton user can click an item in the jlist or they can click the button .when the button is click how do i de-select change the selected list item bgcolor to normals in other words nothing in the jlist will be selected after the button is click the item from the jlist

1360435
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox .when it comes to javascript - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with javascript turned on

1360436
updating	updates
since the user-interface updating takes time i minimize the updates on the faster browsers

1360442
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
if i want to use the canvas tag then i can add that in a different file since ie and firefox opera safari differ in how they create the canvas elements

1360451
32-bit	64bit
however there are couple of caveats .when developing on 32-bit machine and targeting 64bit around use of p invoke com-interop or registry access

1360451
32-bit	64bit
p invoke to a 32-bit dll will fail to load the dll on the 64bit target systemd while happily working on your 32-bit dev machine

1360451
32-bit	64bit
com-interop will fail with class not registered for 32-bit inproc object on the target 64bit machine

1360451
32-bit	64bit
32-bit out-of-proc object might work depending on how they are registered on the 64bit machine

1360451
32-bit	64bit
registry access to registry key for a 32-bit application will work on your dev machine but will write to a different place on the 64bit target systemd

1360451
32-bit	64bit
.when accessing directly memory be aware of the different addressing between 32-bit and 64bit always use 64bit pointers

1360453
key-value	key
i am doing multiple queries and i need to retrieve that primary key-value to use as a foreign key in another table

1360477
value	field
the reason i have the user field excluded is because it s not an editable value

1360494
buffering	streaming
if you write directly to the client output streaming and buffering all data on server first it may be a strain on the server

1360509
ruby-on-rails	django
jquery-claypool is a small fast railable asp.net-mvc framework built on jquery based on my experience with django ruby-on-rails spring etc

1360542
textbox	button
and is to be followed by a feedback page which has html like controls - radio button textbox and a submit button - we are still talking about the pdf here

1360561
data-members	instances
you can also just directly access with the appropriate locking of course your data-members if you started the thread using the instances form of the threadstart delegation

1360561
data-members	instances
you can use the attributes instancess attached to your class as a data storage but i fail to see how that is better than using static or instances data-members

1360562
elisp	lisp
i m trying to learn lisp elisp actually and i tried writing the following function as an exercise project euler problem 2

1360565
any	set
if you do have reliable sessions set to true you re most important settings are maxconcurrentsessions how many sessions clients can be connect at any given moment and maxconcurrentinstances how many instances of your service object can exist at any given time

1360574
web-services	security
for some guidance consult patterns practices improving web-services security guide

1360578
versioning	upgrade
major numbers change means that the new versioning is incompatible with the old one and any dependent of the prior versioning will required code changes to upgrade to the new package

1360578
revision	updates
revision numbers is updates whenever a bugfix is applied to the building such that it doesn t bring a compatibility change or introduce newer features

1360579
command-line	cmd
for normals say windows forms c# applications to execute cmd after a successful building i would use the building events- post-building event command-line in project properties

1360594
linux	unix	ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu the cvs clients does no conversions as the repository should be unix line-endings and linux also uses unix line-endings

1360594
linux	unix
is there a way to make cvs on linux convert any windows line-endings to unix line-endings on a commit to prevent this from happening

1360605
configuration	environment
a corollary to conway s law .applies here - your configuration files will resemble the variety of environment your .app is deployed to planned or actual

1360605
configuration	environment
if there different architectural concerns across different environment then i ll encapsulate those into one class and make that classname part of the configuration files -

1360621
lightbox	jquery
this jquery plugins called cycle is one of the nicest slideshows i ve seen that isn t a lightbox types

1360622

1360626
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
the menu is working fine in firefox opera safari ie8 but not in ie6

1360639
any	set
if you are using a positionable elements such as a div you should ensure the z-index styles is set to a value higher then any other elements

1360639
contains	elements
also because you don t know in advance anything about the page show in the iframe you would actually need to manually search for all elements contains a z-index styles

1360652
json	xml
serialization typically means writing the data as a string think xml json or as raw binary a etc

1360658
constructor	object
deserialization can be thought of a separate constructor for the object

1360668
sql-server	ms-access
is there any quick way to upload the data from table to table from ms-access to sql-server

1360670
python	c++
like many others have answered given some high level frame work it would be possible to use python has the scripting-language but at a minimum you d need some kind of graphics systemd written in another language like c++ to handle the graphics

1360675
subnet	ping
i used to ping a subnet like 192.168.1.0 24

1360675

ubuntu	linux
i only tested it on a fresh install of ubuntu 9.04 with openjdk 6 but i m quite sure i have seen similar issues before on linux

1360717
primitive	int
for primitive and those object like int which can be automagically mapped to them types promotion and the + operation is part of the language

1360752
hide	next
.when i click the next button the previous button should display and .when i go to the last slider the next button should hide

1360762
keyword	synonym
u can use the worldnet dictionary to the get the basic information of the question keyword like its past of speech extraction synonym u can also can do the same for your document to create the index for it

1360770
hash	md5
my first idea was to md5 the requestparameters and then write a caching file using the hash as filename

1360776
connection-pooling	pool
.when using simple jdbc however in the presence of connection-pooling as implements in application servers closing the connection has the semantic of return to pool and the connection pool will retain the connection s associations with your current transactional

1360777
callback	methods
you can either specify a callback methods in settimer or handle wm_timer messages

1360783
contains	set
despite contains the words test a lat is not a test in its own right but is rather a pre-defined set of such procedure

1360800
job-queue	queue
admin user can see all of the items in workflow in user-interface view job-queue current queue execute jobs exception-handling

1360806
priority-queue	heap
the jdk s priority-queue implementation is a balanced binary heap

1360806
priority-queue	heap
for example getting the top-10 over a million items will take half as long as using a binary heap priority-queue all other things being equals

1360829
code-duplication	code-generation
this can happen especially .when it s not just code-duplication for example if you have a recording of data with certain field that repeat itself in different places db table definition c++ class text-based input the usual way to reduce this duplication is with code-generation

1360830
subtract	time	mousedown	mouseup
you can use two global-variables to recording the time of mousedown and mouseup and have a subtract

1360870
contains	set
you need to set overflow hidden on your contains div and make sure it has at least one dimension that is fluid

1360870
contains	elements
by default overflow elements floated elements anything taken out of normals document flow overflow their contains blocks bounds overflow visible without affecting their parent containers

1360870
any	set	contains	elements	contains	any	contains	set
.when you set overflow to hidden you tell the box model to grow the contains div in any dimension that are not set to fixed size such that it fully contains its content elements

1360870
lookup	any
any browsers that support the css3 overflow provide additional capabilities that you can lookup on w3c.org

1360870
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
however it does seem to be preferred over the overflow fix for modern browsers opera firefox 3.x safari google-chrome ie8

1360886
onmousedown	onmouseup
.when onmousedown is fired you can hang an onmouseup event on windows

1360952
ip-address	hostname
as you said it lists username hostname and ip-address of users do you mean it ping the network and finds it

1360952
icmp	arp	subnet	ping
you can use arp icmp ping to know the hosts present on your network provided you enter the correct subnet information

1360967
versioning	upgrade
then you can use gem updates --system to upgrade to rubygems versioning 1.3.5

1360972
value	field
.so that if the value is selected only then assign it to field else leave it as it is null

1360979
textbox	button
.so for example if you have a panels with a numbers of button textbox etc in it

1360979
textbox	button
somewhere among those you have a user-controls which consists of a textbox and a button

1360981
authentication	login
conversely using an email as a login identifier has the advantage of external authentication via openid

1361003
superclass	inherited
inherited clone methods always has superclass as their return-type

1361028
python	c++
is there a way to transfer a new class instances python class that inherited c++ class into c++ with out having to hold on to the object return and just treat it as a c++ pointers

1361028
python	c++
pyinstances is the python class instances and m_pgamemode is a pointers to the c++ base-class of the same instances

1361028
python	c++
more info python object to native c++ pointers

1361029
required	checked
in some situations a clean up is required mid execution part of this is stopping all the threads i don t want them to stop immediately though i just set a variables that they checked for that terminate them

haskell	scala
given that it s impossible to see into the future what factors related to clojure scala or haskell are likely to determine whether one of them catches on

1361110
git-clone	git-pull
git-clone does not appear to allow for specifying a path and any other cmd that i found git-fetch git-pull seem to required an existing local git repository to work

1361119
malloc	free
you haven t malloc ed the memory block - the string is allocated in static storage - and later you try to free that memory block

1361119
malloc	free
you can only free blocks allocated with malloc otherwise you risk running into undefined behavior

1361119
malloc	free
you could either only put pointers to statically allocated strings into frag seq field and never free them or you could malloc memory for these strings and copy the strings into malloc ed blocks

1361126
strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy
you have to use strcpy or strncpy or memcpy depending on your religious perspective on the whole mess to copy the contents of one string into another

1361198
vba	vb6
phoenie i don t think there s anyway to look at the private class variables in vb6 vba once you have something in local scoping that hide it i had a good old google-search but nothing came up

1361219
linked-list	arrays
.when you re handling large byte arrays i suppose it is inefficient to use a linked-list to contains each byte

1361235
contains	any
.so you can make sure that your code is refactoring-proof because it does not contains any magic strings

1361263
versioning	upgrade
as i wrote in my answer i maintain two sets of scripting one set that can building the database from scratch and one that can upgrade a given database from one versioning to the last

1361263
versioning	upgrade
in a perfect world i should be able to perform an upgrade from versioning n-1 to versioning n of the database and compare the obtained schema to the schema of the previous database

1361270
authentication	login
.when a user is not authentication either because they are not logged in or do not have the required role they are redirected to the login page with a returnto url

1361288
version-control	git
i don t think any distribute version-control like mercury or git is going to work for you here

1361291
directory	folder
to fix the problem i have to delete the bin and .obj folder from the asp.net-mvc project directory which allows the solution to be opened again

1361295
checkbox	button
you can t put html controls in a pdf but you can add form field to a pdf which support button radio button checkbox textfield etc

now i want to access member variables of derived-class this variables is not present in the base-class using the pointers to base-class which points to a derived-class object

1361441
textbox	button
.can we add contents to xml through a textbox by pressing a button

1361448
derived-class	base-class
you can use dynamic_cast to cast the base-class pointers to the derived-class pointers and get the variables in the derived-class

1361493
contains	any
problem is file1 and file2 can contains any possible characters including regexp special symbols

1361517
attributes	properties
it will depend on how your attributes is used if it is on a class properties methods etc...

1361517
attributes	properties
if it is only used on properties as your example then you could nest an additional foreach statement that will enumerate all properties for a given types and look for the attributes

1361528
telnet	ssh
use ssh instead of telnet and make use of public private key for authentication

1361547
value	field
and now for direct answer one way to checked if the value for the field has changed is to fetch original data from database before saving instances

1361552
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
jquery generally works with konqueror and firefox 1.0.x but there may be some unexpected bugs since we do not test them as regularly as firefox 2.0+ ie6+ opera 9+ and safari 3+

1361562
variables	boolean
concerned with setting resetting testing boolean numeric state variables and or timers

1361567
overwrite	import
import the themes s css file and overwrite the classes you are interested in with your own css

1361569
unmanaged	c++-cli
if you re porting c++ code to c# then you should perhaps consider converting the unmanaged c++ code to c++-cli

1361569
unmanaged	c++-cli
an alternative to converting to c++-cli would be to wrap your existing unmanaged c++ code using swig however the migration will be made more difficult using this methods

1361570
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
i am using and working on software which uses mysql as a backend engine it can use others such as postgresql or oracle or sqlite but this is the main application we are using

1361570
hash	md5
the software was design in such way that the binary-data we want to access is kept as blobs in individual columns each table has one blob column other columns have int floats to characterize the blob and one string column with the blob s md5 hash

1361571
enterprise	platform
jboss enterprise application platform 4.3 however does not have a jms directory in this location

1361575

.when you are ready to delete it you can simply decrement the reference count and python will clean it up for you

1361579
contains	set
one set of lists contains an overview on how much someone earns

1361583
implements	extends
iqueryable extends ienumerable and is intended to be implements by linq providers

1361583
ienumerator	ienumerable
a types implements ienumerable basically declare that i can give you an iterator object via the getenumerator interface methods exposing an ienumerator interface which you can use to access the current elements in the collections and movenext to move to the next elements in the list

1361584
union-all	union
if you want to join two similar tables you can use union or union-all

1361584
union-all	union
union its like a join command.when using the union-all the selected columns need to be of the same datatype.only distinct-values are selected

1361590
enumerator	any
it just represents a enumerator sequences of elements without any methods for manipulating the sequences

1361601

1361649
constructor	object
the constructor will be called for you .when you create an object .so this should work

1361680
null-terminated	c-strings
line 2 is checked to see if the current character is the null terminator of the string - since c-strings are null-terminated and the null-character is considered a false value it will begin unrolling the recursion .when it hits the end of the string instead of trying to call strreverse4 on the character after the null terminator which would be beyond the bounds of the valid data

1361735
children	nodes
the value for a certain nodes is the sum of the value of its children

1361735
textbox	button
the textblock textbox and button are definedd in a hierarchical templates and i can t defined a click-handler in that templates

1361735
textbox	button
very well am i able to do trv.itemcontainergenerator.getcontainerfromitem item and as justin angel showed i can very well change the font-size but didn t find any way to access the textbox or button

1361742
arrays	map
i want to pull a list of coordinates from a database into an arrays before display them on a map

1361749
dependency-injection	singleton
if you want to use static instances it s better to use some dependency-injection tool and set component s lifestyle to singleton

1361783
checkbox	button
next i put a checkbox and a button on the

1361791
value	field
this isn t quite what i expect from an inherited points of view is there some way to get the field to be created whereby meta.verbose_name refers to the value on the non-abstract model class not the abstract one on which the field was defined

1361796
triggers	insert
that triggers should insert the row being updates to a log table which is nearly the same as the original table

1361798
shell	bash
is there a way to do cmd substitution in bash shell without breaking output into multiple arguments

1361810
multithreading	wait
exactly hashtable is synchronized that mean that it s safe to use it in multithreading environment many thread access the same hashtable if two thread try to updates the hashtable at the sametime one of them will have to wait that the other thread finish his updates

1361814
derived-class	base-class
the only case-.when base-class need to call methods or to use variables of derived-class is curiously recurring templates pattern .when it implements static polymorphism

1361826
instrumentation	profiling
the irony is that instrumentation is not required to do profiling coverage analysis as .net has an api for this

1361838
getter	setter
it is silly to write a test for every setter every getter and .so on

1361840
value	field
.when i display the detail recording i want to add a summary indicating the numbers of recording which have their boolean value set to true for each of the four boolean field

1361858
sql-server	oracle
index organized tables are the concept of oracle which is near to clustered indexes in sql-server

1361858
sql-server	oracle
imho the concept of clustered index is bound to sql-server data storage and there is no need to rebuild this behavior in oracle

1361886
selected	checkbox
basic-authentication is enabled checkbox is selected

1361894
triggers	insert
the simplest way in the db is to insert now in the beginning of the triggers and insert now at the end

1361908
32-bit	16-bit
could it be that the program is 16-bit and that vs 2008 compiles it into a 32-bit program

1361911
complex-numbers	matrix
even if you stay within the realm of decidability there exists no algorithm that can take arbitrary statements p x and q x and compute a statement r x equivalent to p x q x for all x where x can range over any domain int strings matrix real numbers complex-numbers logical statements whoops back into undecidable territory

1361919
arrays	loops
if you want a more sophisticated definition of â œmatchingâ than looking for an equals string you ll need to loops on the arrays yourself and perform your desired test on each object in the arrays one at a time

1361919
arrays	loops
if you want case-insensitive or locale-aware comparisons you ll need to loops on the arrays yourself and use one of nsstring s other comparison methods

1361927
radio-button	selected
the problem is that .when user click on a radio-button in a grouping and then selected another radio-button in that grouping the new value will be add to this i want to only add one of the value to the total value

1361942
selected	button
selected add as link from the drop down box next to the add button

1361944

oracle-adf	jsf
whereas microsoft has currently unvieled asp.net-mvc 2 and oracle seems to have oracle-adf which is based on java and jsf but provides darg and drop functionality

1361961
rollback	commit
an explicit rollback is probably more appropriate .when you encounter a conditional that is not causing an exception-handling but you still don t want to commit

1361964
connection-pooling	pool
on the other hand if you re using connection-pooling .when you close the connection the pool manager intercepts it and will probably hopefully rollback the connection and leave the connection open

1361964
rollback	commit
it generally doesn t hurt to do an unnecessary rollback after a commit

1361985
interpreter	runtime
in c++ you can t use the compiler at runtime but you can embed an interpreter in your project like cint

1361989
value	field
thus if a recording is added you store table x insert new recording with these value ... with modifications just store the table field and changed value

1361992
arguments	default
yes i know that s not a realistic example but variations do happen in real code especially .when none is used to indicate a default function arguments

1361997
contains	elements
the problem is that the divs al.so contains span and br elements .so simply looking for those elements and using the .remove methods doesn t work

1362016
checkbox	button
and here is a case if you want to highlight all controls button checkbox choice and edit if horizontal manager is focused

1362023
codedom	.net
in c# you can create a .net codedom tree and then compile this using the .net compiler

1362025
any	set
obvious downside is that if the recording size is in any way significant the size of the page sent to the browser will be of proportionate size - and the user might not actually care about the full recording set

1362039
firefox	safari
this seems to work in ie6 ie7 windows firefox 3.x and safari os x

1362326
sql-server	oracle
some customers use direct connect to connect to databases stored on oracle or ms sql-server

1362335
selected	listbox
.when i selected multiple items in a listbox how can i display them

1362337
click	mouse
if you have too many table cell setting the click handler would be heavy but you can make a workaround to calculate the box numbers from mouse click s event.page.x and event.page.y this will give coordinatesof click pixels on your screens and you can calculate which box is under that pixels

1362340
specifications	w3c
according to rfc 2965 which is referenced by the w3c specifications the leading

1362342
worksheet	excel
in excel workbook project how could we detection if the filtering on some worksheet are updates

1362357
constructor	object
the constructor is called because you re creating an object

1362374
selected	listbox
first you need to set the selectedionmode properties on your listbox to either selectedionmode.multisimple or selectedionmode.multiextended .so that you can selected multiple items

1362374
selected	listbox
within this event handler accessing the selecteditems collections of your listbox will provide you with access to a collections of all the selected object

1362374
selected	textbox
here s an example event handler that display the selected items in a textbox called textbox1

1362375
arrays	loops
then on the relevant pages i would execute a database query then loops through the result create an arrays of these object based on the data from the query

python	ruby	python	java
i don t mind about the language but i d prefer something java python or ruby or anything else free and crossplatform

1362392
value	field
.when the page loads there is no value in the field

1362392
value	field
i know i could use the value attributes and set it in the declaration but that only allows me to put a static date in the field not a dynamic date

1362404
click	mouse
i can paste data to it using my mouse right click - paste but the shortcut ctrl + v does nothing

while-loop	loops
i have a while-loop that loops through each row and spits out the user data

1362444
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie7 and google-chrome browsers and one friend tested on firefox 3.0 and it worked

1362452
hash	md5
store the results into a session a good idea would be to create a hash of that data using md5 then using that caching the session per multiple users

1362454

1362552
callback	methods
in cases where the delegation is less of an event and more of a callback i tend to use public methods to do this and keep the public delegation from being exposed directly

1362572
attributes	properties
because the text properties does always returns a non-encoded string simply changing the text properties attributes did not do the job

1362576
.when	ready
.when you re ready to take on objective-c cocoa is my girlfriend is a great introductory resource

1362584
getter	setter
sometimes a lot of helpers classes is a symptom of an anemic model if are related to classes that mainly have setter getter in those scenarios helperss grows up from behavior that isn t correctly assign to domain object

1362586
integration	payment
the default architecture that magento payment modules use involves the customer integration with the module and the module talking to your payment-gateway behind the scenes

1362605

ive used windowshosts to hosts a webbrowser-control and that has allowed me to access the webbrowsers document dom directly t read html content via mouse click on html document elements and also to invokes on submit forms

1362605
click	mouse
but my question is has any one done this and is it possible once you get the dom to do invokes to submit contect to html forms and also get html elements via mouse click events

1362616
silverlight	wpf
i am wondering why i cannot get this to work .when i try and load them in as classes i get a parsing error i can do this fine in wpf but not in silverlight 3.0 what can you do to have to have xaml work as object rather than resources

1362616
silverlight	wpf	panels	grid
where preview is a grid within a scrollview which is where i want the xaml to be loaded into ie the canvas there a various versioning of canvas i want to load into this preview panels each one is a class as xaml in wpf but cannot seem to get this to work in silverlight 3.0 without the parsing error tried user-controls but this has the same problem

i have a wcf service that uses the .net system.addins framework to load assemblies into a seperate process and .app domain

1362646
constructor	object
then .when the object definition is encountered the constructor is called

1362654
literals	hardcode
however unless you have a good reason for using hardcode string literals you should probably consider using resource-files rather than literals for most strings

1362657
selection	highlight
there are ways to highlight other than setting the background-color and i d recommend you explore them because it can be confusing to users to have different background-colors for different reasons selection versus highlight

1362674
synchronous	.when
the problem is .when user wishes to load a new state for _thinker may be from file or some other menu action i cannot synchronous two states of _thinker

1362704
keyboard	mouse
of course without any use of keyboard mouse hardcode workarounds

1362710

use introspector.getbeaninfo to get the propertiesdescriptor and use those to invoke the getter and checked the properties value using equals

1362755
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade it to the latest versioning 1.03 via cpan

1362757
autodesk	revit
i am thus left to conclude that the error i am getting is related to one of the line i commented out the scoping added to the engine contains an object i have little control over - a reference to a plugins hosts this software is intended to run in autodesk revit architecture 2010

1362757
serialization	marshalling
i have whittled the problem down to passing an object via the scoping that does cannot be proxy to the other appdomain all object added to the scoping of an ironpython interpreter running in a different appdomain will have to be marshalling somehow and must thus either extends marshalbyrefobject or be serialization

1362762
gethashcode	equals
two rows will only be joined .when gethashcode of left and right are the same and equals returns true

1362766
execution	restart
not exactly a best practice but why don t you mark with a bool use mutexes if neccesary that the state has changed during execution and if .so just restart the thread in automove don t provide any feedback

1362787
configuration-management	build-server
if you have more than a handful of referenced solution items follow petter s advice and set up a build-server with associated configuration-management devoted to third party dependencies etc

1362794
duplicates	contains
the grandparent.parents collections contains 4 items 2 of which are duplicates

1362803
any	set
you set the max length in the skins file as you would normally and then any textbox that uses that max length would use the skins

1362842
32-bit	64bit
if you need an hash that is only 32-bit or 64bit long that is if you need an hash of the types used in computer science terms such as hashtable and not an hash in the cryptography meaning which can t be that short and strong at the same time you can use crc32 or one of its friend

1362851
any	set
in your case there are a couple of problems i normally recommend the arm instruction set to start with there are more arm based product shipped today than any other x86 computers include

1362851
any	set
no matter what platform any platform worth using has data sheets or programmers reference manual free from the vendor that include the instruction set as well as the encoding of the opcodes the bits and bytes of the machine language

1362851
cross-compiling	binutils
if not mingw32 plus msys is an excellent platform for generator a cross-compiling from binutils and gcc sources generally pretty easy

1362851
llvm	gcc
i recommend llvm and gcc with binutils neither produce great code but they are multi platform and multi target and both have optimizers

1362853
value	field
set up your workflow to wait for a value in a certain field to change

1362879
continuous-integration	build-server
do you have a continuous-integration server like a build-server but runs unit tests

1362883
gethashcode	equals
using a key in a dictionary is a matter of overrides gethashcode and equals

1362890
contains	elements
basically i don t want to compare elements but elements that thy contains

1362894
hide	show
with this methods you can then return true or false depending on whether you want to show hide the button

1362894
hide	show
i want to show hide the button later on how do i get the callback to triggers

1362903
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1362903
any	set
anyone has any idea whether this could be possible because of stricter policies which might have been set on any folder

1362908
unicode	ucs
the specifications defined unicodeâ s character set the universal character set ucs and some encoding to encode that characters the unicode transformation formats utf-7 utf-8 utf-16 and utf-32

1362917

i am using databound datagridview controls to display tabular data read from a web service

1362964
splitter	panels
add splitter bars to allow the panels to be resize

1362981
javascript	dom
since web browsers will rendering the content differently your only option to find out the real width of the content is to use javascript to traversal the dom elements and measure the width

1362995
variables	boolean
stoprecording does two things set a boolean variables to false to prevent dosomething from adding more stuff and then copying the list to return a copy of the data to the caller

1363001
selected	button
in revision selected revision and enter a range that include the deletion 1000-1001 or use the browse button to selected them

1363007
order	add
the order in which you add views to stack affects the order that they will display in .when you dismiss them

1363019
silverlight	wpf
it has to be a silverlight 3.0 solution as some wpf features are not present such as dynamicresource which is what i m used to using

1363025
user-interface	look-and-feel
from the user-interface screenshot it appears to use a web part and take on the sharepoint look-and-feel

1363034
dictionary	arrays
the technique you are after is memoization caching the results of execution keyed off the arguments passed in to the function in an arrays or dictionary

1363040
webserver	nginx
the front-end webserver is nginx .so maybe that is where i should be looking

1363051
variables	boolean
yes setting a boolean variables is atomicity but that doesn t make it thread-safe

1363052
button	popup
if the required textfield is filled in i want the submit button to work as normals aka call the onclientclick function but if it s not filled in i want a dialogue windows modal popup to show up stating that they need to fill in the specific field

1363054
gethashcode	equals
types t basically has to be dealt with as an object using only the lowest common denominator of operations available to everything assignment gethashcode equals

1363067
execute	prepare
prepare statement is just a parsing and precompile sql statement which just wait for the bound variables to be provided to be execute

1363067
execute	prepare
any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsing optimized compiled and then execute

1363071
getter-setter	setter	getter-setter	getter	getter	setter
in java defining getter-setter instead of defining public member variables does not result in performance degradation as the jit inline the getter setter

1363091
short	zero
since the value of myduration is likely to be short you can use the technique ire_and_curses show which will often yield zero as its result which would be less than the 1 you are testing for note that your log messages says 6 seconds though

1363100
countif	sumifs
edit i also recommend that you google advanced excel functions like sumproduct sumifs and countif

1363111
any	set
i learn how to set that variables in my mds simulator and i learn that this is not a production solution because any end users will have to have their bes or mds admin change the setting there

1363117
benchmarking	profiling
i guess it doesn t really matter but i tend to think that .when gather information about what will run in production it is best to test exactly what will go to production this goes for analysis profiling benchmarking etc.

nsmutablestring	nsstring
since nsmutablestring is a subclassing of nsstring you may have been given a mutable string at assignment .so other code may modify the string s value without your knowledge unless you are using key-value observing to observe those changes

1363119
nsstring	nsdata
for this reason it is usually appropriate to use copy semantics for properties that you intend to hold an immutable value nsstring nsdata nsarray nsset are the common--though not exaustive--suspects

1363128
listobject	excel
i am trying to save a listobject from a .net 3.5 excel 2007 vsto workbook to a new sheet done and save that new sheet to a new workbook done without that workbook requiring the vsto customization file

1363147
protected	public
the only additional access that making it public would provide would be to allow instances of the class to be declare as variables in scoping that cannot access its protected members but instances of abstract-class cannot be declare at all

1363156

i ve replace min max average stdev small percentile skew kurtosis and a few more

1363198
contains	any
the class provides a methods called containsvalue object value which checked if the guava contains the specified value for any key

1363214
protected	public
my opinion would be that the public constructor might be seen to be confusing and as you say making it protected would be correct

1363219
defined	declare
be careful though to explicit declare defined your protected private copy-constructor

1363252
scriptmanager	updatepanel
i have a weird scenario i need to use the ajax scriptmanager and updatepanel on two specific asp.net 2.0 pages

1363290

i know wpf is based on directx direct3d even for simple controls but i cannot find any reference on the topic which provides a good overview of borderline scenarios

1363318
decimal-point	digits
if the numberss are monospaced javascript could be used to adjust the padding on the cell in ems depending on the numbers of digits before the decimal-point

1363325
google-chrome	safari
i have tested it for ie safari and google-chrome revealing no errors

1363338

1363383
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
more or less what happened to perl python ruby and some other languages

1363416
contains	set
only if none of the above are true then the pwdlastset value contains the date .when the passwd was last set to which you can add the maxpasswdage from the domain policy and this will give you the date .when the user s passwd is going to expire

1363422
amazon-cloudfront	amazon-s3
i just started using the amazon-s3 and amazon-cloudfront

1363446
boost	stl
it will probably make you able to do more in less time than with c++ stl qt boost

1363463
arrays	map
using map will create an new arrays of the same size filled with none

1363471
println	output
you might get more interesting results if you added a println at the beginning of each invocation of run and maybe even added a counter to the test object that gets increment each time a new one is created and which is output with the finalize messages

1363492
bazaar	cvs
note that i said a vcs .so it can be svn cvs bazaar .

1363509
vb.net	vb6	vb.net	vba	vba	vb6
i m reasonably familiar with the various forms of vb that existed prior to .net vb6 vba vbscript... but have yet to delve into the sweet new flavor that is vb.net

vb.net	vb6	vb.net	vba	vbscript	vb6	vbscript	basic	vbscript	vb.net	vbscript	vba	vba	vb6	basic	vba	basic	vb6
what you can do is contrast with vb.net with vba or vb6 or vbscript or some other variant of visual basic

1363528
directx	gdi
additionally on modern hardware 2d gdi or gdi+ can be about as fast as 2d opengl or directx

knapsack-problem	bin-packing
this is a bin-packing problem or a multi-dimensional knapsack-problem

1363597
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you are familiar with php i d recommend using asp.net-mvc over webforms but from the sound of what you are saying you ve already started down the road of webforms

1363597
value	field
in your javascript function you can then change the value of the hidden field before submission

1363597
webforms	asp.net
although having said that you are better off redesigning the page to work better with asp.net webforms

1363623
virtual-machine	virtualbox
you can use a virtual-machine like sun virtualbox install sql compact 3 or 3.1 on it and convert your database inside it

1363632
associations	fields-for
fields_for repeat the enclosed fields-for every image in the associations

1363640
expression	evaluation
you can also selected an expression and inspect the value of it s evaluation using the inspect menu option

duplicates	contains
this is to handle the possibility that the triples userguid sessionguid date may contains duplicates for a given userguid date

1363665
cos	sin
you can change cos to sin

1363665
cos	sin
dont forget that sin and cos are periodic

1363677
ms-access	mysql
then you could treat mysql tables as if it were part of ms-access

1363697
abstract-class	pure-virtual
abstract-class can never be directly initializer because of the pure-virtual methods it declare

1363727
csv	xml
option to generator data in xml excel html csv or sql

1363733
contains	any
a user could also have a privileges of event administration in which case privileges.cs would not contains any additional properties for events because in our application an event administration can manage all events

base-class	inherited
i would like to have a role base-class that has properties for activedate and deactivedate that each role like applicationadministratorrole can inherited from .so that every role is forced to have these properties

1363747
font-size	height	font-size	width
this will allow you to measure the width and height of your text taking into account font-size etc

1363776
decrement	increment
according to the explanations i have read the first two s should increment depth twice then the first should decrement it once

1363783
value	field
what i do know is this query which gives all instances of the custom field description the value of test if the field is null

1363796
mstest	nunit
without integration of nunit one of us has resharper while the other does not we are leaning toward mstest

1363805
mta	sta
the main issue is that the designer was created for use in visual-studio which runs in everything in an mta thread whereas asp.net uses sta threads

1363805
mta	sta
just create a new mta thread execute the code and wait for it to be finished in the main asp.net sta thread and you are good to go

1363817
double	int
it looks like there is a shared lock that is used .whenever is called .when formatting an int and presumably double

1363819
environment	building
everybody i know or i talked with either use the fully fledged visual-studio environment or they use the compiler libs from the free sdk and some editor on top of it codewarrior codeinsight etc and rely on some variant of make to building

1363845
boolean	int
i could have overloads for all the different underlying types they re all dates int boolean and decimal but i wanted to see if i could get the generics versioning working

1363850
checkbox	button
depending on what sort of back-end is handling your form after it s submitted some people named radio button and checkbox with a after their named to make them convert nicely to arrays in the form handling systemd

1363873
mbunit	nunit
it include mbunit but its runner can run tests from other frameworks like nunit xunit.net etc

1363880
wordpress	phpbb
or if your site will be hosting an install of wordpress or phpbb there are ways of leveraging those technologies authentication modules to sign in to other pages of a site

1363881
msbuild	nant	mstest	nunit
see msbuild nant nunit mstest and frustration not written by me

1363881
msbuild	nant
msbuild seems like a poorly-done copy of nant we use both and mstest likewise looks like microsoft s usual not invented here answer to open source

1363900
order	add	order	join
now the rest of the report can probably be done in any order although i prefer to work through the parts that should have one-one relationshisps first .so next i ll add the join and the field that will get me all the sales rep as.sociated information

1363904
directory	folder
.so if i put all the pdfs of the job descriptions in a folder called .. jobops with the php file located in root directory what would i need to do

1363911
dictionary	arrays
to deserialize step through each item in the key-value arrays and add them back to your dictionary

1363927
tail	eof
the -f option to tail tells it to wait for more data .when it hits eof

1363949
directory	folder
to do this create a folder in the same directory as your scripting called whatever you like populate it with at least one image .so that the following if doesn t unset the entire arrays and see if that works

1363951
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup events

1363960
boolean	int

the problem is it s not getting .posted to during the .post that jqgrid makes to the controllers for the editurl

1363990
exception-handling	try-catch
i have it wrapped in a try-catch but no exception-handling appears to be throw

1364001
postback	ajax
purely a guess because there s not code enough to tell but i would say that your ajax function is being triggers by an event that would ordinarily cause the form to postback to the server

1364001
postback	ajax
if this is the case then the ajax call is being made but before the success handler can be invoked the page unloads as a result-of the postback

1364017
any	set
.so if the modelerror.errormessage properties is-empty which i verified that it is .when trying to set a non-integer value to a declare int asp.net-mvc goes on to checked the modelstate which we already discovered is null thus null is returned for any exception-handling modelerror

1364038
key-value	key
fire up regedit find in key the key-value of under

1364050
double-quotes	single-quotes
as mark mentioned if you have double-quotes around your string inside the string should only be single-quotes

1364082
any	set
i think i implements it correctly but i still got a stack-trace just at main -- his explanation wasn t terribly clear and i d prefer not to mess with the codebase wrap existing set of functionality in another methods any more than necessary

1364084
sql-server	mysql
aha -- i see in sql-server timestamp is a synonym for rowversion which is sort of like mysql s auto_increment except it generator a new monotonically increasing value on updates as well as on insert

1364084
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
nor does mysql support a sequences object like oracle or postgresql or ibm db2

1364096
callback	methods
inside the callback methods

1364115
user-interface	splash-screen
i have been doing some reading up on threading and have learned that the splash-screen should be spawned in its own thread and feed status updates using delegation to cater for cross-thread updates to the user-interface from the main thread and that this should all be done in the program.cs main subroutine

1364116
invokerequired	begininvoke
however .when combined with the invokerequired properties or the invoke begininvoke methods it is bad

1364128
output	mode
from another page i came across mentions the output pegging out at 2.37g .so it appears they use the 2g mode or the lis302 that only supports 2g

1364148
put	get
if we can get that to work we can start thinking about where we really want to put the else statements at a later date

1364181
hide	show
why not just show and hide it on the users request

1364182
postdata	request
if it does validation you can then use libcurl to send the data to your 3rd party processor forming each variables properly in the postdata in your request

1364206
unique	words
split it by and then for each words in the value put it into a div with a unique id.

1364217
parentheses	keyword	parentheses	let	expression	evaluation
this also has a connection with set and let language keyword and expression evaluation especially parentheses

1364248
assign	add
as a person s employment situation changes you can assign stop termination dates to the old recording and add new recording for new jobs

1364250
revision	updates
of course many website do provide nightly tarballs but that has nothing much to do with the specific versionig systemd they re using anyways and more with some crontab scripting they have laying around and those could be easily be done for monotone-hosted project as well even in realtime using server-side hooks such as the one that updates monotone website itself as soon as a new revision is upload

1364286
dependency-injection	inject
the idea behind dependency-injection is as the named states to inject dependencies

1364291
python	java
i am familiar with java and python but i m not sure how to make them be able to know where the button is and how to read text without unnecessary image-recognition

1364307
python	java
basically write a java .app or python for that matter that does http post to the survey pages inorder and uses regex s to find the next page etc and then use a stack to keep tracking of the history

1364313
web-testing	selenium
selenium - it is primarily a web-testing framework but it would be easy to scripting it from java to auto-submit forms

fadein	show
it will fadein and fade out based on the numbers of milliseconds you specify in the static show methods

1364370
ruby-on-rails	grails

1364379
javascript	dom
where is it in the dom or how would i calculate it using javascript

1364387

an hour later i realized that the rate and the code field whose value is xx must not be divided by an end

1364460
graphics2d	java-2d
to employ java-2d api features in the application cast the graphics object passed into a componentâ s rendering methods to a graphics2d object

1364461

yet at the same time i am not sure how to do this business-logic since either way i still have to pass in the value to insert-into the create methods even if it is null a1 is a nullable field

1364466
json	xml
with whatever server-side stuff you re using set up some kind of switching that determines whether a particular request is for html or for whatever your flash movie consumes xml json another swf whatever

1364470
arguments	default
as default they are case-sensitive but most of them if not all including indexof has an overload that takes a string-comparison arguments

1364470
ignore-case	indexof
as the string-comparison arguments to indexof it will as the named implies ignore-case difference

1364484
getter	setter
because the .net properties wrapper are bypassed by wpf at runtime one should not include logic in the getter and setter

1364494
expression	brackets
the expression in your lookbehind is only required to match an angle brackets .so it only looks as far back as the latest one

1364502
environment	restart
is it a restart in the new environment issue or will it manage to detection the changes automatically

1364506
carbon	cocoa
i know hitoolbox is not 64bit but i suspect the menu api must still be given that the cocoa menus are still based on the carbon menus

1364516
openoffice.org	uno
i am working on java-api which interacts with openoffice.org swriter through uno

1364522
sql-server	mysql
i know that there is a sql-server client for php in beta and i wonder whether it would be hard to change the database provider to points to sql-server instead of mysql

1364528
sql-server	mysql
i know that there is a sql-server client for php in beta and i wonder whether it would be hard to change the database provider to points to sql-server instead of mysql

1364530

i work on a jscript vbscript html application .so we can execute at higher privileges than a normals webpage and we re providing the capability to downloading a file and need to provide feedback on the downloading progress to our users

1364530
progress-bar	progress
naturally i figured a progress-bar or progress text based on the total file size and the amount of the file already downloading

1364550
floating	padding
the text itself becomes smaller but it seems to have a bunch of padding around it and is floating now

1364563
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to new versioning of no-script and still had problem

1364569
traversal	parent
since offsettop and offsetleft give you relative positioning value you can get the absolute value by traversal up the tree of offsetparent s aggregation the offsettop and offsetleft value of each parent elements

subclassing	superclass
also the subclassing don t need to have the generator function in them if i need that again i can just call the code generator from the superclass

1364647
postgresql	firebird	postgresql	mysql	firebird	mysql
i don t like mysql licence firebird and postgresql are better

1364651
negative-number	difference
there will be a huge difference if the counter starts with a negative-number

1364666
postgresql	mysql
drupal core only officially supports mysql and postgresql as database providers for drupal 6 with work being done to support sqlite for drupal 7

1364703
double-quotes	single-quotes
which allows only within matching double-quotes you could similarly expand it to allow single-quotes

1364726
contains	any
defined an interface for iloggable and an abstract-base-class contains any common code

1364726
base-class	inherited
then defined a screensloggable class that writes to the screens it should inherited from your base-class and contains the variant of the code that writes to the screens

1364726
base-class	inherited
it also should inherited from your base-class but contains the variant that writes to a file

1364739
background-position	background-image
not positive but it sounds like u can just assign the background-image and use the background-position properties to show the appropriate image during hover and non-hover state

1364742
fadein	hide
append the item get the new height hide the new list item animate to the new height and then fadein the new list item

1364762
32-bit	64bit
this is for the same compatibility reasons that system32 contains 64bit binaries while syswow64 contains 32-bit binaries

1364763
credentials	security
my wcf service uses a custom credentials validation for custom message-based security because i want to ensure each client calling an operation on my web service has a corresponding username and passwd in my database

1364770
inherited	accessor
but obviously this only works if you have a level of control over your object necessry to make them inherited from the domain-object and it wouldnt involve 30 years of drugery to rewrite all your properties accessor

1364779
sql-server	ms-access
the ms-access database uses pass-through queries via dsn-less odbc to connect to sql-server

1364779
profiling	trace
we ran a trace on the server using profiling and this showed up ms-access trying to execute the following cmd prior to stored proc execution

1364801
show	next
both these methods seems to work fine at first but if i put my application next to windows task manager my application always show about twice as much as the task manager does

1364802
reflection	runtime
from what i understand you are trying to do i would consider using reflection to dynamically examine a class at runtime and generator output based on that

1364828
contains	any
that may make more sense if your version-control contains tests that you re revising building your codebase to attain your tests lead your code - not by any means an unusual situation

1364833
malloc	free
you should get a few linker errors about undefined malloc and free and .so on

1364840
google-chrome	firefox

1364847
webforms	asp.net
you can use asp.net webforms

1364853
revision	svn
.when for some stupid reason svn can t merge the revision and flags the file as a conflict show me the conflicts

1364853
revision	svn
it s no use to me if svn just dump 2 files to disk one of my current revision and another of trunk

1364875
any	set	base-class	inherited	environment	building	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	base-class
you could deploy this check-and-redirect-if-needed or other behavior alteration of your choice in any of various ways decorator wsgi middleware inherited from an intermediate base-class of yours that subclassing web.app.requesthandler or whatever other base handler class you re currently using and methods named different than get and .post in your .application-level handler classes and others yet but i think that the key idea here is that os.environ is set by the .app engine framework according to cgi standards and .so you can rely on those standards similarly wsgi building its own environment based on the value it pick up from os.environ

1364887
callback	methods
since it seems you re only using the success callback of .post you could use the ..post methods which is a bit easier on the eyes

1364887
updating	updates
i d also be checked the output of the php scripting to make sure that whatever you are updating actually is updates just echo xml from php and you ll see it on your console.log

1364893
any	set
any controls that you have will be accessible by their id and any value set on them in the code-behind

1364894
messagebox	alert
i think it is easily done by replacing the messagebox alert in the example page with a call to form-submit

1364895
administration	integrated
in my current project a custom cms written in django our solution for i18n model is based on this example snippet which i extended to be more usable in templates and integrated within the administration interface

i have a handler which is al.so in the faces-config as a separate managed-bean .when the user click a button control goes to handler class which call a service that populate field in the pojo infobean .so as i can see it should appear but it does not

1364921
log4net	nlog
.so can you not use log4net or nlog and push to a wcf service

1364923
callback	methods
how do you provide a callback methods to an opaque object with weakref semantics

1364925
put	get
since the only way for data to get into your sandbox is for you to put it there most apps have intrinsics knowledge about the data of any file they can read

1364929
data-members	private
then you have a getter that returns a reference to that private data-members

1364939
contains	elements
i want clients to submit envelope schema contains multiple document elements via wcf

1364945
xsd	xml
i am looking for a way to take a xpath for an instances xml file and use it to find the xsd elements

1364952

1364978
postgresql	firebird	postgresql	ingres	postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	firebird	oracle	firebird	mysql	firebird	ingres	oracle	mysql	sql-server	firebird	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql	sql-server	ingres	ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql
it gets us much closer to making applications truly db-agnostic - you can swap out the sql-server provider for mysql postgresql oracle firebird sqlite ingres - and all the linq-expressions stay exactly the same

1364983
specifications	w3c
there s no such requirement in w3c specifications rather obviously because they do not cover any kinds of language binding

1364999
expression-blend	wpf
you can use expression-blend to extraction the the default tabcontrol templates in wpf

1365003
grouping	sorting
one contains culture-invariant data the code s internal id for sure the code itself if the code was culture-invariant and possibly other columns like sorting grouping category

1365017

1366454
callback	methods
execution could unwind back past the methods which invoked the callback and thus prevent it from ever later signals the wait handle

1366454
.when	ready
this makes sense because if iscompleted is false you would expect the call to endinvoke to block and the whole points of the wait handle as with the callback is to know .when the result is ready and it won t block

1366668
constructor	object
however if foo int int is the only constructor on foo then you can simply assert the types of the returned ifoo object

1366668
constructor	object
if there is more than one constructor then you d have to checked some external state of the returned object

1366721
radio-button	selected	value	field
choose custom filtering in the filtering types dropdownlistfor selected search and replace radio-button and then set two request uri field with the corresponding value

1366734
restart	reload
i assume this means that the log configuration is loaded .when the myclass is loaded and is therefore set in stone until the myclass is either reload or the jvm restart

1366770
grouping	sorting
this site show the various sorting algorithms using four grouping

1366770
grouping	sorting
in addition to the four grouping in norman s answer you want to checked the sorting algorithms with collections of numbers that have a few similarities in the numbers

1366774
configuration	logging
as far as i know none of the usual logging implementation log4j java.util.logging allow you to reload a configuration file in a running application regardless of whether the actuall logger s are declare as static-variables

1366774
configuration	logging
is it just the changing of levels you care about or do you wish to provide completely different logging configuration files logger definitions on-the-fly

1366783
configuration	logging
generally it might be difficult to reconfigurationure your logging subsystem if you are relying on configuration files that are available via the classpath

1366792
configuration	logging
no the log configuration is loaded typically .when the logging implementation classes are initializer

1366792
configuration	logging
.when your class is reload all that happens is that the logging api is called to get a logger which may or may not be present in any configuration and stored as a class variables

1366792
configuration	logging
to reload your logging configuration then you typically would have to get the logging implementation to reload

1366806
protected	public
derived can be only classes sou you can create a myusercontrolbase class which can create some common-controls output and provide it by protected public properties to derived-class myweatherusercontrol for example which can common-controls output modify

1366813
recording	playing
if you re specifically interested in playing audio i d recommend converting the audio into a sound recording and playing back that audio using the pbxbuildfailuresound default for xcode

1366819
compact-framework	.net
i am trying out to get the bitmap of webpage loaded in web browser control but found that webbrowser.creategraphics and even wm_print drawtobitmap messages response is also missing in .net compact-framework

1366830
subclassing	base-class
you could overrides the rendering methods in the base-class to give you custom renderinging and then the subclassing could work with that

1366905
children	nodes	children	tree
the requirements are to dynamically insert and delete nodes copy-paste nodes find information buried in nodes copy-paste of folder and their children from one area of the tree to another

1366908
subclassing	superclass
another warning even if there were a conversion from subclassing to superclass it would incur slicing of the subclassing object since you provide the arguments by value

1366935
selected	checkbox
livevalidation scripting is great to validation forms but how you re suppose to do with grouping of checkbox radio and selected

1366984
mersenne-twister	generator
how can random numbers that are distribute according to the zipf distribution by using a u 0 1 random generator the mersenne-twister

1366999
value	field
the problem is simple the dataset provider produces quoted value for money field which are not accepted for those sql servers

1367043
value	field
we store these details by pretty simply taking the value from the recurrence definition and persistent them to the db one field to one column

1367063
textbox	button
at the start you have a blank textbox to enter the 4 numbers with an add button link image and the same for delete

1367063
textbox	button
.when you click add 4 textbox and delete button are created at the end of the list and the add button is move from where it was to beside the blank answer

1367063
textbox	button
once you enter the 4 numbers 4 textbox and a delete button are automatically created at the end of the list

1367079
versioning	upgrade
try to upgrade your rxtx libs to the latest versioning

1367087
sql-server	oracle
what are the top reasons apart from database independence that most it project today seem to ignore the wealth of features that exist in modern database engines such as oracle 11g and sql-server 2008

1367094
selected	button
i must be missing something but why not use a selected statement dropdownlistfor or radio button

1367094
textarea	textbox
multiline textbox textarea

1367094
textbox	button
one textbox a add button and a bit of javascript

1367117
low-level	hardware
basically low-level embedded is very different from general pc programming only at the hardware specific level

1367117
pointers	stack
therefore this piece of startup code will defined stack pointers and heap pointers and such

1367132
linux	unix
i wrote a article about dumping stack in c++ with windows and unix linux at ddj some years ago

1367136
python	php	python	java
generally have worse tooling monitor and debugging capabilities than php c# java python etc

1367136
oracle	mysql
i ve frequently used materialize views and sometimes used connect by in oracle neither of which i believe exist in mysql

1367148
required	checked
part of the test required me to issue 3 cmd on 0 5 10 15 20 and 30 minutes to checked stablility

1367154
order	join
we are using nhibernate in our application and using hql we join these two tables order by showorder of first table and second table respectively

1367162
put	get
you have to put some text into the hidden textfield because textchanged will only get called if the text actually changed

1367186
any	set
this will ensure only one set of checked cmd is execute at any one time and if the two were to clash one of the two would just be delayed until the next time the event was raised

1367189
python	perl	python	java
does anyone knows some tools either in java or python or perl which accomplishes the task

1367197
python	php	python	java
as other posters have noted the question mark is part of the url specifications and an html get form will produce urls in that form -- that doesn t matter whether your server is written in java python php or anything else

1367206
selected	checkbox
i remember .when i used to develop windows apps a checkbox could also have a null not selected state i m not sure if there is any alternative for the web

1367207
groovy	java
see this question this applies to groovy as well as java and it doesn t look like there s a way to do what you want with out using libs that aren t part of the core java or groovy language

1367238
checkbox	textbox	value	field
both options are substantially inferior to edit-in-place in the table by using an editable grid or replacing your table with an arrays of appropriate controls textbox combo boxes checkbox etc. that are populate with the field value for the appropriate set of recording

1367238
selected	button
users change field directly in the table and selected a save button or menu item to updates all changed recording at once

1367242
any	set
the security reason is that if it were allowed to be set you could arbitrarily upload any file from the users computer which would be bad

1367243
margins	padding
if you can t a simple way is using divs a wrapper with width margins same with both box model and another inside with border-width and padding

1367255
shell	bash
i m working on porting bash scripting to sus posix-compliant shell

1367282
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the code is working fine in firefox and internet-explorer but it is not woking in google-chrome browser

1367296

the file can be placed in some temporary location on server and after the postback display a labels indicating that the file is already selected and provide a remove button

1367318
sql-server	oracle
you are trying to run an sql-server code in oracle

1367328
vb.net	vb6
i have a large project where we have 2-3 dll project that are converted from vb6 to vb.net

1367345
slimdx	xna
there are already several wrapper libs exposing opengl or directx to .net such as slimdx which as the named implies is a much thinner more light-weight wrapper than something like xna

1367355
contains	set
maybe i can make a mapping for foogrouping that uses a custom hql sql query to selected the distinct grouping named and another custom query to selected the appropriate set of contains items

1367360
oracle	mysql
i ve even had to figure out how to disable oracle s transactional consistency to deal with long-running queries on an oltp that would ve been no problem in mysql

1367361
base-class	inherited
that being said what you could do is have all the layout inherited their codebase from a common base-class inheriteding from page and inject the google-code centrally from here

1367364
firebird	mysql
i agree that firebird can be better than sqlite and m sql express or even is better than mysql scale better with the numbers of cpus and is more mature triggers and transactional are implements for many many lighting years ago

1367367
selected	button
you could potentially do it with two radio button per option yes true and no false with neither selecteded by default - this would allow a user to leave them blank and ignore them or selected one of the options

1367367
selected	button
the only real issue with this is how to reset them back to nothing once the user s selected one - which would either need a clear all button which would reset all the choices or you re back to a list with three options - either a radio or drop-down

1367380
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade macports to 1.8 removed all previously install ports and reinstall them in 1.8 which i assume would have install a 64bit versioning of the ports including freeimage

1367383
contains	any
- the table that will contains these images will not contains any other information but its key

1367395
contains	elements
i work with a windowedapplication show below which holds a view called masterview that contains all different lay-out elements

1367416
firefox	opera
this standards applies to ie firefox opera browsers

1367416
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
but the above code only works in safari and in ie and firefox and opera it will become 1020px overall width

1367438
openpgp	pkcs#7
it depends if you re talking about raw encrypted data in that case you can use methods such as listed by gs in the other answer or an encrypted file in some standards format the most common are cms pkcs#7 and openpgp

1367456
code-coverage	gcov	environment	building
will gcov show code-coverage if i have arm assembly source files in my building environment

1367456
code-coverage	gcov	environment	building
if my building environment has some x86 assembly source files then will gcov show code-coverage data

1367474
nsdata	nsurl
resulting in boilerplate code to just to decide if i should open the image with nsdata datawithcontentsoffile or nsdata datawithcontentsofurl sadly you can t create an nsurl from a local file named

1367484
export	report
i am export data to excel and try to save to a folder which is in my application...but the excel is saving defaultly in c document but i wanted to save in e apllication report

1367488
2checkout	payment
i am using drupal with uber cart and the standards 2checkout payment module

1367502
plugins	add-on
if you re using resharper there s a free add-on for it called agent smith plugins

1367504
arrays	loops
is there built-in methods that would do this or do i always have to manually create a new arrays and then fill it up with a foreach loops

1367509
perl	awk
awk is the tool of choice for column-based data some prefer perl but not me

1367532
contains	any
you need only to do this within a dynamic view any dynamic view the activity will contains a list of extended pathnames meaning you will be able to access and copy each versioning through that myfile main mybranch myversioning path

1367533
headless-browser	htmlunit
however i still think that this will be the way the headless-browser tests will go and apart from the immature webrat culerity interface you could probably create some decent test suite based on celerity htmlunit

1367579
margins	padding
i guess under the w3c box model a box having a width of 100px with 2px padding on each side a 3px border and 7px margins on each side will have a visible width of 114px

1367588
contains	lookup
you can then use a image lookup table within your dbase within which each recording contains a relative or absolute-path to the image files within the filesystems

1367612
selected	button
after selected the field and click on the search button i have to generator a long get request for the database which is located on a different server than my page and uses rest receive the response xml format extraction the search results and publishing them on the page

1367612
value	field
where x1-xn are the value for the search-engine and have to be read from the page s field .so it has to be generator dynamically

1367632
constructor	object
it would be easy if those were functions in my code - i would insert a macros that would obtain the current function named and time of call start and pass those to a local object constructor then on function exit the object would be destroy and trace the necessary data

1367636
windows-vista	windows
to clarify -- this is only a problem on windows-vista or windows 7 using desktop composition

1367644
configuration	logging
actually if you are using java.util.logging logging directly then you can reload the logger configuration on-the-fly

1367644
configuration	logging
this reload the default logging properties and reinitializes the logging configuration

1367644
configuration	logging
this loads the logging properties from a streaming in properties file-format and reinitializes the logging configuration

1367645
jquery	.post
if you want to .post to the server use jquery s ajax get .post methods s

1367649
perl	c++
but .so far all of my research pointed me to the conclusion that the latter is just plain out impossible in c++ i .so miss perl now that i m forced to do c++

1367649
perl	c++
heck i can easily write that perl scripting being much more of a perl expert than a c++ one - i just can t get bigwigs in software engineering at my bigcompany to buy into using it

1367649
constructor	object
the solution must not be limited to create an object from a db table constructor

1367677
iframe	popup
you could generator a request to the other page in an iframe or try and do it in a self closing popup windows - but that has other issues like popup blockers flicker windowss etc

1367702
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
a proper user-interface solution is to have a selected whose contents are dynamically populate based on a search field - either typed text think google s new search-box or browser s address bar or sometimes checkbox radio button

1367708
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i ve got the jquery validation plugins working beautifully in firefox opera safari and ie8

1367710
javascript	dom
not sure what your use case is but i m not assuming you re not manipulating the dom or else you d be using javascript

1367711
keydown	keyup
put another way keydown + keyup keypress

1367720
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter key do raise the keydown and keyup events

1367735
margins	padding
i ve tried it but there s always some weird padding margins or fonts issues in some browser

1367741
keydown	keyup
depending on the typing delay settings there can be multiple keydown and keypress events but only one keyup event

1367746
keydown	keyup
the keydown event happened once before the first d appeared on the screens the keypress event happened 6 time and the keyup event happened after the last d appeared on the screens

1367767
attributes	properties
i have another class - parameter - it has a properties of iscollection a bool i would like the iscollection attributes to be serialization only .when it is set to true is this possible

1367775
keydown	keyup
keypress is a higher level of abstraction than keydown and keyup

1367775
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup are hardware related the actual action of a key on the keyboard

1367784
system.web	wcf
is your configuration aligned iis web-config system.web and wcf

1367791
jquery	.post
in jquery i .post the login credentials via ajax

1367798
postdata	request
after inspector the raw postdata at the soap server end my php soap-client is making request like this

1367805
instances	private
give b a private instances of a for example

1367829
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my team and i are about to start a project and we would really like to use asp.net-mvc not the webforms

1367829
webforms	asp.net
with asp.net webforms and it s loadcontrol methods it s simple

1367836
value	field
that aside i have been noticing that i can run a query on table a and field b will have a value of 1

1367836
value	field
if i went into sql tools or oracle developer and changed field b to a value of 2 subsonic s loadbykey functions still returns an object with field b having a value of 1

1367865
keydown	keyup
notice that keypress occurs in between keydown and keyup not after keyup as many of the other answers have stated that keypress is not called .when a character isn t generator and that keydown is repeated while the key is held down also contrary to many of the other answers

1367865
keydown	keyup
for the curious keydown roughly correlates to wm_keydown keypress to wm_char and keyup to wm_keyup

1367870
tapestry	wicket
tapestry 5 has many similarities with wicket and works very well with scala

1367879
redgate	ssms
for this kind of work i tend to use ssms to generator a basic scripting pimp it a bit run it carefully then use a comparison tool such as redgate compare to generator a safer versioning

1367883
constructor	object
in debugging in second call c 3 you can see that within a constructor self.props is already equals to and .when b constructor is called after that it becomes for both object

1367894
databound	gridview
i have a gridview which is databound to an xml datasource

1367905
linux	unix
if you happen to work under unix linux use

1367910
python	c++
.so in c++ you might say you expect a duck but in python you really want .something that goes quack

1367910
python	java
but then you re just writing java in python and as someone who tried that once let me tell you its very counter-productive

1367927
arguments	default
and in python default arguments value are only evaluated once

1367933
hide	show
the function you call should assess if the field is valid and show hide the hidden textbox accordingly

1367938
arguments	default
the function definition is evaluated exactly once .so every time you call it the same default arguments is used

1367942
callback	methods
you callback methods audioqueuecallback will then be called whenever the audioqueue needs more data

1367957
continuous-integration	teamcity
we ve just started to use teamcity as a continuous-integration server

1367959
background-image	background-size	background-image	height
the css3 background-size properties will allow you to specify a percentage for a background-image s height but until it s widely supported there s no way to do this directly

1367962
mouseleave	mouseenter
it s supposed to have an effect on hover - i turn border on on mouseenter and off again at mouseleave

1367972
sql-server	oracle
i think that in oracle it s possible to achieve this but maybe not in sql-server

1367977
spritebatch	xna
in c# i saw already the spritebatch class in the xna plugins for xbox games

1368007
mouseleave	mouseenter
first focus enter and leave are different events than mouseenter and mouseleave

1368007
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave deals with where the mouse is right now

1368009
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
then what you should do is make sure your application uses a uinavigationcontroller and have each uiviewcontroller that needs a toolbar set it s toolbaritems properties to an nsarray with the uibarbuttonitem object you need

1368013
publishing	release
the most obvious would be to publishing an artifact from the release building that is basically a text file with the building numbers in it and retrieve that from your building scripting

1368051
tclientdataset	bde
i m using absolute database for this but most things that work with the bde or tclientdataset will work with absolute

1368082
put	get
i put the delegation which i would not consider class definitions at the bottom of that file outside of the local namespace and the program didn t get the missingmanifestresourceexception anymore

1368084
having	union
is there any workaround .so i can actually do .something like this without having to repeat the entire expression or force a union or temporary table

1368087
value	field
create a temp table customerid search field value

1368088
.war	jar
thus .when ask maven2 to building my .war the my-.lib jar is added in the web-inf .lib directory of the web application

1368095
arrays	loops
you will have to convert the string to a arrays using encoding.unicode.getbytes string then loops through that arrays and prepend a and u character to all unicode characters you find

1368101
directory	folder
i mean the flex or air will receive the input on what the folder and file named will be and .when i press create it should create a directory structure.

1368139
expression-blend	silverlight
expression-blend is used for designing the user-interface of your silverlight project

1368154
put	get
if you put a breakpoints or an alert on the value of totalprice after it s been assign what do you get

1368170
cross-join	inner-join
these will result in an identical query plan but the inner-join outer-join cross-join keyword are prefered because they add clarity to the code

1368181
python	java
i want to mimic a python functionality in java

1368189
filtering	grouping
the would have the regex put the search filtering stringbuilder into a regex grouping

1368192
hash	md5
you could have an external javascript file which takes an md5 hash of your login javascript and send an ajax request to the server to verify that it is correct and up-to-date

1368195
rollback	commit
if you don t commit then any changes you make are rollback

1368195
rollback	commit
other systemd provide a mode where you are in auto-commit until you run an explicit begin work statement whereupon of course you are in a transactional until the corresponding commit or rollback

1368195
rollback	commit
i have been caught out by mode ansi databases not committing sufficiently often to make sure that i commit .when it matters but the software i use not oracle still rollback uncommitted work rather than silently committing it for you - and i would be unhappy if it was changed to work otherwise

1368197
value	field
named the form field named and system.web.mvc.viewdatadictionary key used to lookup the value

1368207
http	ssl
in most cases you can basically configure your httperver to use ssl and change your http request to http

1368231
loading	gif
what i want to know is is it possible to change the cursor to a custom loading animation such as a simple spinner gif

1368233
click	mouse
now .when user click with mouse inside the control in a place below the last line the caret is move into the second div elements as it s the closest one to the points where the user click

1368233
click	mouse
i want to move the pointers to the end of the first div on the mouse click

1368233
click	mouse
the problem is that no matter where i intercept the event prehandleevent posthandleevent or posteditoreventnotify the caret positioning is eventually reverted to the default one on single click but it is not reverted if i hold the left mouse button pressed for a while or if i click with right mouse button

1368245
extends	super
he describe the mnemonic pecs which stands for producer extends consumer super

1368247
duplicates	elements
.when i run the report on my whole project i get lots of duplicates columns because i have elements with the same unqualified named in different package

1368253
margins	padding
i ve checked margins and padding and they don t seem to be the problem

1368262
firefox	safari
this already works in safari 4 and will also work in firefox 3.6

1368262
any	set
other than this and for browsers that don t support any of these your best bet is to follow the suggestion given by ceejayoz thinker and donut before me don t vertically repeat the gradient image and set the background to that of the end of the gradient

1368273
textarea	textbox
for example chinese text gb2312 is paste into a textbox or textarea of a html page and the form is posted

1368273
any	set
at the server side is there any means by which this character set gets detected

1368277

markov-chains	research
i have tried googling for research papers on random walk and markov-chains as that is my best guesses about where to look but .so far have found no scenarios similar enough

1368311
contains	set
i am having a stored proc which return 2 recording and which contains a selected statement from a temp table .so .when i used this stored proc inside a oledb .source in ssis and just trying to insert the set of recording into a destination sql table using oledb destination

1368320
basic	vb6
here s some more info on the terrible mishmash that is vb6 s implementation of unicode a free chapter from michael kaplan s excellent book internationalization with visual basic

1368325
value	field
one thing you could do to avoid sql-injection since you know it s only four parameters is use a stored procedure where you pass value for the field or null

1368340
directory	folder
the problem is globbing again works fine in the root directory where this scripting is located but .when i points it to a specific folder it returns 0 files found

1368363
order	join
could you not just do a simple join and order by dateadd and grab only the first recording

1368372
low-level	hardware
i have seen tools in the past that are able to detection failing sectors and other kinds of trouble on conventional mechanical hard drive but i fear that flash-memory does not have the same kind of predictable low-level access to the hardware due to the internal workings of the storage

1368378
value	field
in the oncalcfields event handler set its value to the value of the lookup field

1368383
object-reference	instances
i m trying to access a forms control from a class file in the app_code directory but i keep getting the messages object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

1368412
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	java
to add a slightly prosaic spin on to the answers already given the reason we use rest service where i am is that if you know you can hand a business partner a url and know they will receive in return a nicely laid out slab of xml no matter whether they re working in .net x.x php python java ruby or god-knows-what it severely reduces headaches

1368419
httpwebrequest	webrequest
.when i try to submit the exact same xml using c# webrequest or httpwebrequest with content-type of text xml or application x-www-form-urlencode with a buffering encode ascii or utf8 i get an error that implies the xml cant be read at all on the other end

1368433
panels	grid
if you want the grid to be proportional to the form insert it to a panels table and set the dock properties to the table and the table docks to the form

1368436
iframe	popup
iframe can hosts another asp.net page which you can use for display the information on modal popup

1368436
iframe	popup
each time the iframe is show it will load the modal popup information page

1368436
hide	show
using javascript you can show hide the iframe and it can be made movable on the page also

1368446
dependency-injection	inject
if you would use some variant of dependency-injection such that your code gets access to the idbcommand without knowing how it gets construct you would be able to inject your mock without much of a hassle

1368448
actionscript	mxml
you cannot do this in css but mxml or actionscript will work

1368459
constructor	object
you will apply constructor to empty object

1368513
filesystems	fileinfo
in this case i think the problem is that fileinfo can required a filesystems read to get the properties value and if fileinfo doesn t internally caching the value it could end up performing this read repeatedly

1368520
web-applications	webserver
version-control systemd are obviously important in development project but there use in web development project appears to be more complex what with the requirement of having a webserver to run all but the simplest of web-applications

the reason you get the object-reference not set to an instances of an object. is because findcontrol is returning null and you are trying to derefrence a null reference

1368577
g++	gcc
qmake does not call g++ gcc directly

1368577
g++	gcc	build-system	nmake
you then invoke your native build-system either gnu make or ms nmake or xcodebuild or whatever which will call your native compiler g++ gcc or whatever

1368729
getter	setter
it generator correct getter setter for you

1368736
c-preprocessor	macros	wxwidgets	mfc
qt chooses to do this with extentions to the language and a pre-compiler mfc and wxwidgets do this with c macros and the c-preprocessor

1368736
environment	building
the qt approach means it can do more it s not limited by the cpp macros language at the expense of a slightly more complicated building environment

1368743

1368870
python	perl
if for some reason your environment is defined in a perl dictionary as in my case... you can either try to use pyperl or convert the perl dictionary into yaml and then read the yaml into python

1368882
glib	gtk
python binding to gobject and glib provide an application framework not bound to guser-interface or anything-- however if it should be bound to a user-interface gtk comes closer

downloading and install the asp.net-mvc binaries on the webserver you are using and the problem will go away

1368901
switching	router
can you enable a log on your router switching to see the raw ethernet frame coming through

1368958
decrement	increment
because in the objective-c reference counted memory-management scheme the creation of the arrays will increment the reference count and if you do not store the return-value in a variables you can send a release messages to you will have no way to decrement that count and will introduce a memory leak

1368967
webforms	asp.net	servicecontract	datacontract
my current problem is how to take the assembly appropriately decorated with servicecontract datacontract and webget attributes and reference it in my existing asp.net webforms application and expose it using rest

ideally i like different endpoint for jquery compatible bare xml json and soap web-services but right now i d be happy with getting bare xml to work

1368980
loading	png
if you are loading textures from png or jpg files using uiimage cgimage and cgcontext it is very important to set gl_texture_min_filter to gl_linear or gl_nearest before creating textures because if you don t do it all your textures except the last bound will be set to blank white

32-bit	64bit
we do our development on 32-bit machines and deploy to a 64bit server

1368983
32-bit	64bit
i have seen solutions where you simply put iis into 32-bit mode and run everything in 32-bit mode to be able to use sqlite but does this screw me out of being able to launchd a 64bit process

1368993
deployment	install
...in the end you end up with a deployment package that you install on the server and then use a combinations of xml configuration-files and environment variables to configure the package

1369010
put	get	32-bit	64bit
yes if you put iis in 32-bit mode you won t get 64bit process

1369015
value	field
increment a field is achieved by using the verb or you may want to take a look at how mongodb can atomically updates or increment a value

1369024
worksheet	excel
i have a project to upload the data in many excel workbooks each contains many worksheet that all have different columns

1369024

you can pass data in to ssis package as variables and the value in those variables can be passed on to virtually any properties or attributes within the package

1369084
variables	boolean
this variables will always show the proper design boolean

1369094
configuration	environment
this is really a serverfault question but anyway ifdefine doesn t test environment variables it tests the configuration options that were passed to apache at startup

1369094
configuration	environment
i m not sure if there s any apache configuration directive that acts as a conditional for environment variables like you re looking for

1369099
tortoisegit	svn
the svn cmd from tortoisegit are

now imagine customer table has 30 field and order have more complex sub join the data duplication can quickly become huge

1369164
google-chrome	firefox
it won t work in google-chrome or firefox intentionally - the link will fail silently

1369164
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome doesn t open file links from pages that originated from outside the local machine

1369172
defined	declare
either you have to defined it yourself in a source file or if it is already definedd in the libs you may need to declare it as extern in main.cpp

1369174
winpcap	libpcap
i d do it with winpcap and windump windows versioning of libpcap and tcpdump

1369198
json	xml
your first example uses datatype json but your second one with autocomplete uses xml

1369202
value	field
for example suppose we have a field that is supposed to contains say transactional types and the possible value are sale return service and layaway

1369202
value	field
if you say well those are all the tax-related codes or whatever then fine create a field called tax_related and set it to true or false for each code value as appropriate

1369221
unsafe	out
edit i should clarify that c# also has unsafe features and functionality but they default behavior is managed-code which you have to explicit opt out of

1369221
type-safety	generics
generics are all about type-safety and avoiding casting but dynamic-typing in objective-c makes this essentially a non-issue

1369222
postgresql	mysql
aggregation is a basic feature of relational databases and both postgresql and mysql can do it with no problem

sql-server oracle etc are terribly powerful pieces of software

1369227
export	report
one for display and export to pdfor rtf and another report for export to excel

1369227
export	report
i know in general this is not a good approach because there is the possibility for data to be different in the export than the display report but if careful it works well

1369227
export	report
to do this i simply load the display report to the report viewer as you normally would but .when you go to export the report i load the excel report with the same parameters as the display report and call the code to export the data to excel

1369227
export	report
by using this methods the display report can be formatted any way necessary without having to worry about messing up the export to excel

1369227
export	report
the excel report field can then be made a smaller size than required by the display report because the data should export even regardless of the size of the field

1369227
export	report
doing this allows you to fit more data on the excel export report

1369321
highlight	cell
i am writing a javascript function to highlight the row and column of a click cell

1369321
selected	cell
this function must take into account cell in previous rows that use rowspan to protrude down into the selected row - because this causes the cell indexes to differ from the apparent index

1369323
put	get
the address i got from the wsdl for the webservice is .when i just put that address in a web browser i get what looks like soap xml with ibrequest getinfoxmlstring

1369352
selected	button	highlight	selected
edit are you pressing right mouse button with shift key during the operation to selected highlight something while debugging

1369377
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is clearly the technical more advanced database managment systemd while mysql is probably a bit simpler to run is more widely used and in consequence offers more support sources on the internet

1369397
csv	xml
i assume that you can t control the base file-format simple csv or xml formats aren t going to be possible

1369404
debugging	trace
i often use the immediate windows in debugging mode to find the depth i have to back out or use the trace true on the webpage and look at the control tree to see the hierarchy

1369417
checkbox	button	checkbox	listbox
.when you run that code you should get a listbox with the options visible and collapse and .when you choose an option you should see the visibility of the button and checkbox is changed to reflect your choice

1369446
oracle	mysql
now i m experienced in using mysql and was wondering what the main difference are between oracle and mysql

1369448
input-field	selected
how to make if we selected no will have another input-field below the id noinput

1369477

i have a tabcontrol with 3 tabitem one of the tabitem has textbox the second has textbox and radio-button and third has only checkbox

1369502

linux	aix
windows os x linux aix .

1369536
jquery	.post
this tells the jquery ajax to do a .post to the methods

1369537
directory	folder
although you do have to put a php file in the wp-content mu-pluginss directory - putting a your plugins code inside a folder does not work

1369538
sequences	subset
this subset of the form would generator the following sequences

1369538
radio-button	checkbox
i m looking for a tool where a given checkbox radio-button generator a specific sequences and the mapping is configure by the user

1369540
reserved-words	keyword
in many c++ compilers especially microsoft ones far is a reserved-words either keyword or defined in a header

1369545
google-chrome	safari	inspector	webkit
use firebug getfirebug.com or safari google-chrome s webkit inspector

1369547

oracle also incorporates more features than mysql

1369547
linux	aix
6. oracle runs on all if not most major platform including linux windows and aix

1369553
show	next
in the next section iâ ll examine the implementation details and show how to write object for use with this statement

1369556
google-chrome	firefox
any thoughts on how i can get the form to look like it does in firefox and google-chrome without changing the page structure

1369556
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the form correctly display the form as follows

1369557
administration	account
for instances flash would be a perfect fit for a high end video game website where you can login see screenshot videos stats and change some administration account settings

1369562
g++	gcc
g++ gcc 3.4.4 cygming special gdc 0.12 using dmd 0.125

1369572

asp vbscript or asp.net can create the files to store the basic feedback comments

1369575
seam	jsf
i have a seam jsf page that very nicely allows you to edit all the field of any given task

1369579
boost-variant	boost-any
if you did not use the union you would be left with reading the header extraction both the size and the types initializer an object of the appropriate types either in a hierarchy or to include inside a variant types as boost-any boost-variant and performing the second read on the newly created spaces

1369579
udp	tcp
we use this solution extensively to control simulator some companies do not appreciate new technologies like dds or hla and still depend on raw udp tcp data for their simulator

1369584
oracle	mysql
4 mysql syntax on some things is forgiving whereas oracle won t let you do it

1369593
attributes	properties
also i think it s redundant to have the table named in the column named because if you think of the table as an entity and a column as a properties or attributes of that entity you think of it as the id attributes of the employee not the employeeid attributes of an employee

1369606
listobject	worksheet
create the worksheet and populate the listobject on said worksheet

1369608
gnome	xfce
don t uninstaller gnome just selected xfce in the graphical login screens

if i need to have other repositories mysql oracle xml other what account class will i use

1369647

how to delete all files and folder in a directory

1369648
lookup	any
there shouldn t be any need for a complex selector lookup .when you re using ids

1369657
any	set
this is a bunch of work .so i d suggest that rather than rolling your own http-request logic use urlconnection which is built-in to java and include methods for retrieving the content of a response as well as any headers set by the server

1369686
sql-server	oracle
migrate an entire database-schema + data from one platform to another ie ports an oracle to sql-server hopefully including supports for sequences and identity columns

1369686
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
personally i am mainly concerned with sql-server and oracle support but mysql support would be very nice to have as well

1369691
google-chrome	firefox
this is because at least in google-chrome and firefox the fieldname div is getting a computed right-margin of 340px taking up the entire width of the form

1369694
.net	wcf
i am building a .net 3.5 winforms .app that uses wcf service wshttp binding to communication to my server which gets data from sql-server and passes it back to the winforms .app smart client

1369729
png	gif
did you try upload image format like gif or png

1369744
callback	methods
for example many people suggest and a good suggestion i agree to put your code in the jquery-load methods s callback on the calling page and not the called page

1369744
callback	methods	put	get
.so my question remains how to get this to fire excluding any answers that tell me to put this in the .load methods s callback

1369763
mstest	mbunit
is there a mstest equivalent of assert.warning in mbunit

1369766
parentheses	macros
i can get around that by a judicious application of parentheses but its very easy to write a macros that works in some situations and not in others

1369780
nsstatusitem	nstextview
it turns out that the nstextview i was working with was added to an nsstatusitem as part of an awakefromnib routine

1369782
listitem	selected
i ve created a simple web part with a connectionconsumer row that successfully show the selected listitem but i m trying to figure out how to programmatically create a form depending on the list with a save updates functionality

1369794
oracle	mysql
also if you re used to using the limit clause in mysql you may need to be careful in using rownum in oracle

1369794
oracle	mysql
you should also investigate date formats and functions in oracle which differ to those in mysql

1369795
fieldset	labels	fieldset	margins
edit i added a width to the fieldset and a right margins to the title labels

1369795
fieldset	labels
this makes the title labels take up most of the fieldset width forcing the other elements down into place

1369797
attributes	properties
however if i add an address properties to this person and mark the address class with dataannotation attributes they will not be validation

1369801
environment	building

directory	folder
then a folder eclipse was extraction from .tar.gz package under the directory bin eclipses

1369803
margins	padding
borders padding and margins

1369816
children	nodes
but that doesn t work i m guessing because children returns an empty set since there s only a text nodes in there

1369819
jquery	.post
then with jquery i will intercept the click on the link which would go to a page for non-javascript users to do a .post

1369827
32-bit	64bit
here s the working reason my main application is a 32-bit application but i can use a 64bit wrapper and communication with 64bit autocad

1369829
remote-server	lan
i used remote debugger before but that was used .when i created new project on some development server in local lan and the source and project is actually on the remote-server i just attached remote debugger from my desktop to that server it works fine

1369845
javascript	dom
you could use some javascript to dynamically alter the dom to add newer elements

1369860
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
i have need for a systemd function-call the same as those in python perl php ruby c

1369860
buffering	streaming
second the streaming to the child-process do not buffering and fflush properly

1369868
children	nodes
match the tag and then ancestry would give all parent nodes child would give you all the children - you would have a lot more power using simple xpath syntax via xslt

1369883
global-asax	web-config
i m using these instructions to get thigns configure including the web-config and global-asax changes

1369890
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m doing this through asp.net-mvc by the way but it should make no difference i assume in webforms either

1369897
processor	cpu
this will consume one core of your cpu which is why you re seeing 50 processor usage you have a dual-core processor correct

1369903
sql-server	oracle
i d give a try to sql-server migration assistant for oracle ssma for oracle

1369910
user-interface	look-and-feel
if you want to really control painting in situations like this you need to either roll your own or go with a swing button and then explore the user-interface component the delegation object responsible for painting the control among other things - part of the look-and-feel being used at the time

1369910
user-interface	look-and-feel
but delegation much of their behavior and almost all of their appearance to the user-interface controllers in the look-and-feel package

1369912
buffering	streaming
on the matter of buffering and flushing the streaming i don t thing there is an easy solution

1369917
buildout	plone
i quite like the plone buildout tutorial

1369917
buildout	plone
here is the new link to plone buildout tutorial

1369931
constructor	object
the npgsqlinet object has a constructor that accepts a string .so i tried to create a custom user types following these instructions

1369951
attributes	properties
the servicecontract attributes on your service s interface definition default the sessionmode properties to sessionmode.allowed

1369956
.net	wcf
in wcf you should not throw standards .net exception-handling - this is contrary to the potentially interoperable nature of wcf - after all your client could be a java or php client which has no concept of .net exception-handling

1369956
defined	declare
you should declare your invaliduserfault as wcf datacontract and defined what members might travel back with that types error-code error messages etc.

1369968
exception-handling	try-catch
now i want to catch the exception-handling that opening this file could cause and this is fairly high risk code in that it can fail due to the environment but if i write try-catch inside would that not be repetition

1369968
exception-handling	try-catch
however i would want to catch the exception-handling opening a file can cause .so i should wrap the try-catch outside the using statement s scoping and al.so the exception-handling for whatever i do inside the using block .so i should add the try-catch inside the block

1369998
exception-handling	try-catch
the outer try-catch will catch whatever exception-handling you need to watch for while ignoring the dispose

1370008
json	xml
i don t know of any xml - json converter offhand besides writing a manual one yourself

why is it that a with a single field will reload the form .when the user enters a value and presses the enter and it does not if there are 2 or more field in the

1370022
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
there s a sample .app built using the framework which has user interfaces for winform wpf asp.net webforms asp.net-mvc plus dal s using linq ado.net which makes it a candidate for a learning tool and a framework to be used in real world .apps

1370028
des	rsa
support for blowfish rsa md5 sha-1 des triple- des rijndael and

1370037
http	ssl
i m not sure what you re asking http http over ssl

1370038
repository	entity
don t get in a habit of passing the entity object around they re bound to the datacontext s lifetime and it leads to unfortunate coupling between your repository and its clients

directory	folder
i have found a lot of information on how to get all the files in a folder and or subfolders but nothing on checked for a directory within each subfolder

1370075
mouseleave	mouseenter
have you tried using mouseenter and mouseleave

1370091
swing	awt
you can then draw this information with awt swing or whatever you like

1370092
directory	folder
as you have two applications i think the best thing to do it is to create a new virtual directory that maps to that folder where the files are into the second application and then to write a httphandler that get the files from there

1370107
json	xml
the lack of reflection prevents orms like hibernate or linq xml and json parsing that instancinate classes data serialization and many other thigns where initially typeless data has to be used to create an instances of a class

1370118
python	java
you can certainly write all your code without the const keyword and get things to work just as you do in java and python

1370142
difference	factors
i haven t benchmarking it but one factors in the time difference is that you have to do several variables lookup in the second function

1370142
dictionary	arrays
this is because local variables lookup are much faster than global or built-in variables lookup the python compiler optimizes most function bodies .so that for local-variabless no dictionary lookup is necessary but a simple arrays indexing operation is sufficient

1370175
value	field
i removed the default-constructor because i see no value in a product instances with uninitialized field and no possibilty to alter them later

1370203
hide	show
all content in it is called via show hide divs with jquery

1370285
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are unaffected

1370285
google-chrome	firefox
use ie i used ie7 firefox and google-chrome don t appear to have this issue

1370289
constructor	object	copy-constructor	constructor
call the constructor of world with the arguments foo unless foo is a world object already and then call the copy-constructor of world with the result as an arguments

1370289
constructor	object
.so first creates a world object on the heap calling the constructor with the arguemnt 100

1370293
32-bit	16-bit
i was under the impression the 16-bit co-ordinate limitation was bumped to 32-bit starting with nt .so i have no clue why this wouldn t work on xp or vista

1370298
reflection	runtime
attributes are burnt in at compile-time and cannot for reflection be set at runtime

1370300
ghostscript	pdfsharp
open-source pdfsharp has a namespace for using ghostscript

1370303
boolean	int
if you use zend_validate_notempty and were doing anything strange like filtering input to be an object of .some .sort zend_validate_notempty now causes an error if the item isn t a float int string arrays boolean - .so object don t cut the grade anymore

1370304
expression	brackets
what do the first brackets mean in the expression

1370316
cassini	iis
the only issue is developing using iis rather than cassini

1370317

1370326
sql-server	postgresql
what is the simplest way to move data from an ms sql-server 2005 db to a postgresql install 8.x

1370330
attributes	properties
if i use injectionproperties for one properties do i now have to explicit declare all the other properties that have the dependency attributes

1370336
value	field
but i also have a numbers of recording with event_starttime field value like dec 31 1969 - 8 00pm which looks bad in view and i need to replace them with some custom labels like no date available

1370336
value	field
to sum up the general problem is that view field are kind of limiting and sometimes you just need to replace some field value but it s either date or nothing or node-reference id or nothing

1370336
export	csv
the situation might be a bit complicated because i use bonus views export module which makes my view return csv data

1370338
arrays	loops
you ll have to loops through the arrays and printing out each item individually

1370346
linq-expressions	lambda
or how not to use .net linq-expressions inorder to get parameter named and arguments value from c# lambda

1370353

1370392
selected	textbox	hide	show
.so i now have the following jquery to hide or show a textbox based on specific value selected in a dropdownlistfor

1370395
exception-handling	try-catch
before i found exception-handling filtering inject i ended up implements a short function that took a functional delegation and a catch delegation and would just call the functional if exception-handling-handling were allowed to bubble up otherwise called the functional in a try-catch calling the catch delegation on a caught exception-handling

1370412
postgresql	mysql
the stored procedure and function language differs greatly between postgresql and mysql

1370435
datacontract	servicehost
if not using events is there some other way using wcf classes configuration to determine if a servicehost singletoninstance is currently process a datacontract

1370436
contains	elements
by the way i would recommend using the selector to get a jquery object contains a reference to your input otherwise jquery will search all elements to match the css class .statusactionamountcssclass

1370437
value	field
i want to write a generics value mapper for these object that given a target object instances of mydata here and an input recording will be able to tell that mydata.time is a date field and perform types mapping automatically

1370455
catransition	caanimation
a catransition is a caanimation and .so the documentation on repeat animation covers your issue

1370463
handler	service
i have sorted out the issue and the solution is that since i had a model like this jsp button is clicked- call goes to handler- handler call methods in service- service populate the managed-bean infobean and returns it to handler

1370463
instances	private	getter	setter
one other suggestion i got was make infobean a private instances of the handler with getter and setter this way it will get created with the handler and will also be olk

1370465
modifiers	final
the final keyword modifies the local variables to which it refers whether a basic types or a reference but is not a modifiers of the referred object

1370476
value	field
not including field in indexes .when you are always seeking and return the same value for instances formatted named for an employee .when you lookup using employeeid causing two actions instead of one

1370493
lighttpd	apache
apache nginx and lighttpd can do that for you i don t know for iis

1370500
order	join
but this order isn t set in stone particularly .when join are involved

1370500
order	join
if a join matches on a column with an index other than the clustered index it may well order the results based on that index instead

1370500
order	join
of course it can be tricky here because updates statements are not allowed to use an order by clause .so regardless of what you find you should really write the join .so it matches the destination table 1 1

1370532
rollback	commit
funnily enough with the 11gr2 release this week 2009-09-03 sql plus now has an option to commit or rollback on exit

1370557
postgresql	mysql
both mysql and postgresql are known to support guid datatypes i believe it s called uuid but it s the same thing

1370560
multibyte	strlen
php s functions such as strlen str_replace do not produce the correct results on multibyte encoding such as utf-8 since they operate on single bytes

1370561
ubuntu	linux
the reason why it can happen is that ubuntu systemd you re compiling at is newer and forward-compatibility is not preserve in linux libs

1370569
attributes	properties
the relevant attributes have a cascade properties to set cascading behavior

1370583
linux	unix
i ve always got this to work on linux unix

1370586

i have found this .post with very good instructions for determining if windows is running within vmware virtual-pc or wine but i haven t been able to find anything similar for parallels

1370610
key-value	key
the graphing is represented by key-value pair where key and value are simple types int for the most part but some may refer to more complex types such as strings

1370610
key-value	key
queries using strings of key key key key-value

subclassing	nsobject
another option is very similar but instead of subclassinging nsfetchedresultscontroller i create a nsobject subclassing or category that handles the same work

1370697
exception-handling	try-catch
and was thinking of creating an attributes class that will handle exception-handling in methodss instead of coding a try-catch methods in each methods or class i create

1370698
constructor	object
to avoid this and still keep the binding in your markup set the selectedindexvalue of your datacontext object to -1 before binding before initializecomponent is called in your form constructor

1370715
attributes	properties
i ve not dealt to much with attributes but my understanding was they were a better way than using marker interfaces to indicate that a class or methods possessed a given properties or should be used in a certain way

1370719
nsmanagedobject	nsobject
for one nsmanagedobject doesn t use the same methods for initialization that nsobject does

1370742
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu use .deb red hat and fedora use .rpm etc

1370743
order	add
you could add a many-to-many relationship to your domain model order class

1370768
authentication	login
the login form intern uses an authentication class that i ve created to authentication users and set access rights

1370784
debian	linux	debian	rpm	contains	any
linux use .deb for debian and its variants .rpm for red hat and its variants and .bin which is actually a shell scripting contains the data and the installation procedure meant to install in any linux independing on the presence of deb or rpm install

1370785
duplicates	elements
if you are just trying to get for instances unique value from some set whose elements then form the key you can just use exists could also help to catch duplicates if you checked for exists first before assign a value

1370800
ostringstream	std
better fix since you re using c++ look into the std string and ostringstream classes which will resize themselves to prevent buffering overflows

1370802
triggers	insert
but inorder to keep things transparency to the applications you have to continue to allow insert on the view that cause insert into two or more different tables you need an instead of triggers

1370803
fortran	ada
+ java fortran ada --enable-java-awt gtk --disable-dssi --enable-

1370804
triggers	insert
.so if you create a view that s a join of two tables and you try to execute an insert statement on the view you can write an instead of triggers that modifies the two underlying tables appropriately instead

1370831
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.12 gecko 2009070611 firefox 3.5.12

1370838
defined	declare
any function declare or defined as friend inside a class is not a member of that class

1370841
pixels	line
it would be relatively easy to write custom methods where you specify shapes to be draw in the normals gdi+ way rectangles and coordinates and radii and .so forth and then your code translation the line of these elements into bezier coordinates where you slightly alter the positioning of things randomly by a few pixels in each directions

1370843
arguments	default
you can call django.contrib.auth.views.logout with the extra arguments if you write your own pattern for it or if you call it from your own view but not from its default url-pattern

1370850
lookup	any
it is not .something i would include in mysql otherwise - it does nothing to affect the query overall because it always evaluates as being true and does not hit the table s involved .so there aren t any index lookup or table scans based on it

1370850
coalesce	isnull
coalesce and isnull are not ideal because the query is still utilizing indexes or worse table scans based on a sentinel value

1370853
windows-server	windows-vista
operating systemd windows-vista windows-server

1370859
windows-server	windows
unless you qualify for bizspark or maybe the empower program you will need to buy licenses for windows-server sql-server visual-studio windows 7 or vista xp

substring	strstr
strstr extraction substringing just like std string substring

1370898
private-members	object
a common use of friend functions is in overloading streaming operatorss where the specific operators needs access or is facilitated by access to private-members of the object

1370935
meta-tags	meta
meta-tags are a somewhat outdated means of setting caching protocols and most of the meta caching control properties are fairly deprecated no-caching

1370937
triggers	insert	updating	updates
the triggers would insert updates into a log table and just differentiate between insert or updating based on the current time

1370940
permission-denied	sysadmin
all of a sudden i am getting the error selected permission-denied for table but the account i m using to connect to the database specified in my app-config file has the sysadmin server role bad programmer i know

1370956
background-color	transparency
obviously this isn t happening at the moment though i m unsure why because i ve set the background-color to transparency for all the elements of which the logo is composed

1370965
datagrid	textbox
this enables me to edit multi line text in a datagrid .when the text is being edited the textbox it is in grows over the top of the grid instead of resizing the height of the row

1370977
javascript	dom
.some other points of interest were that accessing dom object expando properties is really slow .so we put them all into javascript arrays instead

1370978
javascript	dom
i don t know whether there is a way to accomplish that but you can use either javascript or jquery to change your dom elements show priority

1370980
javascript	dom
you could load the larger background via javascript once the rest of the dom has loaded if it s worth going that far

1370988
directory	folder
but now i d like to split up that directory string into the individual folder components ie something like

1370989

perl	c++
this article compares perl and lisp macros but the points is still the same text level macros perl c++ cause massive problems compared to source level macros lisp

1370995
attributes	properties
registering properties with the api runtime will cancel dependency attributes

1370995
attributes	properties	reflection	runtime
but you can use reflection to get properties decorated with the dependency attributes and register them at runtime

1371001
ip-address	hostname
from javascript you can only get the http header which may or may not have an ip-address typically only has the hostname

1371001
ip-address	hostname
part of the browser s program is to abstract the tcp ip-address away and only allow you to deal with a hostname

1371009
hide	show
personally i would hide the extension and show the icons

1371014
checkbox	textarea	selected	checkbox	dialog	pop-up
given that i have many input typess selected drop downs textarea input with children like an input types text with a checkbox that .when checked opens a datagrid that can add remove items via a dialog pop-up form etc. i d like to avoid hard-wiring building methods like in my example above

1371017
contains	set
yes the mysql-workbench can reverse-engineer a diagram from an sql scripting that contains a set of create-table statements

1371136
text-editor	editor
also note that visudo is a text-editor that mirrors the vi editor and uses the same cmd as vi

1371170
put	get
if you put the bordered text inside the or inside it s own or get rid of the display inline then you will get a box-level layout as you expected

1371170
margins	padding
updates yet another way to fix this would be to put the stuff above the table inside a div that isn t inline and then styles that div with identical but transparency margins and padding

1371172
32-bit	64bit
in the versioning of c you have is a long 32-bit or 64bit

1371174
spaces	output
if the output was truncated due to buff_size limit then the return-value is the numbers of characters not including the trailing 0 which would have been written to the final string if enough spaces had been available

1371188
any	set
get set any clr types including collections

1371193
fadeout	fadein
i suspect that you dont understand how fadeout and fadein works

1371201
private-members	object
what friendship means is that duplicates has access to the private-members of any crectangle object which is passed to it or which is a local variables within its scoping

1371202
attributes	properties
your custom task getassemblyinformationversiontask will need to have a properties on it of types itaskitem that is decorated with the output attributes

1371224
digits	zero
this will validation that it is any numbers of digits with at least one 1-9 .so greater than zero

1371234
superclass	inherited
the instances size is determined based upon a combinations of per-class without inherited compile-time structure size and per-runtime calculation of total size of the class and all superclass

1371246
fopen	fread
you can use regular fopen and fread to access the contents of a file

1371246
nsstring	nsdata
alternatively you can use nsstring if your file contains only text or nsdata for non-text data

1371258
textbox	button
in the silverlight .app i added two textbox and a button and a service reference to the wcf service

1371258
object-reference	instances

1371279
keyboard	mouse
.so far i ve got keyboard input working but am having trouble injecting mouse input

1371279
click	mouse
i used spy++ to observe the windows messages that get sent to the wpf windows .when i physically click the mouse button

1371279
click	mouse
injecting the appropriate mouse messages .when i ve manually positioning the cursor over the button doesn t cause the button to be click however the click event isn t fired by the wpf framework

1371279
click	mouse
if i add a handler for mouse click on the actual dialog the client area that handler does get called if i positioning the cursor over the dialog itself and inject the same windows messages as before

1371279
mousedown	mouseup
strangely enough if i change the push mode of the button to press it s considered click on mousedown rather than the default mouseup the button click event is now fired .when i inject the same messages as before

1371279
click	mouse
it seems like there are some other criterion that need to be fulfilled inorder for a mouse click event to be fired by the wpf framework

1371279
click	mouse
does anybody know how mouse input is handled internally in wpf or why it s not interpreting my mouseup and down messages as a click on the button

1371280
value	field
i have a bunch of object that have a value and a date field

1371290

the tool works fine is launchable and i stop it from the dock the problem i m facing is that this tools is a command-line server creates no windows and its stdout and stderr are needed

1371296
stderr	stdout
is there a way to create the bundle in which stdout and stderr are redirected to a logfile or even a windows somewhere once the .app is execute

1371300
directory	folder
then execute your code that writes files directory using the temp folder as a parent do your assert on the files directory and as a best practice clean up the temp folder in your unit test s teardown methods

1371307
contains	elements
the body elements contains a chunks c1

1371307
contains	elements	contains	any
if you have a display inline parent elements and if this parent has a child that is display block then the existence of that child seems to make the parent nearly behave like display block and ignore the fact that it s defined as display inline in that the parent now contains nothing but anonymous and non-anonymous block children it no longer contains any inline children

1371337
json	xml
they were originally formulated on xml but json is totally applicable

1371353
codeigniter	kohana
i ve recently converted from codeigniter because i think kohana is a bit more well thought out however the docs seem lacking and i couldn t find out how to do what i needed

1371362
directory	folder
i know _server document_root returns the document-root most likely something like home user public_html but is there any way to get the parent directory of this folder

1371363
spaces	output
but not according to the output of your free 1 cmd which show no swap spaces recognized by your server instances

1371376

the display block elements inside display inline elements makes the display inline act like a display block with width 100

1371376
contains	elements
a display inline elements contains only display block float left or float right elementss takes no spaces and is as if there were no elementss inside of it

1371377
constructor	object
if the constructor doesn t receive valid input or can t construct the object in a valid manner it has no other option but to throw an exception-handling and alert its caller

1371400
sata	ssd
ide scsi ssd sata or all of those

1371403
required	checked
the boxing unboxing it incurs is much faster than the security checked requiredd for the reflection api invocation which happens to also required boxing

frame	width
if not how would i get the scrollbar s width .so i can manually add it to the my frame s max size

1371511
base-class	inherited
as a result i was wondering if there was a base-class that controls implements the tabindex properties inherited from .so i could generator the following code

1371512

1371536
triggers	insert
your client is wrong - even in sql-server 2008 there s no before insert triggers

1371536
triggers	insert
as charles bretana already mentioned you get after insert or instead of insert triggers but no full-fledged before triggers in sql-server

1371537
radiobuttonlist	updatepanel
also remember that the updatepanel is a templates control and the radiobuttonlist and all other controls are rendering inside of its contenttemplatecontainer somewhere in the updatepanel s lifecycle i think it s somewhere around createchildcontrols

1371554
firefox	safari
for firefox and safari outline none works

1371559
constructor	object
it s possible for the half-constructed object to stick around though if it s made itself visible earlier in the constructor by assign a static field or adding itself to a collections

1371559
constructor	object
one thing to be careful of about throw exception-handling-handling in the constructor because the caller usually will have no way of using the new object the constructor ought to be careful to avoid acquiring unmanaged resources file handles etc and then throw an exception-handling without releasing them

1371563
unchecked-exception	runtimeexception
unchecked-exception are basically subclassing of runtimeexception

1371565
teamcity	nant
our team recently upgrade to teamcity 4.5.4 but we re having trouble with teamcity running our nant building scripting

postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
many vendors including micro.soft sql-server oracle mysql postgresql support it .so that might be a first step

1371569
sql-server-express	sql-server
if you re a .net shop and are either using a small database sql-server-express or have the money for the full sql-server use it

1371569

sql-server will perform better than postgresql for most actions and about the same as db2

1371569
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
other databases where it was about the same for a transactional database as oracle sql-server where were better than mysql postgresql etc

1371574

the best guess i could come up with was an insert triggers which deletes the newly insert row but there are no triggerss on the table and why would it work .when done manually then

1371623
sql-server	oracle
on windows sql-server is king simply because ms own both os and sql-server like oracle red hat

1371629
pointers	stack
because in that last case disp1 is a pointers to a display object probably allocated on the heap while disp2 is an actual object probably allocated on stack

1371639
subclassing	base-class
if one interface has been implements by thousand classes and at some points we need to introduce a few new methods in the base-class we will have to fix all the subclassing

1371639
abstract-class	subclassing
abstract-class provides flexibility in terms of functional expansion as it can provide default implementation without affecting subclassing

1371639
implements	extends
however .when i think about it again we still have to change all the subclassing due to the fact that the class declaration forces us to use extends or implements at the very beginning

1371640
value	field
.when i enter say 010109 into this field and tab out of it the binding appropriately sets the value properties to this string

you can mostly always write custom c++-cli glue to wrap managed object in unmanaged wrapper or unmanaged object in managed wrapper

1371923
unmanaged	c++-cli	managed-code	unmanaged	managed-code	c++-cli
once you ve done this you should be able to both consume and implements the interface in both unmanaged and managed-code c++ c++-cli c# etc.

1372819
revision	updates
we want to elliminate problems originating from author forgetting to updates revision numbers

1372819
revision	svn
we are not using the svn revision numbers but instead use a human revision numbers for our document

1372819

64bit users will want to use the 64bit versioning to save the 32-bit libs loading while as 32-bit users won t have the choice

1373220
contains	elements
have you tried setting the width and height on the parent contains elements presumably the map

1373220
contains	elements
i ve had some problems with absolute and relatively positioning elementss in ie before and giving the contains parent elements a width and or height seemed to fix it

if you go into blend selected a button and edit a copy of the button s templates you ll see the exact xaml that s used to make a wpf button look just like a standards mfc

1373249
swing	swt
â¹ - swt as as i understand it compiling the swing stuff to native basically means you need the whole jre

1373251
log4net	nlog
if you use a logging framework such as nlog or log4net the way you log things is configure in your client application

1373257
directory	folder
i have already built the templates put it into my itemtemplatess directory beneath my document folder and it works in the sense that i can add new items to the project through the templates

1373276
msbuild	nant
aware of build-tools we heard that msbuild and nant are some build-tools

1373276
msbuild	nant
we heard that msbuild and nant are command-line based build-tools

1373279
radio-button	selected
my question is how can i validation the radio-button ie i can any one help me out writing the javascript to validation if any one of the radio-button is selected

1373280
sql-server	oracle
|| certainly works in oracle though not apparently sql-server

1373285
.when	ready
.when ready the integrator pushes the collected integrated changes from his integrator repo into the project s main public repo

1373294
annotations	mapping
how can i configure hibernate inherited mapping using java annotations

1373302

1373358
gethashcode	equals
the problem is i ve got a class with overrides methods such as equals and gethashcode but .when i am trying to compare two object of this class with assert.areequal my code is not called .so i get an exception-handling

1373419
constructor	object	securitymanager	classloader
this attempt fails in the above example the securitymanager checked in classloader s constructor throw a security exception-handling but the attacker simply ignore any exception-handling and wait for the virtual-machine to perform finalization on the partially initializer object

1373421
mkmapview	mapkit
as well as my question removing mkmapview annotations causes leaks. i have discovered that if you create a view based project add a uisearchbar and mkmapview into the view s nib wire up the delegation i m not creating any methods as we don t actually need to do anything to triggers the leaks link in the mapkit and fire up the project then simply click in the uisearchbar causes a 1k+ leak

1373426
png	gif
it should only be able to do jpeg gif and png files

1373429
javascript	dom
this is another instances of choosing the right tool for the right problem but javascript s access to everything in the dom and its ability to gracefully degrade make it a pretty versatile tool and a great framework like jquery that removes much of the programming pain just helps it to be even more .so

1373453
put	get
i would be much better to get a connection to the header rows read all of your object put them in a collections and then iterate back through them and read the detail object with separate result sets

1373453
any	set
although the jdbc specifications doesn t state any obligations on the jdbc drivers with regards to this the jdbc-odbc bridge explicit only allows one active statement per connection .so other jdbc driverss are certainly free to have similar restrictions such as only one open result set per connection

1373467
base-class	inherited
there are time where i want to declare a new object of the inherited types and call methods on the base-class with the base-class knowing inherited types it is working with and the most logical choice would be to use the discriminator properties

1373492
constructor	object
these field are established based on the parameter list of a given object constructor

1373492
constructor	object
once the field are filled in and the user submit i know the object types i need to create i know the parameter named its constructor takes and the parameter typess

1373492
constructor	private	constructor	object
the object potentially can have many more properties public or private than what the constructor exposes

1373492
attributes	properties
i m not sure if i can specify default value somehow by properties attributes or something.

1373501
sql-server	oracle
otoh if you re writing the next sql-server oracle the effort is probably worth it -

1373523
linux	unix
i need to run a standalone ruby scripting as unix linux daemons

1373546
literals	hardcode
instead of using an tag for the error messages wrap a literals in a tag you hardcode on your page

1373550
rollback	commit
now if you re using nh then if your service and repositories shared the same session which they should then you can call begintransaction in the service-layer and commit or rollback as required

1373561
worksheet	excel
i m using axframercontrol inorder to embed excel worksheet in my application

1373566
postgresql	mysql
just had a discussion at work about the merits of using postgresql over mysql and vice-versa

1373591
contains	any
never building and execute a sql sommand in a string if it contains any text given to you by the user

1373596
splitter	panels
i would have thought that this would set the splitter distance dynamically to 100 pixels less than the total height at all time making the bottom panels occupy the remaining 100 pixels

1373599
entity-framework	nhibernate
if we have developed our own orm framework and the framework is working fine over the years then why should we learn and use branding new .net technologies like linq or entity-framework or nhibernate or csla.net for our upcoming software project

1373702
extends	super
aside from jdk7 features i m guessing .so you can use extends and super

1373720
private-members	constructor
.when is the constructor called .when are properties set are private-members serialization or does all deserialization occur on and through setter etc

1373723
libxml2	lxml

1373727
windows-mobile	windows-ce
uncaught_exception is only supported on windows-ce 5.0 and higher versioning including windows-mobile 2005 platform

1373734
constructor	object
with constructor overloads you let for example a unit-testing framework send in a mock object

1373734
arguments	default
now as you see we have provided a default class types that will be initializer if no arguments is provided to the constructor

1373756
postgresql	mysql
and then we get to the question of best and this assumes that mysql or postgresql are the only two options

1373765
xsd	xml
it should work similar to how xml can be validation using xsd

1373787
contains	any
each contains a link and .when this is click i want to execute a function rather than navigate but importantly this should only happen for the links contains in the parent and not any links that may be present in a nested

the first one is a c# clone of the original protobuf which only supported c++ java and python

1373955
any	set
even if you have the use custom workspace option enabled and have a special set up for the building consider having the first step of the building be a scripting that cleans up any prior artifacts and building step that might have been created by failed buildinging

1373976
display	width
but in both cases even if i put controls in a table and set the width of the table and columns to 600px if i put say 1000 characters in the textarea on page one on page 2 the display control is far wider than the 600 pixels i want to limit it to

1373994
exception-handling	try-catch
inorder to avoid having to use a try-catch block to catch the seh exception-handling as describe in the previous question i need to be able to tell whether the object has been deallocated or not

liferay al.so supports jsr168 and jsr286 portlets .so in respect to that you can use the same api s as you are using in websphere-portal

1374034
credentials	ntlm	ntlm	cas
liferay doesn t have a credentials vault for example but it still supports sso ntlm or cas

1374034
websphere-portal	liferay
your websphere-portal knowledge won t help you much in liferay development as it is a totally different product

1374038
textbox	button
give a named to your textbox then bind the commandparameter in the button to it s text properties

1374046
textbox	button
you could make a button templates that internally has a textbox maybe with ishittestvisible set to false and an outer grid with transparency background

1374053

for example what if the types of the superclass constructor parameter was different to the parameter types in the subclassing

1374245
webserver	nginx
how to install the nginx webserver

1374248
constructor	object
if the function would use a non-const reference then you couldn t pass const object to constructor that take const references

1374251
selectable	sortable
then to add sortable and selectable

1374264
key-value	key
for simple key or assciated foreign key you can use the tracking service to store such key-value pairs in the database too and query them later by using the tracking information in the tracking tables

1374274
boost	stl
this is a part of the boost libs though and not stl .so it may not be available on your particular platform

1374283
ubuntu	linux
i have a fresh install of rsa 7.5.3 in linux ubuntu 9.04

1374291
any	set
note that a types s properties should be able to be set and retrieved in any order

1374291
arrays	loops
as a result 2n+1 copies of the arrays will be created in the following loops

1374296
attributes	properties
consider using a properties if the member represents a logical attributes of the types

1374320
authentication	login
i dont need them to return any value as the webservice methods is just used for logging and the other has code to authentication the user and login to home page

1374324

you might be able to fix it by making the object constructor explicit

1374335
pointers	stack
this second variables is called a pointers and is located as global data or as part of stack

1374346
iprincipal	iidentity
first have a look at the definitions of iidentity and iprincipal

1374346

your code may contains a bunch of special cases that were hard to debugging a set of quirks and hacks that do not fit into any conference article

1374362
derived-class	base-class
the usage of the base-class is only for implements the derived-class

1374362
derived-class	base-class
note that c-style casts purposely allows casting a derived-class to a protected or private base-class in a defined and safe manner and to cast into the other directions too

1374386
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i ve had trouble with attributes selectors in firefox once or twice .so if you ve only tested in firefox checked google-chrome ie safari opera etc

1374412
any	set	value	field
at any rate we kept tracking of the current index in a hidden form field and set the visible panels based on the value

1374412
value	field
this methods is ugly but it would resolve the issue of disallowing a user from navigating top a next step page by having the step all in one page and also allows you to control the current index by setting the hidden form field s value on whatever events you need to use for setting the index

1374419
bluetooth	usb
nokia series60 devices should have a javax.microedition.io.commconnection that would allow the use of usb infrared and or bluetooth comm ports via the generics gcf api

1374433
macros	vba
i understand how to use shellexecute in vba for my outlook macros but i m looking to be able to use shellexecute to wait for the execute program in my scripting

1374446
triggers	insert	contains	any
any time a row in the basetable contains the xml column is altered the triggers fire your query is run and extraction data out from the xml and insert it into a relational table which in turn has a view over it to ensure you don t modify the relational data since this does not reflect back into the xml

1374448
httplistener	http.sys
and also don t forget - http.sys much more customizable than httplistener

1374448
httplistener	http.sys
you can t do streaming with httplistener but you can do that with http.sys - question about httplistener streaming

1374463
gridex	janus
they will save you time very quickly - some like janus gridex control costs relatively little a few hundred quid and will save you hours - which if you work in a commercial environment can translation to much more than the cost of the control

1374467
checkbox	button
i m trying to iterate over checkbox in an asp.net webpage and if any of the checkbox are checked then i want to enable the button on the page but if none are checked i want to disable the button

1374479
aggregate	grouping
following yet again on the use of a custom aggregate-functions of string concatenation you need to remember that the selected statement will place rows in any order .so you will need to do a sub selected in the from statement with an order by clause and then an outer selected with a grouping by clause to aggregate the strings thus

1374485
temporary	copy
you could copy that temporary string object to some other string object and take the cstring from that one

1374496
cacls	cmd
i can t tell which versioning of windows you are running but the security properties dialog or on xp home the cacls cmd should detail the permissions before and after

1374498
value	field
assumptions about the state of the environment the value of your parameters your local-variables and field etc

1374518
json	xml
like in the second line of your example if someone requested json instead of html or xml isn t an error-code return the appropriate response

1374520
temporary	copy
now you have to know that there is a kind of optimisation called return-value-optimization that say that if the compiler see an initialization via a function-call and that function return a temporary it will not do the copy but just make the assign value be the temporary

1374523
scp	ssh	sftp	scp	sftp	ssh
simply put you cannot use .netrc with sftp scp or ssh

1374523
scp	ssh	sftp	scp	sftp	ssh
now that you can make ssh sftp and scp connections without entering any passwd or pass-phrase you re ready to automate the rest

1374523
sftp	ssh
use an sftp program that break the ssh standards by allowing you to store connection parameters such as the passwd

1374538
look-and-feel	nimbus
if you use java web start for launchd you have control on the deployment users are easily prompt to downloading the jre the latest versioning is a much smaller downloading and you can either go for the nimbus look-and-feel which i think is really nice or a platform specific look-and-feel with a single line in your main methods

1374584
put	get
if i copy something to the clipboard from visual-studio before running the application there are a total of six object in the clipboard various string formats and a locale which all get put in the caching

1374594
keyboard	mouse
unplug the keyboard and mouse and lock them up in a cabinet

1374604
duplicates	contains
if your page contains a lot of html that would be duplicates if the views are separated then i would put the if logic in the view and rendering a partials view depending on whether the list has items or not

1374614
subclassing	superclass
the reason is .when you defined parameterized constructor in subclassing you want to overrides something from superclass

1374619
subclassing	superclass
what bothers me more is .when i have a superclass a with two subclassing b and c and b and c both required the same 10 constructor with a bunch of parameters

1374619
subclassing	inherited
if i can write an ordinary function in a class that is inherited by its subclassing why can t i write a constructor

1374619
constructor	object
a has a constructor a that in effect returns an object of types a

1374619
constructor	object
but a constructor for b would have to return an object of types b not a

1374625
svnadmin	dump
i move my repositories from one server to another using svnadmin dump and didn t have to have my users do anything different other than reconfig their clients to points to the new svn server

1374625
svnadmin	dump
note .when i loaded the repo dump i used svnadmin load --force-uuid to try avoiding the problems like you said

1374627
local-variables	function-call
.when the function returns the stack-pointer is reset to the way it was before the function was called thus the entire stack frame including local-variables is free to be overwrite by the next function-call

1374650
difference	factors
there are many factors that can go into this kind of difference the contrast in the portable display might not be as great in an effort to conserve power make the device cheaper etc

1374668
arrays	loops
i think the foreach loops is adding each elements of the arrays onto one big string lonarrays

1374694
postgresql	mysql
and postgresql has fewer experienced administration than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

1374710
textbox	button
i ve got a button that i want to keep disabled until all the textbox have had text entered in them

1374737
value	field
is there a way to create a unique on these field that will enforce uniqueness for two not null value but ignore if there are multiple entries where named is not null and email is null

1374750
selected	checkbox
however the selected item is one of these .when i click on it the checkbox show in the top of the combobox i don t want this instead i want it to say display as this is a list of display settings how can the combobox be changed to allow this in silverlight

1374759
textbox	button
how do i disable enter in the textbox like if you hit this is a test+ enter it submit the page i want the user to have to click on the submit button at the bottom

1374768

the amount of physical ram in your box does not directly correlate to how much memory you can allocate with calloc malloc realloc

1374773
any	set
it accepts and set of 13-16 consecutive numbers allowing one spaces or dash between any such pair of numbers

1374775
32-bit	64bit
and of course it should work dandy under 64bit on any systemd even the 32-bit versioning with the bad calculation worked but only coincidentally

1374780
any	set
it depends on how your php-ini is set up but the default behavior is to look in the current directory and the include directory or directory if any .so foldername header.php is relative to the path of the home.php scripting

subclassing	superclass
the concrete class compiles fine because b extends a and since java 5 a return-type on a subclassing can be a subclassing of the return-type on the superclass

required	checked
note that putting advice on required will not do anything if semantic has already been loaded .so you may need to checked featurep semantic first and load cedet.el immediately if necessary

1374885
external	root
where wwwroot is relative root my goal was to put the machine-specific instruction for in the inetpub directory .so that xcopying new code automatically picked up established machine settings in the external configuration file

1374899
textchanged	textbox
you could try using the textchanged event instead since really you just want to know .when characters were added or removed from the textbox

1374908

distance	altitude
does postgresql spatial plugins or any spatial package for that manner factors in the altitude .when calculating the distance between 2 points

1375003
difference	factors
i know the spatial package factors in the approximate curvature of the earth but if one location is at the top of a mountain and the other location is close to the sea - it seems like the calculated difference between those two points would greatly vary if the difference in altitude was not factorsed into account

1375003
distance	altitude
also keep in mind that if i have 2 points are at the same ocean altitude but a mountain exists between the 2 points - the distance package should account for this

1375012
value	field
for example we send large numbers of sms using a 3rd-party aggregator service and each sms has an originator field which can be a phone-number specifically a msisdn or a text value

1375036
latitude-longitude	location
it seems this only has the named of the location and no latitude-longitude data

1375043
double	int
i hesitate to even suggest this but you might consider runtime checked against the types of t in the methods and throw if t is not an int long short float or double

1375046
contains	any
there s no magic bullet here and these books don t contains any secrets

1375047

guice is also a nice lightweight di framework that imho is easier to learn that spring

1375048
pointers	stack
say i knew another .app say a usermode webserver and load the viewmodel for that process change it s instruction pointers stack or even load different code into the process and then switching back to my own .app

1375061
addition	formula	distance	altitude
if the distance formula you re using does not take the altitude of the two points as parameters in addition to the latitudes and longitudes of the two points then it does not factors in altitude to the distance calculation

1375061
distance	altitude
in any event altitude difference does not have a very significant effect on calculated distance

1375061
distance	altitude
as usual with gps the difference in distance calculations that altitude would make is probably smaller than the error in most commercial gps devices anyway .so in most applications altitude can be safely dispensed with altitude measurements themselves are pretty inaccurate with commercial gps devices although survey data on altitudes is quite accurate

1375143
python	java
i do most of my coding in java and some in python accepting the tradeoffs of each

1375143

if you really can t stand java you might want to use hybrid languages like scala

1375149
distance	altitude
postgresql does not factors in altitude .when calculating distance

1375155
internationalization	translation
i ve found that the simplest approach to internationalization is to simply maintain a list of all the different pieces of text in your application labels button form caption etc. in a spreadsheet or tab-delimited file of some sort and then send this file to the translators to add in one additional column for each language all the translation

1375164
derived-class	base-class
if you have a pointers or reference to a base-class you can use dynamic_cast to see which derived-class it is and therefore which derived-class s methods it supports

1375165
reflection	runtime
c++ does not have built-in runtime reflection

1375170
subclassing	base-class

ideally you could use something that would never be used in a field value - then it s a simple search replace problem

1375233
arrays	loops
.so you need to loops over the arrays

1375261

is there some sort of way to reset all panels to their default state

1375419
mouseenter	mouseover
you can use mouseenter instead of mouseover

1375421
derived-class	base-class
however it s important for me to include the named of the actual derived-class in the debugging info as the event handling code in the base-class is shared by a large numbers of derived-classes and only certain ones exhibit the problem

1375421
derived-class	base-class
i can of course start modifying the classes and say pass the derived-class types to the base-class constructor where it can store it but this is a lot of changes for what is obviously only a temporary need

1375421
derived-class	base-class
is there a simple way to get the types of the derived-class from within the base-class

1375444
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
if it s because trygetvalue doesn t throw an argumentexception but instead throw an argumentnullexception you should be safe in fixing it

1375488
qwidget	qobject
however .when looking in the properties editor only the qobject and qwidget properties are visible

1375508
arrays	loops
another possible approach would be to return an arrays of range object and then loops through the arrays

1375519
textbox	button
.when you click the button i also want the labels to display you added data and the textbox to be emptied out.

1375539

1375641
double	int	primitive	int
if p is a primitive numeric data types float double int etc it should probably be in lowercase

1375641
double	int
also since it translation to if x and y where int and p were float or double you might not get the answer you expect

1375642
databound	formview
i can get access in the formview s databound

something that can be a little quicker to set-up but potentially less robust to long term use is to use a service like dropbox and set a dropbox directory as your workspace provided you aren t working on sensitive code with personal information assorted caveats to apply to any cloud-style service

1375770

1375845
callback	methods
the exception-handling actually occurred in the callback methods many line after the line indicated in the stack-trace

1375845
exception-handling	try-catch
the line where the exception-handling actually occurred was not inside of a try-catch block .so the unhandled-exception-handling was expected

1375845
callback	methods
i think that it s safe to say that if your stack-trace points to the first executable line of an async callback methods you should suspect that it could be wrong

1375850
constructor	object
in fact i think you have to unless you plan to pass the class of t to the constructor of genericthingywidget and then dynamically cast from your mbox.getselecteditem since as far as i can tell getselecteditem only returns object

1375861

1375874
constructor	private
how can i call a function and keep my constructor private

1375874
constructor	private	constructor	object
if i make the class static i need to declare an object named which the compiler uses to call the constructor which it cannot if the constructor is private also the object would be extraneous

1375874
constructor	private	constructor	object
i want to keep the constructor private because i will later be doing a lot of checked before adding an object modifying previous object .when all submitted variables are not unique rather than creating new object

1375877

firefox	safari
firefox and safari do it right the spaces on screens is small

1375992
response	timeout
actually another questions is if the timeout exception-handling always happened at system.net.httpwebrequest.getresponse does that mean application is waiting for the response from remote-server and could not get response until timeout

we had a test project that started out as mbunit v3 gallio but decided to go to mstest

1376046

1376086
complex-numbers	matrix
i take the two-dimensional fft of x which is an int matrix of dimension 4096 x 4096 which gives me the frequency domain representation x which is a matrix of complex-numbers and i think it s dimension is 2048 x 2048

1376086
complex-numbers	matrix
similarly i take the two-dimensional fft of y which is an int matrix of dimension 64 x 64 which gives me the frequency domain representation y which is also a matrix of complex-numbers and i think it s dimension is 32 x 32

1376086
numerical	matrix
i m using the fourn function in numerical recipes .so my input matrix x and y must be collapse into one-dimensional arrays which get replace by their discrete fourier transforms x and y

you need to push state to the client as well as pull state

1376123
constructor	object
move the constructor implementation after the definition of the referral global object

1376123
constructor	object
it would make a little more sense if the constructor did not interact with the map and the submit methods would create the object and then include it in the list.

subclassing	base-class
i have a base-class say base which specifies the abstract methods deep-copy and a myriad of subclassing say a b c .

1376161
deep-copy	object
unfortunately that means that if if i have an object from a subclassing say a of a then i always have to perform an unchecked cast for a more specific deep-copy

1376161
deep-copy	object
i want to guarantee that any deep-copy returns an object of the same runtime class

1376163
for-loop	loops	dictionary	for-loop
the other comments about the test in the for-loop looking suspect are probably correct but in addition if you re getting this segfault the first time you try to go into loops then it s possible that you re working with a dictionary that has no entries

32-bit	64bit
after correcting the code the answer using various gnats on mac os x was 0 using -o2 for all of them but without optimisation gcc 4.3.3 gets 42291 gnat gpl 2009 which is a 64bit compiler gets 16777216 and a recompilation of gnat gpl 2009 for 32-bit gets 1

reliability	high-load
if you re designing a systemd for high-load which usually implies high reliability having a single points of failure is never a good idea

1376272
contains	elements
the problem with using empty is that it also assesses whether an elements contains text nodes as well as elements nodes and if it contains text nodes is not considered empty

1376272
any	set
i don t think that this is the behavior you want .so we can use .length on a wrapped set of the child elementss of a to ascertain whether it has any child elements nodes

the key and value-type are both restrict to the basic .net types bool byte all the int float double guid datetime and string

1376430
synchronous	.when
.when .net 4 is release for example the task-parallel-library will make using a synchronous object asynchronous a trivial task - which means its easy to just write one versioning of your software and allow it to be used asynchronous or synchronous

1376441
webrick	apache
i even reboot webrick though i didn t restart apache proxypass to webrick as i thought that overkill

1376455
constructor	private
you can come reasonably close using nested types and a private constructor though

1376455

cucumber	webrat
i have been using cucumber and webrat for a while

1378354
cursor	row
if i run the stored procedure in this cursor i never get a single row

1378355
contains	any
the best way to think about this is that there are 80 master field and each csv file may contains any subset of those 80 field

1378355
value	field
the data written to the access file must contains all 80 field .so missing field need to be written as null value

1378366
dictionary	map
if you need to map a 1-n relation and map it as dictionary rather then list then read dictionaryionary based collections

1378375
selected	button
i want the user to choose a character button and then continue to the flipviews and in the views the image display should be the one that they have selected on the main view

1378389
contains	any
for example if i have properties as arrays of base-class and my real value can contains derived child classes of any types

1378399
directory	folder
i ve been developing my first iphone .app part-time and would like to start using a more rigorous form of version-control than i ve been using over the past four months copying source code folder to another directory and time stamping them

1378403
value	field
if the csv file is being import into an application by a user then a basic mapping can be done by listing the field in the csv file eg reading in the value from the first row

1378446
perforce	cvs
i just looked in xcode 3.2 though .so it may not be exactly the same and the options for .source control integration are subversion cvs and perforce

1378452
javascript	dom
javascript access parent dom across domains

1378458
versioning	staging
assuming your site uses a database and other server-side service queue web-service other data layer etc. i recommend having a staging environment to hosts the beta pre-prod versioning - complete with manufactured data and pre-prepared demo scenarios

1378486
distance	polygons
test if the next points of the polygons is inside or outside a circle with a radius of detailradius around the current points that is if the distance between the current and the next points is smalleer or larger then detailradius

1378507
arrays	loops	increment	reset
then loops through each of the first arrays value and for each increment the index of arrays by 1 and checked the next arrays and the next column on the first loops it will be 1 and index will be 0 increment - 1 then get arrays 1 - b and .so on if you reach 0 break if you reach right border reset first index to 0

1378526
value	field
for eg address field value

1378526
value	field
those double-quotes appear only if the field value has comma in it otherwise value are not surronded with double-quotes

1378532
repository	entity
whilst this removes the direct reference between entity and repository it doesn t reduce the loc

1378545
for-loop	arrays
make an empty arrays data at the beginning of for-loop

1378563
google-chrome	opera
ie8 ff3.5 google-chrome 2 opera 9.5 correctly rendering these elements without the spacing

1378563
margins	padding
it doesn t appear to matter whether or not the form elements eg inputbox are placed within s or s nor does it seem to matter about padding margins spacing settings

1378569
for-loop	loops
assuming loops length is an integral constants expression the most probable outcome it that a good optimizer will recognize both the for-loop and the memset 0

1378583
concatenation	comma
this would be include in a separate module and .when called would return a concatenation comma separated list of id s

1378585
.net	wcf
wf and wcf are very much hand in hand in .net 4

1378593
sql-server	mysql
my question is similar to this mysql question but intended for sql-server

1378647
contains	elements	contains	set
something to be aware of if you set an outer-element like body or even html but careful to relative it will required an explicit height or it may shrink up or no longer contains visually the child elements

1378664
sql-server	oracle
i m an oracle guy but i believe ms sql-server has support for the connect by clause

1378686
gethashcode	equals
if two object compare as equals the gethashcode methods for each object must return the same value

1378686
gethashcode	equals
however if two object do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different value

1378686
gethashcode	equals
the gethashcode methods for an object must consistently return the same hashcode as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return-value of the object s equals methods

1378686
gethashcode	equals
types that overrides equals must also overrides gethashcode

1378701
selected	listbox
the appscreen will show more info about a item that was selected from a listbox in menu

1378701
selected	button
.so in menu i have a list whit lots of items about 1000 and the users selected one and .when he click a button the appscreen will come showing that item and additional info about it

1378720
ubuntu	linux
i m using qt 4.5 2009.03 on linux gnome ubuntu 9.04 and would like to display video capture by my webcam in a phonon videowidget of my qt application

1378725
gethashcode	equals
types that overrides equals must also overrides gethashcode

1378739
contains	set	key-value	key
if you set the datakey field of the gridview to contains the primary key there is this codeproject article on how to set the selected index of a gridview based on the key-value of the recording using an extension methods

1378759
datagrid	textbox
i have an issue where i have to search rows in a datagrid view based on the key-value given explicit through textbox

1378763
authentication	login
running the project from the visual-studio .net 2008 has absolutely no problem but it doesn t work on iis after click the login button the authentication code run with no error but the login page kept getting reload and reload

1378770
lookup	any
you could return the same value for all instances although this will make any algorithms that use hashing such as dictionary very slow - essentially all instances will be hash to the same bucket and lookup will then become o n instead of the expected o 1

1378770
lookup	any
this of course negates any benefits of using such structures for lookup

1378796
gethashcode	equals
if two object compare as equals the gethashcode methods for each object must return the same value

1378796
gethashcode	equals
do i have to overrides gethashcode and equals in new classes

1378796
gethashcode	equals
overrides equals and gethashcode question

1378796
gethashcode	equals
why is it important to overrides gethashcode .when equals methods is overridess in c#

1378803
python	java
how can i provide input to that program using my program written in say c# java or python

1378812
arrays	loops
you can just put the creator instances within a loops and dynamically add named from an arrays if you .so wish

1378832
show	next
i just want to show next and back links

1378838
triggers	insert
i would like to create an insert triggers on the orderdetails table .so that every time an orderdetail is insert it gets the current value of the unitcost as defined in the product table

1378843
double-quotes	single-quotes
i know i could replace them with single-quotes or use all double-quotes and wrap the string in single-quotes but i m not sure how to use both

1378864
python	c++
it will work for c++ and python thanks to win32 python extension

1378881
dictionary	arrays
complex object and struct arrays collections lists dictionary generics types etc

1378893
value	field
and i want to return only the field named that have value 1 in this case bee

1378893
value	field
i found that by show field i can get the named of the field but how i can say show the field named where field value 1

1378906
updating	updates
i know how to updates it after the exe has finished but its the constants updating that i need

1378924
value	field
in the click event of the save button i iterate through all controls in my form and i retrieve the field value and the field named that refers to the database field that i am saving the value to

1378924
value	field
the click event triggers a postback and it is during the postback that i visit the controls and here is the funny thing the properties value for the database field has become null

1378926
python	ruby
how can i see a list of methods for a particular object in an interactive python shell like i can in ruby you can do that in ruby irb with a .methods after the object

1378955
directory	folder
you should place your view in the views employment folder of your mvc.net application directory

1378995
build-process	ant
the non-dvcs way to handle it is to set up your build-process to read the connection strings from separate configuration file and then preprocess it during the build-process in java you could use ant or maven to filtering from a properties-file i don t know about ms-land

1379010
order	add
by that i mean if you had a complex calculation for total that reuired adding say 5 to order below â 50 and the business changed it to add 10 to order below â 50 it is done in your business-logic code rather than in your storage medium in this case sql

1379045
digits	base
with base being the numbers of digits 2 count of letters in alphabet is that 48

1379046
alfresco	liferay
for examples of such programs checkout alfresco liferay etc

1379047
value	field
the rea.son that i mention indexing is that you haven t specified whether the total is on all the value in a column or on a subset - if it s a subset then the field that make up the filtering may need to be indexed .so as to avoid table scans

1379078
versioning	upgrade
if management is nervous about changing framework versioning you could upgrade to vs2008 and use c# 3 but still target .net 2.0

1379109
versioning	upgrade
it s always easier to upgrade versioning by versioning than it is to jump several versioninging

1379109
versioning	upgrade
upgrade that jumped multiple versioning required a signficantly larger amount of extra code and testing

1379114
value	field
basically you use a compositecollection in your xaml which gives you the ability for instances to have numeric value in your combo-box and the text please select... to designate the placeholder which you can t do if you are binding entirely to numeric field in your model and relying on that to add this magic value

1379116
deployment	install	show	next
if you can make the deployment cost minimal you might roll the 3.5 framework into the next install or something then you ll probably be able to show that the productivity benefits far outweight the costs

1379127
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 2.6.24-19-generic #1 smp wed jun 18 14 43 41 utc 2008 i686 gnu linux

1379155
value	field
you can use a required field validation and set the initial value properties to the value of the item in the dropdownlistfor you do not want selectable

1379163
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
well the file named would be server-side .so it shouldn t matter if you use ie6 or firefox or google-chrome or opera

1379197
32-bit	64bit	versioning	upgrade
.so if you get a new mac with snow leopard or you upgrade to snow leopard it include both a 32-bit and 64bit versioning of java 6

1379197
32-bit	64bit
in addition java 6 in snow leopard default to the 64bit jre on 64bit macs .so if you are calling 32-bit native libs jnis it will fail

1379197
32-bit	64bit
you must call java using the -d32 command-line option to run the 32-bit versioning of the java jre on a 64bit mac with snow leopard

1379202
macros	vba
i m currently in the unfortunate positioning of having to call a vba macros from c# via the com-interop

1379230
typemock	nunit
i am just starting to do test driven development and i am wondering the major difference between rhinomock typemock and nunit s built-in mocking

1379291
for-loop	loops
refer to the other post - looking at for-loop someone thinks the incrementor is declare within loops

1379295
arrays	loops
we still have nested-loopss except that each loops works on a copy of the arrays where key that are currently used by outer loopss have been removed from this loops s arrays

1379303
reflection	runtime
however reflection is slow may have issues with code security and it s not typesafe and may lead to runtime instead of compile-time problems on naming errors due to the late-bound nature

1379303
getter	setter
that said you may want to use getter and or setter methods and use delegation on those

1379311
boost	stl
as to your rationale against boost its templates are an order of a magnitude more flexible than what you can find in stl functional header

1379315
selected	checkbox
once i had selected the checkbox in datagrid then i pressed the delete key the above function is called perfectly but after execution recording didn t get deleted

1379324
children	nodes	contains	elements
nor is the parsing permitted to combine whitespace that appears on either side of an elements .so in this case the dom representation of foo has three children a text nodes contains only whitespace an elements nodes for bar and another text nodes contains only whitespace

1379341
contains	elements
now .when i m adding elements to the treeset and the comparator s compare methods returns 0 it seems like the treeset contains only one of the object with equals ranking

1379358
subclassing	nsobject
the problem seems to be .when uiviewcontroller is made the delegation of the mkmapview a direct subclassing of nsobject seems to work okay

1379375
instrumentation	profiling
do some profiling using the instrumentation .app found in the same directory as xcode

1379391
highlight	selected
list field consumes navigation events from manager to highlight currently selected row with special color

1379394
animation	rotation
using two-stage rotation animation

1379407
nunit	moq	rhino-mocks	moq	rhino-mocks	nunit	rhino-mocks	typemock	typemock	moq	typemock	nunit
typemock is a commercial product meaning you ll have to pay for it but will allow you to mock concrete object - unlike rhino-mocks nunit moq which can only mock an interface abstract-class

1379409
selected	cell
i notice users have to click once to selected the cell and again to edit it

1379413
digits	zero
the digits are a - z and a to z where a is zero and z is 51

1379422
tiff	png
however in the article i believe it explains a way to convert the tiff image to a jpeg or a png which is supported by silverlight

1379427
value	field
the problem was lack of indexes on the value field for example now it works great

1379436
instrumentation	profiling
instrumentation is your friend in this regard and has many excellent profiling tools for finding memory-leaks how much memory you re using detailed tracing of what code is running .when and .so on

1379436
instrumentation	profiling
personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time .when it matters

1379446
png	gif	bmp	png	bmp	gif	tiff	png	tiff	bmp	tiff	gif
a tiff file is a multi-page format .so rendering it is not as simple as a png gif or bmp

1379476
mocking	tdd
a video called tdd - understanding mock object by roy osherove is very helpful in learning the difference of the different mocking libs

1379479
python	java
it is automatically wrapped to python c# java using swig

1379485
nunit	moq
mocking sharepoint classes is not possible with rhinomock moq nunit etc since i believe they required interfaces to mock object rather then being able to mock the actual concrete classes

1379509
png	gif	loading	png	loading	gif
.when you load bitmap from gif png jpg formats they will be opened as an encodedimage anyway and if you do this many time it may beat performance ex 50 seconds to load 14 png from resources to bitmaps on bold avg size 80 kb tuned up to 2 seconds loading into encodedimages

1379523
value	field
thomas is correct - copytodatatable does nothing special to dbnull field value

1379528
jquery	.post
what you could do though is add a temporary jquery .post call to the login page that will run on startup

1379542
hide	show
to switching between the widget i simply hide the one i am leaving and show the one i am going to

1379542
show	next
however this leads to problems if the user resize or move one widget since the next widget will always show up at its default positioning instead of the new one

1379549
document	editing
compiled pdf is refreshed and centered around the portion of the document you re editing

1379549
sweave	latex
if compilation has errors replace the pdf with the results of the compilation latex errors or sweave errors

1379549
sweave	latex
but i would really like to hear about everybody s preferred way of creating sweave and or latex document

1379579
selected	textbox
i mean .when user changes the dropdownlistfor the selected text in dropdown will be filled in related textbox

1379584
populate	row
if that does not work for you you can create a formula field in each subreport that contains a shared variables that you populate the row count of the subreport

1379588
required	checked
you might have to do some checked if you required a unique email-address and you think there might be duplicates

1379596
append	input
what i don t understand is why the 0 is append to the variables in the cint input

1379615
ruby	php
is there a good class repository like pear for php for other languages such as ruby or c#

1379668
directory	folder
ignore the bin and .obj folder for each directory .when it comes to commit as well

1379680
sunos	aix
it seemed to on sunos but always said no on the other two aix hp-ux and i couldn t seem to come up with a libs off the top of my head i could guarantee it would find

1379700
python	ruby
python object have a unified namespace differently from ruby where methods and attributes use different namespaces

1379712
click	mouse
how i personally i would do this would be using sfml since it can very easily handle mouse click in the gui windows

1379719
haskell	python
python has the pypi haskell has the hackage

1379722
filesystems	hardlink
- copying moving the real files to the same filesystems as the svn working-copy and using hardlink instead of symlinks

1379736
scriptaculous	jquery
that said i have switched from prototype scriptaculous to jquery and i m pretty happy with the change

1379737
environment	building
we have a nant task setup to call on tarantino to sync up the other building environment dev qa and run any new change scripting

1379762
jcifs	ntlm
jcifs fully supports all 3 versioning of the ntlm handshake

1379771
alter-column	alter-table
alter-table mytable alter-column mycolumn nvarchar 5 not null

1379771
alter-column	alter-table
alter-table mytable alter-column mycolumn nvarchar 5 not null

1379802
arrays	loops
1 declare the data arrays at the top of loops body where you want to start with a fresh empty arrays

1379805
zipfile	archive
each templates is in a zipfile just edit the desired file in the archive

1379816
gridview	formview
for any column in a gridview or field in a formview or field in a detailview there can only be one templatefield

1379816
show	next
if you want the textbox to show up next to the labels in the normals non-edit mode you would put the textbox within the existing itemtemplate as follows

1379821
player	movie
unfortunatly doesnt seem that the mpmovieplayercontroller gives you the ability to adjust such a feature .so i would say it is not possible right now with the built-in movie player

1379830
any	set
however .some elements do not equals any of these value .so i want to be able to checked which elements in a div do not have a background set via css then apply a background

1379837
page-fault	kernel
the kernel will bugcheck immediately if it has a page-fault at dispatch_level or higher

1379840
msbuild	nant
good tools include capistrano fabric and ant if you re on windows you might also consider nant or msbuild

1379845
while-loop	for-loop
in the specific case of an infinite-loop i might choose a for-loop over a while-loop for that reason

1379878
directory	folder
it obviously is looking on the wrong directory cause the project folder is in my desktop

1379879
methodology	waterfall
i had that idea because a i think our current bulky desktop internal 6+ years old application suite needs a major face lift and b instead of continuing our waterfall development methodology which usually resulted in a project canned after tens of people spending months on something that no user cares about

1379885
contains	elements
also has is for elementss contains elementss a has b means selected all a elementss contains at least one b elements

1379890
entity-framework	ado.net
but i don t know anything at all about linq entity-framework ado.net delegation asp.net-ajax asp.net-mvc providers the different api s provided with asp.net such as membership the default controls that come with asp.net as well as the normals patterns used to create rich stable and high performance asp.net sites

1379911
arrays	loops
loops through the list of named object building an object arrays from each of the field

1379943
default	reset
how do i reset building settings to default in xcode

1379969
stderr	stdout
i don t see any sort of logfile and no output is written to stdout or stderr

1379986
default	reset
i m not certain what you mean by reset but if you mean set to default i have an overview of it in an article on moving to xcconfig files

1379995
interpreter	runtime
.so the runtime systemd will try to interpreter characters in the file as recording marks and get confused

1380007
compatibility	legacy
there is almost no advantage to bdb and i think it is only around for legacy compatibility

1380017
binary	hex
a hash-function might be defined to avoid â fixed pointsâ where hash x x but your hash-quine differs a little in that you re taking the string representation in hex of the hash rather than the raw binary

1380047
scite	vim
aside from eclipse i also generally have a lightweight editor like scite or vim -- depending on the platform i m working on

1380071
variables	boolean	boolean	int
you should also ensure that get_original_passhash is returning the right types of variables - int string boolean etc

1380087
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
if static member inherited were feasible i would place the factory-method in the base-class and use a virtual-method call to the derived-class to obtain the types from which a concrete instances must be initializer

1380089
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work fine in google-chrome ie firefox

1380096
updating	updates
if you have to fake it i would recommend sharing with the development environment and just realize that updating production make cause unexpected downtime during the updates as you validation everything works

1380121
web2py	django
once you ve learned web2py you have to be careful learning django that you start fresh with no translation from old concepts to new

1380126
mocking	tdd
part of the benefits of tdd is that by embracing the limitations of mocking frameworks you will design better code

1380138
entity-framework	data-access
.so for example you might pick linq-to-sql or the entity-framework for your data-access side

1380139
triggers	insert	contains	any
i know that in an insert triggers old doesn t contains any data but i m not sure how this affects the evaluation of a .when clause for that triggers

1380139
triggers	insert
and i want to modify this triggers to only run on an updates .when foo was previously null but always run on an insert i could satisfy the updates part of the change by adding a where-clause

1380139
triggers	insert	updating	updates
i m aware that i could split the insert and updates triggerss or use insert updating deleting in the triggers body but i d rather not in the case that inspired this question

1380147
httpwebrequest	webrequest
the webrequest class has several subclassing including httpwebrequest and ftpwebreuest

1380148
selected	button	selected	listbox
i want to disable the button unless 1 item in the listbox is selected

1380152
scp	ssh	ftp	scp	ftp	ssh
i can t tell you how well the ftp methods works in general as i usually work with scp or ssh

1380170
constructor	object
here s .some code that uses factory + member initializer methods that is called by constructor and it s protected .so you don t have to worry that .someone will call it again after creating an object

1380175
icollection	ienumerable
use icollection product or ienumerable product or iproduct productbase . br

1380185
arrays	loops
the regex pull each attributes excludes the tag named and puts the results in an arrays .so you will be able to loops over the first and second attributess

1380202
selected	listbox
edit asp listbox rendering to html as selected as the code above

1380203
dialog	pop-up
pop-up is a dialog extended from a jframe

1380203
variables	boolean	dialog	pop-up
i tried using a boolean variables and a loops to checked if .something was entered in the pop-up but it doesnt work the dialog is desplayed but there is not textfield or ok button .so the only thing i can do is to kill it

1380233
python	java
the google-app-engine lets you use python or java

1380243
cassini	iis
why does the application-restart automatically .when we create a new folder under a website in iis 7.0 or cassini

1380263
webserver	upload
then we upload those files to a webserver

1380273
dialog	pop-up
if possible you should re-implement pop-up to inherited from dialog instead of jframe and call dialog s setmodal true methods which will prevent subsequent code from running until the dialog is dismissed

1380279
latitude-longitude	location	accelerometer	magnetometer
i can use latitude-longitude to detection physical location i can use the magnetometer to figure out the directions they re facing and i might be able to use the accelerometer to figure out how their device is oriented but i can t figure out a way to get height of the device off the floor

1380296
tostring	equals
you ll get 714341252076979100 instead of this numbers because tostring as describe by ecma-262 â 9.8.1 works with powers of ten and in 53 bit precision all these numberss are equals

1380324
accelerometer	magnetometer
the closest i could see you getting to what you re looking for is using the accelerometer magnetometer as an inertial tracker

1380334
push	pull
google was at least initially going to implements a gchat api you could use for a push pull implementsation

1380352
web-config	app-config
normally we store connectionstrings and some other settings in the web-config or app-config

1380364
boolean	int
as written the boolean conversion will also succeed to convert to any int types

1380364
defined	declare
the technique to declare and initializer a variables is most often used together with dynamic_cast though but can be perfectly used together with a user defined types like above too

1380364
arguments	default
note that syntactically you have to initializer the variables using the form like for a default arguments

1380369
boost-serialization	boost
boost has a very nice serialization deserialization .lib boost-serialization

1380390
copy-constructor	constructor
most compilers would elide the copy-constructor in such an initializer .when optimizations are enabled but an accessible constructor is required nonetheless

1380435
least-squares	regression
if you want to also be able to do common linear algebra operations solving systemd least-squares regression decomposition etc. look into lapack

1380465

the mechanism is called type-erasure the constructor accepts object of arbitrary types and then stores an object encapsulated into an object that you may reach through virtual function-calls boost-function is optimized like hell using its own vtable and stack-allocation to avoid new for small types and .so on

1381164
triggers	insert
just fire a triggers on updates and insert using that function around your passwd and you have avoided storing plain text passwd

1381334
postgresql	oracle
i have done simple python utilities that show schema info for informix oracle and postgresql

1381340

safari and ie will checked against the documentâ s ready state....finally in case all else fails the onload event will bring up the rear. perhaps a setinterval similar to my settimeout above could be the penultimate course of action before relying on onload as a last resort

1381485
hash	md5	salt	md5
hashtype is either sha1 or md5 salt is a random string used to salt the raw passwd and at last comes the hash itself

64bit	x86
if the application you are trying to use to connect to oracle install into the c program files x86 path on 64bit machine you will have to change the install path to something that doesn t have the in it like c program files_x86 due to a known bug in the oracle drivers that has yet to be fixed to my knowledge

1382252
python	ruby
under xcode 3.2 my objective-c + python ruby project can still be opened updates and compiled but you cannot create new project

shell	bash
etc .profile is read .when bash is invoked as login shell .so al.so checked if bash is started with the --login -l option this usually happens from msys.bat

1382565
required	checked
dynamic_cast is safe but slow because it checked and therefore required rtti info

1382569

subtract	add
one sensible way to handle this would be to compute internally with ordinary numbers which go from positive to negative at zero and only add subtract 100 for presentation

1382678
value	field
instead of fifa10 i d like to have the value of a custom field with the key name-of-game in there

1382681
scripting	shebang
one can write scripting that omit the shebang relying on the default shell

1382694
oracle	mysql
oracle and probably mysql will fetch a few 100 rows at a time to decrease the amount of round trips to the database

1382706
http-get	get
fetching too much data before being able to process any of it assuming it s blocking io - if you make 100 request to 100 different servers you re suddenly going to get a flood of data back to you - http-get request are small - the response possibly not

1382711

1382914
data-structures	tree
ravadre has pointed to search tree based data-structures

1382914
hashtable	sorted
if you need to access the elements in sorted order using hashtable is not advisable

1382914
hashtable	sorted
however if you do not need sorted items go with a hashtable access time is o 1 on average and although this depends on a lot of factors it is often still far superior to access time in tree-based structures

1382918
dictionary	arrays	dictionary	map	arrays	map
if you store the dictionary itself in an arrays the value to which the words key map could be just a list of the indic of the dictionary entries in the arrays in whose description the words appears

1383060
32-bit	64bit
most of the time maybe always i m not really sure you can run binaries compiled for 32-bit even if your systemd is 64bit

1383060
32-bit	64bit
if your macbook is a recent one it has 64bit support core 2 duo processor if it is an older versioning core duo it is 32-bit

value	field
another problem is that browsers do not allow to get value of passwd field .so i can t create a new and set its value to the passwd s one

1383162
alter-column	alter-table
you could change the default-value on the database to be 0000-00-00 using a proper sql alter-table alter-column ..

1383164
debian	linux
remember the software should still have the cross-platform functionality and if it is not possible then how can i made it for debian linux as i have made it on windows

in the same activation page the user is asked for passwd which must be hash to the the same value as in cookies and any other information necessary for the account creation

1383331
activation	account
upon submission of the activation page a new account is created

1383336
constructor	private
i am bit confused in the usage of static-class private constructor and abstract-class

1383347
constructor	private	instances	private
a private constructor ensures that only code inside the class itself can create instancess of it a static methods or an instances methods in an already existing instances

1383347
base-class	inherited
even if you inherited from the class it still has to call the creation process of the base-class .so there is no way around it

1383348
constructor	private
a private constructor was the pre .net 2 way of preventing somebody from initializer a class using new - in .net 2 the static constructor was introduced

1383350
static-classes	inherited	static-classes	base-class	base-class	inherited
static-classes cannot be used as a base-class for inherited and can only contains static-members

1383350
abstract-class	base-class	base-class	inherited
abstract-class cannot be initializer at all and are useful only as a base-class for inherited

1383350
abstract	sealed
they can provide abstract memebers with no implementation that the derived-class must overrides they can provide virtual members with default implementation that the derived-class may overrides or they can provide regular sealed members that provide common functionality

1383350
constructor	private
private constructor typically found in non-abstract non-static classes prevent the class from being initializer with no parameters initialization

1383355
cos	sin
static-class may be considered a bunch of methods - you would use it if you just need to grouping some methods sample usage mathhelpers with methods like sin cos convertxtoy or to hosts extension methods

1383355
constructor	private	constructor	object
private constructor - this one you would use .when you want to be able to control how the object is created for example if you want to make sure that those object can only be created by your static-methods

1383383
contains	any
value may contains a struct or any

1383383
contains	any
may contains an arrays or any other

1383384
eclipse-plugin	aptana
you can also install aptana as eclipse-plugin

1383386
contains	elements
ids must be unique in a document .so there is only one elements with one specific id while a class can contains multiple elementss and an elements can be in multiple classes

1383402

1383402
getter	setter
note the below methods doesn t actually work for setter only getter

1383403
textbox	button
the panels has a few textbox named age favourite sports team and a save changes button

1383403
selected	checkbox
the idea is that .when the user selected a person in the datagridview by checked the appropriate checkbox then the panels show the relevant data for that person named age fav sports team by pulling the data from a database

1383403
textbox	button
if the user would like to updates the per.son s details they can do .so by typing in the textbox and then click the save changes button

1383403
checkbox	button
suppose a user checked a checkbox reviews the data and does not make any changes and then checked another checkbox and decides to updates the data by click the save changes button

1383403
selected	checkbox
if a i selected five different people using the checkbox and then hit save changes i get five updates successful messages

1383403
instances	destroy
it feels like each time a checkedbox is click i need to checked if an instances of updatepanel exists and then destroy it

1383428
selection	cell
.when you enter edit mode for a uitableview grouping but i believe this applies for the other types as well the cell shrink to the right to accommodate the delete selection button

1383514
twitter	bit.ly
you can use bit.ly twitter uses this

1383528
trackpad	mouse

however .when i use xamlwriter.save to serialization this the properties does not appear as an attributes in the string which is produced

1383674
command-line	cmd
you need three things a base kit that inclues tk which will become part of the wrapped application sdx.kit a tclkit that has the cmd that do the wrapping and the command-line versioning of tclkit from which sdx.kit will be run

1383704
utility	gnu
using the non-standard gnu extension sed utility from the command-line

1383709
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1383718
printf	strcat
if your strings are large the time spent copying the data will drown out the difference between strcat printf

1383719
hidden-field	input-field
it s al.so worth noting that hidden input-field are not foster parented .so if c had been a hidden-field the order on submission would be a b c

1383738
duplicates	lookup	value	field
this also show how to create a guava kind of dictionary to lookup matching items given a field value that might be duplicates across items

1383743
attributes	properties
well then clearly you must use a properties that updates all the relevant dictionary as well as the instances s attributes

1383755
attributes	properties
is there any way to tell my system.xml.serialization.xmlserializationr to ignore the fact that some properties have that attributes and that it should serialization everything in the object

1383755
attributes	properties
i could probably obtain the source and recompile it without the xmlignore attributes but it d be nice if xmlserializer had some nice overrides properties like

1383787
contains	set
i d start with minimal set of tags and attributes and add new ones as needed being especially careful of anything that may contains url

1383788
getter	setter
the properties must be public and have a getter and setter to be serialization

1383804
contains	elements
as for the dot in elements named if you go to the xml specifications for start tags you ll see that it contains a named which is itself made of a namedstartchar and a sequences of namedchar

1383804
contains	set
the namechar set happens to contains the character . .so having a

1383823
put	get
i received a .post on the kvm news grouping on the topic that states there is a bug in the jadtool and the author claims to have field a bug report and .posted a patch l kvm-interest f s p 9858 one interesting note that was al.so .posted was that the cert jad params are static .so once you get them from the wtk correctly you can put them statically in the ant script.

1383823
required	checked
to rectify this go to tools - manager - menu - settings - online certif checked on off required there is also a default address setting

1383823
required	checked
if the online control setting is required the checked will fail if there is no default address

1383835
printf	strcat
printf is designed to handle far more than just strings strcat is specialist

1383835
printf	strcat
.so here strcat is faster by far your milage may vary depending on compiler and options despite the inherent inefficiency of the cstring conventions and supports my original suggestion that printf carries a lot of baggage not required for this purpose

1383843
actionlistener	focuslistener
what you want is a focuslistener not an actionlistener

1383863
scripting	shebang
usr local bin python shebang in a python scripting it will run and in applications python 2.6 the python launchd is made default application to run .py files which uses usr local bin pythonw and libs frameworks python.framework versioning 2.6 bin is created and added to the front of the path .so which python will get the python in there and al.so #

1383864
any	set
as for the minimal set of characters to allow to be visible to shell you are better off not letting any characters be seen by the shell

1383868
constructor	private	instances	private
i understand that a class having private constructor prevents instances creation

1383868
constructor	private	instances	private
my question is if a class with a private constructor prevents instances creation why does that class support having a non-private constructor

1383871
coalesce	isnull
as you can see the structure of both line is the same - only coalesce in-place of isnull

1383871
coalesce	isnull
tags wpf sql coalesce isnull rowfilter

1383874
constructor	private	instances	private
adding a private constructor to a class doesn t mean that you won t be able to create instances of that class

1383879
constructor	private
private constructor don t only prevent initializer from the outside world - they often enable construction from within the class

1383879
constructor	private
indeed the only reason a private constructor is often used to prevent initializer is to avoid the compiler adding a public parameterless constructor by default

1383879
constructor	private
that s the only way in which a private constructor hinders other callers

1383879
constructor	private
that s just one situation in which a private constructor makes a lot of sense

1383884
fadein	hide
simply set the logo s styles to display hidden and call fadein instead of first calling hide

1383885
constructor	private
also if you have a private constructor that takes arguments and a public constructor that takes no arguments you can still call the private constructor from the public one

1383893
put	get
but .when i put the same html file in a subdirectories tmp rewrite sub and try to access tmp rewrite sub alice.html i get alice

1383897
derived-class	base-class
if base-class function is virtual then if you overrides that function in derived-class it is implicit virtual even if you don t specify explicit

1383900
bimap	map
use a map implementation built for this like the bimap from google collections

1383906
build-server	msbuild
it must also work with msbuild because we run all the other unit tests automatically in the build-server

1383908
contains	elements
elements contains patterns which are generally relative to base dir

1383911
relocation	linker
programs make call to a shared libs through a procedure linkage table which is filled in by the dynamic linker loader ld.so based on the information in the dynamic symbols table and relocation entries

1383912
hide	show
i use this placeholder tag to show and hide the child

1383912
contains	set
i want to use this button to set the visibility of the contains placeholder

1383917
oracle	mysql
commercial and open source package for odbc and jdbc connections including connections into rms files and package and tools for connections into databases including oracle rdb oracle classic mysql or otherwise are available for openvms

1383918
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
coming from somewhere else my background is cakephp and ruby-on-rails

1383918
asp.net-mvc	webforms
a webforms project if designed right can have most of the benefits of asp.net-mvc

1383918
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
asp.net-mvc is simply another alternative to draw in ruby-on-rails and cakephp developers such as myself p

1383926
constructor	private
in the context of this question constructor act like any other methods - private ones are inaccessible from outside the class while public ones are accessible

1383926
constructor	private
as jon mentioned usually adding a private constructor with no parameters simply prevents the compiler from adding a default public constructor with no parameters

1383926
constructor	private
if there already exists another constructor in the class private parameterless or otherwise the compiler will not add this default-constructor

1383926
constructor	private	instances	private
.so a private constructor doesn t prevent instances creation - it simply limits instances creation to being done only within a methods of the class perhaps a public static methods

1383926
constructor	private
and that only pertains to the usage of that particular private constructor

1383931
.when	ready
however it still reads and bufferinging data in the background .so that .when you call read again the next row is ready waiting in the buffering and it doesn t have to go to the database

1383941
content-management-system	multisite
i m going to write a multisite content-management-system in asp.net

1383946
uilabel	uiview
it is a uiview with two uibarbuttonitem subviews and one or two uilabel for the day and date text

1383949
aggregate-functions	sum
but your query doesn t have any aggregate-functions like sum or count

1383949
order	join
i d order category_id first in that primary key .so the join can take advantage of the index

1383965
margins	padding
you can then apply the formatting margins padding etc. that you want

1383970
malloc	free
then i added a malloc and free inside loops

1383970
printf	strlen	malloc	free
.so malloc + strlen + free do not dominate the .profile enough to make avoiding printf worth while

1383972
masstransit	nservicebus
i have looked into nservicebus and masstransit

1384009
contains	any
assume a systemd that contains only the basic perl installation without any extra cpan modules lwp is hence not install

1384011
put	get
insert in the database the information about the module and about that top section of the templates you should totally create a table in the database about templates structure .so the systemd can know where to put every module related with every page and just use the systemd to get the module needed in every page request to the right positioning making it load its own view s into that place

1384012
required	checked
the _once siblings of include and required will force php to checked if the file has already been include requiredd and if .so not include required it again thereby preventing cannot redeclare x function.

1384022
cursor	row
one of the more noteworthy improvements in db2 9.7 release in june 2009 is an enhancement to cursor stability isolation that provides access to the currently committed versioning of a locked row

1384023
selected	cell
after selected a game cell

1384029
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
for example the datatemplate for the ferryviewmodel contains an itemscontrol with a itemspanel of types canvas to be able to positioning the trucks and an itemtemplate that was a datatemplate for truckviewmodel

1384044
constructor	object
note this arguments will be compared against the first parameter of the constructor and against the implicit object parameter of the conversion functions

1384055
vb.net	vb6	vb.net	vba	vbscript	vb6	vbscript	vb.net	vbscript	vba	vba	vb6
vbscript is a variety of vb just as vb6 vba and vb.net are

1384067
key-value	key
you will need to request an .app lock on a string descriptor o the resource like the key-value or a checksum of the key or it s lockres value

1384068
linked-list	nodes
and internally treemap works similarly to linked-list nodes are just linked with references

1384078
value	field
you just need to test the value of the field after each keystroke and before it is sent to the field for example with a keypress event handler - if the new keystroke would create a value too high then reject the key press

1384078
value	field
basically the only third character that you should allow is 0 and only if the current field value is 10

1384087
copy-constructor	constructor
it seems msvs2008 has its own opinion about constructor selection it call copy-constructor in b regardless of constness of a s operators

1384095
fflush	fgets
you can replace your scanf with a combinations of fgets and sscanf and you can do away with fflush stdin

1384098
contains	elements
n items in this structure are stored in a contiguous arrays which is divided in sqrt n chunkss of sqrt n contiguous elements perhaps the last chunks contains less elements

1384098
division	modulo
to access an elements you should determine what chunks it s in takes one division and do a proper shift within the ring buffering sum and modulo

1384100
convenience-methods	initializer
the class was intially static but i added the possibility to initializer it as an object to allow extends with new convenience-methods in future versioning without the need for a lot of parameter parsing

1384111
vbscript	basic
vbscript is a lightweight subset of visual basic with limited syntax that is used for scripting purposes like routine task automation rather than application development

1384125
g++	gcc
i need to implements a simple graphical messagebox for a linux sdl application similar to the windows messagebox in c++ gcc g++ 4.4.0

1384125
motif	x11
x11 motif openmotif has what i need xmcreate error|warning|infodialog but these need a parent widget top level windows which i don t have and do not accept a null parameter for these

1384128
vb.net	vb6	basic	vb6
.so to clear things up a bit both vb6 and vb.net are dialects of the visual basic language family letâ s call it that

1384128
python	ruby
the only aspects in which they actually resemble each other apart from said syntax similarity is that they both are very well suited for rapid application development rad â at least until youâ ve tried dynamic-languages such as python or ruby in combinations with gui agile frameworks such as shoes

1384128
vb.net	vb6
the difference between vb and vb.net are even bigger by some metrics because no complete vb6 code is valid vb.net

1384128
vb.net	vb6
saying like kibbee that the compilers of vb6 and vb.net are â œbasically the sameâ is flat out wrong

1384128
vb.net	vb6
let me sum up the main points of this rather long posting .so it doesnâ t get lost just like java and javascript vb6 and vb.net have very similar named and for very much the same rea.son too marketing but this is entirely misleading

1384137
javascript	dom
this approach might slow down casual users from viewing source use jquery s load methods or corresponding call in the javascript libs of your choice to inject html into the dom after the page has been loaded

1384146
data-access	ado.net
disconnect architecture is not well suited for desktop clients with multiple updates but most tutorials are oriented towards disconnect ado.net would like to see tuts on connect data-access architecture

1384157
motif	x11
looks like you will have to create a top-level x11 motif windows

1384165
dependency-injection	inject
customerservice is your business level class for instances where you can inject some customerdao with dependency-injection using an inversion-of-control containers

1384166
unsigned	bigint
you can get up to 4 billions if you use unsigned int but beyond that you have to use the bigint libs

1384191
abstract	extends
i am trying to extends the mysqli class to make a helpers class that will abstract away some of the complexities

1384206
put	get
to get a list of everything available on the iphone put this little snippet in your applicationdidfinishlaunching delegation methods and look at the log output

1384208
hide	show
i am wanting to use jquery to do a show hide of a div from a text link

1384208
hide	show
for making it generics it could be where i assign a div that is show hidden with an id like id toggle-hide-1 and just change the numbers in my page to make it a different show hide area

1384208
hide	show
i could just named the id using a named that will make the function show hide a div and to seperate it from other divs that show hide on a page i could add a numbers to it

1384208
hide	show
below is partials code that will do a show hide of a div on a link click but is not exactly what i need

1384223
shell	bash
i ripped all the non-versioning specific symlinks out leaving python2.5 python2.6 etc and wrote a bash shell scripting that i can run as root to change one symlink i use to direct the path to the versioning of my choice

1384227
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
not sure about firefox google-chrome safari - test those yourself

1384228
persistent	transient
i realize that the rabbit hole goes deep .when it comes to different types of transient state but simply persistent object loaded class definitions would be useful to me

1384236
hash	md5
i have a field in my users table called session_key varchar 255 in which i store the users ip-address hash with md5

1384236
hash	md5
.when they login and if they have checked a checkbox named autologin it will store their md5 hash ip-address in field session_key

1384240
vbscript	vb.net
i don t know of any tool that is designed to take asp or at least vbscript and convert to vb.net

1384240
vb.net	vb6
however vs does have a tool for converting vb6 to vb.net

1384240
vbscript	vb6
it may be possible for you massage or at least cut n paste chunks of you vbscript and pretend its vb6 code then get the tool convert it

1384243
firefox	safari
in firefox all is normals but in safari there is a tiny flash after the hide animation where the full bar is visible

1384243
firefox	safari
luckily its in safari and not firefox but still not very fun.

1384257
put	get
2 then i nead to get content from database and put it in a webpage and show it

1384260
subclassing	base-class
i ve factored out eaglview into a base-class and i m subclassing it in 3 different opengl views to make 3 transparency layer

1384269
value	field
the left panels in the below screenshot demonstrates inspector field value

1384278
contains	any
1a yes if the textarea will accept text in any language as long as you have the webpage that contains it encode in utf-8

1384291
fltk	gtk
fltk gtk and qt support opengl widget in a portable way

1384291
cairo	gtk
it s also worth points out that cairo has an opengl backend and there are a numbers of toolkits that depend on it including gtk

1384298
put	get
because this location will be exactly the same as the uri of the put request except that it should be a get request is that okay

1384309
instances	private
this transactional class for example nettransactional should keep a private static list of all active transactionalal and should store the result handler function in a private instances variables that is to be called .when a transactional completes on result on status or on timeout

1384320
python	php
hey gang i m trying to convert a legacy php scripting over to python and not having much luck

1384348
16-bit	8bit
i have one function that operates on a 16-bit int value which is an upscaled 8bit value

1384369
selectedindex	selecteditem
i did a test where i temporary replace the viewmodel selecteditem properties with a selectedindex properties and i bound that to the listbox.selectedindex properties

1384395
value	field
you get the value of a wordpress custom field with get_post_meta

1384396
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
i am creating a website and using linq-to-sql as a data-access-layer and i am willing to make the website can work on both linq-to-sql and ado entity-framework without changing many things in the other layer business-logic-layer or user-interface layer

1384396
entity-framework	ado.net
my question is if i need to switching to ado.net entity-framework i will need to edit this constructor line or there is a better solution for this

1384407
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
if you re tiering your application then that part would go in the business-logic-layer and the repository would be in the data-access-layer

1384416
csv	xml
the above code example happens to get a csv file but in most cases that web service will give you a xml file or even document

1384418
selected	listbox
i ask myself what s the points of adding a mouse-click gestures to a listbox if i cannot get to the selected value

1384418
expression-blend	wpf
apart from the fact that droves of code-behind code defeats some of the purpose of wpf in the first place it makes the user-interface designers working in expression-blend less empowered

1384438
signals	sigint
updates on linux you can attach signals handler for sigterm and or sigkill and or sigint and hopefully close down the connection in an orderly way from the client

1384440
double	int
.when assign to a double either will work since the int can be cast in a widening conversion

1384447
order	join
as many accesses against the orderlineitem table will be order join orderlineitem using orderid or some variation of that this is often handy

1384448
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it works just fine in everyone browser that i test firefox opera google-chrome safari but inside ie7 don t want to inject my external php file into predefined div

1384450
double	int
it really doesn t matter to the compiler whether you initializer floats or double with int literals

1384468
click	mouse
it is kindof a standards lasso control the user can click and drag and it will draw a box from the initial click points to the mouse s current location

1384470
beautifulsoup	lxml
i m converting some html-parsing code from beautifulsoup to lxml

1384479
linux	unix
the fulltext search comes with the same set of built-in dictionary as on unix linux which is pretty good coverage

1384479
installation	building
if you required custom dictionary they also work equally well on windows but you are likely going to have a harder time building the installation of them there

1384492
background-image	background-color
for example i don t want to use dirty trick of background-image to rendering background-color and border because the website allows changing color

1384493
http-get	get
i want to get it with a http-get call

1384518
jquery	.post
using a lightweight jquery call to do the .post but then expecting a full control hierarchy in the code-behind to pull data out

1384522
javascript	dom
i can currently do this by having .some javascript that insert html into the dom of the page but i d like the html to be display at a higher level within the browser .so that the block remains if the user browses to a new page or switches tabs

1384541
hotmail	gmail
checked to see if the previous owner used it for spam by sending test email to your test account at hotmail yahoo gmail etc

1384546
order	add	repository	entity
the order repository can call on the customer repository to return a customer entity that fulfils that role and add it to the order aggregate

1384546
repository	entity
the icustomercreditbalance acts both as a marker interface to your customer repository to tell it what you need the customer for .so it can create the appropriate customer entity and it has the methods and or properties on it to support the specific role

1384546
repository	entity
it s all about letting the repository know just what role you want for the entity it returns

1384557
.net	wcf	asp.net-mvc	wcf
i am guessing one can use the .net asp.net-mvc to create web-applications that have both a front end and an api points but i am not sure if the safe way of buildinging the api is to building it with wcf and then use it in the asp.net-mvc as a controllers

1384563
instances	destroy
once no more references to a particular instances of class a exist its instances of class b is destroy

1384563
instances	destroy
once there are no more references to a particular instances of class a its instances of class b will not be destroy

1384573
javascript	dom
in this javascript based game he extended table elements in the dom

1384579
difference	factors
if you don t required supreme accuracy then you calculate your distance using pythagoras s theorem remembering the cosine variation in longitude and the factors 2 unit difference 360-degrees of longitude but only 180 of latitude

1384581
asp.net-mvc	wcf
clearly wcf is designed specifically for creating rest endpoint with all of the security implications that are implied thereof whereas asp.net-mvc is designed to create rest endpoint which can be used by asp.net-mvc itself

1384581
json	xml
create rest api using asp.net-mvc that speaks both json and plain xml

1384581
asp.net-mvc	wcf

physics-engine	chipmunk
my problem is that cocos2d-x s physics-engine i m talking about chipmunk lies in a world behind sprites

1384603
contains	elements
basically for it would mean this list contains elements all of a certain types which is a subtyping of streethelpdata.

1384613
duplicates	elements
you can easily duplicates the behavior by not just positioning both of the fixed elementss separately or using other positioning to alter the child s positioning within the fixed elements

1384614
create-table	insert-into
however because i m not writing the query to insert-into __sysobjets sql-server does that in response to create-table i can t do this

1384622
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade to xcode 3.2 and i m searching for the offline documentation reference libs that was always available for the previous versioning of xcode

1384623
jfreechart	swing
a sample code for swing is available here if you don t need anything fancy or special it may be easier than jfreechart because of the direct available documentation

1384624
expression-blend	silverlight
but being relatively new to silverlight and expression-blend 3 i m not sure how to go about this

1384634
templating	mako	genshi	mako
i ve been considering a templating solution although my choices are between mako and genshi

1384634
templating	mako	genshi	mako
i find templating in genshi a bit ugly .so i m shifting more towards mako

1384642
subclassing	inherited
summary a subclassing inherited all the

are not inherited by subclassing but

1384644
python	java	mergesort	timsort
timsort a stable adaptive imperative natural mergesort variant is especially suited to languages with reference-to-object semantics like python and java where data movement is relatively cheap since all that s ever being move is references aka pointers not blobs of unbounded size

1384650
contains	elements
they re positioning the same as absolutely positioning elements relative to their contains block

1384650
contains	elements
if the elements has positioning fixed the contains block is established by the viewport in the case of continuous media ...

1384650
contains	elements
if the elements has positioning absolute the contains block is established by the nearest ancestry with a positioning of absolute relative or fixed ...

1384650
contains	elements	contains	any
which suggests that while their positioning algorithm is the same they re both positioning relative to their contains block the contains block for fixed elements is always the viewport in contrast with ab.solutely positioning elements .so they should be positioning relative to that and not to any ab.solutely or fixed-positioning elements

1384652
zipfile	archive
it will decompile all classes from your archive and save their sources into another zipfile

the system.drawing.bitmap class can handle opening and saving any kind of bitmap image including jpg png gif bmp and others

1384676
arrays	loops
supposing you are using .post and not get .so you will have to loops through all value in that arrays

1384705
touch	drag
or if you just want it if you touch the child imageview add a uibarbuttonitem drag it over the child and set it as a custom button will make it invisible

1384706
children	nodes
for each variables nodes xml in children

1384706
debugging	trace
trace s should only exist during debugging and should disappear asap

1384714
binary-tree	nodes
i like andrã hoffmann s idea of using a binary-tree in which every leaf nodes corresponds to a question and every intermediate nodes stores the sum of the weight of its child nodess

1384714
binary-tree	tree
.so my suggestion is to use a self-balancing binary-tree a red-black tree avl tree etc which is order by the question id

1384714
children	nodes	children	tree
operations on the tree need to maintain the properties that the weight of any nodes is equals to the sum of the weight of its children

1384736
haskell	scala	haskell	erlang	erlang	scala
maybe i just don t have enough real-life experience with say erlang scala or haskell s relatively-new software transactional-memory to see how wonderfully they scale to high utilization of tens or hundrends of thousands of cores on low-qps high-work-per-q workloads.

python	c++	python	java
with explicit carefully crafted architecture python is surely no worse than java c# or c++ at handling such scenarios in my working experience at least

viewwillappear	viewdidappear
you ll still need to make field the first-responder in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

1384776
linux	bsd
use bsd instead or linux with apache

1384776
linux	bsd	openbsd	bsd	openbsd	linux
centos if linux and openbsd if bsd my suggestions

1384795
arrays	loops
if it is impossible to loops the http elements i can building an arrays and than loops that

1384804
short	base
short answer you can t with base mysql

1384811
subtraction	addition	subtraction	division	order-of-operations	parentheses	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	exponentiation	multiplication	subtraction	exponentiation	addition	exponentiation	division
i challenge you to write a mathematical expression evaluator that respects pemdas order-of-operations parentheses exponentiation multiplication division addition subtraction without using regular expression a pre-existing eval -like function a parsing libs etc

1384811
multiplication	division
give multiplication and division equals precedence

1384811
subtraction	addition
give addition and subtraction equals precedence

1384818
arrays	loops
i use something like the following to loops through an unknown numbers of arrays items

1384831
m2crypto	openssl
i ve just done such a survey last week and adopted m2crypto that seems to be the most advanced wrapper today above openssl found it in several recommandation lists while googling

1384831
m2crypto	pycrypto
i also tried pycrypto but it miss certificates management and standards key file-format management that m2crypto has with pycrypto you have to pickle unpicle your key or write your own key manager for common formats

1384833
constructor	object
like my thinking was the object gets passed into the constructor and what ever is in it gets set into the user properties in the taskserviceclass

1384844
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays	arrays	loops
use a for-loop to adjust all value ot their numerical counterpart do arrays i arrays i - 0 in loops

1384855
erlang	python
other process certainly can. still python threads aren t like erlang threads start enough of them and it ll start to hurt

1384858
contains	elements
similarly mock_args expands to all of the elementss of mock_args as separate words whether or not they contains spaces hence each elements of mock_args becomes an elements of cmd with no quote-parsing confusion

1384858
double-quotes	spaces
note that this will handle spaces in parameters and blank parameters but not for instances double-quotes inside parameters

1384881
numeric	digits
fgetc reads characters one-at-a-time from a filehandle - the common trick to convert a digits stored as a char to a numeric value is x - 0 where x is the digits character

1384881
malloc	free
malloc can make a dynamically-allocated arrays of whatever size you want for you but you ll have to free it .when you re done

1384881
fseek	ftell
to get the file size use stat on most unix-like systemd or for a more portable approach use fseek and ftell to find it

1384883
javascript	dom
.so all in all i d recommend having at least a rudimentary knowledge of the dom and javascript syntax and functionality before doing jquery

1384884
jquery	.post
the website you have linked to does a .post of the form ajaxuploadform using the jquery ajaxform function

1384900
postgresql	mysql
.when i try to use phpinfo printing out database support i can see mysql is there but not postgresql

1384900
postgresql	mysql
i was wondering why mysql is ok but why not postgresql

1384908
any	set
these are basically javascript generator div elements...but do any one of you know a good libs set of controls that can be used to achieve these styling effects

1384913
google-chrome	firefox
work all in firefox 3.x ie 7 or higher google-chrome

1384916
highlight	selected
how to make its value selected make it highlight

1384917
any	set
do any one of you know a good libs set of controls that can be used to achieve these styling effects

1384917
margins	padding
everything in .so is essentially a normals html box div with borders margins and padding and other plain and simple css settings

1384932
decrement	increment
overload the model.put .so that it increment the counter .when the model is saved for the first time and similarly overload model.delete to decrement the counter

1384988
required	checked
i am currently working on an application that required to checked whether the opensearch has been added

1384991
defined	declare
for simple needs you can just defined a struct or better yet declare a class

1384991
getter	setter
i often declare a class with a set of properties synthesizing all getter setter to encapsulate data

1385008
background-color	transparency
i d like to know if there s some way to rendering the background of a tabcontrol transparency the tabcontrol not the tabpages instead of taking the parent form background-color

1385025
64bit	x86
i install this versioning should work for windows x86 and 64bit

1385029
ip-address	proxy
at least this code gets you the actual ip-address even from users behind isp proxy and .so on

1385042
authentication	login
i m not sure at which points do i grab the user role login every authentication

1385073
google-chrome	safari
mozilla differs from ie google-chrome safari i.e

1385082
authentication	login	authentication	logout	logout	login
on my hosts i can logout but .when the user tries to login again especially with google the authentication goes through without requiring the user to types in named and passwd

1385090
authentication	login
that s generally something handled by the openid provider - for instances if the user remains logged into their google-account and checked the box to remember the openid authentication for your particular site then the provider will transparently log them in and redirect them back without display the login prompt

1385092
user-interface	look-and-feel	widget	button
i created some widget with jquery user-interface and i notice that button have a distinct look-and-feel colors hover effects etc.

1385158
children	nodes
children of a specified parent nodes

1385165

on application-start i checked in loaderinfo.parameters to see if it s set to true a string literals not a boolean and if it is i set a public static variables debugmode on a global environment class instances to true

1385180
button	popup
change your code .so that the button invokes the location acquisition in the background and then subsequently popup the information or fills out the form later

1385182
http	ssl
an example of a gotcha is that wcf--adhering closely to a best practice --requires an active ssl connection inorder to pass soap authentication credentials over http

1385190
instrumentation	profiling
i tried using profiling tried instrumentation api but may be i am looking at the wrong place

1385200
.net-remoting	asmx
it s about unifying all the diverse programming model that existed .so far asmx enterprise service dcom .net-remoting

1385200
.net-remoting	asmx
sure - most of this stuff can be done in asmx or .net-remoting - but try to convert an asmx web service to be callable in your intranet using tcp-ip and transport security.

1385215
glassfish	geronimo
finally if you want an application-server for testing there are jboss by redhat sun s glassfish and geronimo i preferred the last one but you may have noticed my preferences for apache project already

1385242
code-coverage	emma
i m pretty sure some of the various code-coverage tools such as emma and clover recording the numbers of time each statement is execute because it s display in the report

1385242
cobertura	emma
cobertura newer open source tool than emma and does recording statement count

1385252
lisp	let
in lisp local-variables must be explicit declare with let or other forms that create local-variables

1385254
interop	tlbimp
you can generator the interop as part of your building using tlbimp and give it arguments to building a strong named

1385255
python	java
languages like java or other interpreted-language python be my personal preferences are going to allow you to use a lot of commonalities

1385282
keyword	synonym
.sometimes these features had been developed by several vendors independently .so either the standards or the vendor had to support synonym for keyword

1385288
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	c++
try to setup a prototype with something that is more productive then c++ for example ruby python and well maybe even php

1385290
python	lua
you also probably want either lua or python or another scripting-language which plays well with calling c to give a sensible higher level way of controlling the game

1385294
tcl	lua
in which case the top 2 scripting languages to look into would be lua and tcl

1385297
c++	lua
it is an ansi c libs .so that means that a it can be compiled in at least most c++ compilers and if there s a c compiler for the platform then you can use lua

1385301
ubuntu	linux
sorry im new to linux and just install ubuntu 9.04 64bit

1385306
scons	cmake
for example scons or cmake can create project files makefile for most compilers under windows linux macos

1385336
textarea	textbox
because asp.net textbox finally turns into html textarea which does not support text limit

1385346
pecl	pear
but i can t see difference between pecl and pear

1385354
defined	declare
i have declare all my variables in button.h and defined all methods in button.cpp and i am calling these functions in winmain the following error appears

1385365
put	get
unless you declare it as extern there and put the definition into a c++ source file not header file every translation unit will get their own definition of the variables

1385372
treeview	gridview
i am trying to populate a datagrid or gridview as a child elements of a treeview from the database

1385385
windows	ms-dos

the above hidden-field is set from a jquery that execute .when a radio-button is click

1385421
dictionary	arrays	arrays	loops
is there a built-in function for converting a string arrays into a dictionary of strings or do you need to do a loops here

1385425
dictionary	map
a dictionary is a hash where key map to value

1385432
contains	set
if you actually just want a set which you can checked to see if it contains a particular string for example you can use

1385451
sql-server	mysql
for example if you are using sql-server you should put it in and use for mysql

1385472
deployment	install
i had to do a dll deployment of asp.net-mvc with this .app because i can t install asp.net-mvc on the server

1385489
primitive	boolean
why not use the boolean primitive

1385489
primitive	boolean
this allows easy interchangeability between using primitive and their object equivalent boolean vs

1385489
boolean	int
boolean or int vs

1385492
primitive	boolean
what about just using the boolean primitive

1385493
primitive	boolean
or make a generics holder class which means you will have to use class boolean instead of primitive boolean

1385497
derived-class	base-class
this warning show that an indexer already exists in base-class.if you want to change its behavior you should either overrides it if it s defined as virtual in base-class or use new keyword to tell the compiler to use derived indexer methods whenever it s working with an instances of derived-class

1385503
derived-class	base-class
have a base-class a and a derived-class b which overrides function templates func

1385503
derived-class	base-class
now the problem here is that if i pass a shared pointers of the base types to the derived types then func of the base-class will be called not the derived-class being pointed to

1385503
derived-class	base-class	class-template	derived-class
i ve considered making class m a class-template on the shared pointers types and having a static_cast in the constructor to ensure this types is of the base-class types a or of a derived-class

1385509
webforms	asp.net
checkout here router with asp.net webforms

1385509
webforms	asp.net
the upcoming asp.net 4.0 will also bring some better support for router with webforms asp.net 4.0 webforms router â part i

1385521
managed-code	native-code
since you did not ask specifically for a module written in managed-code nor did you constraint iis to a specific versioning i going to recommend microsoft s own url rewrite module a module implements in native-code specific for iis 7.0

1385549
double	int
not until the next part is the int promoted to a double

1385553
instances	self
.when in a static methods you don t have a self instances what object are you calling the non-static methodss on

1385554
unsigned	short
for outputting a 16-bit since you re using unsigned short words one needs to use outw

1385559
implements	super
i suspect that you could actually implements super as a package and maybe it historically was i don t know

1385565
contains	any
this way you can create a webcontrol that can contains templates where you place any control

1385572
oracle	mysql
is that choice the same with other modern rdbms like oracle db2 or mysql i don t have access to those .so i can t perform tests

1385578
debian	linux
that test program â modified with the correct parentheses â works just fine here on debian linux w perl 5.10

1385581
javascript	dom
jquery is nice but if you don t know javascript and the dom it isn t going to help

1385586
put	get
most web-applications differenciate between the verbs get put and .post see w3 rfc on verbs

1385587
solaris	bsd	solaris	rpm	solaris	debian	solaris	linux	debian	linux	debian	rpm	linux	bsd	izpack	nsis
there are also plugins for nsis debian and rpm packaging but using those means you have to maintain configuration for each platform on the other hand izpack allows you to generator an install for windows-xp vista 2003 2000 mac os x solaris linux and bsd

1385591
environment	building
java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_14-b08

1385597
python	php
hardly it is too python specific i m afraid and therefore it would not be any fun to write a parsing for python data-structures in php

1385597
python	php
if you really need to do this then i would recommend building a middle-layer in python which would then expose your zodb over an interface that is usable in php

1385597
json	xml
one possiblity would be using http for the protocols and then json xml or whatever else your heart desires for payload

1385617
mouseover	mouseout
.so you might want to try using jquery s live event with mouseover and mouseout

1385622
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
sql has to do perform the same step to gather the required information to prepare for a grouping by or for the equivalent distinct query same filtering same sorting etc

1385622
aggregate	grouping
.when a grouping by query does not include any aggregate in its selected grouping and unique are essentially the same thing even if they boil down to distinct methods in the code of the server

1385622
aggregate	grouping
i would go with the grouping by approach as it may would to add aggregate in the selected if such info was desired at some time without changing the query much

1385625
spaces	output
.when there is some output even one white spaces is enough

1385652
contains	elements
get a jquery object contains the elementss in question which in your case i believe is text input .so it would be .something like where parent is the parent elements passing in input text by itself will not work correctly if you have other text input in the page outside of the parent elements as the plugins relies on indexes

1385667
stderr	stdout
note also once you ve resolved the inputstream issue that you should be consuming your spawned process stdout and stderr otherwise the spawned process may block

1385687
udp	tcp
.so you end up writing a reliable protocols on top of tcp to simulate udp - but continuously establish a new connection .when it crash

1385689
z-index	overlay
i ve overlay a link in using z-index on the bottom banner but whilst it works in other browsers i can t see it in ie7

1385705
temporary	copy
bulk copy the data into a temporary table and then call a stored proc that splits the data into the two tables you need to populate

1385725
javascript	dom
also the javascript target is sometimes hard to use because haxe provides a really good language but some kind of framework for the most common dom manipulations is missing but i think some people are working on that

1385737
scrollable	panels
i implements the scrollable interface yet .when adding it to the contains panels with

1385740
32-bit	64bit
be aware that .some 32-bit compilers don t have a 64bit types at all .so using long-long will limit you to 64bit systemd and a smaller set of compilers which include gcc and msvc .so most people won t care about this problem

1385744
environment	building
then invoke maven as normals the environment variables is substituted and your building should work as required

1385747
internet-explorer	firefox
the selenium tool-suite is quite nice for that it allows your testing programm to pilot a browser a real one firefox internet-explorer ...

1385750
enumerator	any
by the way lists are arrays in ruby in any case .so i m not sure what you mean by enumerator lists

1385768
subclassing	superclass
the documentation for a class should indicate whether subclassing should call the superclass methods

1385768
subclassing	superclass
no - a subclassing often needs to know something about the design of the superclass

1385798
updating	updates
i know i could just iterate through the entire arrays and run an updates query on every row updating the order value to the value of the counter iterator but that seems a bit ugly i may not need to updates every row and i could potentially be firing a lot of queries very quickly to mysql

1385806
joystick	keyboard	joystick	mouse	joystick	hid	keyboard	mouse	keyboard	hid
the hexwax firmwares use the hid interface keyboard mouse joystick etc .so drivers come with windows linux os-x already

1385828
32-bit	64bit
consider the following code for a 32-bit int and 64bit unsigned long-long systemd

1385828
32-bit	64bit
in the first case the two 32-bit int 1 and 2 are pushed on stack and printf interpreter that as a single 64bit ull value 2 x 2 32 + 1

1385828
32-bit	64bit
in the second you actually push the 64bit 1-value and a superfluous 32-bit int 2 which is ignore

1385866
windows-vista	windows
what i want is that there comes a frame from uac like in windows-vista or windows 7

1385869
click	mouse
is there some easy way or tool i could use to rename them all automatically with no more than say 10 mouse click

1385872
emacs	vim
vim and emacs are the hardest to learn but once you get used to one of them you re most likely to stay with it for many many years

1385907
project-management	project
look also for project-management systemd for developers - these systemd handle project with tasks

1385912
repository	entity
a repository directly correlates to an entity often an aggregate root

1385912
repository	entity
.when working at the conceptual level a ddd repository differs from a ddd service in that it is specifically tied to entity persistent

1385912
repository-pattern	poeaa
for instances a ddd repository is not the same thing as the repository-pattern found in martin fowler s poeaa book though it may employ such a pattern

1385956
expression	evaluation
if you really wanted to rename the variables and parameter named you would probably want to try and building a process that just parsing the code files to do a text replacement with regular expression or basic string manipulation depending on what you know bearing in mind it would be a once only change this would probably be quicker than evaluation code refactoring tools

1385963
.net	wcf
it is possible to use the native apis from .net code but this is going to be a lot more involved than going the peer channel route with wcf

1385965
put	get
all i want to do is hook this into apache .so that all the files that my website serves get put through the preproces.sor before going out to the browser

1385976

1385990
derived-class	base-class
i mean separate memory block is allocated for base-class and derived-class

1386000
postorder	inorder
how can i find a binary-tree from a given traversal methods inorder postorder or pre-order

1386001
derived-class	base-class
after the object header comes all the instances data associated with the object - including base-class field and derived-class field

1386001
derived-class	base-class
it s all in one place - it s not like the instances of the derived-class also has a reference to a hidden instances of the base-class

1386015
unique	words
relevance is computed based on the numbers of wordss in the row the numbers of unique wordss in that row the total numbers of wordss in the collections and the numbers of document rows that contains a particular words

1386016
buffering	streaming
you can use a streamingwriter to write to a memory streaming and use its buffering

1386017
postorder	inorder
the wikipedia article for inorder postorder pre-order tree traversal is here

1386019
derived-class	base-class
a constructor of a derived-class has to call the base-class constructor first even if you don t explicit specify it in your code

1386020
virtual-machine	parallels
i was running windows in a virtual-machine on mac os x using parallels

1386033

1386040
value	field
the field are automatically added to the user edit forms via the hook_user implementation in profile_user - the same mechanism is used to add the value of those field to the user object .when that gets loaded

1386044
derived-class	base-class
yes the derived-class will also contains the base-class field in memory

1386044
contains	any
this object also contains the bytes necessary to hold all of the instances data field defined by the manager types as any instances field defined by any base classes of the manager types in this case employee and object . emphasis added

1386073
postorder	inorder	postorder	preorder	preorder	inorder
you can t do this by it with only one traversal inorder preorder or postorder

1386073
preorder	inorder
it can be done if inorder preorder traversal of a tree is given

1386073
postorder	preorder
in postorder from 2nd l nodes will be preorder of left subtree and after that are preorder of right subtree

1386073
preorder	inorder
.so we found root elements and devided our inorder in to inorder of left subtree inorder of right subtree and preorder in to preorder of left subtree and preorder of right subtree

1386073
postorder	inorder
similarly we can do for inorder and postorder where root will be the last elements of the postorder

1386075
arguments	default
if an elements is not present in the map we will pretend that it is equals to the value default from the templates arguments

1386081

because even sites like stack overflow they do not log you out .when you logout of the openid provider you authentication with

1386155
webforms	asp.net
standards asp.net webformss which is what i guess you ll be using doesn t give you total control over your html - you re not programming directly in html and markup but against an abstracted webforms model

1386155
webforms	asp.net
checkout the official asp.net website which has plenty of articles tutorials screens casts and demos on how to get started on asp.net webforms development

1386171
json	xml
because of the excellent remoting classes you can use to communication between platform i also realized xml isn t all that special nor is json it s all meaningless without code that acts upon it

1386173
attributes	properties
dave - actually this is sort of possible - i took a look at the how linqpad work section of linqpad s official website and the answer was generator the classes at runtime using reflection.emit to create an in-memory footprint of methods properties and their attributes and then create the classes based on them

1386179
continuous-integration	nant
i am succesfully building asp.net applications in nant using the asp compiler without a problem. as part of my continuous-integration process

1386214
value	field
the problem is in sql-view it seems to think that the sqaure brackets means its a parameter and its asks me for a value but i don t want a value i want to be able to selected that field named

1386223
authentication	login
if i log on locally at server using sql-server management studio sql-server authentication and the created login i can display and alter-table data as i would expect

1386237
authentication	login
you can use the standards login user-controls to authentication users or do this manually see asp.net role provider vs membership-provider for code and explanation

1386255
for-loop	arrays
you would need direct access to the pixels data for the cgimage the code is here then use a for-loop reading the pixels data into the arrays boolean value

1386258
attributes	properties
i agree that attributes access and everything that looks like it properties in the python context should be fairly trivial

1386258
attributes	properties
properties and attributes for that matter should be idempotent

1386260
hide	next
now this works just fine on the first tab but won t hide on the next two tabs

1386267
javascript	dom
by the dom javascript if not html

1386283
transient	entity
add a transient attributes to your core datamodel in the task entity

1386283
attributes	properties
once you have done this you simply use the transient properties as the attributes you pass to get back the sections

1386289
put	get
this causes spring to expect the model attributes to be stored in the session from a prior get web request that put the object into the model

1386296
linked-list	queue
i have tried solving this using a wrapped list almost reinvented the wheel wrapped twin queue this one was a complete mess and my third attempt i just failed with was a wrapped linked-list in which i got everything else working except rewind

1386314
authentication	login
authentication twice if needed with 2 different zend_auth_adapter_dbtable object and add .some logic to determine if the login is username or email by guessing if what types of login user provided .so that you save one query for most of the cases

1386319
widget	button
i want the dialog to open printing the intended messages and .when the user click on the ok button the dialog plus the top widget i had to create for it should be closed removed

1386320
instances	private
a class rectangle that have private invariant x and y public instances methods z calcarea operating on x and y and public instances methods y calcside z operating on x and on arguments z

1386339
entity-framework	ado.net
i am currently building a very small simple web application in asp.net-mvc with ado.net entity-framework

1386342
export	csv
the open source data-mining and web mining software rapidminer can import both apache webserver log files as well as csv files and it can also import and export excel sheets

1386343
show	next
my next idea is to write a perl scripting that replace all invalid chars with .something that latex can show but it feels like i m risking to reinvent the wheel .so i figured that i could ask if .someone had a better idea

1386356
libsvm	weka
regarding svm implementation weka comes with one such implementation libsvm while rapidminer provides four svm implementation libsvm mysvm evosvm smo-svm some of them with more advanced features

1386365
postgresql	mysql
if your data get s bigger than that you should start using tables in a database like mysql postgresql ... to persistent the data

1386372
entity-framework	ado.net
i specifically want to continue using this ado.net entity-framework implementation

1386372
entity-framework	ado.net
i m completely new to silverlight and essentially just want to know how to perform crud on a database using ado.net entity-framework and a silverlight datagrid

1386390
argument-dependent-lookup	result-of
the other is argument-dependent-lookup at each initializer context but the result-of the lookup at each initializer context is not allowed to change behavior between two different initializer contexts

1386412
triggers	insert
after insert triggers

1386418
implements	extends
extends and implements your own auth adaptor and use query like where username

1386421
nunit	moq
i have right now moq that throw a exception-handling on a mocked methods but i don t know how to use nunit to catch it and look at it

1386428
exception-handling	try-catch
why can t you enclose the mocked methods call in a try-catch block and catch the specific exception-handling being throw

1386447
multiplication	division
you re talking about a single multiplication and a single division right

1386447
smalltalk	lisp
anybody insisting on good practice ood while inventing problems that don t exist in smalltalk or lisp can imho stuff it

1386456
graphics2d	jcomponent
depending on what methods you re overrides to get at the graphics2d jpanel s don t contains a graphics2d object like a component - a graphics2d object is used to paint the jpanel - if it s paintcomponent you should read the javadoc for jcomponent - and call super.paintcomponent g first .so that opacity is honored - and then do the rest of your painting

1386461
python	c++
caveat i m using pyqt and i ve only tried to use slots added in this way from python not from c++ .so your mileage may vary.

1386463
radio-button	button
instead of making a custom control you could use regular labels and radio-button controls to get the desired output but you would need to associate a groupname and checked each button individually

1386471
constructor	object
the rea.son is that constructor are the only methods that cannot be inherited excluding statics... .so they cannot be generics impossible to have a unique interface for all your copiable object

1386471
deep-copy	object
given a top object they know how to make a deep-copy of it

1386471
default	reset
reinitialise a graphing of object to its default value for all properties think of the implementation of a reset button in a multi-tab huge form

1386538
user-controls	tabcontrol
the tabcontrol contenttemplate is a user-controls control2 that has a listview

1386549
any	set
also can the bar baz function have just about any signature is there a somewhat restrict set or is there just one valid signature

1386555
macros	let
let s look at the expansion of the sample invocation sum 1 2 3 of the macros

1386557
logout	login
now i am able to login using facebook but logout is not working

1386563
implements	abstract
and entered as a feature request resolved in ticket 9798 because the new- class will have the option inherited abstract methods since at least eclipse sdk 2.1 2003 for you to choose inorder to automatically implements those public abstract-methodss

1386577
contains	lookup
fastfind db is nothing but a file which contains a list of files in my project and i wrote a scripting to search the list for faster lookup

1386607
octal	hex	decimal	octal	decimal	hex
for instances specify numbers format hex decimal octal numbers of decimal padding and more

1386608
perl	php
my advise would be to choose the right tool for the job switching to another macros language like m4 or even ml i if you feel adventurous or use a scripting-language like php or perl

1386656
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if you re looking to get the numerical weekday from an nsdate object you need to use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents like this

1386686
base-class	inherited
if all of my pages inherited from a base-class then that base-class will need to inherited from the page class for it to do any good

1386689
gethashcode	equals
then overrides equals and gethashcode such that only the first prefixlength bits of ip-address.getaddressbytes are taken into consideration and of course the ip-address types

1386697
getter	setter
an example would be adding getter and setter to your entities to support databinding in the user-interface

1386697
getter	setter
if your model has getter and setter it will probably do a poor job of model state changes that need to happen transactionally or encapsulating business-logic

1386701
populate	row
id x to it you should direct him to relevant page selected relevant row and populate formview based on selecteded recording

1386702
atom-feed	feed
recently i have created a php feed reader class which can parsing both rss and atom-feed

1386707
rollback	commit
what i fear is that once i ve flowed the context to another business application it may try to register a completion participant by itself and then try to commit or rollback the transactional ruining the whole transactional and probably the logic on the initiator side

1386735
multiplying	addition
as you see multiplying two huge numbers in native python code can be almost 1000 time slower than the simple addition while with gmpy the slowdown is less than 100 time and it s not too bad even if only one if the numbers is already in gmpy s own format .so that there s the overhead of converting the other

1386739
json	xml
if the format is discussable i d suggest json not xml

1386739
json	xml
json is actually faster to load and write than standards xml

1386757
constructor	object
this doesn t happen in ruby constructing an object is the same as assign the result-of a function-call to a variables because constructor are just normals functions

1386764
directory	folder
i know virtualbox allows you to defined shared folder which are directory on your hosts that are exposed to the guest

1386766
binary-tree	nodes
i could use a binary-tree with boolean labels on the nodes

1386770
button	popup
i want a messagebox for linux similar to the windows one it should popup display some text and .when the user click the ok button it should disappear and return control to the calling function

1386775
webserver	upload
i deployed it to an apache webserver by upload a zipfile and .sql file of the database

1386776
malloc	free
valgrind cannot analyze this because it uses custom malloc free functions

1386792
textbox	button
for a cross-reference like my button changes my testbox the idea is to give to the button the controllers the code that will get activated .when click a reference to the textbox

1386792
textbox	button
.so .when the button is pressed it can change the textbox

1386798
administration	account
iâ m using visual-foxpro 9 on vista in the administration account

1386812
contains	any
assuming list is full of various subnet and x could contains any address then this -

1386821
attributes	properties
per.sonally i like to primarily use properties to expose .some attributes of the class to the outside world - .so for iboutlet only the class will manipulate i simply declare them without using properties and release them in dealloc

1386863
any	set
i would guess they limited the amount of memory you can use and do not allow it to be set any higher or you are running inside a virtual hosts that simply does not have the amount of memory you request that could be the cause of the error 500

1386870
decimal	octal
it s very useful also to format numbers in different representations octal control the decimal place etc

1386880
spring	seam	spring	jsf	wicket	spring	wicket	seam	wicket	jsf	seam	jsf
you can use spring and seam together - spring for backend components seam for enhancement of web layer jsf gwt wicket and other stuff

1386880
spring	seam
seam offers a lot of spring functionality inversion-of-control containers transactional managment - in your project you can decide - witch implementation to use

1386880
spring	seam
more details on integration seam with spring - seam in action - free bonus chapter

1386907
value	field
add a methods to code-behind formatdatacadastro that will take a field value and convert it to the expected format

1386930
postgresql	mysql
this also needs to be compatible on windows linux and mac using any db mysql sqlite postgresql etc

1386933
unsigned	bigint
i think two bigint unsigned would be a reasonable way to store them but i guess you could use a binary byte arrays

1386940
malloc	free
you might be able to get the busy distribution hooking into malloc free but the free distribution which essentially is the fragmentation seems up in the air

1386947
margins	padding
i ve tried variations on setting negative margins to the top and bottom margins and padding to compensate for the header height but haven t figured it out yet

1386952
python	php	eclipse-pdt	komodo
you should checked aptana which eclipse based development enviroment.also support javascript ajax ruby-on-rails python development and it has smooth user-interface if you compare other editor for php.i used most of them komodo eclipse-pdt php designer... but aptana is the most suitable for me.you can look at here

1386962
nunit	moq
i am using nunit and moq but i am not sure how to fake this

1386976
maya	mel
everytime i create a new ik handle in maya via mel it creates an end effector named effector1 or effector2 depending on what is in my scene

1386980
if-statement	for-loop
your problem is that you re trying to pull a new token for every iterator of the for-loop - instead you need to assign the result-of st.nexttoken to a variables before the for-loop and then use that variables in the if-statement

1387065
highlight	cell
highlight all of your cell with the data

1387065
selected	cell
selected the topmost cell in the column e.g

1387069
highlight	selected
highlight all the columns that conform to this schema then go to the data menu and selected text to columns

1387089
return-value	arguments
.when you defined a function that accepts multiple parameters as opposed to a single tuples with multiple elements you can partially apply it and use its return-value as the arguments to another function

1387120
show	next
the main reason why i think i need to preload the images is because if i call wximage on each image i show two at a time each time i load a transactional the interface from one transactional to the next is very slow and clunky - if i load them in memory its very fast - but then i get my memory error

1387122
constructor	object
i think you ll do ok without necessarily needing a book but c++ has ridiculously tricky syntax try figuring out how to assign a constants field in an object instances using the constructor for example and i found the book to be quite illuminating

1387123
genshi	mako	jinja2	mako	jinja2	genshi
multiple templates languages out of the box genshi mako jinja2

1387123
genshi	mako
- given it s modularity you need to read documentation from different sources sqlalchemy genshi or mako repoze.who pylons etc.

1387133
constructor	object
yeah javascript s object don t have classes and chainable constructor like that

1387137
web-services	webserver
edit moving the non-essential to web-services may make the most sense then and this is a standards practice where the webserver is outside of the firewall .so vulnerable .so all the real work is done by other servers and the webserver is just responsible for static pages and rendering

1387157
scala	java
since scala compiles to java bytecode anything you write could be called from your java code however you please

1387159
json	xml
you can always use xmlhttprequest to load it as json or xml

1387162
javascript	dom
i m creating a page right now where i use a hidden java applet width and height 1 pixels with the same color as the background to have full control over all the good low-level socket communication and from the applet call a javascript function to make updates to the webpage dom html .when new data becomes available

1387170
mstest	nunit	xunit.net	gallio
however the code-behind and supporting classes of a silverlight v1 or v2 or v3 .application are valid c# vb .so you can write unit tests against that portion of the .app and run those tests with nunit mstest gallio xunit.net etc and you will get coverage of that portion

1387189
value	field
the operators field of the token arrays can have one of the following value

1387189
subtraction	addition
this would occur for the addition and subtraction operatorss unless a sign operators directly followed

1387189
parentheses	operators
if parsing fails or the preceding token was a constants or a closing parentheses effectively a subexpression which will evaluate to a constants then the current token is an operators otherwise it s a constants

1387189
contains	any
after tokenizing is done calculating and folding are done by calling m which first looks for any matched pairs of parentheses and process the subexpressions contains within by calling itself recursively

1387189
subtraction	addition	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	exponentiation	multiplication	subtraction	exponentiation	addition	exponentiation	division
then it process operators first exponentiation then multiplication and division together and finally addition and subtraction together

1387189
value	field
consequently the final result is left at the beginning of the token arrays .so .when control returns to e it simply printing that to a string taking advantage of the fact that the first value in the arrays is the value field of the token

1387191
silverlight	wpf
make sure all the code xaml namedpace class named are the same in wpf and silverlight versioning

1387205
background-position	background-image
i ve tried using the animate in jquery with the a modified background-position plugins similar to that show here but it more or less move the background-image up pixels by pixels not set pixels jumps

1387251
.net	wcf
the advantage of this approach is that you can built-in full management capabilities into the task management service such as tracing impersonation remote integration via wcf and error-handling and report all while using your .net language of choice to implements the tasks themselves

1387258
hash	md5	salt	md5
al.so i am storing an md5 hash of the user s passwd + salt in the database not their actual string passwd .so that is one less thing to worry about

1387264
qpushbutton	qtextedit
for example if i have a gui with two qpushbutton and one qtextedit is it possible to set value to the qtextedit from a thread different from the gui main thread without freezing the gui

1387270
value	field
or have a product_type field on product that might have value like flagship or normals or obsolete or whatever

1387277
hash	md5
consider sha1 or an even stronger hash instead of md5

1387290
worksheet	excel
i need to allow a user to selected an excel file and then upload all worksheet to a sql table

1387308
scala	java	haskell	scala
either haskell or one of the java .net fp languages scala clojure f# would be the way i go

1387309
hash	md5
also md5 is not considered strong enough for passwd hashing anymore it s is too fast to hash and you don t want that in a checked that an attacker will need to run over and over again whilst a real user only needs to do it once

1387326
getattr	setattr
and b you re in a class that doesn t use really deep dark soot-black magic apparently django s model superclass is breaking something absolutely fundamental such as dir setattr and or getattr -- though even with that hypothesis i just can t reproduce the specific symptoms somewhat-reported by the op

1387334
click	mouse
related it appears that appkit doesn t recognize ctrl+click as a right mouse click

1387354
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m working my way through some asp.net-asp.net-mvc reading and i have a web .app at work that i ll be migrating from webforms to asp.net-mvc

1387362
shell	tcsh
i would like to get the most out of working in cch or tcsh shell

1387369
tcsh	bash
something that csh tcsh and even bash have is the cool

1387378
parsing	comma
some parsing ignore the extra comma but ie errors on it

1387382
contains	set
is it possible to display a modal windows from a wpf user-controls that is a child of an elementhost and set the owner parent of the modal windows to the contains form-control

1387408
while-loop	for-loop
if you goal is to make the scripting pause your better off using a while-loop or for-loop with dates

1387413
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
in firefox opera google-chrome it s sets the width height correctly

1387420
linux	unix
vim gvim on unix any linux mac os windows

1387431
directory	folder
where some_list is a list i populate using some custom code to read the folder in a directory

1387453
sql-server	mysql
how s your sql-server vs mysql

1387465
gtk	gdk
ok i think i know what you mean now i found this table matching up the gtk signals and gdk events

1387483
entity-framework	ado.net
while trying to use the entity-framework and ado.net data service i m hitting a real headscratcher

1387501
droppable	draggable
checkout the draggable and droppable integration that jquery user-interface has

1387506
any	set
it s in c# because i m not set up to test vb but you shouldn t have any trouble converting it

1387508
arrays	loops
i want to loops through my css and javascript arrays and inject html at specific points in output

1387511
median	max	median	min
this would be called an online median selection algorithm although wikipedia only talks about online min max selection

1387535
getter	setter
properties can be registered with getter setter

1387535
getter	setter
the macros currently allows for a properties types a getter and a setter to be registered

1387560
traversal	parent
but the list i m traversal is variables size .so i need to find a way to find out how many parent s i ll need to go through to get to that parent nodes

1387568
any	set
any of the children can simply dispatchevent and i can set up the main swf to listen for the event

1387580
environment	building
i am attempting to a get a isolated building environment setup in my dev team

1387584
json	xml
see why json over xml

1387597
value	field
the problem is that a boxed value-type cannot be simply unboxed into a nullable versioning of that value-type because the boxed value doesn t have the boolean hasvalue field in it

1387597
value	field
.so .when unboxing a value-type into a nullable versioning the clr must allocate a nullable t object initializer the hasvalue field to true and set the value field to the same value that is in the boxed value-type

1387605
value	field
.so .when unboxing a value-type into a nullable versioning the clr must allocate a object initializer the hasvalue field to true and set the value field to the same value that is in the boxed value-type

1387605
variables	boolean
there s not a performance issue to allocate spaces for an extra boolean variables

1387611
directory	folder
for example my loadview will look for the view file in the current module directory or if you pass an optional module arguments it will look specifically within that module s folder

1387615
setinterval	settimeout
i used setinterval for simplicity but for the interest of saving resources you probably would want to use settimeout over and over and stop checked for updates once you know a recording was updates

1387632
annotations	mapping
however if you re looking for auto-generation of hibernate mapping files .hbm.xml or annotations you should look into hibernate tools as stated below

1387651
key-value	key
i would need something that uses a key-value pair where key would be the id and value would be that input in the textbox

1387652
continuous-integration	teamcity
i use teamcity on windows 2003 iis 6 for my continuous-integration environment

1387652
configuration	environment
whilst i know there are a numbers of tasks and way to handle configuration replacement and transformation between environment i m particularly interested in this one provided by microsoft based xslt principles which looks like it refers to msbuild in .net 4.0 sdk

1387671
temporary	copy
with a temporary copy of the shorter

1387686
value	field
however if you loops out the field with their value filled in with data stored in an object you can probably save that object in a session variables to compare against on the next request

1387687
put	get
if someone does get some code working please put it up on github and make a comment here

1387738
inherited-resources	controllers
then in my controllers using inherited-resources i set the subdomain associations using the very cool methods begin_of_associations_chain

1387762
value	field
once you get there then examine the fields-for your list of illegal chars or examine the value in each field to determine they re valid if you can do .so

1387797
row	col
in the example patterns there s no way col could match more than one pattern .so you can be sure you ll see each row of tbl at most once in the result

1387801
nunit	moq
since you are using linq-to-sql here is a sample of testing the scenario you mentioned using nunit and moq

1387807
google-chrome	firefox
2 running in firefox in google-chrome mode

1387809
simulator	platform
i wrote a small tutorial on building cross platform iphone libs that run both on the device and the simulator

1387864
contains	elements
the tree has 5 elements in the first level and each contains several elements in level 2

1387872
sql-server	oracle
i doubt you would find any other datastore that would do this as well as a modern commercial dbms oracle sql-server db2 etc. or any opn source tool that would accomplish

1387873
postgresql	mysql
how do i perform something equivalent of a for operation where-in the following code can be used to generator sql for all supported databases h2 mysql postgresql

1387875
ftpwebrequest	ftps
it may be that implicit ftps is not supported in ftpwebrequest i don t know

1387875
sftp	ftps
if .so take a look at edtftpnet pro which supports both implicit and explicit ftps as well as sftp

1387885
droppable	draggable
draggable and droppable

1387906
python	c++
i made a c++ .app on my desktop that embedded python 3.1 using msvc

1387906
put	get
i put in code in my .app to dynamically link from the local python31.dll to ensure that it was using it but i still get the crash

1387906
python	c++
the python documentation and other guides do not seem to ever address how to distribute your c++ applications that use python-embedding without having the users install python locally

1387906
python	c++
i know it s more of an issue on windows than on unix but i ve seen a numbers of windows c++ applications that embed python locally and i m not sure how they do it

1387912
qstandarditemmodel	qobject
mymodel const int r const int c qobject parent 0 qstandarditemmodel r c parent

1387935
checkbox	listbox
you don t need to use inherited custom control to make a listbox with checkbox

1387957
value	field
on the page postback display labels or secondary form field readonly with the new entered value on the right that can be copy-paste eg arrow button points left that copies the value back to the original form field

1387990
openssl	gnupg
that s true for pgp gnupg openssl

1388000
configuration	installation
read up on the installation documentation for apache and php again remembering that you ll probably have to restart the apache service after each change to its configuration

1388009
any	set
ok now checked if any view has exclusivetouch set to yes

1388016
children	nodes
for a leaf this count would be 1 for a nodes with two leaf children this would be 3 etc

1388020
contains	set
it contains bitflags that are set and cleared by the microcontroller as it execute code telling you the result-of operations

1388036
arrays	loops
the idea i had for this was to create an arrays of delegation allowing other methods to register then .when the object had been saved it could loops through the delegation and call each one

1388048
hide	show
which will first hide both inner divs then change the css of the click div to 100 and show it

1388056
contains	set
the document likely contains alternate unicode spaces characters which appear normally in your editor but are unrecognized by the php code running in the default character set for your server

1388110
licensing	gpl
it s licensed under a dual licensing model - gpl for free opensource software

1388114
licensing	gpl
if your source code needs to know which licensing model it is being compiled into you can use if declare gpl ... ifend to test for the existence of the gpl symbols

1388125
execution	jobs
hudson - building testing software project ... monitor execution of externally-run jobs

1388173
typemock	moq
although you re currently use moq i think that the functionality you re looking for cannot be achived without dependency-injection unless you use typemock-isolator disclaimer - i worked at typemock

1388176
testng	junit
for testing checkout along with your normals unit test frameworks of junit testng watij and or htmlunit

1388176
continuous-integration	automated-tests
related to automated-tests i think you need an automated building continuous-integration systemd

1388180
joomla	drupal
if you re using an existing cms like joomla drupal etc

1388185
contains	any
any class with virtual methods contains a reference to a vtable another 4 bytes

1388197
xsd	xml
any xml must be validation via strict xsd

1388329
hashtable	set
that will always be the case though - a hashtable would only ever be genuinely o 1 for all key if they had unique hash value and the table maintained a set of buckets for every possible hash in reality it tends not to be a problem

and if you need the sequences of unique items returned as a you can add a call to tolist

1388371
nvidia	ati
.so my question is if i distribute the ati opencl implementation with my application will that mean it will never be able to use nvidia video cards

1388371
nvidia	ati
and if i use the nvidia opencl sdk that it will never run optimally on amd chip considering the ati amd link

1388371
nvidia	ati
i ve seen that ati has a board and nvidia presumably has their own where does the opencl user developer community hang out

1388389
html-select	selected
you need to specify selected attributes of html-select tag

1388390
exception-handling	error-handling
i recommend reading the boost community guide boost.org to exception-handling and error-handling

1388392

itextsharp	itext
the faq addresses itext the java versioning project from which itextsharp was derived but applies to itextsharp as well

1388550
exception-handling	try-catch
the closest i have come is by enclosing a try-catch around the code that returns the object at a row in a column an exception-handling occurs because that item no longer exists .so i can grab the tableview and call reloaddata which seems to updates that specific nstableview

1388565
attributes	properties
you could modify the boot classpath and there is support for that with a specific attributes in ant but i think it should be the java.endorsed.dirs properties in raw javac

1388565
required	checked
you shouldn t add the endorsed directory to the classpath as the boot classpath and any endorsed directory are checked before the classpath to resolve required types

1388571
any	set
this means that if you haven t set any value yet hasvalue properties is false then you d potentially get a null value returned

which populate my html.dropdownlist with all the named in the foreign key table but has nothing in the value field

1388861
value	field
but how can i make the dropdownlistfor to show the named but let the value field be the id field of that foreign key table

1388873
value	field
this means that you will need to pass all the value of the contractuser .when invoking the delete action you could store them in hidden field in the page

1389137
32-bit	64bit
not an answer to the the specific question you asked but you should perhaps consider building your .app on an x64 machine which could run 32-bit tests as well as 64bit tests.

why does the v1.operator other not destroy the elements it contains

1389407
right-to-left	hebrew
i wrote a program that accepts and output hebrew right-to-left text

1389407
textbox	button

but then each time i refactor the model to add a new field or to change the named of an existing field i also have to edit the list of field in the parentheses assign to unique_together

1389444
32-bit	64bit
there s no need to make 32-bit systemd potentially struggle to make a 64bit write atomicity .when they can do it easily with 32-bits.

1389522
xts	zoo
both zoo and the newer and also highly-recommended xts package can use posixt and especially the compact posixct types for indexing

1389523

1389570
contains	elements
what is the most efficient way to compare whether the two byte arrays contains the same content for each elements

1389572
configuration	logging
as a general principles logging to stdout should be avoided - far better to log to a logfile and then you can use standards configuration tools to changelog levels or turn it off altogether

1389579
getter	setter
synthesizing a properties only creates getter and setter methods and therefor won t release the ivar .when the object is deallocated

1389598
updating	updates
notice that the updates query is updating multiple tables at the same time

1389599

sql-server	mysql
i m currently working with mysql but consider moving to sql-server .so i would like the query to fit both

1389648
sql-server	mysql
the syntax is pretty similar between mysql and sql-server

1389680
defined	declare
i declare and defined void myslot slot in my class x and i m connecting some signals to this slot in x s constructor

1389680

sql-server	oracle
it will write out a csv file and then load that file into the appropriate database at this points either oracle or sql-server

1389759
oracle	mysql
this means that we have to support mysql mssql and oracle as not all the customers use the same database engine

1389759
oracle	mysql
the scripting is written using mssql syntax however i was wondering if there is an application for automatically converting mssql syntax to that of oracle and or mysql to save me from having to manually do it

1389782
oracle	mysql
the scripting is written using mssql syntax however i was wondering if there is an application to automatically converting mssql syntax to that of oracle and or mysql to save me having to manually do it

sql-server	mysql
neither sql-server 2005 nor mysql support one

1389782
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
mysql supports deleting from several tables at once not available in oracle or sql-server

1389782
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
sql-server unlike oracle and mysql can updates cte s that use analytic-functions

1389789
show	next
also since i m doing this for a site that will get updates regularly how can i prevent the previous and next button from showing up .when there are only 3 list items to show

1389809
sql-server	oracle
unlike oracle you have to separate statements in sql-server with the keyword go after each statement

1389822
click	mouse
and if i got it right the goal is to write unit tests not to be able to create unit test by click on them with right mouse button -

1389826
value	field
this has only one shortcoming afai can tell there s a piece of generator code in the actual foreign key field s set properties that should throw an exception-handling if you try and set the value .when there s already a value in-place

1389840
where-clause	sql
the syntax is generally the same as what would you would use in a sql where-clause without the where .so in this case it would be

1389889
google-chrome	firefox
using the vb code provided here btw i could open that page only from ie7 not from firefox 3.5 nor google-chrome 2 i wrote following function

1389894
oracle	mysql
this answer works in oracle - don t have mysql .so can t test there

1389913
firebird	mysql	sql-server	firebird	sql-server	mysql
i doubt that there are all that many people who specialize in firebird certainly compared to say mysql or ms sql-server or .

1389919
any	set
in particular my understanding is that you used the snippet to mean any characters except for a spaces or a full-stop period . this would in fact be expressed as using the caret to negate the characters in the set

1389919
backslash	regex
i don t know if this was just a typo in your .post or what was actually in your code but the regex as it stands in your question will match the words passwd a colon a spaces then any sequences of backslash characters s characters or periods

1389926
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
you need as 3 experts to sort that lot out - one each of sql-server mysql and oracle

1389928
python	c++
i ve used opengl in c++ and objective-c but i don t have much experience in python

1389928
32-bit	64bit
i d prefer to stay in 64bit mode if possible since i ve heard 32-bit programs required loading a lot of extra 32-bit libs

1389928
wxpython	pyglet	32-bit	64bit
again i d prefer to stay in 64bit mode but if nothing works i ll switching to 32-bit and try wxpython or pyglet again

1389950
credentials	account
this may be the difference between your credentials and the asp.net account

1389959
copy-constructor	constructor
will result in the templates constructor to be called followed by the synthesized copy-constructor will output just t .

1389962
aggregate-functions	sum
sum can be replace by any other aggregate-functions

1389973
postgresql	mysql
i never tried on any unix but i think that postgresql or mysql should be more mature

1389978
constructor	object
the first does not create a temporary unnamedd object using my_mutex as the constructor arguments but instead the parentheses around the named are redundant

1389978
.when	ready
it means .when the object is set up and ready for use

1389978
constructor	object
for a class types object the lifetime begins .when the constructor ends execution and it ends .when the destructor begins execution

1389978
expression	evaluation
most of them end lifetime after evaluation of the full expression they are contains in like the comma-operator of above or an assignment expression

1389993
turing-complete	lambda-calculus
have a look at lambda-calculus which is one of the most minimal turing-complete languages i ve ever seen

1389993
haskell	sml
functional languages like sml and haskell lack arrays just like lambda-calculus and these are actually useful languages

1389995
contains	any
what is h.appening instead is the .app is being install successfully and it is running the first time with an activation context but the activationuri does not contains any query-string value

1390016
python	c++
my advice above is good for python c and c++

1390025
postgresql	mysql
sql database - you may use interface to some of dbms like mysql postgresql etc. but it s only good for larger amount of data thousands of recording

1390028
default	reset
in practice it s still unusable because reload the windowssystem or visualworksbase applications causes their initialization blocks to run and a whole lot of settings are reset to their default - fontss and fonts sizes windows colors user-interface settings.

1390033
pointers	stack
.when you invoke sum the compiler will push onto stack the address of the current instruction pointers and then jump to the location of the subroutine

1390033
machine-code	disassembly
to confirm what i ve said i suggest that you look at the assembly emitted by your c code either by using a debugger to disassembly the machine-code or by using a compiler command-line option to generator an assembly listing file

1390035
subprocess	pexpect
to avoid the many problems that can always arise with buffering for tasks such as getting the subprocess s output to the main process in real time i always recommend using pexpect for all non-windows platform wexpect on windows instead of subprocess .when such tasks are desired

1390039
pointers	stack
then your assembly function will need to work out where the caller s stack frame is - a pointers or offset to it along with the return address and any parameters is generally pushed on stack .when any function is called - and hence where the local-variables a b and c are in memory

1390051
command-line	cmd
is there some easy set of bash command-line cmd i can chaining together to remove them

1390073
constructor	object
to alleviate the overhead of allocation an arrays of bamboo object i could implements this class as follows -- basically instead of creating object via the regular constructor a construction methods allocates a single memory block to hold both the panda object and its bamboo arrays

1390076
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
accidentally i mixed up between 32-bit and 64bit libs files on my x86 embedded-linux systemd

1390082
getter	setter
in the example module below the getter and setter are generator by adding anonymous subroutine to the symbols table

1390082
getter	setter
after the methods have been created in this manner will the resulting code be functionally equivalent in terms of behavior speed etc. to a module with manually-written getter and setter or does this approach have some sort of inherent liability

1390083

exc-bad-access	crash
everything is working fine except for one thing if i navigate too fast on my uinavigationcontroller the iphone simulator crash receiving an exc-bad-access signals

1390125
spaces	output
the advance no arguments and the tl10 tab left .so many spaces edit descriptor works well to overwrite text on the same line the output of the following code

1390127
delegation	dealloc
the issue is due to the fact the mapviewcontroller the parent of the mkmapview has been dealloc d and the async map fetching internals of mkmapview is trying to call the delegation of mkmapview which was mapviewcontroller

1390127
delegation	dealloc
.so on dealloc of mapviewcontroller you ve got to reset the mkmapview.delegate nil .so that no delegation are called after .some tile get returned

1390127
delegation	dealloc
updates it s good practice it s somewhere in the memory-management docs to nil delegation in dealloc before releasing the delegation holder

selected	button
i cannot use the gridview.selectedindex because the button can be click on a row that isn t the selected one

1390237
ubuntu	debian	opensuse	ubuntu	opensuse	debian
another hint for you is that firebird stable is include in ubuntu debian and opensuse

1390237
firebird	mysql
.so the community it s growing larger it s still a long way to reach mysql level but with small step who knows we might replace the lamp with firebird + ubuntu+ nginx +php

1390248
keyboard	mouse
of course some users use keyboard mouse

1390248
updating	updates
not a big problem except we would have to updates those manually but that s not an issue given that we ve been updating win32 apps for 5 years now

1390248
asp.net-mvc	webforms
do you think that planning this in asp.net-mvc or webforms would be too crazy

1390267
subclassing	base-class
your base-class methods should be virtual if not your subclassing methods won t be called

1390270
scikits	scipy
you can use scikits audiolab to read in any file supported by libsndfile and then use pylab numpy and scipy to do the process

1390272
lookup	any
btw you haven t actually given any link on how you are building your list of files or lookup of it

we ve faced similar issues in the past and decided that using ssl in all qa environment was desired there are downsides - especially .when debugging the http streaming - but what doesn t have downsides

1390319
textbox	button
.when a user click on a button one textbox should be added

1390323

1390335
constructor	object
.when you initializer an object that has other dependancies in it that structuremap knows about in the constructor then structuremap will also load up those object as well

1390350
append	input
if you replace the innerhtml the previously entered value will be cleared to avoid that you can append the input elements programmatically

1390383
entitymanager	entities
instead many applications create a layer of data-access objects--separate from the entities--that use entitymanager instances to query load and save entities

1390384
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera

hit m-x shell and then start your python shell inside that bash shell session like .so

1390404
associations	model
with this in your soldier model i m assuming there is an associations that contains more email addresses you want to use

1390424
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome but not ie 8

1390439
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
consider for example if the member is part of a base-class or equivalently if you want to apply the offset to a pointers to a derived-class but there is multiple- or virtual inherited involved

1390441
haskell	c++
just look at haskell or c++ s metaprogramming capabilities

1390444
environment	building
to achieve a greater independence between the dll and .app one typically defined a relatively immutable interface and uses that to make buildinging more independent and possibly use different building environment

1390454
attributes	properties
while css in most cases interpreter 0 without a unit size as a default zero-unit for that attributes it is not always the case font-size for example and some validation will object to properties which required unit sizes in their specifications .when they encounter a parameter without that unit include

1390459
linux	osx
another laptop running osx 10.5.7 and mysql 5.0.37 works fine as do the linux servers running mysql 5.0.27

1390468
contains	elements
this can be done with a custom user-controls contains within the elements to updates

1390492
show	next
as for your points about how to work with paging i think you re on the right tracking with the show next 100 results approach

1390498
stateless	stateful
ad 1 it s used mainly for jpa and stateless stateful local session beans

1390502
getter	setter
with large numbers of attributes there will be a difference in compile-time and memory use...both in favor of the generator getter and setter not the manually-written ones

1390506
shopping-cart	cart
i have a shopping-cart control that lists the items in cart

1390506
shopping-cart	cart
each row has a delete submit button that is wrapped around ajax.beginform that will call the controllers delete the item in cart and rendering the shopping-cart as partialview

1390522
asp.net-mvc	webforms
now that asp.net-mvc exists i d say webforms is more about letting non-web devs do web

1390526
unique	words
however as a words of advice ajax is not particularly involved in the management of framesets in any special or unique way

1390532
constructor	object
wicket supports rest ful url s out of the box using a combinations of bookmarkablepagelink s and pageparameters constructor of the webpage object

1390548

the statement has been terminated. my field is decimal 11 2 at the table and my max and min value are 1 603 837 393.70 -- -1 688 000 000.00 amount

1390612
value	field
but now i need to put the data back temporary table is still having the original float field and i just simply cannot make it insert value with a insert selected statement

1390619
double	int
that does not make sense it is like saying operators + may operators on int or double

1390624
value	field
can i just load this value into a pre-drawed field under the input-field that collect the data from the customer

1390645
nvidia	ati
a simpler approach might be to employ cuda nvidia or streaming computing ati to harness a gpu s power for image manipulation because these apis are much closer to regular array-based c++ programming

1390651
tcp-ip	tcp
tcp-ip wont go lower than that - this is always stateful because tcp is stateful

1390659
persistent	transient
the reason is because i have some transient attributes that i can t persistent to the database facebook data and .when the facebook data is already loaded in memory i don t want to re-query facebook for the data

1390677
launchd	daemons
you could set up an applescript folder action arrgh or use a launchd daemons and the fsevents facility to watch your source code files

1390689
contains	elements
containers html elements contains scripting

1390692
contains	elements
containers html elements contains scripting

1390710
value	field
you say my field is decimal 11 2 at the table but this contradicts what you say about the max and min value which aren t within the range of decimal 11 2

1390716
controllers	routes
this routes are available through your controllers views etc

1390718
callback	methods
use an entitylistener or a postload callback methods

1390725
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
it seems like a mixed metaphor to be creating a uinavigationcontroller but then not using its usual navigation methods pushviewcontroller animated and popviewcontrolleranimated and instead using the modal methods inherited from uiviewcontroller

1390733
decimal-point	digits
but a value of 1 603 837 393.70 would required decimal 12 2 - 12 digits in all 2 after the decimal-point

1390733
decimal-point	digits
this would mean total of 11 digits - 9 to the left 2 to the right of the decimal-point

1390733
decimal-point	digits
the maximum total numbers of decimal digits that can be stored both to the left and to the right of the decimal-point

1390739
default-value	default
dreamweaver sets the default-value to -1 to ensure no recording are returned by default

1390748
environment	execution
if you can get your hands on an older versioning you d probably have a better place to start even p3 manual - they explain better the same basic execution environment

1390754
contains	any
.when location contains a virtual path apache serves up the page scripting in that path straight away without the browser knowing there was any kind of redirect

1390780
httpwebrequest	webclient
from my investigations the behavior of the webclient class is the same which is somewhat expected since it appears to only offer a more simple interface to the httpwebrequest

1390789
.war	jar
how many time to i have to mention that jar .war and ear ant tasks are subtasks of the zip one

1390790
contains	any
if you just want to see if it contains any character i d recommend using string.indexofany as suggested elsewhere

1390817
contains	any
with session.clear the nhibernate session will not contains any dirty object anymore

1390835
optgroup	selected
is it possible to create a selected box contains optgroup s with asp dropdownlistfor in versioning 1.1 of asp.net

1390835
optgroup	selected
would it be the only way to craft the html by hand or are there any controls available capable of rendering selected boxes with optgroup tags for this old asp.net versioning

1390854
callback	methods
the items can be retrieved from store in synchronous and asynchronous methods i provide the store with list of key and a callback and it invoke the callback and return the item in it

1390862
http	ssl
i know that the http rfc specifies not sending the referrer info from http - http but does this also apply to http - http across domains or ssl certs

1390867
attributes	properties
i m making use of q_property s in my project and i m trying to figure out the best way to add some attributes to those properties like min and max value

1390867
attributes	properties
it doesn t look like there s any where to store such attributes on the properties itself.

1390869
directory	folder	latex	tex
this page on latex package says you ll need to install the .sty file in the latex installation directory my installation of ubuntu seems to be usr shared texmf-texlive tex latex or you need to have a copy of the .sty file in each file contains latex source -- in your tex document folder at the very least

1390893
latex	tex
you can put styles files in texmf tex and standards latex distributions should find them

1390893
latex	tex
if you prefer to install them system-wide you can put them in the corresponding texmf tex folder within your latex installation the location of this installation on os x varies depending on which latex distribution you used

1390905
pyside	pyqt
the mature python interface to that is pyqt but if the alternative of gpl or for-pay licenses is a problem for you pyside is on the horizon nowhere as mature as pyqt at this time but by the time gpl ing your software could possibly be a problem pyside should be definitely ready for you

1390905
bazaar	git
beyond your choice of frameworks for gui-based cross-platform desktop .app development of course lie many many other choices of tools and .approaches -- but they re less crucial for .solo development than they are for effective team cooperation .so until teamwork is in prospect for you it won t hurt to use whatever tools you find simplest svn rather than a dvcs i strongly recommend a dvcs such as hg git or bazaar for team use but for a .solo developer i guess svn is still quite acceptable and perhaps simpler to install and use

1390908
contains	set
it will allow you to transform a points or set of pointss using the transformgroups transformation where in your case the transform3dgroup to use is contains in the geometrymodel3d.transform properties

1390911
selected	textbox
.when a user click or focused on a textbox the datepicker interface should popup with the current date on it and the user could easily selected the date

1390934
protected	public
in your case deriveda can t even see staticvar since it s private not protected or public .so it doesn t even know there is a staticvar variables in existence

1390953
textbox	button
i have a textbox with an add to clipboard button next to it

1390953
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
whenever the copy to clipboard button is pressed i want the contents of the clipboard to get copy-paste to the clipboard and work in a cross browser way across internet-explorer firefox google-chrome opera etc

1390956
webforms	asp.net
i m currently in the process of developing an asp.net webforms application that will have multiple skins

1390956
contains	elements
image dimension on the contains elements will need to be specifically specified in css as they will be implements as css background-images

1390963
getter	setter
don t use any getter setter or

1390971
click	mouse
hence the document class the old concept of _root can respond to mouse click from any display object no matter how deeply nested with addeventlistener mouseevent.click _onmouseclick

1390971
any	set
in any other situation - bubbling is set to false the broadcaster is not an interactiveobject on the display list or as in your case the listener is lower than the broadcaster in the display list hierarchy - the object broadcasting the event must be specifically listened to fooinstance.addeventlistener event.bar _bazfunc as opposed to just addeventlistener event.bar _bazfunc

1390972
google-chrome	firefox
zeroclipboard is another choice and this does appear to work well tested in firefox 3.5 ie 6 and google-chrome

1390977
any	set
are there any open source applications that provide a set of features similar to that of amazon-ec2 or rackspace cloud

1390986
uiresponder	uiview
uiresponder documentation claims a uiview should figure out if it has a controllers and pass the event to it

1390987
constructor	object
presumably i would just have to pass tihd or sphd to the constructor and then i would be able to use the object to indirectly modify the arrays with extended functionality similar to using a graphics object to modify a bitmap

1390995
interface-builder	iboutlet
i m wondering since the viewcontroller is an iboutlet in the .app delegation header that i may have to do something in interface-builder but i m not sure what

1391015
32-bit	64bit
initially 32-bit later 64bit

1391020
value	field
you can choose a variety of types for the code column - a single byte tiny int a small char field or an int depending on how many value you might need

1391021
network-interface	packets
as describe in the docs a remote network address is considered reachable if a packets destined for that address could leave this computer via any network-interface

1391027
.when	ready
.so if you want to be sure best recommendation i can make for compatibility with windows-xp only is to respond to inquiry as removable look for regular testunit ready cmd and then .when they cease consider yourself safely removed

1391033
variables	boolean
you can avoid duplication of the boolean variables with a templates class

1391084
subtyping	generics
this is not down-casting since java generics are invariant is not a subtyping of even though t is a subtyping of a

1391097
debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	debian	ubuntu	debian
if you are on a debian-based distribution ie debian ubuntu ... you ll have the apt-get cmd-line cmd which allows you to install.packages

1391109
kerberos	ldap
how do i implements integrated windows-authentication using asp.net kerberos protocols ldap in iis

1391136
silverlight	wpf
i m porting an .app which someone else wrote from wpf to silverlight

1391136
silverlight	wpf
however some of the methods properties which exist in wpf are missing in silverlight

1391136
silverlight	wpf
my internet searches only return information for wpf with no information on silverlight

1391138
packaging	building
once maven install putting a complete building in-place for your project compilation of java sources and unit tests execution of tests packaging of the compiled classes is a matter of 10 seconds really

1391144
vba	vb6
vba vb6 - 484 chars

1391157
reflection	runtime
it feels like it s doable with attributes and the reflection framework but i don t see a way to replace functions at runtime

1391169
spaces	output
although the last tr cmd is not needed since the output from a cmd implicit will have newline converted to spaces in this context

1391199
exponent	modulo
for testing purposes i have a set modulo and private exponent that i want to export into rsacryptoserviceprovider

1391209
getter	setter
then use synthesize in someobject s implementation to synthesize the setter getter

1391240
callback	methods
just make some class in java probably implements your callback interface that has native methods

1391241
bazaar	git
i had a quick look and it seems there are lots of git mercurial and svn options but no bazaar

1391243
hide	show
i need to show the numbers of results for a given category and hide any category that give no results

1391256
dictionary	arrays
but if it s likely to never grow you can probably get away with archiving - and possibly even the easiest of all the mechanisms sticking an arrays or dictionary straight into a plist

1391260
nsmutableset	ivar
my other option is to put an ivar on the parent controllers either an nswindowcontrollers or an nsmutableset of nswindowcontrollers s and then watch for the nswindowwillclosenotification in the parent controllers and release it in response

1391277
subclassing	inherited
each concrete subclassing of static-initializer gets it s own static constructor initialisation methods but you keep the advantage of having true inherited

1391283
constructor	object
the containers initializer complex object and inject them with the required object based on the types hints in the constructor using reflection

1391283
implements	extends
one thing i obviously stumbled upon is the fact that i can register multiple components that can be inject of the same types extends same class implements same interface s

1391313
dictionary	map	key-value	key
a set is like a dictionary or map of key-value pairs except that it only stores is a collections of key without associated value

1391313
contains	set
a set either does or doesn t contains an instances of each possible key-value

1391313
contains	set
for example a set of int might contains the value 0 1 5

1391313
contains	set
a value 5 can t be containss more than once in the set if you call the set s insert methods more than once for a given key-value the set will still contains only one instances of that key-value

1391313
contains	set
i ll keep a private set which contains all the valid handle value which i ve created

1391313
contains	set
.when the client gives me a handle i ll test whether the handle is a valid handle by testing whether that value is contains in my set

1391314
ubuntu	linux
what s the easiest way to do this on linux ubuntu

1391316
logout	login
if i access account login account logout account register the session always will be there but if i access different page i cant access the user variables

1391324
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
the parentviewcontroller is a readonly properties can only be read by the uiviewcontroller class and uinavigationcontroller class subclassing of these will not have access to set the properties

1391343
ostream	std
this way it works with both std cout and plain cout and ostream is available .when including

1391345
recording	playing
there is no way to do this while recording - but while playing you can use the setvolume float float methods on mediaplayer

1391348
contains	set
or you can set directly the rtf properties or richtextbox1.selectedrtf which contains formatting info

1391354
highlight	cell
basically i want to change the fonts color of a specific table cell based on a variables which changes daily in effect highlight the day of the week in a calendar

1391360
firefox	safari
but with firefox 3.5 and latest versioning of ie and safari i think the gap is much smaller if there is any

1391395
ruby	php
i have a ruby scripting that s being used to do some api call screen-scraping but our main .app is in php

1391395
ruby	php
our php .app is using shell_exec to call the ruby scripting

1391395
ruby	php
the ruby scripting works great .when called from the cmd lineâ but it will randomly exit early .when called via php s shell-exec

1391396
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
doing it in a pseudo fashion is simple enough - i know how many touches i have just by using touchesbegan and touchesended but the problem is that only touchesmoved send events

1391397
attributes	properties
i al.so noticed you don t have the named properties set in your column attributes .so add it just in case i have it include in my example assuming your column named is description

1391408
superclass	inherited
object does not inherited from kernel it is the final superclass in ruby 1.8

1391451
dictionary	arrays
the following solution provides a dictionary of arrays but you can use it as a basis for producing any data structure you like

1391467
subtract	add
to access elements on the left or right subtract or add 1 take care at the row boundaries

1391467
subtract	add
to access elements above or below subtract or add the row size in this case 3

1391467
decrement	increment
accessing adjacent elements is just increment or decrement either the row or column numbers

1391467
contains	elements
this methods has each cell contains up to four pointers to its adjacent elements

1391473
coalesce	isnull
a slightly more concise query though it there a difference between using isnull as opposed to coalesce

1391495
concurrenthashmap	readwritelock
you can store the readwritelock instances in a map keyed on path just make sure that you get concurrent access to the map correct possibly using concurrenthashmap

1391508
data-members	instances
accessing any data-members of the class will be the same as dereference this which if it doesn t points to a validly construct instances of myclass leads to undefined behavior

1391541
libpng	zlib
the libpng zlib combinations is just too big

1391564
getter	setter
.so the question is how to synthesize setter getter for class-variables in objective-c

1391566
getter	setter
i think the points being said is that use the auto implements instead of field .so that you can change it in the future if in case you need to add logic to getter and setter

1391566
getter	setter
my idea is add a new private variables and add the same x getter and setter

1391576
getter	setter
also you can put breakpoints on getter and setter but you can t on field

1391578
multiplying	addition
in addition multiplying the scrolldecay vector by the decay value

1391594
debugging	trace
for sql statements the log4j.logger.org.hibernate.sql properties needs to be set to debugging and for sqlparameter returned value the log4j.logger.org.hibernate.type properties needs to be set to trace

1391599
aggregate	grouping
aggregate-functions only work .when all of the non-aggregate elements of your selected clause c.id c.user_id etc represent the grouping being aggregate are include in the grouping by clause

1391606
constructor	private
if needed you can also declare a private constructor in your utility classes to prevent them from being initializer to emphasize that their just a bunch of related functions

1391606
instances	self
to call a static function from another function within the same class you would do .so using the self keyword which references the same class and not object or class instances

1391608
deployment	install
inorder to redeploy a gae application i currently have to install the gae deployment tools on the systemd that i am using for deployment

1391608
deployment	install
while this process is relatively straight forwarding the deployment process is a manual process that does not work from behind a firewall and the deployment tools must be install on every machine that will be used for updating gae apps

1391620
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
store a hash bcrypt or pbkdf2 of the passwd which has been salt

1391623
postback	ajax
this worked ok but was alot of hackery to get focus to maintain on the ajax postback amongst other things

1391623
postback	ajax
this is because updatepanel rewrite the whole section of html on each ajax postback

1391629
value	field
also in these situations i set the backing field directly .when value are passed in from a constructor no need to try and fire the onpropertieschangedevent which would be null at this time anyway anywhere else i use the properties itself

1391631
telnet	irc
try connecting an irc client using telnet and checked what mirc does .when you use ctrl+k

1391657
beautifulsoup	lxml
i ve been trying to use beautifulsoup and lxml thus far to accomplish this task but i m not sure how to handle the two div tags and td tag because they have attributes

1391657
beautifulsoup	lxml
in addition to this i m not sure whether i should rely more on beautifulsoup or lxml or a combinations of both

1391692
private-key	rsa
i m trying to encrypt some content with an rsa private-key

1391698
sequences	unique
this is more of a unique sequences then the sum of the sequences

the capability to inline a function-call is both a compiler-specific optimization and a common behavior

1391740
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
let s say i have a base-class called jedi and a derived-class called yoda which inherited from jedi

1391740
derived-class	base-class
if i declare a methods in jedi called forcepush and shadow that out in yoda then .when calling the methods on an instances of the yoda class it will ignore the base-class implementation and use the derived-class implementation

1391746
spaces	output
i d like to output this to the streaming but indentation each line with two spaces

1391746
spaces	output
is there an easy way to do this with the streaming manipulators like you can change the base for int output with special directives to the streaming or do i have to manually process the arrays and insert the extra spaces manually at each line break detected

1391754
keyword	term
this is why that keyword and the associated practice is generally regarded as smelly though some people object to this particular term i find it quite appropriate

1391784
windows-media-player	embed
you can embed the windows-media-player in an html page and then use javascript to manipulate the object

1391789
mocking	stubs
if you attempt to test a member function of a mock stubs class you run the risk of testing the mocking framework rather than your implementation

1391791
entity-framework	ado.net
i have a field of types image in my database which is mapped as binary in my model ado.net entity-framework

1391799
ftp-server	proftpd
it comes with proftpd which is a good ftp-server

1391855
linked-list	tree	linked-list	nodes	value	field
you can implements a linked-list with cons cell that s all a lisp list is a chaining of cons cell with a nil terminator but you can also put arbitrary value in each field using a cons cell as a coordinate pair a tree nodes etc

1391855
linked-list	nodes
a cons cell is thus strictly more general than a linked-list nodes

1391855
linked-list	nodes
to do that with a linked-list nodes you d have to redefine the class or data structure to alter the types

1391868
logging	trace
enable trace logging

1391880
strtol	scanf
there s no one best way to deal with this but generally the approach is to read the whole line as text using either fgets or scanf with a sized s conversion specifier which will consume the newline then convert to the target data types using sscanf or strtol or strtod

1391891
environment	building
use different properties files and use ant replace filtering which will do the replacement based on environment for which the building is done

1391900
ubuntu	linux	keyboard	mouse
on linux ubuntu the keyboard and mouse devices are found

1391933

if you are using ajax request make sure that you are updating all controls that need to be updates after ajax

1392259
selected	button
press the + button and selected new shell scripting

1392269
getter	setter
just use dynamic and implements the getter and setter to reference static-variables from your implementsation file

1392292
header-files	makefile
if you re looking for a quick n dirty way to get it working without changing the makefile architecture you write a scripting which given a list of directory will copy all header-files from those directory to a central location

1392305
managed-code	unmanaged
i know that mstest is orginally meant to test managed-code but its also possible to write unit tests for unmanaged sc

1392312

variables	boolean
private variables _fileloaded boolean false

1392356
variables	boolean
private variables _initialized boolean false

1392360
contains	elements	contains	sorted
if you are only ever doing this to a sorted list then i propose using a custom variant of the binary-search algorithm if you don t find the elements you are looking for then your upper bound actually contains the index of the next item in the list

1392387
python	java
this is a bigger issue in languages where you have a garbage collector like java python etc because the garbage collector will always believe that the singleton is necessary

1392393
put	get
but if i put back the selected attributes after removing it or to an tag without selected attributes i get the same output

1392398
32-bit	16-bit

your as3 classpath is points at a directory to low in the flashdevelop libs folder structure to pick the mx class prototype

1392409
delphi	c++
my company s main application is mostly written in c++ with some delphi code and components

1392409
unicode	wstring
i have lots of questions about this such as is wstring capable of holding everything a unicode-string can and should we just do a search replace or should we avoid all c++ string types altogether and use unicode-string can we change all event handler to use string though the existing .hpps event handler methods prototype were compiler-translated to ansistring right down to basic such as should we prefix all strings with l or is the compiler smart enough with unicode enabled to use unicode strings etc

1392409
delphi	c++
we have delphi code and tlb that are built into the c++ application

1392410
sortedlist	sorted
if you re using instead of sortedlist and make sure it is sorted you can do this using the binary-search methods

1392414
telnet	ssh	command-line	cmd
there are command-line telnet ssh clients that either accept external file as a list of cmd to run remotely or you can pass it with the inputstream redirection less then symbols to them

1392414
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
if the server that s hosting the mysql database is also a webserver - you could also think about putting some scripting php perl python ruby - whatever you like on the passwd protected area that would allow you to execute queries by simply making a http s queries on that scripting

1392436
subtract	time
at that points it s relatively easy convert the utc instant into the local time in both time zones using timezoneinfo.converttime and subtract one from the other

1392440
python	c++	python	java
python like java c++ .net uses string pooling intern

1392447
uitableview	uiview
an uiview which acts as the tableviewcontroller and thus has to implements the uitableviewdelegate and uitableviewdata.source protocols but it must not be derived from uitableviewcontroller directly since by doing .so the uitableview will automatically take up the whole screens size except toolbar navbars and or tabbars

1392447
uitableview	uiview
and connect it with the uitableview properties in your uiview the one mentioned in 1.

1392447
uitableview	uiview
using this methods it is possible to give the uitableview a fixed size which you ll need to to have room at the bottom for your second uiview

1392466
execute	declare
.when the cmd is execute it is most likely generator declare statements with the wrong data types

1392468

1392493
show	next
on every page-refresh if the current time is after the next time show the item and reset the nexttime session variables to the next hour

1392506
attributes	properties
also the selected attributes might not be expressed in the html markup but it is being set where it count - the dom selected properties

1392516
put	get
think of the difference between opengl and a game engine like the difference between getting a car building factory where you have to program all the machines yourself to get the desired car s part opengl and having all parts of the car ready for assembly already game engine and only having to put them together maybe change the color here and add a gear there

1392538
vb.net	vb6
this approach was suggested to vb6 developers who were thinking about upgrading to vb.net

extractto get the files out of the zip archive to put them somewhere

1392566
jquery	.post
i use jquery for a login it has the gmail types ajax login affect .so the user never actually see the login page they are .posting to on this login backen scripting i set a cookies to remember a users email-address i am curious if cookiess are able to be set if the browser never actually goes to the page it just .post to it

1392580
selected	cell
most mobile cell providers provide a free email to sms-gateway .so if you know the phone-number s service provider and you re only catering to a selected market uk only then that may be an option

1392603
arrays	loops
in this case all you need is to know arrays elements count for your project read amount of project then extraction all the data out of your arrays using simple loops

1392604
output	cat
i ve tried to output the full system_profiler data and parsing that using cat data | grep but that s obviously inefficient to the points where it s been faster if i just run each line like my example above

1392636
contains	sorted
each div contains a grid of entries that can be paged through or sorted by a particular column

1392636
contains	any
the first div contains a list of flights the second div contains a list of people who are associated with a flight along with a reference to which flight and the third div contains a list of people who are not associated with any flight at all

1392652
textbox	button
but now in the 2 page i have a textbox with a button to redirect to an url page passing the textbox value as parameter for url report

1392674
firefox	safari
neither firefox 3.5.2 safari 4.0.3 or ie8 show the amount column below as right-align

1392684
16-bit	8bit
from the second formula i assume you operating 2 16-bit value separated into their 8bit part a and b

1392699
execution	jobs
i just started playing around with execution background jobs in powershell and am wondering how far i can push the capability

1392701
any	set
you can set them up any way you like

1392702
rollback	commit
i can t help feeling that code is a little bloated will a transactional automatically rollback is a discrete commit fails in the case of non-nested transactionalal

1392702
rollback	commit
will commit or rollback automatically dipose the transactional

1392708
authentication	login
but .when the data is send to viewdocument the login page is display because the user isn t authentication

1392755
defined	declare
with maven 2 you can mitigate the verbosity by defining common configuration in a parent project in the examples you cite the dependencies can all be defined in the parent or in the dependency-management section of a parent .so a child can declare the junit dependency as

1392755
defined	declare
the plugins can both be declare in the parent and need not be defined in your child

1392766
credentials	account
you ll also need to store your credentials in the .app in all likelihood - though you can use a role account that is and admin only for the .apps it s deploying to minimize risk there

1392794
alignment	layout
this can be done by creating a styles and applying it to the body that include these two line but this also has draw backs creating many alignment and layout issues

1392804
button	popup
i am using asp hyperlink button to open a terms and conditional popup windows

1392822
selected	button
.when the user selected a date and presses the button i d like the results to open in a new windows

1392834
groovy	java
the hotfix is not persistent because the calling code is pure java not groovy

1392835
required	checked
if storing unicode is required then you need to checked if your existing data is compatible with a format such as utf-8

1392844
post-increment	pre-increment
there is little reason to favour pre-increment over post-increment .when you are talking about natural types like int

1392850
postfix-operator	prefix-operator
the postfix-operator invokes the prefix-operator to perform its own operation by design and in principles the prefix versioning will always be faster than the postfix versioning although the compiler can optimize this in many cases and especially for built-in types

1392850
postfix-operator	prefix-operator
itâ s the other that needs explanation why are .so many people intrigued by the use of the prefix-operator in situations where it doesnâ t matter â yet nobody is ever astonished by the use of the postfix-operator

1392877
post-increment	pre-increment
al.so semantics using pre-increment is usually clearer in showing the intention of a test .when the return-value is used .so its better to use it habitually than post-increment to avoid accidentally testing the old value

1392925
cvs	git
i ve used git cvsimport to import a cvs repo into a remote branch in a local git repository

1392925
cvs	git
git cvsimport -i -v -c cdt-make-core -d pserver anonymous dev.eclipse.org cvsroot tools -r cvs org.eclipse.cdt all org.eclipse.cdt.make.core

1392925
cvs	git
git push github cvs master refs heads cvs head

1392928
contains	any
i think if any two variables not just strings contains the same value the value will be stored only once not twice and both the variables will points to the same location

1392932
directory	folder
i am trying to mimic .when you right click a project and say new package - the source folder browse give a directory dialog with only those folder which are open projects..

1392945

1392981
python	perl
scripting languages like perl and python the lingua franca of bioinformatics are well supported on the mac - and it should be remembered that there are many versioning of linux

1393004
python	java
i am integration with a java application via python

1393004
python	java
java uses a modified utf8-decode in datainputstream.readutf which is not supported by python yet at least

can anybody points me in the right directions to construct java modified utf-8 strings in python

1393006
delphi	c++
looking for win32 api functions c++ or delphi sample code that tells me the cpu usage percent and or total cpu time of a thread not the total for a process

1393025
attributes	properties
there are two selected s the selected attributes and the selected properties

1393025
attributes	properties
the html attributes sets the initial state of the javascript selected boolean properties but after that like all form field state they are independent

1393025
attributes	properties
attr in jquery is a kind of hybrid of attributes and properties access which tries to sweep these problems under the rug

1393054
python	java
instead i run it through a python scripting that runs the java

1393056
drawimage	draw
i can draw these on the canvas rendering context with drawimage

obviously this can not be allowed to work as the would contains an object afterwards throw away all the type-safety that generics are aimed to give you

1393129
search-engine	seo
one thing with seo is if a search-engine finds two identical document on two different links it may reduce pagerank for one of the pages

1393203

browsers remember the previous value set in form field .so check2 is still selected without you getting a click event the state of the radio does not match the state of the form-action

1393208
identity-column	sql-server
i have a datatable with an id column which is an identity-column in our sql-server 2005 database

1393210

which will allow you to get strings from the list but not to put anything in

1393216
postback	ajax	user-controls	treeview
i have a custom treeview which i create programmatically as there is a need of specific layout which is not achievable using asp.net treeview.it is on a master page..when i click on treenode the content area refreshes after a postback.there is a page category.aspx which is a content page of this master page.i have a user-controls in that content area named products.aspx.now i want to use ajax to prevent the postback which happens .when i click on treenode.i tried putting user-controls in updatepanel and treeview as well in updatepanel but to no awail

1393220
reflection	runtime
reflection is much more general and enables you to inspect types information at runtime and manipulate object without knowing their types at compile-time

1393227
google-chrome	firefox
sporadically i see errors in firefox only not in ie or google-chrome .when trying to communication with the embedded flash object

1393241
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework

1393286
any	set
content-type can be set in meta tag just as in any other html xhtml document using content attributes like

1393366
constructor	private
the problem is that be default a non abstract static-class will always have a default empty public constructor unless you overrides it with private constructor ....

1393368
value	field
whats more you can al.so add a value field to the dropdownlistfor this way but you must modify the sql query .so it wold return 2 columns

1393385
shopping-cart	paypal
we have custom shopping-cart and use paypal website payment standards to handle payment

1393386
sql-server	ms-access
unfortunately the views collections is not available .when connecting from an ms-access client to a sql-server through an ado connection which is our case see cannot use adox views collections with sql-server

1393389
getter	setter
in scala .when you write a variables foo the scala compiler automatically generator a setter called and a getter called foo for it and sets the field as private you ll see it as private if you decompile a class having public scala field with javap

1393389
getter	setter
in your traits you haven t defined a methods and for a public field setter and getter always come in pairs

1393389
getter	setter
if you want to have similar behavior to a variables you could do something like this by having explicit setter and getter

1393394
double	int
let us assume i have declare the variables i of certain datatype might be int char float or double .

1393394
double	int
note simply consider that i is declare and dont bother if it is an int or char or float or double datatype

1393394
double	int
since i want a generics solution i am simply mentioning that variables i can be of any one of the datatypes namely int char float or double

1393397
selected	button
i have to construct a simple viewer page of a model let us assume person where i present a set of criterion to the user to choose from based on state of persistent model for e.g i have a dropdown for departments showing all the distinct departments for which person recording are available and once departments are chosen i wish to present users with the list of all distinct designations like manager supervisor ..etc. available for that grouping .when all the criterion value are selected and show button pressed is .when i actually want to show the data

1393397
contains	set	value	field
let us assume that the per.son class is heavy it contains a clob field .so this aggregate model has to be loaded on stages like first i want to display all available criterion value to the user and finally based on his selection of the set of criterion that will act as key will i actually want to go to the server to fetch the data and finally display

1393405
32-bit	64bit
the pdf libs has a 32-bit versioning and a 64bit versioning

1393405
32-bit	64bit
i think i need to create a cruisecontrol.net project which on checked in opens the project file replace the reference to the 32-bit pdf dll with a reference to the 64bit versioning then performs a building creating a building ready for a 64bit machine

1393426
put	get
even if it would be possible to get the value to serialization it it can t be deserializationd as there is no way to put the value back in the new object

1393435
show	next
next you use sequences diagram to show how the different object interact with each other

1393435
conditional	operators
a common issue with sequences diagram is how to show conditional and iterator the .post integration fragment explains how integration fragment operators alt opt par loops and region can be used for that matter

1393442
profiling	debugging
don t know the answer but for such debugging i use sql profiling

1393447
gridview	listview	listviewitem	gridview
i have a listview gridview with listviewitem that represent different category of items

1393447
treeview	listview
my treeview has a datatemplate per category and i can see how i can set a different contextmenu for each there but i can t seem to get similar datatemplates to work for my listview

1393451
duplicates	contains	duplicates	elements	contains	elements
edit in my case the list is guaranteed to contains the el elements to avoid and the list containss no duplicates but it would be interesting to see some more general cases aswell

1393453
authentication	login
.when i run threads parallels what is essentially happening is that each thread request a login page and somehow only the last thread to request login page is authentication as i feel that subsequent login page that comes with a new sid in cookies invalidates the old or other sids

1393465
duplicates	elements
edit 2 another alternative for duplicates elements is you could use an optimised shuffle random sort operation on a cloned versioning of the list and then foreach through the list

1393465
duplicates	elements
the foreach would iterate up to the numbers of duplicates elements there were in the list

1393474
pointers	stack
setjmp longjmp is implements by saving the registers including stack and code pointers etc .when first passed and restoring them .when jumping

1393479
scripting-bridge	foundation
if the foundation appkit scripting-bridge modules can be import then everything is alright

1393494
shell	bash
alias are available only in interactive shell - a snapshot from bash manpage

1393497
perl	ruby
better use some fully featured scripting-language like perl or ruby

1393528
selected	checkbox

1394404
python	c++
i think an abundance of behavior-less classes in a multi-paradigm language one like c++ or python that while supporting classes doesn t constrain you to use them .when simpler structures will do is a design smell -- the design equivalent of a code-smell albeit a mild one

1394404
dictionary	namedtuple
in addition to good old dictionary and full-fledged classes python 2.6 offers the handy alternative of namedtuple s for struct with a predefined set of attributes

scriptaculous	jquery
by the way the page is using lightview wich works with prototype and scriptaculous but not jquery

1394651
interpreted-language	static-typing	interpreted-language	interpretation
maybe it s because one of my main interpreted-language is perl and one of my compiled languages is objective-c but i never strongly felt that there was anything special about compilation vs interpretation that suggested dynamic over static-typing

1394651
interpreter	runtime
while a purely interpreter-language would have to add in a preprocessor step and hence not be purely interpreter inorder to warn the programmer before execution of static-typing errors it doesn t preclude throw a types error at runtime as it occurs

1394653
subtraction	addition
we re just talking addition and subtraction here

1394653
oracle	mysql
oracle s analytic-functions are really nice for that sort of thing but i m not sure if mysql has an equivalent

i have uninstaller the 32-bit client and am getting the 64bit client install the problem is that the server is a production server in a dmz and i have no access to the server myself .so i am trying to anticipate any problems i will have .when the 64bit client is install and i try to access the asp.net application on the server

1394712
lgpl	gpl
you have a gpl or lgpl program built as a separate executable with no modifications made by you

1394712
lgpl	gpl
you are building a closed-source application that needs the functionality of the gpl or lgpl program

1394712
lgpl	gpl
however it does violate the spirit of the gpl and the lgpl

1394715
delphi	c++
if you can t satisfy the first two requirements then there is the much harder way which is also what you d need to do if your application isn t written in delphi or c++ builder

1394718

the following code will printing the largest primes factors of a given numbers

1394738
defined	declare
thus i suppose in the followings that your questions investigates another approach .when combinators i is not defined as a mere alias for compound term s k k but introduced as a standalone basic combinators constants on its own whose operational semantics is declare explicit by axiom scheme

1394738
any	set	enumerator	any
any enumerator infinite set disjoint of the constants and parentheses sign will serve as the alphabet of variables i will denote them here with unformatted roman lowercase letters x y z.

mainly the jquery lightbox plugins

1394760
lightbox	jquery
reference the jquery scripting followed by the lightbox scripting in your html document.like .so

1394771
rollback	commit
actually you usually don t just need a custom rollback methods but also a custom commit methods

1394772
callback	methods
they use an xmlhttprequest object to send a request usually asynchronous to some url get the results of that request then execute a callback methods you ve provided callback with a lowercase c passing the results of the request to your methods

1394772
callback	methods
client callback are implements as instances methods on your page

1394795
contains	elements	contains	any	margins	padding
as the green containsers doesn t have any border or padding there is nothing to contains the margins of the orange elements

lgpl	gpl
you re not linking gpl ed or lgpl ed code at all you re only spawn a gpl ed or lgpl ed binary and the gpl and lgpl permit this

1394867
lgpl	gpl
your users are free to use that binary themselves for its author intended purposes and are free to downloading and compile the .source themselves .so all of their freedoms are preserve and you re not in violation of the gpl or lgpl

1394867
lgpl	gpl
this is what the gpl faq is talking about by communicat ing at arms length. this doesn t even violate the spirit of the lgpl and gpl

1394867
lgpl	gpl
also although you didn t specifically ask about this keep in mind that distributing gpl ed or lgpl ed software with your software means that you re required to include a copy of the license with your install and to also distribute the source code

1394867
lgpl	gpl
for example if you package up your .application in an install and include copies of gpl ed or lgpl ed executable in the install then you re distributing lgpl ed or gpl ed code and must make copies of the source code available either online by mail-in offer or by cd depending on how you distribute your .app

1394867

administration	account
.so by default the installing account must be an administration on the target machine

1394899
administration	account
for w2k3 sp1 and later if you do not want to run the scripting as an administration then you could modify the security descriptingor on the service control manager for the target machine to include an ace for the account the scripting runs under with the appropriate right s

1394899
administration	account
in general though you would probably be better off re-thinking your deployment process to use an administration account for service installation

1394903
culture	locale
obviously using the user s current culture will mean that you will get different results in different locale but they will be consistent with what your users in those locale will expect

if not do i have to replicate the crud functionality provided by the repositories in my service-layer which ofcourse will in turn use the repository for these functions

1394979
udp	tcp
i take it you don t want to replace the modems at the client sites the easiest thing on the server side would be each clients had its own ip software stack and used its modem to call an isp and establish an internet-connection and then talk to your server using tcp or udp or http or whatever

1394979
h.323	sip
voip consists of sip for signals for call set-up and call teardown plus some codecs h.323 for traffic encode voice while the call is established

alternatively the newest versioning of octave or gnuplot might reference the newer libs .so you might be able to just upgrade one of those instead

1395071
strtol	atoi
you ll have to pass it through as a string and then parsing it with something like atoi or strtol

1395075
asp.net-mvc	wcf	asp.net-mvc	webforms

directory	folder
i considered just making a folder resources in the main directory but there is a problem

1395598
hashtable	sorted
in your case building a hashtable on either a or b and scanning another table is cheaper than either performing nested-loops over the index on b.id or merging the sorted resultsets which the optimizer used before the hint

1395598
order	join
since you mentioned that loops join improved the speed it may be .so that the join order was chosen incorrectly by the optimizer

1395645
controllers	routes
you can create a custom route to handle that kind of routes and have them dispatcher to the correct controllers and url

1395646
pointers	stack
ebp itself actually points to the previous frame s base pointers which enables stack walking in a debugger and viewing other frame local-variables to work

1395646
pointers	stack
fpo or frame pointers omission optimization which you can enable will actually eliminate this and use ebp as another register and access locals directly off of esp but this makes debugging a bit more difficult since the debugger can no longer directly access stack frame of earlier function-calls

1395650
binary	hex
it doesn t correspond to any source-code line nor does its hex or binary interpretation correspond to a relevant location in the binary

1395661

you should not use the root account or any account that has administration privileges to connect to mysql except .when it s needed -- here it is not

1395920
contains	elements
since your lists contains only unique elements it is clear which ones you have to remove and which ones you have to insert

i have a c++ libs which has functionality exposed to lua and am seeking opinions on the best ways to organise my lua code

1395934
local-variables	function-call
from that points on during the execution of the function the arguments to the function are located on stack at positive offset from ebp because they were pushed prior to the function-call and the local-variables are located at negative offset from ebp because they were allocated on stack after the function entry

1396198
rel	src
you could store the src of the image in the rel tag on the a

1396204

1396228
contains	elements
which would work for a list contains 1 or more elements

1396236
controllers	routes
in codeigniter you can set custom routes and stuff to direct certain urls to other controllerss actions but i think you mean in the middle of a controllers function to jump into another

1396242
google-chrome	firefox
checkout this page in firefox or google-chrome

1396243
order	add
in this case it makes sense to add a separate table that will actually connect the upgrade to a specific order while keeping the product in mind

1396250
bar-chart	plot	parallel-coordinates	scatter-plot
it provides highly dynamic and interactive graphics such as tours as well as familiar graphics such as the scatter-plot bar-chart and parallel-coordinates plot

1396273
log4net	nlog
if you want freedom of choice without creating a strong dependency on a specific logging framework log4net nlog entlib you could take a look at the common.logging libs

1396285
oracle	mysql
i have a cmd class that abstracts almost all specific database functions we have the exactly same application running on mssql 2005 using odbc and the native mssql libs mysql and oracle

1396285

1396300
contains	any
httprequestvalidationexception occurs .when i try .post .when txtbulletin contains any html like

1396318
constructor	object	private-members	constructor	private-members	object
it rather depends what you want to do with the object - the normals technique for private-members means they are accessible only by member-functions and required that you use a constructor to create the object

1396337
where-clause	sql
expression can be used at several points in sql statements such as in the order by or having clauses of selected statements in the where-clause of a selected delete or updates statement or in set statements

1396350
webforms	asp.net	hide	show
i seem to keep running into these complex show hide scenarios in asp.net webforms where the logic goes if field a equals blah and field b equals blahblah then field c is show hidden validation whatever. before i run off and start building custom validation and custom-controls .so i can more easily manage it in markup or backend code are there any libs or simpler .solutions i m missing out there in the wild

1396350
hide	show
...that way if the prerequisites value were both evaluated as true the dependentfield would show and hide if not

1396358
configuration	installation
you could just create .war files for every installation google for .warbler and serve them through one tomcat or use jetty for each installation which can be a little more lightweight than tomcat depending on your configuration

1396371
constructor	object
i think the variables tim new data tweets num .created_at constructor is taking the date from tweets num .created_at and converting it to local timezone my machine time and constructing a new object tim

1396389
stderr	stdout
our .war would output the logs both stdout and stderr to the directory jboss server servername log

1396414

how do antivirus programs detection if something is a virus or trojan

1396452
firefox	safari
it works in firefox and safari but not in ie

1396469
executable	upx
virus dictionary - looks for known signature for example the upx executable compression algorithm is popular to make the payload really small

1396480
debugging	trace
besides you can trace step by step the state of the emulated processor flags register value etc and debugging your code

1396510
itemtemplate	gridview
if you use a gridview you d put a repeater in an itemtemplate in a templatefield column

1396532
any	set
if you set the string variables to equals the component id you cannot access any properties because it is now a string and not an object

1396540
directory	folder
for example i had mobile users come from and use a different directory than the main site but wanted to use all of the functions and classes of the main site .so i would chdir to the main site folder

1396602
invokerequired	begininvoke
the actual call to invokerequired begininvoke invoke are not entirely thread safe

1396603
dictionary	arrays
the problem was that the json from the client was an arrays and not a dictionary which in turn was because the scripting file was caching by ie

1396604
unicode	wstring	wstring	ansi
you can however pass ansi data to systemd unicode-string but not to std wstring and it will convert to unicode automatically

1396604
tuples	any
if your tuples is expecting 8bit characters then you will have to make sure that any struct declarations and such are using char and not wchar_t characters

1396604
unicode	wstring
if you pass the same memory-address to systemd unicode-string or std wstring it is going to assume unicode characters instead

1396608
jquery	.post
ryan goes over how to use jquery to .post a form and handle the response in a .js.erb file

1396622
lookup	any
the double versioning doesn t work because the global namespace is not used for the lookup since double is a built-in types and not specially associated with the global namespace in any way

1396628
required	checked
note that this still means that it s published api .so using reflection to access it shouldn t be prone to versioning breakage though it will required appropriate permissions for your code to circumvent visibility checked

1396632
python	ruby	eventmachine	twisted
i m think here along the line of ruby s eventmachine or python twisted

1396656
checkbox	button
the answers from seengee and los are much appreciated but i wanted a more integrated solution that would allow me to work with checkbox and radio button with the natural f syntax that i already use with other form elements

1396663
arrays	loops
your getdocuments methods has a return-types of ienumerable .so there is no need to even loops over your arrays .when isreverseorder is false you can just return it as is as arrays types is ienumerable.

1396671
python	java
with byte-compiled languages such as java python and .net it is not even sufficient to measure performance on just one machine

1396678
linux	unix
i downloading some source tar ball as linux or unix for this purpose

1396721
callback	methods
the methods is also very slow and required to implements calling the required callback while the real event gets hit

1396733
32-bit	64bit
you can use sysctl and query hw_memsize .this returns the memory size as a 64bit int instead of the default 32-bit int

1396744
subtraction	addition
the speed of the native addition and subtraction opcodes is irrelevant

1396749
tokenize	parsing
i have an application where i need to parsing or tokenize xml and preserve the raw text don t parsing entities don t convert whitespace in attributess keep attributes order etc. in a java program

1396749
stax	sax
i ve spent several hours today trying to use stax sax xslt tag-soup etc

1396750
.when	ready
this will create the service proxy object in the background for you .so .when your .app actually makes a call out to the service everything is ready

1396758
put	get
but if i put 0 1 0 0 only the right to read then i get redirected to and one particular thing that i have noticed is that it doesn t call the app_controller or at least the beforefilter function in the app_controller

1396768
installation	environment	interpreter	runtime
in these cases the platform has been interpreter sensibly i must add as the java runtime environment installation

1396770
basic	vb6
after some investigation it appears that the randomize and rnd implementation in recent versioning of visual basic use exactly the same algorithms as vb6

1396785
mouseleave	mouseenter
both mouseenter and mouseleave only take one arguments but you re defining two callback functions

1396812
arrays	loops
of course that pseudo-code is inside a loops that execute until the file runs out or the arrays gets filled

1396829
scanf	atoi
edit one other note various static analysis tools may flag things like atoi and scanf as unsafe

1396829
strtol	atoi
atoi is obsolete due to the fact that it does not checked for errors like strtol does

1396860
selected	button
but if i make the flash object that small before the user has selected accept in the webcam dialog box flash won t allow the user to click on the accept button

1396860
selected	button
all the netconnection and netstream events seem to get fired identically whether or not the accept button has been selected

1396868
itemscontrol	grid
use an itemscontrol with the itemspanel set to a grid

1396874
xsd	xml
both an xsd and a dtd for xml schema can be found on this site

1396875
telnet	ftp	telnet	ssh	ftp	ssh
- protocols - http ftp ssh telnet any others

1396892
hierarchicaldatatemplate	binding
anyway the best way to add a nodes is to use binding and hierarchicaldatatemplate s

1396895
any	set
this would not be hard to do as i imagine you have .some code that keeps popping up all over the place .so just extends the login functionality to checked for a global variables if you don t have any common global-variabless across your page you could just set it in .htaccess via setenv

1396896
folder	dir
maybe you should not put the include file in your web root dir or a sub folder

1396926
32-bit	x86
pretty much all 32-bit x86 systemd running today uses a flat not segmented memory-model

1396937
buffering	streaming
in addition to those it is possible to create more complicated streaming than the one in the original question - you can specify the buffering size there as well - on both the client and the server side

1396942
32-bit	64bit
normally multiplying two 32-bit int produces a 64bit result but this is truncated to the low 32-bit if you store it in a 32-bit int

1396942
32-bit	64bit
for example on powerpc the mulhw opcode returns the high 32-bit of the 64bit result-of a 32x32 bit multiplying in one clock

1396943
moss	wss
in moss wss 3.0 you can and should use the asp.net webpart

1396956
hide	show
note this code only works if you have a previously selected and visible div because i am using the callback inside hide to activate the show effect and get it nice and smooth.

1396960
32-bit	64bit
not that you re asking about windows but as an example even though windows has an api that sounds like it does what you want a 32 by 32-bit multiplying while obtaining the full 64bit result it implements the multiplying as a macros that does what you re doing

1396962
32-bit	64bit
you would think that the optimizer might know that the processor produces a 64bit value from 32 by 32-bit

1396962
division	modulo
that said at some points i tried to get the compiler to use the modulo as well as the dividend on a division result but the old microsoft compiler from 1998 was not smart enough to realize the same instruction produced both results

1396974
arrays	loops
how to send this arrays object to the service and whats the data types which the service will receive to loops through and process

1396982
eventmachine	twisted
i don t think there s anything quite like eventmachine or twisted

1396997
grouping	sorting
the sorting algorithm i m looking for is a kind of alphabetic sorting but taking grouping into account

1397012
dictionary	arrays
in addition to andrew s solution on this page i ve been able to use the dictionary object in vbscript to do what i was after using a syntax more like associativity arrays normall use in other languages

for example if i had an entity that contains a one-to-many associations to an entity

1397032
directory	folder
add your .htaccess to the same directory where the systemd folder is located .so in your codeigniter root directory you should have

1397046
subtraction	addition
the way this experiment should be designed is to write 2 different programs - 1 for addition 1 for subtraction

1397046
subtraction	addition
if you wanted to analyze different methods of addition subtraction and looping again each of those should be a separate program

1397061
inline-assembly	assembly
you may still find some really performance critical bits of code written in assembly in some games but generally whole functions will be written in assembly rather than using bits of inline-assembly in c++ code

1397076
exception-handling	try-catch
errors should be caught as exception-handling in a try-catch block

1397081
subtraction	addition
re-order your scripting .so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again

1397082
selection	highlight
is there a way to do a selection highlight over all elements in a html table

1397082
selected	button
i want to be able to have data display in a tabular form and the user to be able to click a button to selected the relevant data to copy and paste into the spreadsheet of their choosing

1397085
arrays	loops
and then for each part of your arrays use something similar to my text creating loops and instead use the simplexml functions addchild for each nodes of the arrays

1397113
curly-braces	macros
.so what i want to do is selected a region and then run a function or a macros that will prompt for the tag named and insert the curly-braces the closing and the tag named into the buffering at the start and end of the region

1397115
ruby-on-rails	django	csv	xml
it is fully written in django .so you can use j.son ruby-on-rails xml csv etc

1397118
javascript	dom	.when	ready
instead it is recommended to load javascript as soon as the dom is ready but unfortunately there is no cross browser compatible native solution for this see getting notified .when the page dom has loaded but before window.onload

1397118
google-chrome	safari
your issue seems to be caused by the opposite behavior though google-chrome facilitates the webkit rendering engine just like safari and for the latter onload is discussed to behave differently see section .when does onload fire

1397121
msbuild	nant
it s often easier to shell out from nant to msbuild since the latter supports .sln files

1397157

simplemodal	jquery
i m trying to use the simplemodal jquery libs on a page and the modal pop-up is being hidden behind an embedded youtube object on my page

1397202
header-files	stdafx.h
also i don t think you should be putting the #include stdafx.h line into the header-files at all

1397212
backgroundworker	winforms
backgroundworker is limited one thread and is best used for winforms apps where you have background i o and don t want to lock the user-interface thread

1397219
header-files	stdafx.h
finally have include stdafx.h at the start of each .cpp file not usually in the header-files

1397223
order	add
.so while there are no object being violated in this awkward predicament there is a more natural way of writing addchild statements and that s to add children from parent instead of the other way around because that s the order laid down by the syntax

1397241
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
a nice thing about using json.stringify is that in browser that support native json serializing firefox 3.5 ie 8 nightly building of safari and google-chrome it will automatically take advantage of the browser-native routines instead of using javascript

1397243
base-class	inherited
the first issue you will potentially hit is that c# only allows you to inherited from a single base-class which in this case will always be disposableobject

1397248

1397275
typedef	struct
this wont work as vec is a typedef not a class or struct

1397278

are great tools for this kind of thing since they let you put in the types of the function you want and get back a list of functions

1397321
32-bit	64bit
to expand on matt b s answer the 64bit .net updatess that microsoft provides will always updates both versioning of the framework native 64bit and the wow64 32-bit framework

it seems linq2sql doesn t know how to construct the tsql while you transform linq2sql object into domain-object with constructor

1397400
contains	set
namely fast-enumeration -- the for x in y syntax -- is really fast and more importantly implies that splitpoints is an arrays or set that contains a bunch of data that has already been parsing into individual object

1397405
c++	lua
it appears to be more designed for embedding into a c++ application sort of like lua

1397420
inotifypropertychanged	ivalueconverter
in mvviewmodel the viewmodel part is to help you out - if you can get away with binding directly to the model the data doesn t change or you don t mind implements inotifypropertychanged in your model then doing this even if you have to use a few ivalueconverter classes is okay

1397421
put	get
you can then also use that same value object .when display the address have your persistent layer get the information put it in the value object pass it to a factory with the current locale which returns the desired address format and send that output to the front end

1397422
put	get
if the person doesn t want to fill in the info then they won t -- they ll put in a period or garbage to get past the required field nanny

1397474
dlopen	dlsym
the functions in dlfcn.h dlopen dlsym et

1397479
lightbox	jquery
most jquery lightbox plugins scan the page and insert their functionality at the page load event or rather the jquery document-ready event

1397488
.war	jar
but if both your .wars required the same versioning of the common package you could put the jar for that package into the relevant server configuration s .lib folder server default .lib instead of having it in the .war files

1397490
any	set
i m new to c++ but have set my mind on a specific task that needs me to enable adding a specific chunks of code to be execute whenever any list item is attempted to be changed or read

1397571
profiling	trace
i ve used yourkit a java profiling to trace these delay to major redraw operations

1397586

1397601
command-prompt	command-line
the single-string command-line format is there because we need to be able to types things at the command-prompt

1397601
shell	bash
like all shell bash has special rules about how to split that single string into multiple arguments

1397613
radio-button	selected
.when submitted there is just the one value in the response - the radio-button you selected

1397627
win32gui	wxpython
he s actually working well below wxpython s level of abstraction and in terms of win32gui call win32con constants plus a finite state-machine clocked by a wx.timer at 100 milliseconds though he does admit that the result from the latter frankenstein surgery is.

1397627
xlib	x11
however nobody s yet offered any ports of this to mac os x nor to any windows manager of the many that are popular on linux and unix-like architectures i m not sure whether the feat could be achieved just at xlib level -- windows decoration aspects do seem to be involved and in the x11 world those do tend to need windows manager cooperation

1397651
javascript	dom
appears within the javascript dom model allowing you to access them with various function-calls

1397651
javascript	dom
you can access it via javascript by named but i think that it does not appear as a nodes in the dom or some restrictions may apply you cannot use innerhtml for example if i recall correctly

1397653
haskell	erlang
if you ve bought into the functional-programming paradigms the chances are that you like both erlang and haskell

1397653
versioning	upgrade
it has a seemingly unique feature in its ability to upgrade its versioning at runtime via hot code loading

1397653
haskell	erlang
where i defined mainstream to be any language that has a published o reilly book .so haskell counts. its straightline single-threaded performance looks superior to erlang s and its lightweight threads look even lighter too

1397653
haskell	erlang
i am trying to put together a development platform for the rest of my coding life and was wondering whether it was possible to mix erlang and haskell to achieve a best of breed platform

1397653
haskell	erlang
i d like erlang and haskell to be able to shared the same garabage collector

1397653
haskell	erlang
i understand there are technical limitations to running erlang hot code loading and haskell higher kinded polymorphism on either the jvm or the clr

1397653
haskell	erlang
in the platform i have proposed above i would only write haskell as the boilerplate erlang wouldã be automatically generator

1397653
erlang	scala
scala may not have the absolute fault-tolerance of erlang but it offers an escape route for the very many folks who are tied to the jvm

1397653
erlang	ocaml
often i read of results of benchmarking of ocaml v ghc v erlang v .

1397682
.when	ready
the gdirections object load event fires .when the results are ready

stupidly though .when itunes came up one day and asked if i wanted my phone updates to 3.0.1 i said yes without realizing which phone i was updating

1397786
constructor	object
it s probably to do with the way l2s parsing the expression - it can parsing the object initializer expression but not the constructor expression

1397801
attributes	properties
what ikke said but also i should points out that you shouldn t be setting the checked properties to since it is the dom properties and not the elements attributes which you are modifying - set it to a boolean

1397807
postgresql	mysql
you might get a performance increase by batch-file up several hundred if your database supports insert multiple rows per query both mysql and postgresql do

1397825
python	ruby
people have experimented with language-to-language compilers in other contexts scheme anywhere python or ruby in javascript etc. but those languages were designed for a different place and purpose and in translation lose a lot of their best aspects making the results cool hacks but not comfortable for day-to-day work

pointers	stack
this is done nice an efficiently just by subtract some numbers from a special pointers called the stack-pointers which says where the data for new stack variables will have their data allocated

1397872
decrement	increment
by increment and decrement the stack-pointer programs have an extremely fast way of working out were the memory for variables will live

1397872
pointers	stack
the memory for your arrays is also pushed and popped from the program s data stack and your arrays pointers is a pointers into the program s stack-memory

1397872
pointers	stack
usually your arrays pointers will continue to hold its original data until new stack variables are allocated and assign data the memory is reused for other purposes

1397877
any	set
does anyone have any idea how i could write a stored procedure that will return a result set which has the break-down describe above

it has the required code to work on windows-mobile and windows-ce and also has a good explanation as well as a forum to discuss further on.

1398100
execute	declare
if you only need the dependency in your tests because mylibrary needs it to execute you shouldn t declare the dependency at all in your project s pom

1398100

1398108
value	field
field to hold a formatted value instead

1398136

digits	base
.so to get the numbers of digits of a numbers x in base b you can use the inverse function of exponentiation base-b logarithm

1398207
updating	updates
i m taking a guess that .when you say printing you mean that you are updating some textfield or labels and that perhaps are queueing the gui updates with calllater

1398207

union-all	union
a union-all will normally perform better than a union as a union is a set operation and will remove duplicates by default as will minus and intersect

1398321
32-bit	64bit
note that on top of your main problem there was another bug in the code sizeof data gives you the numbers of bytes required to store the pointers 4 bytes on a 32-bit os or 8 bytes on a 64bit os whereas you really want the numbers of bytes required to store what the pointers points to an int 4 bytes on most oses

1398786
click	mouse
.when mousedown+left button click - save initial mouse positioning

1398786
click	mouse
.when mousemove+left button click - move panel1+label1 by the difference between current mouse positioning and the saved initial positioning

1398797
linked-list	arrays
if you are going to implements such collections you might want to use arrays with floating head tail pointers - since you have fixed size you don t need linked-list at all

1398806
xsd	xml
there are tools out there that will help you generator dtd or xsd for sample xml xml spy has served me well in the past

1398817
click	mouse
if that still makes you uneasy though it s easy enough to eliminate having the controllers checked player.clickable just send the click event to every object under the mouse which implements iclickable descends from clickable

1398818
freebsd	linux	solaris	freebsd	solaris	linux
they support many different platform win32 mac os x linux freebsd solaris wince... and compilers msvc gcc codewarrior watcom etc.

1398837
windows-xp	windows
now while launchd the sfx archive works fine on windows-xp it doesn t on windows 7

1398856
value	field
now on onclientclick event i want to set the field in the inner class a value

1398857
base-class	inherited
.when i use multi-table inherited django creates two tables - one for the base-class and one for the derived one points to the first

1398862
order	join
it s important to note that the optimise will look at the statistics of your tables and indexes then may re-arrange the order of the join

1398862
order	join
but equally having the b table data in a nice order may also make the join faster

1398862
put	get
finally if you put all the field in the index the index does get bigger but the query may never actually need to look at the table

1398867
highlight	selected
the gotocurrent option is meant to make the highlight move to the selected date

1398878
constructor	private	instances	private
make the constructor private and get it to return an instances of either an existing connection or a new one

1398880
updatepanel	gridview
i got a gridview in an updatepanel with this edittemplate

1398889
nested-loops	arrays
in real life for those sizes first option will be slightly faster but this only applies to this concrete example nested-loops bigger arrays or specially smaller caching sizes would have a significant impact in performance depending on the order

1398895
attributes	properties
also the more standards way of setting the checkedness of a checkbox is simply setting the checked properties of the checkbox elements to true or false rather than rely on jquery s attributes handling methods

1398897
haskell	erlang
a lot of haskell and erlang people are interested in the model where erlang supervises distribution while haskell runs the shared-memory nodes in parallels doing all the numbers crunching logic

1398897
haskell	erlang
the question now is to find someone to actually push through the erlang haskell interop to find out the tricky issues

1398931
gridview	listview
the problem is related to the controltovalidate properties because the id of your textbox is not used in repeat elements like gridview listview and repeater

1398963
carbon	cocoa
1 is there a possibility to ports the carbon applications to cocoa

1398963
carbon	cocoa
there is no possibility of porting the carbon application to cocoa then can i develop on

1398966
contains	elements
elements that contains an image

1398971
value	field
also any ideas on how i can segregate based on 2 of field matching with standards and 3 of the field matching with the standards value

1398984
32-bit	64bit
then by default on 32-bit platform i dont know if that is true for 64bit the offset of c is 4 as there is one byte padded after b and after d there are 3 more bytess padded at the end if i remember correctly

1398985
firefox	gecko
1.9.1.2 is the versioning numbers of the gecko layout engine used in firefox 3.5.2

1398991
arrays	loops
you can use the selenium cmd getalllinks to get an arrays of the ids of links on the page which you could then loops through and checked the href using the getattributes which takes the locator followed by an and the attributes named

1398996
loading	gif
i want a loading indicator gif animation if possible to show up .when i drop the item and the request is being sent to the server until the php request is done and load is succesful

1399006
innodb	myisam
usually this is avoided by not using noddy myisam and going to innodb instead which has row-level locking amongst other desirable database features

1399006
innodb	myisam
better migrate the bulk of the table to innodb leaving only a fulltext field in myisam

1399006
innodb	myisam
everything except fulltext searches can then steer clear of the myisam table and use only the innodb table which exhibits much better locking performance

1399006
innodb	myisam
personally i now tend to store everything in the innodb table including the text and store a second copy of the text in the myisam table purely for fulltext searchbait purposes

1399014
value	field	unique	words
you could use a bit field to be able to store 256 unique value in 8 words 256 bits 32-bit words 8 but then the compiler will no longer be able to enforce that only a single bit is set at a time

1399018
row	col
then it should find each row matching the corresponding col and apply the col class to each elements like .so

1399029
hide	show
show the image in the updates function before you start the ajax-call make a callback for the load and hide the image there .so after the ajax-call is done

1399035
internet-explorer	firefox
firefox and family internet-explorer

1399035
safari	opera
3.3+ for sure safari and opera

1399043
callback	methods
using jsni you can register methodss on the windows object which callback into the gwt application and using jsni the other project can invoke this methods

1399050
value	field
then you will initializer a cartitem object set its field to the .post value and finally you will add the shopping-cart item to a list which will be held in the session object

1399069
any	set
any mechanism you devise that relies on the internal storage of a delphi set types is going to be fragile and will required that you have enum typess defined in both c# and delphi that match but which cannot easily reliably be identified as having fallen out of sync

1399071
pointers	stack
you re taking pointers at object on stack .so it is deleted overwrite every time .so the pointerss can be the same

1399071
malloc	free
new_car should malloc the new car and you need to free it somewhere for example .when removing from queue

1399072
entity-framework	ado.net
it has an ado.net entity-framework to communication with an sql-server database and an ado.net data service for communication

1399076
put	get
edit to respond to your comment to get a defined in every file either put it in a header which gets include everywhere or use some compiler option to get definedd added

1399085
contains	elements	contains	set
this in mind you could do some bit fiddling on a byte value and pass it to a delphi call as your set can only contains 4 elements

1399104
attributes	properties
you can submit to a different page but you need to use the postbackurl properties of a button not the form s action attributes

1399105
instances	destroy
there is only one form display at a time which exposes underlying data stored elsewhere and the form instances is created and destroy on each new tree nodes click

1399106
carbon	cocoa
if you write your carbon application in c++ then you can use objective-c++ to integrated cocoa without having to change your existing classes too much but you still have to do all of the heavy lifting

1399106
carbon	cocoa
note that apple s getting started with carbon guide is now part of the legacy documentation libs and an increasing numbers of new features are only accessible through cocoa apis

1399106
carbon	cocoa
i would strongly suggest using cocoa for your new application instead of starting with carbon then porting

1399146
textbox	button
create a simple-form with 2 button and a textbox

1399154
sql-server	mysql
every time you connect to the sql-server both the php scripting and the server need to go through a relatively complex negotiation establish a connection over the network checked that both sides want to speak mysql checked that the scripting has permissions to connect et cetera

1399157
authentication	login
i want the php .app to use my ruby-on-rails .app to perform the authentication and retrieve user details on a successful login else echo error from my ruby-on-rails .app

1399160
delphi	c++
you either need to modify your c++ code to correctly receive pointers to widechar strings or modify the function signature in delphi and convert your strings to ansistring in the delphi code before passing those to the c++ function

1399185
base-class	inherited
in case 1 if you used call the doit methods of the inherited class while the types is declare as the base-class you will see the action of the base-class even

1399186
implements	extends
well by extends a you are already implements runnable .so you simply need to overrides the run methods and all will be well in mordor

1399188
principles	srp
the srp is one of the simplest of the principles and one of the hardest to get right

1399193
arrays	loops
it updates the arrays index in the middle of loops

1399196
implements	extends
since implementss runnable doesn t introduce any executable code into a class but is basically just a promise to implements the necessary methods repeat implementss runnable on a class that already extends another class that implementss runnable does effectively nothing

1399208
implements	extends
class a already implements runnable .so extends it makes this runnable too

1399213
attributes	properties
all you have to do now is implements the ivalidationbackreference interface on the classes used by the webservice and put the attributes on appropriate properties

1399229
contains	set
note the simplified datatemplate that just contains a textblock and the itemcontainerstyle to set properties on the generator menuitem

1399243
execute	prepare	pdostatement	prepare
if you re using a prepare statement and pdostatement execute the same is true for pdostement rowcount

1399251

1399279
wicket	spring
also this is why usually you use a web framework such as spring struts wicket etc - it just a boiler plate code and you have to code your validation anyway

1399291
backwards-compatibility	legacy
controls exists in the microsoft.visualbasic namespace effectively making it a legacy backwards-compatibility option like vbcrlf

1399297
checkstyle	emma
it s designed for use with jdepend pmd pmd-cpd javancss ckjm checkstyle findbugs cloc junit emma java2html and ant.

1399306
show	next
.when form is show datedatetimepicker contains correct value but an errorprovider is show next to it saying value of 01.01.0001 00 00 00 is not valid for value . it disappears .when i change datedatetimepicker value to anything

1399332
double	int
look at the int double and string classes how to resolve those

1399339
controllers	routes
then you need to map those routes to two different controllers actions in your global-asax

1399351
xts	zoo
better still is use of package zoo or xts which give you additional control as well as bells and whistles

1399357
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
isnt supported in google-chrome safari and opera

1399358
json	xml
is there any free xml json whois service for unlimited queries

1399378
filepath	unc
you are correct asp cannot make use of a mapped network-drive but it can access a unc filepath

1399408
base-class	inherited
the execute methods inherited from the task base-class only has a boolean as return parameter

1399415
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
these will then call dispose on the sqldatareader sqlconnection and sqlcommand - either of the first two will cause the connection to be release to the connection pool given we ve asked the sqldatareader to closeconnection on its close

1399430
constructor	object
you will declare an object of this class and pass the string into constructor then use the object as the third parameter to for_each

1399439
click	mouse
then use java s robot class to send mouse click and fill in text

1399446
haskell	erlang
you re going to have an interesting time mixing gc between haskell and erlang

1399446
haskell	erlang
erlang uses a per-process heap and copies data between process -- as haskell doesn t even have a concept of process i m not sure how you would map this universal gc between the two

1399458
constructor	object
after this you could show a constructor that uses assignment instead of initialization for object

1399482
display	width
you will have to display the list items inline or float them and give the ul a very large width to avoid items moving to the next line

1399489
webserver	security
we have sony security cameras which have an inbuilt webserver giving a web interface to view and control the camera

1399499
msbuild	nant
use nant and use nantcontrib you call msbuild

1399506
order	add
if that is a correct restatement of your goal you could add to robin day s answer the code to order your result set by the difference although to be honest i m not sure if sql supports arithmetic on dates and selected the first result using limit 1

1399515
access-control	authentication
.so i wouldn t use this expecting it to provide cryptography level authentication or access-control

1399518
configuration	upgrade
if you want to upgrade the log-shipping configuration on a sql-server 2000 server to sql-server 2008 then see the following microsoft reference

1399553
3des	aes
where encrypt offset key might be 3des or aes with padding the offset if needed and throw away all but one result bytes

1399562
sorted	lookup
the index is essentially a 2-column table with the indexed field in sorted order along with the pk lookup

1399575
packaging	building
if you are trying to building the windows binaries on the same machine say for packaging use a virtual-machine with windows mingw and appropriate scripting

1399577
children	nodes
for example i load the first generator level of nodess then .when the user click on one of the nodess i use the selected event to populate that nodes s children etc etc

1399577
children	nodes
i m sending back from my database a bool value with each nodes value that indicates whether or not the new nodess have children nodess

1399577
children	nodes
i am wanting to set the expand arrow to show in front of new nodes that have a child but the catch is that its children will not be populate yet

1399598
sata	ssd
i m not sure if an ssd would get that commit time down as much as you hope but i was using a normals single sata disk to get both the 50 seconds and 55minutes comparisons

1399601
sorted	lookup
.when you do a lookup using the index it can very quickly find the row s you want because this index is sorted to facilitate a more efficient search using algorithms like binary-search and others

1399603
textbox	button
each textbox has an associated button

1399603
textbox	button
i want to be able to switching the focus on each of these button controls .so that .when i place my cur.sor in the 2nd textbox tb2 and press enter the as.sociated button b2 gets click and the as.sociated onclientclick event gets fired

1399606
websphere	ibm
we are using websphere 6.1 on ibm aix and browser ie7

1399616
noncopyable	containers
another situation where you might need that is .when you have a noncopyable class whose instances you have to store in a standards containers which required that its contents be copyable

1399629
filtering	grouping
i have a list that has a user grouping column that i want to filtering by the column named is users

1399631
compression	streaming
what s the basic process for compression a streaming of bytes

1399637
textbox	button
you could trap the keydown event on the textbox and then fire the button s callback javascript if it s the enter key

1399643
output	mode
output feedback mode is another common one but you have to be careful in its use

1399643
pbkdf2	scrypt
also make sure you re using something like pbkdf2 or scrypt to generator your encryption key from the passwd

1399647
infinispan	terracotta
i m searching for a distributed-caching solution on mono similar to java s terracotta and infinispan

1399667
contains	elements
but i keep getting the following error with regards to the section nodes the elements cannot contains white spaces

1399675
firefox	opera
it supports ie7 8 firefox 2 3 and opera 9 at least

1399682
windows-xp	windows
i don t work with windows 7 but i don t expect this aspects of visual-studio 2008 has changed much from windows-xp

1399705
selected	checkbox
in our systemd we need to pass along a pair of ids for each checkbox selected essentially an order pair

1399719
email-validation	validation
i suppose it depends on what you re doing with this email-validation but i ve done this for years in online asp.net regex validation for form entry purposes

1399753
export	csv
i need to get the contents of this gridview .so i can export the data to csv

1399761
managed-code	c++-cli
in the managed-code this means you have to be careful to dispose of your c++-cli wrapper code properly

1399762
hidden-field	checkbox
with each checkbox have two corresponding hidden-field controls which store each of the ids

1399762
hidden-field	checkbox
you could then use the findcontrol function to get the corresponding hidden-field controls for each checkbox

1399776
hash	md5
typically signature are composed of some s ort of parameters of your function followed by a secret-key then take the md5 hash of that and sned it through

1399776
hash	md5
in the r equest no one will be able to find the secret-key because it is in the md5 hash

1399806
base-class	inherited
then you can create your .aspx pages that inherited from the base-class and then call addheaderlink on that

1399823
any	set
i have used jsch to set up ports forwarding from my systemd to an internal nodes but is there any way i can make it bidirectional without having to set up a separate tunnel on every internal nodes

1399872
any	set
you can move your validation to the rowupdating event of the grid and set any error messages on the custom validation

1399902
waveform	pcm
given that the hardware can playback a pcm buffering 16-bit samples at 44.1 khz which it surely can with some libs function or the other you re only left with calculating the waveform

1399908
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
i have a case-sensitive server sql_latin1_general_cp1_cs_as but the database is case-insensitive sql_latin1_general_cp1_ci_as

1399931
value	field
all the time i mistakenly ran my code without closing the transactional which therefore did not result in actual rows being insert nevertheless increment the auto-increment surrogate primary key-value .so that i have a gap no rows with id field value of 751 to 762

1399936
licensing	lgpl	licensing	gpl	lgpl	gpl
the main difference between the lgpl and the gpl is that the lgpl does not impose any licensing requirements between modules that can be interchanged by the end user

1399944
lgpl	gpl
that is where the lgpl and the gpl differ

1399963
value	field
this will put the value of the lon and lat field of the form in the url
