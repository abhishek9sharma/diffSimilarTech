150001
32-bit	16-bit
because the compiler is packing your bitfield into a 32-bit int not a 16-bit entity

150010
selected	textbox
ideally the user is going to click on an icons next to a textbox that will popup the form they will selected the department they need and .when they click ok the dialog will close and i will have the value selecteded for me to updates the textbox with

150012
unsigned	short
interesting - i would think that words would evaluate to unsigned short .so you d have that problem in more than one place

150023
directory	folder
remove all directory in building folder

150026
for-loop	loops
for example setting documenttext in a for-loop will only set properly on the first iterator of loops

150029
sql-server	sqlcommand
since you are using sql-server 2005 have you tried with a sqlcommand object instead of the oledbcommand object

150030
default	reset
you can then use #pragma pack to reset structure packing to it s default state

150064
subtract	add	assign	add
for each row in the datatable add subtract the credit debits to the previous row s balance and assign it to the appropriate cell of your datatable

150064
subtract	add	assign	add
for each item or altitem add subtract the credit debits to the global variables and assign it to the appropriate cell of your datagrid

150078
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
it matches any character which is not contains in the ascii character set 0-127 0x0 to 0x7f

150123
exception-handling	try-catch
using a try-catch block to save on performance because your invalid data rate is low is an abuse of exception-handling at the expense of maintainability and good coding practices

150141
scheme	lisp
in languages like lisp scheme they re often passed around quite liberally as function parameters but the idiom in c# typically finds lambda used only for lazy-evaluation of functions as in linq or for making event-handling code a bit terser

150148
value	field
value of the field of the dataset does not exist

150151
partial-trust	xbap
edit i forgot to mention that this needs to be able to work in a partial-trust xbap

150154
profiling	trace
we ve run a profiling on it and the trace file confirmed that it took over 5 minutes to complete the query .when called this way

150169
forms-authentication	ntlm
this works well if you need windows-authentication ntlm under forms-authentication

150180
digits	base
the result-of this is that any extra digits of formatting that you specify are likely to be noise that can result in conversions between base 10 formatted value and base 2 floating-point value

150195
private-key	rsa
then you can get for example the private exponent of an rsa private-key and output it in your desired format

150223
deployment	install
would greatly assist me for the deployment of my application and it s install

150223
advanced-installer	nsis
if makes any difference to anyone i m using a combinations of nsis and advanced-installer for this installation project

150224
unsigned	short
this is followed by the unsigned short which is on an int boundary and then a words which is along aligned on an int boundary which means that there 2 bytes of padding between them

150224
unsigned	short
.when you switching to unsigned int wwindow 16 instead of being a separate short the compiler uses the unused parts of the previous bitfield .so no waste no short and no padding after the short hence you save four bytes

150254
32-bit	16-bit
there s a definitive guide in the article porting 16-bit code to 32-bit windows on msdn

150257
sql-server	oracle
neither in oracle 11g nor in sql-server 2005

150278
processor	cpu
it was a bit hard on the processor we were running on a pentium-iii equivalent machine and it was pushing 50 -75 peak cpu

150282
decrement	increment
among them increment and decrement fetch_and_add etc

150283
scheme	lisp
.so for learning scheme lisp javascript isn t a bad start

150283
haskell	lisp
note though that functional languages like lisp are quite different from pure functional languages such as haskell

150296
value	field
in addition to overrides save to provide the generator value you want you can also use the exclude option in your modeladmin class to prevent the field from being display in the admin

150302
terminate	timeout
a short timeout value will consume considerably more cpu than the infinite timeout but there are good reasons for using a short timeout for example if you want to terminate the process thread the runloop is running in

150333
web-services	api
ideally there would be some kind of web-services call to exchange or an api we could work with

150359
put	get
but .when i try to just put something in there i get an errorinvalidchangekey

150361
processor	cpu
doing it that way however should improve performance because it would come down to doing only about 20-30k vector transformation which doesn t take much processor power on most modern cpu s

150365
variables	boolean
note i am among those keeping their old habits from c++ coding java with m_ prefixes for member variables and s_ for static ones prefixing boolean with an initial b using an initial uppercase letter for function named and aligning braces.

150368
worksheet	excel
if you need multiple worksheet or named worksheet within your excel workbook you can do something similar via an xml schema called spreadsheetml

150390
formatting	printing
the best part of about this you can format cell do conditional formatting setup headers and footers and even set printing ranges

150391
contains	elements
could the content be contains in the title attributes of a semantics appropriate elements

150411
verilog	vhdl
if you re going to do a lot of bit-manipulation and you care much more about reliability rather than performance for your application then you may want to create an int wrapper to enable slicing like in verilog or vhdl

150430
virtual-machine	vmware
with modern virtual-machine options vmware server microsft virtual-server microsoft virtual-pc and others why not set up a virtualenv running your existing platform then upgrade and test that

150434
contains	any
does somelowlevellibrary.lib contains or use any classes named crect

150443
postgresql	mysql
let you access sqlplus and other command-line sql environment for postgresql mysql

150464
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i ve just started reading the art of ruby-on-rails which covers some more advanced topics such as meta-programming api-design and rspec

150471
selected	checkbox
.when the user double-clicks on the checkbox the checkbox gets checked the rowchanged event gets called is selected and then the checkbox is cleared and no corresponding rowchanged event gets called

150478
similarity	distance
this reduces your problem into one of finding the variables that will defined similarity and establishing distance between possible enumerate value like for example classical and acoustic are close toghether while death metal and reggae are quite distant at least in my oppinion

150480
implements	sealed
.when coming to mock classes that are not test friendly sealed not implements any interface methods are not virtual you would probably want to use the adaptor design pattern

150486
methodology	waterfall
not the same way you did with a waterfall methodology where nothing really worked

150489
getter	setter
-automated code-generation eclipse s generator getter setter aren t likely to understand this .so you ll have to fix it by hand or muck with eclipse enough to get it to recognize

150491
protected	public
i tend to grouping things by visibility public then protected then private and use #regions to grouping related things functionally regardless of whether it is a properties methods or whatever

150501
webserver	nginx
i ve used the articles on there to set up users a basic firewall nginx or apache and other bits and pieces of a basic webserver

150508
constructor	private
classes member should be alphabetized and grouping into sections field constructor properties events methods private interface implementation nested types

150512
constructor	private
private field public field constructor properties public methods private methods

150528
constructor	private
i prefer to put the private field up at the top along with the constructor s then put the public interface bits after that then the private interface bits

150555
exception-handling	try-catch
i run into a similar problem with a system.data exception-handling throw a sqlclient exception-handling which was uncaught adding a try-catch into my code did the trick in the instances

150565
contains	elements
character data inside xml elements can contains quote characters without escaping them

150579
dbase	dbf
the format for the dbf files is like the old dbase iii format

150583
multiple-projects	subproject
only commit that are touching sensitive subproject or those spanning multiple-projects would then need to be checked by means of a full building

150606
textbox	button
textbox radio button etc

150617
windows-xp	windows	background-color	border-color
you can also eliminate windows-xp s styling of button and every other versioning of windows by setting the background-color and or border-color on your button

150630
value	field
if your database is sql-server 2005+ your key-value table can use the sqlvariant data types for the value field - with a third column to store the data types you need to cast it to for use

150630
value	field
that way you can literally insert numbers text value of varying sizes into the same field

150634
double-quotes	single-quotes
double-quotes in attributes value can be represented as the double-quote character if the value is delimited by single-quotes and vice versa

150677
poi-hssf	jxl
not sure if you need to stick with jxl but the best libs for handling excel files is apache s poi-hssf

150677
spreadsheet	apache-poi
just out of curiosity apache-poi stands for poor obfuscation interface and hssf is horrible spreadsheet format

150698
telnet	ssh
at my new job i m getting acclimated with the ide we have visual slickedit 8.0 install on our sun solaris workstation that we telnet into lol yes ssh is turned off

150718
version-control	git
as far as version-control subversion is pretty mature and stable or you could go with the up and coming git systemd

150729
tree	trie
use a forest of prefix tree trie .

150738
build-server	msbuild
sure you can do things to your msbuild scripting to send out notificatioms but that domain belongs to the build-server

150739
any	set
edit the user does see a unique set of 20 rows that could be different than any other 20 rows the users see

150755
contains	elements
using a sax processor you may be able to write a methods that makes a single forward-only pass-through the source document parsing it as it goes and writes all of the output document as it encounters the elements that contains them

150762
shell	bash
also out of curiosity how would i do this using bash or another unix shell

150773
attributes	properties
then you can create a single monster class with each attributes represented by a properties field

150802
perl	ruby	perl	awk	python	perl	python	ruby	python	java
substitute regex with c or c# or java or python or perl or sql or ruby or awk or .

150802
perl	php
just like java perl php or especially sql each language has strengths and weaknesses and you need to know the language you re writing in .when you re writing it or maintaining it to have any hope of being productive

150802
perl	c++
these are not the same things that would be common in general-purpose languages like perl c++ etc. .so the huffman coding was targetted at this specialization

150814
put	get
specifically if we put this into a plain html page it works fine but if we put it into an aspx page wrapped by the tag we get a mycontrol is undefined error

150862
jflex	yacc
since i usually work with java my preferred methods is jflex but there is also lex yacc and several others

150872
temporary	copy
i would suggest using ssis to copy the recording to a temporary table then create a task that uses selected distinct or rank depending on your situation to selected the duplicates which would funnel them to a flat-file and delete them from the temporary table

150872
temporary	copy
the last step would be to copy the recording from the temporary table into the destination table

150873
pixels	line
the idea is generally to load the image in memory .so that the same contiguous block of bytes would not contains pixels in one line but rather of a square in 2d spaces

150879
http	ssl
the overhead is due to the ssl handshake which are lengthy and drastically increase the numbers of round-trips required for a http session over a http one

150879
http	ssl
ensuring that your server is using http keepalives - this allows the client to reuse ssl sessions which avoids the need for another handshake

150880
constructor	object
registering in an object constructor would be a mistake

150886
arrays	loops
this is loops that is used to send the data buffering is a byte arrays contains the file data

150902
value	field
how can an object be loaded via hibernate based on a field value of a member object

150928
ruby	php
excellent for anyone who is already familiar with nb for java ruby or php development

150928
development-environment	platform
it al.so provides for a portable development-environment .so you get a consistent workflow and toolset between platform

150958
tar	cat
i ve seen recommendations in the past to do this sort of copy operation with various permutation of dd cpio or tar but never cat

150971
solaris	linux	solaris	aix	linux	aix
linux solaris aix and mac os x 10.4 tiger onwards

150971
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
freebsd macos x netbsd openbsd etc

150993
traffic	packets
the thing is they never drop your sockets with traffic shaping they only drop packets

150998
getter	setter
in my actionscript3 class can i have a properties with a getter and setter

150999
perl	ruby
that s nothing against ruby because it sucks just as hard in glorp which handles activerecord for smalltalk or perl or anything else

151006
boost-python	f2py
f2py part of numpy is a simpler alternative to swig and boost-python for wrapping c fortran number-crunching code

151024
versioning	upgrade
i just want to upgrade the con.sole versioning .so i can for example have python compiled in to use omnicomplete

151064
mime	rfc
arguably the right thing to do would be to use mime s technique for encoding non-ascii data in headers as describe in rfc 2047 but i have no idea whether browsers actually support that

151079
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
this seems to be broken in firefox and ie but work in opera safari and google-chrome

151086
cfengine	puppet
depending on the numbers of machines you might find it makes sense to use something like cfengine or puppet to configure the new install

151115
getter	setter
yes you can create getter and setter functions inside an as3 class

151115
getter	setter
more information about getter and setter can be found here

151158
arguments	default
similar to oli s answer i use an arguments object and an object which defined the default value

151158
arguments	undefined
you can omit as many argumentss as you like - if you only want to overrides the value of one arguments you can just provide that arguments instead of having to explicit pass undefined .when say there are 5 argumentss and you only want to customise the last one as you would have to do with some of the other methods suggested

151158
constructor	object	arguments	default
.when working with a constructor function for an object which inherited from another it s easy to accept any arguments which are required by the constructor of the object you re inheriting from as you don t have to named those arguments in your constructor signature or even provide your own default let the parent object s constructor do that for you as seen above .when charfield call field s constructor

151158
constructor	object	arguments	default
child object in inherited hierarchies can customise arguments for their parent constructor as they see fit enforcing their own default value or ensuring that a certain value will always be used

151204
directory	folder
i have a folder variables unity conf with some properties files in it and i d like the caucho s resin jvm to have that directory on the classpath

151258
hostname	router
by inspector the socket connection you will be able to take into account weird router tables multiple ip addresses and whacky hostname

151275
delphi	c++
.when i was looking for 3 programmers earlier this year to work mostly in c# java pl sql javascript and delphi i looked for c++ programmers and have not been disappointed

151278
boolean	int
using an int as boolean

151289
nested	order
note that i suggest a nested arrays instead of a hash because a hash s order is unpredictable

151302
content-disposition	content-length
after you set content-disposition header also add content-length header then use binarywrite to streaming the pdf

151308
realloc	free	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
or use libdmalloc5 drop in replacement for the systemd s malloc realloc calloc free and other memory-management routines while providing powerful debugging facilities

151318
implicit-conversion	equality
the problem i am having is that if i support #2 implicit-conversion then i can t get my equality operators to work since they complain about no conversion being the most specific

151336
versioning	upgrade
the versioning properties you mention is used by msi engine internally for upgrade uninstaller etc and is never display

151359
getter	setter
note that you can also use attr_reader or attr_writer to defined just getter or setter or you can defined them manually as such

151399
irrlicht	ogre	system-requirements	platform
irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system-requirements and works better across platform than ogre in my opinion

151427
virtual-functions	base-class
in practice you see two solutions to this problem ad hoc systemd where you pass a void and the event and hierarchies with virtual-functions in a base-class like windows systemd

151435
derived-class	base-class
to call a methods on the derived-class the methods has to be declare in the base-class as virtual and overrides in the base-class and your pointsers should points to the base-class methods

151445
revision	updates
i wanted a similar availability and found rev to be insufficient because it was only updates for a file if that file s revision was changed which meant it would have to be edited and committed very time not something i wanted to do. instead i wanted something that was based on the repository s revision numbers

151528
checkbox	textarea	checkbox	button
this pop-up windows has a textarea and a set of checkbox along with a button input types submit i think

151528
checkbox	textarea
i might try replacing the textarea with a plain input types text but since the checkbox also exhibit this bug i suspect the one-line textinput will also cause the bug

151538
memcheck	valgrind
valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full . a.out

151583
environment	building
part of our building environment is a scripting that output versioning information to a header file that our nsis scripting sources

151587
restart	exit
.when i right click the icons in the task panels by the clock and choose exit program it just restart moments later

151596
build-server	teamcity
even more automation can be obtained with jetbrains teamcity build-server that can run inspector building and report the above configure checked

151612
boost	stl
using boost iterator_facade you can easy adapt any caching on disk data-structures to have a stl containers interface

151627
webforms	asp.net
i am tackling a similar problem at the moment not quite as messy as what this sounds but the product of really bad asp.net webforms overblown view state and deeply nested server controls that format search results from a database

151630
emacs	vim	jedit	vim	jedit	emacs
a good text-editor jedit emacs vim eclipse etc. is really all you need

151635
eclipse-rcp	swt
eclipse-rcp if you are ok using swt

151641
button	popup	contains	any
popupbutton shipped with flex has two button it contains a main button and a secondary button called the popup button which popup any uicomponent object .when a user click the popup button. source

151670
any	set
with libcurl or any other http client you may have to set the content encoding

151678
populate	row
a fill-down can populate this into every row for you

151687
put	get
can it be put on a pty .somehow .so that we could potentially get access to it

151696
versioning	upgrade
we want to upgrade our current versioning v6.3 and are in a pickle

151715
moss	wss
i was part of a team working to better the story around development of wss and moss solutions with tfs but i don t know where that stands

151726
jruby	mri
difference between jruby and ruby mri

151730
datagridview	listview
i can easily do it using the listview datagridview sorting functionality -- but i d like the display to be in virtual mode because of the quantity of data i have and for that i need to provide my own sorting anyway

151734
environment	building
you should al.so tag the .sources used to create each building .so if needed you can reproduce the built-in a dev environment

151754
abstract-factory	singleton
based on your question it seems you may be looking at an abstract-factory pattern creates an instances of several families of classes that keeps an internal list dictionary of classes that have already been initializer thus mimicking the singleton pattern functionality

151762
constructor	object
in case-when you need to provide additional information to singleton constructor you can just create a pool of object

151775
defined	declare
the reason is that all methods defined in an interface are abstract whether or not you explicit declare that modifiers

151783
compare-and-swap	atomicity
just curious to know which cpu architectures support compare-and-swap atomicity primitive

151790
windows-xp	windows
just as windows 2000 support has ended .so will windows-xp support and vista support and windows 7 support etc etc

151802
solaris	linux
ibm in it s solaris to linux porting guide gives this example

151812
reliability	scalability
iâ m specifically interested in production-proven paging patterns that behave well with the concurrency scalability and reliability

151822
instances	destroy
the savedinstancesstate is only for saving state as.sociated with a current instances of an activity for example current navigation or selection info .so that if android destroy and recreates an activity it can come back as it was before

151838
value	field
always be careful about putting data into a field that has no meaning special value to represent no data

151839
decrement	increment	compare-and-swap	atomicity
.so the lwarx stwcx combo allows you to implements atomicity increment decrement compare-and-swap and more powerful atomicity operations like atomicity increment circular-buffer index

151841
compare-and-swap	atomicity
i d like to document what high-level c++ not inline assembler functions or macros are available for compare-and-swap cas atomicity primitives.

151843
versioning	upgrade
i used to develop a warehouse management application using c++ and sql and we always had to support at least two versioninging back from the current versioning of sql-server because our customers were extremely reluctant to upgrade

151857
latitude-longitude	location
for geographic location you may wish to resolve an address to a latitude-longitude arrays perhaps using google-maps etc. to calculate proximities etc

151867
directory	folder
dos cmd cd changes current directory to the root folder or cd folder1 folder2 goes to c folder1 folder2

151868
if-statement	while-loop
the idiom is more useful .when you re writing a while-loop instead of an if-statement

151870
if-statement	loops
it s more useful for loops than if-statement

151873
blogengine.net	dotnetnuke
i have garnered from the response to checkout blogengine.net subtext dasblog and to stay away from the blog in dotnetnuke

151893
constructor	object
then pass the model object into the constructor of this new class and call its methods for getting sql

151897
itextsharp	itext
you can use the open-source itextsharp which is a ports from itext java

151905
postgresql	mysql
i have had this problem with various dbms postgresql informix mysql and mssql thanks to lomaxx for the answer

151931
debugging	exit
.when i exit firefox the vs2005 8 debugging session doesn t terminate

151975
instances	self
there is only this for referring to the current instances of the class the object and self which can be used to refer to static-members of a class

151979
click	mouse
however .when i run this application and click on the checkbox i ve found that sometimes my mouse click are swallowed and the checkbox s status doesn t change

152068
python	java
but hey since python does not really have interfaces in the java sense maybe it is ok

152073
instances	self
self not self refers to the types of class where as refers to the current instances of the class

152084
y-combinator	combinators
i m interested in actual examples of using fixed-point combinators such as the y-combinator in c++

152099
textbox	button
there is a textbox and button on the screens as well

152099
dialog	pop-up
currently we pop-up a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletes but we need something better than this

152099
updatepanel	gridview
this is the markup for the gridview as you can see it s inside an asp.net updatepanel i forgot to mention that sorry i left out most columns and the formatting

152101
ruby-on-rails	django
i want to learn asp.net-mvc architecture pattern but i don t want to jump into a framework like ruby-on-rails or django just yet

152104
autogrow	textarea
for textarea i extends it using the autogrow plugins

152104
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
first autogrow does only work on firefox not on ie safari opera and google-chrome

152112
wicket	spring
we mostly write web-applications with wicket spring and hibernate and we use interfaces for spring beans service and daos

152124
spring	guice	dependency-injection	inject
then use dependency-injection with spring or guice if you have many implementation of the interface to inject into the places in your code you re using new

152126
unicode-string	utf8-decode
the first paragraph is garbled since the â will not be sent using utf8-decode the second is fine because the unicode-string supplied is encode to utf-8

152132
versioning	upgrade
you still have the job with adding dll s .when deciding to upgrade to a other versioning of the dll though

152141
toarray	equals
i d be much more concerned about the toarray call on the populate list which will result in a memory allocation equals to its internal size and a memory copy of the contents of the list into it

152144
sql-server	oracle
this central storage can be sql-server using the native management of session state btw also oracle from oracle 11 can support session-storage the aspstate service or an external solution like scaleout as you said or its open source alternative memcached see

152151
value	field
basically you can use selected identity to retrieve the value of the auto-increment field that is generator on your connection

152157
allegro	sdl	cairo	sdl
since you mention gdi+ i suppose you want it for windows but there are good portable solutions like sdl allegro cairo etc

152204
linux	unix
glib a common systemd libs on linux and unix systemdd but also supported on windows and mac os x defined several atomicity operations including g_atomicity_int_compare_and_exchange and g_atomicity_pointer_compare_and_exchange

152234
versioning	upgrade
from this points on you ve given the customer a reason why not to upgrade to your new versioning and to stay with the old versioning

152254
attributes	properties
then you will be able to simply get named of the properties having this attributes

152256
json	xml
these can be dynamically created using json as the datasource rather than html xml

152321
attributes	properties
personally i like using attributes for simple single-valued properties

152321
attributes	properties
for single-valued properties attributes lead to more compact xml and simpler addressing in most apis

152332
delphi	c++
it comes with a load of profiling including static-code-analysis and works with most important windows compilers and systemd including visual-c++ .net delphi borland-c++ intel c++ and even gcc

152350
.net	wcf
you can downloading visual-studio 2008 and .net 3.5 training kit and .net 3.5 enhancements training kit if i recall correctly there were samples for wcf unit tests

152365
keyboard	mouse
each structure represents an event to be insert into the keyboard or mouse inputstream

152368
decrement	increment
to that end you must declare functions in your delphi-compiled dll which invoke the constructor and destructor for the tstringlist class you must make sure that your delphi dll uses the sharemem unit and you must take responsibility for increment and decrement the reference count for your delphi ansistrings before they leave the dll and after they enter it preferably also as functions exported from your delphi dll

152375
value	field
you could create a table writer_status which has a last_id field each writer updates this table before writing with the id it is going to write to the log but only if its id is greater than the current value of last_id

152379
knopflerfish	equinox
you might want to have a look at pax drone which enables you to use all felix versioning as well as equinox and knopflerfish in your tests

152387
standard-library	boost
i do agree that the standard-library and boost are essential but is there anything beyond that or is it different for every company project domain

scripting mage command-line tool from the .net sdk to updates the clickonce manifest using the same versioning see the -v and -mv switches

152470
switching	router
the term ports also refers to certain ethernet connection points such as those on a hub switching or router

152502
imultivalueconverter	ivalueconverter
edit if imultivalueconverter isn t available it looks like silverlight only has ivalueconverter then you can always pass your entire bound object eg your person object to an ivalueconverter and use various properties from that to return your brush

152507
switching	router
uch as those on a hub switching or router

152509
value	field
xml that is used to represent stuctured data generator from a database may work well with ultimately field value being placed as attributes

152510
tcp-ip	udp	tcp-ip	tcp	udp	tcp
you create a socket by either defining a local address in case of tcp-ip an address is an ip-address and usually in case it s a tcp or udp socket a ports-number both can be any and then binding the socket to it and just use it a server socket or you can create a socket by defining a remote address and then connecting the socket to it additionally you can bind it to a local address in advance if you want to keep control of the local address and ports as well and use it as a client socket

152516
mstest	mbunit
mstest is slow mbunit

152519
shell	bash
here s my suboptimal solution using a bash shell scripting

152521
udp	tcp
a ports denotes a communication endpoint in the tcp and udp transportss for the ip network protocols

152562
click	mouse
the reason is that the one of the other border elements with a templatebinding of borderbrush was further down in the visual tree and was capturing the mouse click that s why setting the borderbrush to null allowed the checkbox to correctly receive the mouse click

152607
swing	swt	swing	awt	swt	awt
i you are not using a gui for instances awt swing or swt you could try starting you application in headless mode

152614
declarative	imperative
i prefer to write in functional or declarative styles over imperative whenever i can

152649
json	xml
instead of the assign templates a generics xml json templates is called which just output a xml that contains all templates variables

152652
any	set
i don t know of any convenience-methods in ruby-on-rails for this but you can access the query-string directly to parsing out parameters that are set there

152658
default-value	arguments
if this is the case don t use the default-value for the def arguments in the above case

152713
ruby	php
netbeans is a pretty good ide which also caters for other languages php ruby c++ if you re prone to using any of those

152722
python	java	python	c++
the power of eclipse is that it s basically the same ide for many languages meaning that if you know you ll have to code in several programming languages java c++ python it s a huge advantage that you only have to learn one ide eclipse

152725
exception-handling	error-handling
if you are trying to replace the throw of an exception-handling with some other error-handling mechanism your only option is to return or set an error-code - the problem is that you then have to go and ensure it is checked elsewhere

152728
sql-server	oracle
frustratingly the oracle substringing function is substring whilst it sql-server it s substringing

152731
difference	count
since i m not a lawyer i m not going to go into what constitutes a demonstrable and obvious difference but i would imagine a colour change would count as one.

152742
constructor	private
make it have only private constructor

152742
constructor	private
the compiler will not allow you to initializer the templates that use the versioning with private constructor

152745
linux	unix
i ve done some timing on various linux unix machines and gcc versioning

152745
pointers	stack
other ways of arranging a 2-d arrays without stl - an arrays of n pointers to the start of each row or defining the whole thing on stack as a constants size - run at almost exactly the same speed as the index function methods

152770
sql-server	ms-access
is there any facility of transpose rows to columns in sql-server it is possible in ms-access

152770
sql-server	ms-access
i was befuddled because this facility is available in ms-access but not in sql-server

152773
versioning	upgrade
my eclipse is a highly recommended versioning that i ve seen all over the .net that is really very affordable last i heard 50 for the distro plus a year of free upgrade

152781
irrlicht	ogre3d
if you want to peek at code there are several open source game engine like ogre3d nebuladevice and irrlicht

152785
ref	out
tuples represent a powerful methods for returning multiple value from a function-call without the need to litter your code with throwaway classes or resorting to ugly ref or out parameters

152789
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
after testing with a serialization object written to a file using the objectoutputstream in a java 1.5 program then running a read with a objectinputstream in a java 1.6 program i can say this worked without any issue

152800
linux	unix
most of the big player have linux unix versioning these days

152808
contains	set
this is typically in an application main windows and it contains a set of mdi children

152819
backwards-compatibility	deprecated
its popularity has also meant that it has striven to maintain backwards-compatibility throughout its lifecycle meaning that poor decisions about the language live on even after they are deprecated

152823
apache-config	.htaccess
problem is i can t get my apache-config to view these .htaccess files

152823
httpd.conf	.htaccess
updates rename htacces.txt to .htaccess and ammended the appropriate directives in the httpd.conf file and all seems to work

152863
arguments	default
you could probably support a single arguments remoteendpoint .when default are acceptable for the local endpoint

152865
rich-internet-application	ria
flex like silverlight is marketed for the creation of something called ria rich-internet-application

152869
highlight	selected
it is easy to highlight a selected datagrid row by for example using toggleclass in the tr s click event

152869
highlight	selected
but how best to later remove the highlight after a different row has been selected

152873
put	get
if you edit the test run configuration by double click the .testrunconfig file that gets put into the solution items solution folder .when you add a new unit test you get a test run configuration dialog

152881
multiplication	addition
the double named n m format is very fast .when you are accessing data by rows both because has almost no overhead besides a multiplication and addition and because your rows are packed data that will be coherent in caching

152901
virtual-machine	vmware
however this has proved to be quite distressing as sometimes the vmware gets hold of it and turns off pauses ctrl + z the virtual-machine

152922
put	get
the mapping between get and .post and put and delete and controllers actions is set up in configuration routes.rb in most modern ruby-on-rails code

152929
put	get
rest only cares about 4 events in the life on an object-create .post retrieve get updates put and delete

152930
selected	button
.when the user selected one of these the form will grow enough to house the new field the new field with labels will be display at the bottom of the form and the add field button will show below the new field

152934
append	input
basically each task would need an individually named and then you would need to append a new uniquely named form input elements for each new field that they choose to append

152957
credentials	integrated
assume there are 7 environment in the enterprise predev dev integrated test user test prod pfix training each needing it s own set of credentials

152963
cursor	row
then you insert one row in your temp table updates it via another cursor through the variables value pairs and then selected it usually joined with its parent entity in effect making it seem like those custom variables value pairs were like built-in columns in the original parent entity

152981
ftp	ssh
note ideally it needs to handle both ssh and ssl ftp connections but i d consider two separate components if it makes the most sense..

152984
interop	tlbimp
if you can create com components with java you can use tlbimp to create an interop assembly for using in vb.net

152990
sftp	ftp
i use rebex.net file transfer pack for sftp and ftp transfer in .net

152991
web-services	api
other way is to wrap your api with java web-services

152994
boost	stl
boost especially will cause this but even the regular stl code can do this

153007
instances	private
.when you re developing every developer should be working against their own private database instances

153015
tcp-ip	udp
.sockets are protocols specific - .so the implementation of uniqueness that both tcp-ip and udp ip uses ip-address ports is different than eg. ipx network nodes and...ahem .socket - but a different .socket than is meant by the general .socket term

153015
udp	tcp
since ip has become the dominant protocols a ports in networking terms has become synonomous with either a udp or tcp ports-number - which is a portsion of the socket address

153015
udp	tcp
the api functions make it clear that both are just different types of sockets - sock_dgram is udp just sending a messages and sock_stream is tcp creating a virtual circuit

153015
udp	tcp
technically the ip header holds the ip-address and the protocols on top of ip udp or tcp holds the port-number

153027
contains	set
the up methods contains the set of database changes that need to be made to bring the previous versioning of the database-schema to the current versioning

153041
identity-column	sql-server
just like in sql-server you don t insert a value for an identity-column

153065
void	main
the main problem is that in one function the previous coder uses a void arguments that is converted into suitable types in the function itself

153066
boost	stl
one big advantage of boost is that many of its features will show up in the stl extensions for the upcoming c++0x standards see for example

153071
httpd.conf	.htaccess
my guess is that within xampp you need to enable allowoverride through an .htaccess in httpd.conf

153082
ubuntu	linux
the only software that i see providing torrent links are linux distros and not all of them for example the ubuntu website does not provide torrents to downloading ubuntu

153105

153108
javadoc	doxygen
doxygen is a free doc-generating tool similar to javadoc that ll also produce relationship graphing as well

153138
constructor	object
a few bytes of memory for the object won t be noticed and a handful of constructor call will take maybe ten minutes to add

153155
attributes	properties
you should be able to use a combinations of labels and id attributes to pick out the correct properties for your edit-in-place implementation to work

153158
versioning	upgrade
typically the rules of thumb with dotnetnuke is to upgrade to the most current versioning and keep an eye on the security items posted on the site also keeping an eye on cathal s blog is a good idea as he is the head security person

153164
communication	messages
as much as 40 of your communication on the wire can be control flow messages and chat between clients asking for pieces

153193
textbox	button
i d like to customise the search results .so that they actually look like our intranet has generator them and al.so place the search form s textbox and submit button on the intranet pages themselves

153200
put	get
rest has guarantees of safety a get messages won t change state and idempotent a put request sent multiple time has same effect as just one time

153208
template-engine	templating
alternatively if you absolutely need to do templating i d suggest using a template-engine such as nvelocity rather than trying to kludge asp.net into doing it for you

153214
hide	show
active is .somewhat like an onclientclick event .so if you nest a hidden input in the li this css hide the span and show the input .when the li is click on

153221
debugging	exit	put	get
which seems to get called .when i do python myservice stop from the command-line i can put a debugging line in there that produces output to a file but doesn t actually exit the whole service - subsequent call to python myservice start gives me an error

153240
sftp	ftp	sftp	ssh	ftp	ssh
iirc ftp is built-in to .net system.net.ftpwebrequest and last time i looked a couple of years ago admittedly i couldn t find any free ssh sftp assemblies

153248
any	set
as i do not need to create overly complex excel sheets the most complicated thing is that i explicit need to set a cell types to numeric or text i m looking towards option 1 next but i just wonder if there are any other good and supported ways to generator excel 2007 sheets

153253
any	set
performance will also improve if you minimize the set of things svn has to checked - tell it to ignore any temporary directory object file directory etc

153261
getter	setter
i interpreter that as meaning that testing setter and getter that don t do anything except set or get is probably too much testing no need to take the time

153276
compact-framework	.net
on a project a long time ago using .net compact-framework 1.0 i wrote an auto-updating application

153297
getter	setter
getter ans setter too because they could accept negative value or null value that you might do not want to accept

153298
thickbox	jquery
for example most tables in the document are display via a thickbox jquery plugins

153299
value	field
if the field do need to be open for data entry you could leave have them defined as a list of fieldnames and value and use click-to-edit to dynamically place inputbox on each elements as needed

153304
solaris	linux
runtime flag for solaris and linux

153314
python	ruby	python	java
you should learn at least 1 compiled language like c# or java and 1 scripting language python ruby etc

153316
sftp	ftp	sftp	ssh	sftp	ftps	ftp	ssh	ftps	ftp
edtftpnet is free but you have to buy their pro versioning to get sftp ftp over ssh and ftps ftp over ssl

153317
getter	setter
i don t unit tests simple setter getter methods that have no side-effects

153317
easymock	junit
but for java i use maven 2 junit dbunit cobertura easymock

it doesn t include ssh and sftp though

153394
contains	set
datacontainsers contains no real code just get set corresponding to the database

153419
cairngorm	flexunit
asynchronous testing cairngorm events can also be done with flexunit but is not as elegant as with dpuint

153433
javascript	dom
there is a plethora of javascript libs that try to implements a workable platform on top of the dom and to even out the difference between browsers

153433
jquery	dojo
however impressing libs like dojo yui and jquery are they are limited by the platform and it is limited indeed

153436
vbscript	jscript
assuming this is for an intranet where you can set permissions and mandate ie you can generator the workbook client side with jscript vbscript driving excel

153438
targetinvocationexception	comexception
the problem seems to stemming from the targetinvocationexception not contains the error numbers as i d expect if it were a normals comexception .so

153438
targetinvocationexception	comexception
can i make this same call in a way that would cause a comexception contains the error numbers rather than a targetinvocationexception .when the com component fails

153454
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
create a 1000 elements arrays of pointers to linked-list nodes 1-1 mapping

153454
linked-list	arrays	linked-list	nodes
sort the pointers arrays based on linked-list nodes s value

153454
linked-list	arrays
this will rearrange the arrays but keep the linked-list intact

153454
linked-list	arrays
add the 1001th elements to the linked-list and insert a pointers to it in the correct positioning in the arrays by performing one step of an insertion-sort

python	java
from python source code to java source code

153530
python	java
or from python source code to java bytecode

153535
python	java
determining how to map classes defined in python into typess in java will be a big challange because of difference in each of types binding time

153544
debugging	trace	logging	trace
i have found that in all reality many user applications don t need large amounts of logging as really if issues come up you will be debugging to trace the value there

153546
logging	trace
note here i m referring to the logging that happens .when trace mode is enabled for developer-oriented logs not user-oriented normals operation logs.

153547
contains	any
any datarows that may contains suspicious data .when being passed down to the methods

153554
debugging	trace
.when you need to debugging it a user can switching on the debugging or trace output and get far more information

153570
put	get
instead we are doing put via a .post and for delete we are using a get on a resource with an url parameter like

153588
checkbox	textbox
from the user perspective a form that just does the right thing by figuring out what i want makes me much happier than having to understand a stack of textbox checkbox and dropdownlistfor

153607
instrumentation	profiling
best yet it can instrumentation a running process and lets you turn data collections on and off at runtime both manually and based on the callstack - great for profiling a small section of a larger program

153644
contains	elements
since arrayss and hash can only contains scalar in perl why do you have to use the to tell the interpreter that the value is a scalar .when accessing arrays or hash elements

153660
order	add
request to add a natural-sort come up from time to time on the mysql bugs and discussion forums and many solutions revolve around stripping out specific parts of your data and casting them for the order by part of the query

153660
extends	final
this sort of solution could just about be made to work on your final fantasy example above but isn t particularly flexible and unlikely to extends cleanly to a dataset including say warhammer 40 000 and james bond 007 i m afraid

153665
value	field
this is the default-value .so you d only have to change it if you wanted to save a value from a different field

153665
display	width
don t forget that .when you set the widths of the other columns you are display the combo box s width properties should be greater than or equals to the sum of the column widths otherwise you may not see all the columns

153672
web-config	app-config
to access the information from your application then add into the app-config or web-config the following

153677
perl	php	perl	ruby	ruby	php
i have used c# ruby perl javascript and php professionally over the last year and they ve all been useful in different ways

153724
digits	zero
i also would like only significant digits to be display - there should not be any trailing zero

153775
abstract-class	base-class
i know that i can do it with a base-class some abstract-class and the knowntype -attribute but iâ d definitely prefer the interface as identificator of the object cause it is used widely in the client .app and would ease development

153780
multiplying	subtract
solving this systemd by multiplying the first equation by v2.v2 and the second by v1.v1 and subtract or otherwise gives the equation for a and b

153855
put	get
it s important to not just get opinions but to put them to the test

153877
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
an autoresetevent resets .when the code passes through event.waitone but a manualresetevent does not

153907
digits	zero
here 05 says use 5 digits with leading zero

153918
required	checked
there you can checked the required secure channel ssl box and ssl will be requiredd for that page only

153929
contains	elements
.so myarrays call a subroutine passing it a reference to an anonymous arrays contains a single elements 1

153944
sql-server	mysql
i ve used mysql and sql-server which both seem to be case in-sensitive

153945
contains	any
is there any open source or free .net user-interface toolkit contains at least one of the following controls

153953
realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free
iâ m using mtrace to get a malloc free realloc trace

153957
.when	ready
.when you get ready for a release make a branch

153967

usually case-sensitive table and column named are the default on linux mysql and case-insensitive used to be the default on windows but now the install asked about this during setup

153975
abstract-class	nested-class
point2d.double is a nested-class inside of the abstract-class point2d

154020
environment	building
you develop the solution in a mini-visual studio environment and can building very complex solutions for moving and transforming data

154021
shell	bash
you ll also be able to use bash as the shell instead of cmd.exe which is much nicer

154042
abstract	extends
however if i change bar to be an abstract superclass and have foo extends it then it works again

154043
wxpython	pyqt
also there s pyqt for gui and wxpython mentioned earlier

154055
subtract	add	subtract	modulo
nb you have to subtract 1 from the month for the modulo then add it back to new_month since months in datetime.date s start at 1.

154056
boolean	int
make it a boolean default to false or small int default to 0 or whatever

154057
subclassing	inherited
inherited is more useful .when a new subclassing wants to change the way a methods works if you just need to change the data the class uses to work probably an approach like this would do the trick

154057
instances	self
this way you can keep your class clients and your self happy because you don t needed creating an instances to do the work

154058
subproject	ivy
if you make the subproject independent from one another you could work on one subproject while having already compiled the other ones think maven or ivy to manage the dependencies

154076
solaris	linux
in a pthreads systemd like linux or solaris try using pthreads_fadvise

154079
alpha	rgba
i have a numbers of rgba pixels each of them has an alpha component

154102
mapping	unique
mapping is a unique sort of api

154133
output	mode
i ve found that the easiest way to do this without touching the report code itself is to open the report in preview mode with the filtering applied and then output the report to whatever format you need

154138
curly-braces	braces	curly-braces	macros	braces	macros
it doesn t help to wrap things in curly-braces within the macros because a semicolon after the braces is syntactically incorrect

154177
python	tcl
python has an embedded gui toolkit named tkinter which is based on tk libs from tcl programming language

154177
linux	osx
tkinter is not hard at all to use since it doesnt have millions of widget controls and options and is the default toolkit include in most python distributions at least on windows osx and linux

154180
mstest	nunit
i seem to remember that nunit and mstest attempts to run tests in parallels on multiple threads which would definitely triggers race conditional on the static shared gateway but i cannot find any documentation that says what actually happens

154180
mstest	nunit
my question is does nunit or mstest ever run unit tests in parallels

154184
positioning	slider
all of this is currently working it s just that .when the internal logic decides the slider needs to change it call islider setpos which then changes the wpf slider which then triggers a valuechanged event on the slider and the handler for that event extraction the slider s positioning and passes it in to the winforms control which originated the event in the first place

154207
proxy-server	squid
i have friend that have had good luck with squid proxy-server in nix but the only box that is available for me is a windows-server 2003 box

154238
pointers	stack
likewise culling all of the function definitions to see .when they re not using reference or pointers arguments ie copying the entire class instances onto stack should be pretty straight-forward

154254
extends	final
you can t extends obsolete because its final but maybe you can create your own attributes and mark that class as obsolete like this

154270
textbox	button
basically my problem is that .when i maximize my program all the things inside of the windows button textbox etc. stay in the same positioning in the windows which results in a large blank area near the bottom and right side

154290
configuration	installation
the installation and configuration seems to be fine

154307
order	add
if i add 3 or 4 elements to a dictionary and then do a for each to get all the key they appear in the same order i added them

154321
order	add
to checked it quickly use the same elements and change the order in which you add them to the dictionary

154333
order	add
what key did you add with in your test and in what order

154341
doubly-linked-list	nodes
i used doubly-linked-list where each nodes was a character quite a wasteful design

154341

1 linked-list of arrayss with each arrays representing a line

154341
linked-list	arrays
3 arrays of linked-list

154342

154356
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
i ve tested the above in the following browsers ie6 7 8b2 firefox 2.0.0.17 3.0.3 opera 9.52 safari for windows 3.1.2 and google-chrome whatever the latest versioning was at the time of this .post and it works across all browsers

154359
tablelayoutpanel	panels
there are some special containers types panels that you could stick on your form such as flowlayoutpanel and tablelayoutpanel

154361
abstract-class	subclassing
you are trying to put knowledge of the potential subclassing into your abstract-class which is a no-no

154361
subclassing	superclass
this also raises the question of if you could make this call what is the callback going to do with the subclassing that would be different from the superclass

virtualization	esx	virtualization	vmware	vmware	esx
go with a virtualization solution that is bare level like xen server or vmware esx or esxi free or hyper-v which isn t bare-level but closer in performance

154391
double	int
i made that assumption because i try to avoid overloads that differ by only a single datatype and in looking at the code didn t even pick up on the int double difference

154408
visio-vba	visio
is there a way in visio-vba to see if there is a shape in front of or behind a shape in visio

154409
mootools	extjs
most people start out with prototype jquery or one of the top 6 libs mootools extjs yui which have different object model

154416
punctuation	words
words contains punctuation

154425
perl	c++
may be storing your initial dictionary the 25000 wordss in a berkeley-db hashtable on disk that you can probably use directly from c++ i know you can do it from perl and for each words in the text query if it s present in the database

154444
default	reset
the default raster positioning should be 0 0 0 1 but you can reset it to make sure

154452
selected	checkbox
go to the sessions tab and selected the overrides user settings checkbox

154464
constructor	object
if you declare them on the constructor they cannot be acceced on other methods you need to declare them as object field to be global to your object instances

154481
modifiers	final
if the readers can make changes to the class and want to remove the final modifiers they can do .so at their own risk

154500
canvas	scale
you could al.so restructure the elements .so that the elements you don t want to scale with the canvas are not actually children of that canvas

154525
any	set
if you have set any properties on the table then you have to reset those properties

154545
contains	any
if your file doesn t contains any sensitive data and you can get them a short but complete program along with it i suspect that will help enormously

154551
decrement	increment
this int is only increment or decrement

154557
vmware	esx
you d be best off running vmware esx esxi as they both have a fancy memory pooling feature

154587
flac	mp3
i get flac files a lot and want to automate the taging of the endpoint mp3 files after i have converted them

154598

capturing both stdout and stderr seperately and merged

154598
python	ruby
python has a module subprocess which i was thinking about using as inspiration for a similar module in ruby

154603
subclassing	base-class
overrides is where you change the behavior of the base-class via a function with the same named in a subclassing

154607
virtual-functions	base-class
the base-class contains the prototype of the virtual-functions possibly unimplemented or with default implementation as the application dictates and the various derived classes each implements them differently to affect different behavior

154617
directory	folder
updates 2010-11-27 python 3.2 addresses the issue of cluttering source folder with .pyc files by introducing a special __pycache__ subfolder see what s new in python 3.2 - pyc repository directory

154636
embedded-database	hsqldb
at the moment we use hsqldb as an embedded-database but we search for a database with less memory footprint as the data volume grows

154640
packaging	building
if you re building this for unix you might also consider packaging your scripting using this recipe unix zip executable but note that you might have to tweak this if you plan on using stdin or reading anything from sys.args it can be done without too much trouble

154646
linked-list	arrays
list is the base-class the compiler has no clue if you re count a linked-list vector arrays or a custom list implementation as long as it acts like a list

154665
exception-handling	try-catch
there s really no other way to do this except putting the call that could throw the exception-handling in a try-catch block

154673
base-class	inherited
an overrides function replace a function inherited from the base-class but does .so in such a way that it is called even .when an instances of its class is pretending to be a different types through polymorphism

154675
parametric-polymorphism	polymorphism
i would disagree with some of the answers here in that overloading is a form of polymorphism parametric-polymorphism in the case that a methods with the same named can behave differently give different parameter types

154697
value	field
the cell is originally populate from a dataset with a numeric field value but since the datagridviewcell object returns it as an object i can t do a straight assignment

154704
python	perl
this is like key in perl and python and other languages that have built-in support for hash aka dictionary

154720
any	set
in fact we were told to ignore any problems that users running at lower resolutions reported since their internal help desk answer was set your resolution to 1024x768 or better and run with the browser maximize

154720
horizontal-scrolling	resize
the horizontal-scrolling was because we set everything to automatically resize but to stop horizontal resize at 768 actually the client area width at 1024x768

154771
contains	any
always contains a reference to any

154783
hardware	monitor
the problem with temperature and other monitor sensors is that there is no common protocols on the hardware level nor drivers allowing to retrieve that information with common api

154791
children	nodes	children	tree
i m writing a java tree in which tree nodes could have children that take a long time to compute in this case it s a filesystems where there may be network timeout that prevent getting a list of files from an attached drive

154791
show	next
i believe this is done .so the jtree knows whether to show a + icons next to the nodes

154791
children	nodes	children	tree
if i fake the value of getchildcount the tree only allocates spaces for that many child nodes before asking for an enumerator of the children

154809
lgpl	gpl
the second question is a little harder since the cross-platform solutions ffmpeg tend to be gpl d or lgpl d

154812
any	set
unlike most sorting routines what python list.sort which is what uses timsort cares about is avoiding unnecessary comparisons because generally comparisons are a lot more expensive than swapping items which is always just a set of pointers copies or even allocation some extra memory because it s always just an arrays of pointerss and the overhead is small compared to the average overhead in any python operation.

154816
versionone	basecamp
everything from excel to versionone to scrumworks to basecamp was mentioned

154823
children	tree
i m not sure if it s entirely applicable but i recently worked around problems with a slow tree by pre-computing the answers to methods that would normally required going through the list of children

154843

this page says saleslogix runs on ms sql-server or oracle both of which can connect with ruby-on-rails through activerecord

154849
vsts	tfs
this is especially important for servicing purposes - making sure that .when a service pack for vsts is applied to the client machine then the tfs api s get upgrade as well

154849
64bit	x86
the tfs api assemblies are all marked x86 but if you .app is marked any cpu then on a x64 machine it will get loaded by the 64bit clr but .when it comes time to dynamically load the tfs assemblies it will fail

154854

firefox	safari
you left out the occurs under another o s category of bugs .so that a webpage that is fine in ie and firefox on pc may look like crap on safari on a mac

154976
g++	gcc
also use the correct gcc frontend executable g++ will treat .c files like c++ files unless you explicit tell it not too

154976
g++	gcc
.so if you are compiling real c then use gcc not g++

154982
any	set
edit the logs are custom - they have a set format but i don t think they conform to any widely used standards

154997
sql-server	oracle
updates apparently oracle call it the same thing as sql-server

154997
sql-server	oracle
or rather sql-server call it the same thing as oracle since oracle s implementation came first

155004
any	set
if you set up the time-stamp stuff to run off of triggerss than any action that can set off a triggers reads

155028

my concern is that there is a compatibility issue with building software using visual-studio in an amd environment

155064
32-bit	64bit
last i am confused about 32-bit and 64bit installation

155064
32-bit	64bit
should i stick with the least common denominator 32-bit even though 64bit is steadily gaining ground

155073
32-bit	64bit
i would go for a 64bit machine and run 32-bit vms on it if you feel the need to do testing in that environment

155077
environment	building
.so i set up an appropriate hardware environment to duplicates it and i put a custom building of the server .software that instrumented the section of code in question

155077
sniffing	packets
i then set a packets sniffing tool on the network

155077
fileserver	smb
after studying the capture what i found was that the server messages block or smb aka cifs aka samba connection between our server and the fileserver was actually timing out at the tcp level due to extreme loading on the server

155077
fileserver	smb
once you lost your smb connection to the fileserver all your file locks were toast and there was no way to recover

155086
hide	next
seconds you can easily change things enough to hide the bug only to have it resurface again with the next patch

155118
contains	any
does your document contains any entity references

155119
32-bit	64bit
i would definitely go with 64bit because you can always emulate 32-bit for viewmodel s and apps and .so on

155128
32-bit	64bit
vista 64bit however has almost all the drivers support of vista 32-bit

155129
switching	screens
i typically have things set up .so i can pass a switching like -unattended that suppresses the con.sole screens

155146

deployment	install
windows service deployment is easy after the initial install you just turn them off and do an xcopy

155182
animation	rotation
only use if you are not animation the transformation of the sprite movieclip scale rotation etc otherwise it will actually make it slower

155185
virtual-functions	base-class
however you can get virtual-functions into sealed classes by declaring them in a base-class like this

155188
textbox	button
how can i use javascript to triggers the button s click event .when the enter key is pressed inside the textbox

155188
textbox	button
and i only want the enter key to click this specific button if it is pressed from within this one textbox nothing else

note that you ll need a elements contains the input-field to make this work thanks sergey ilinsky

155210
httplistener	http.sys
the .net class httplistener exposes the underlying http.sys upon which iis is built

155228
configuration	environment	environment	building
to use different versioning of a configurationuration file for different environment create a building configurationuration for each of the different environment and a configuration file named after the environment e.g

155228
configuration	environment
the pre-build-event would look similar to the above just use configuration to get the appropriate file for the environment you want

155255
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc doesn t use any postback .so most of webforms server controls don t function

155280

the types within the denotes the types of elements contains in the list

155293
project-management	project
but in the end estimation inaccuracy is a tough project-management issue that you find in agile-based or waterfall-based project

155301
value	field
readonly doesn t work on checkbox as it prevents you from editing a field s value but with a checkbox you re actually editing the field s state on || off

155301
value	field
it s important to understand that readonly merely prevents the user from changing the value of the field not from integration with the field

155301
value	field
in checkedbox for example you can checked them on or off thus setting the checkeded state but you don t change the value of the field

155306

155363
configuration	environment
under configuration properties - debugging edit the environment value to set environment variables

155385
python	java
i worked for a company which undertook a ports to java of a huge smalltalk similar-ish to python systemd and this is exactly what they did

155403
stderr	stdout
this will give you access to stdin stdout and stderr

155405
background-color	display	background-color	transparency
based on that example we can set the itemcontainterstyle to have a transparency background-color and then wrap the listbox in a border the listbox doesn t display its background-color

155457
debugging	trace
you could go with an inbetween approach and use trace to trace out your pre and .post conditional to some kind of application log which you could use to debugging problems

155465
moss	wss
i think .when you are developing new features or integration stuff on a moss wss server you need a little flexibility

155510
shell	bash	bash	zsh
it assumes that emacs s inferior shell is bash zsh or other compatible shell

155518
project-management	scrum
now scrum is a project-management methodology not a development one

155537
value	field
ankhsvn doesn t use the actual value in the individual project s scc field

155542
ncurses	x11	pdcurses	ncurses
you could write your program to uses ncurses and then use pdcurses to convert it to an x11 application - as the readme advertise

155542
ncurses	x11
i know it because i ve used it as portable ncurses though i ve never tested its x11 capabilities

155552
modifiers	final
the sealed modifiers will do what final does in java

155583
order	add
you add your elements as sortable and code your own callback to execute .when the items are dragged then dropped -- such as sending an asynchronous request to the server to persistent the new order

protege	jena
there seem to be enough tools protege topbraid jena etc. that knowing the syntax of the markup languages is not necessary but knowing the concepts is of course still critical

155625
richfaces	gwt
given the heavy reliance by gwt richfaces etc

155628
void	main
use exitcode if your main has a void return signature otherwise you need to set it by the value you return

155628
void	main
if the main methods returns void you can use this properties to set the exit code that will be returned to the calling environment

155628
void	main
if main does not return void this properties is ignore

155662
radians	cos	radians	sin	cos	sin
you need to use a partials function to input the radians into cos and sin

155662
radians	cos	radians	sin	cos	sin
that said javascript s sin and cos aren t quite as picky .so you must have halved your radians or .something

155664
firefox	safari
.when performing an xmlhttprequest and execution a function onreadystatechange the xmlhttprequest.responsetext properties contains the data loaded at that points in firefox but not in ie and maybe safari

i ve tried a pre tag but it doesn t obey the width set in the contains div elements

155682
rdfs	owl
semantic-web for the working ontologist book contains a good numbers of practical examples and motivates the need for rdf rdfs and owl and is in my opinion very readable

155694
instrumentation	debugging
i debugging hw sw integration and its often the case logging instrumentation changes or hide the bug

155700
fortran	pascal
since first popular programming languages such as fortran c pascal didn t cover the oo paradigms they only call to these artifacts functions

155702

155713
dictionary	map	data-structures	dictionary	data-structures	map	attributes	properties
attributes are usable in domains where they map onto data-structures that follow those rules the named and value of properties on an object of columns in a row of a table of entries in a dictionary

155722
defined	declare
there is another portion of code with def just below which defined a function it is a function because it is not declare inside a class this function-calls the methods we defined inside our class as you can see and finally the function is being called by itself

155723
postgresql	mysql
this methods is undocumented in the mysql adaptor but is documented in the postgresql adaptor

155730
firefox	safari
as of 2008 javascript 1.7 is supported in firefox 2.0+ and safari 3.x

155750
exception-handling	try-catch
i put all code that could cause an exception-handling inside a try-catch block and inside the catch block i spit out an alert messages alerting the user that an error has occurred as well as log the exception-handling in a database including form input query-string etc

155761
firefox	safari
generator and iterator works only in firefox 2+ and safari

155767
cosine	sin
says that function f will return the sin of the first parameter added to the cosine of the second parameter

155767
cos	sin
as it happens sin and cos are also functions

155827
python	ruby
oo purists might argue a methods is something different from a function and if you get into advanced python or ruby - or smalltalk

155830
any	set
you can set the default editor for any given file types .cs .xml .xsd etc

155841
selected	button
using refers to all input textarea selected and button elements

155845
attributes	properties
the other thing you might try is to decorator your properties with attributess and then reflect against your class .when it is construct looking for properties with the attributes and load rules

155852
constructor	object
the component has a properties which is a collections of custom object this object is marked as serialization and implements the getobjectdata for serilizing and public constructor for deserilizing

155956
openbsd	netbsd
the netbsd and openbsd versioning support only -r

155963
getter	setter
the reason for using a di containers are that you don t have to have a billion properties pre-configured in your code that are simply getter and setter

155963
getter	setter
these methods will allow you to ensure that any interface specified as a field in your class instances is configure correctly upon startup and then you no longer have to null-check your getter and setter assuming you do allow your singleton to remain thread-safe

156009
perl	c++
because of the more tedious way of adding hostss to be monitored in nagios it required defining a hosts object as opposed to the previous program which only required the ip and hostsname i figured it d be best to automate this and it d be a great time to learn perl because all i know at the moment is c++ and java

156010
project-management	project
i would say that on top of general bad project-management unrealistic scheduling mismanaged slippages etc etc etc deathmarch project often involve a new technology that is being treated as some sort of silver bullet

156024
directory	folder
note 2 i recommend you create a temporary folder for the tests and run command-line or powershell whose current working directory is set to this location

156024
command-line	cmd
step 2 we compile platform-specific assemblies using simple command-line cmd

156024
32-bit	x86

any	set
the issue itself is regarding the behavior related with the snmp set community itself that i d like to understand if there is any relationship between them

156051
callback	methods
on the success callback of the methods in javascript i m populating the dropdown via a loops

156065
input-field	selected
but the simplest idea would be to put the selected value into a hidden input-field for the postback event

156072
spaces	output
if the optimizer can correctly deduce from statistics the approximate unique numbers of combinations of x and y then there s a pretty good chance that in the tempspc column of the output of the second query it will show you just how much disk spaces if any will be required to complete the query no column no disk spaces requirement

156076
revision	updates	revision	utility
we have put together a small utility in-house that reads the catalog changes and building a large updates scripting based on the contents of the catalog by grabbing the contents from each revision in the catalog and applying them

156087
system-tray	balloon-tip
you wrote that you display notifications on the bottom-right of the screens - the standards way to do this would be using a balloon-tip with the combinations of a system-tray icons

156102
web-services	api
with the advent of web-services this sort of thing should have died away but not all apps provide a nice api to interact with

156104
digits	zero
left pad with zero with at least as many as maximum numbers digits

156110
any	set
is your pga_aggregate_target set to zero by any chance

an answer that would work cross browser safari webkit firefox etc. would be preferred

156133
markup	xhtml
i m trying to load fragments of xhtml markup using jquery s function but it raises an error trying to add the new markup into the dom

156134
debugging	exit
it makes debugging and maintenance .so much easier and as a bonus you can easily printing out the exit codes on your help screens - you do have one of those right

156136
direct3d	directx
i looked around and found the directx direct3d stuff which has all the underlying pieces but there doesn t appear to be any high level api to work with unless you re willing to use .net and use wpf neither of which really interest me

156136
direct3d	directx
directx direct3d has these pieces but you have to jump through a lot of hoops or .so it appears to use it

156158
required	checked
in the timer event handler you can checked for cancel and stop early as required

156172
mips	x86	powerpc	arm
the world would be better if we all ran mips i think or even arm or powerpc - or rather if intel amd took their semiconductor expertise and used it to make multi-core ultra-fast ultra-cheap mips processor instead of x86 processor with all of those redeeming qualities

156173
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
transitioning to any web-trendy language php asp.net ruby python is going to be worth it if for nothing more than to realize where asp classic lacks

156224
background-color	transparency
the fade masks would just be rectangles with a gradient that goes from transparency to the background-color

156237
.when	ready
.when work is completed tested and ready we merge the changes into the trunk

156249
keyboard	mouse
by this i mean if you take something that relied on both the mouse and keyboard and changed it to rely only on the mouse or only on the keyboard then you have improved useability

156252
python	java
having learnt java you ll be amazed how much simpler python is for getting the same things done

156261
stderr	stdout
the tool call out to the shell and i wanted to capture exactly what was display during test runs no matter what git was display and no matter if it was being spit out in stdout or stderr

156266
composite	visitor
sounds like you need either a to leverage polymorphism by putting methods on myinterface and implements in a and b or b some combinations of composite and visitor design pattern

156270
if-statement	for-loop
thus the more appropriate place for the lock would be inside portions of code such as inside a for-loop or if-statement .so you can free up the individual elements right away even before other ones are process

156280
put	get	push	pull
i know i can do an hg incoming -p to see the patch sets of changes coming in but it d be nice to just directly see the actual changes for a particular file that i d get if i do a pull of the latest stuff or what i might be about put push out

156280
scp	ssh	temporary	copy
the easiest thing i can think of right now is to create a little scripting that takes a look at the default location in .hg hgrc and downloading the file using libcurl if it s over http otherwise scp it over ssh or just do a direct diff if it s on the local filesystems and then to diff the working copy or the tip against that temporary copy

156292
constructor	object
should i declare the constructor as taking the order object as the first parameter and the productsservice and customersservice after that eg

156295
delegation	dealloc
if you re passing yourself as a delegation to another object reset that object s delegation before you dealloc

156304

value	field
4c get or set value of field

156322
bug-tracking	fossil
my favorite things about fossil single executable with built-in webserver wiki and bug-tracking

156328
keydown	keyup
for keypress you can also use sendmessage sending both keydown and keyup

156329
digits	zero
i need to pad numbers with leading zero total 8 digits for display

156341
selected	checkbox
selected the compact on close checkbox

156341
value	field
also beware that autonumber field value behave differently than advertised after the compacting procedure according to the ms-access 2000 documentation if you delete recording from the end of a table that has an autonumber field compacting the database resets the autonumber value

156359
multiple-projects	multi-module
you can just treat your multi-module project like a workspace with multiple-projects

156365
defined	declare
linq-to-sql has some support for inherited via a discriminator here here but you can only query on classes that are defined in the linq model - data-classes themselves and more perhaps importantly for this example the query itself must be phrased in terms of data-classes although tentity is a data-class it knows that the properties here is declare on the entity base

156369
scheme	lisp
and there are equivalent in lisp and scheme

156374
common-lisp	scheme
well apart from common-lisp labels and scheme letrec which you ve already mentioned javascript also allows you to named an anonymous-function

156387
installation	building
for example if your major.minor.patch numbers is 7.15.5 on the machine where you building the binary and the major.minor.patch numbers is 7.12.1 on the installation machine ld will printing the warning

156420
pointers	stack
the classptr points to memory that is typically on the heap occasionally on stack and starts with a four byte pointers to the vtable for that class

156420
pointers	stack	base	zero
in this example ebp stack frame base pointers has the variables at zero offset

156447
function-call	inline
usually very short function are inline .when the copy of the function body would be not much bigger than the usual prologue epilogue code generator for the normals function-call

156467
expression	brackets
to me this is a lot clearer than the equivalent using repeated if else or a composite ternary conditional which gets very messy for non-trivial expression - brackets galore

156470
contains	any
as to a valid regex for it the perl mail rfc822 address module contains a regular expression which will apparently work - but only if any comments have been replace by whitespace already

156476
continuous-integration	teamcity
if it s continuous-integration that you re looking for have you checked out teamcity

156479
sql-server-express	sql-server
.so install sql-server-express edition and open the sql-server powershell

156492
instances	private
the caching itself is what else a struct private to the caching instances

156538
silverlight	wpf
i m building a silverlight application and one of my caveats from last time was that if you need anything done right in silverlight wpf way you d need to model your object as a dependecyobject and use dependencyproperty ies

156538
silverlight	wpf
i m aiming to minimize code bloat and boiler plates i hate them and really would like to know if anyone with experience in silverlight wpf has any tips techniques for keeping usage of dependencyobject and dependencyproperty to a minimum

156541
switching	router
one possible .solution a bridging firewall between the router and the switching .so it sees all traffic between lan and internet

156550
linux	unix
if you re on unix linux then you can put it through sed

156575
logging	trace
uses .net built-in trace logging

156594
mocking	tdd
my real unit tests are built during normals tdd cycles and they always assert something although not always directly - sometimes the assert are part of the mocking framework and sometimes i m able to refactor similar assert into a single methods

156598
ip-address	hostname
the hostname exists dns has an a recording and resolves to an ip-address

156600
serialization	marshalling
activemq 5.x works on java 1.5 or later - any jvm 1.5 or later should work fine as activemq uses its own marshalling layer and does not rely on serialization etc

156603
reverse-proxy	varnish
for super high-traffic full-page caching take a look at doing varnish or squid as a caching reverse-proxy server

156604
memcached	apc
depending on what you really need you might be looking for apc memcached various templates caching libs.

156615
log4net	nlog
i have used both log4net and nlog

156620
authentication	login
i know this is not a good solution but what you can do might be setting the text of o normals textbox with stars or something like that in a different login page if there is a cookies to authentication the user

156636
value	field
a way i tend to use to solve this kind of problem is to use a dictionary field with the types as the key and the lambda as the value which is pretty terse to construct using object initializer syntax

156640
png	gif	png	ico	ico	gif	exif	xmp	webp	exif
it fully supports exif as well as iptc xmp and many other types of metadata from file types including jpeg png gif png ico webp psd .

156641
digits	zero
i have a table of users which has a username column consisting of a six digits numbers e.g 675381 i need to prepend a zero to each of these usernames 0675381 would be the final output of the previous example is there a query that could handle this

156673
if-statement	loops
unfortunately sometimes there are special cases though and these should be dealt with inside loops construct via if-statement

156675
callback	methods
if you re using jdk 1.6 you can use the callback methods gettimetolive and needsreload in resourcebundle.control to control if the bundle caching needs to be loaded with new value from the database

156679
click	mouse
basically you need the button click and mouse movement messages available

156684
webserver	security
can be used for security - pass in some kind of value to identify the client - from their the webserver will either deny or grant access to the client dependant on some criterion - maybe a lookup list

156695
system.diagnostics	.net
this is necessary for .net 1.1 implementation of system.diagnostics

156708
sql-server	ms-access
for a worked example sql-server syntax but is easily adapted for ms-access see david porta s blog

156718
any	set
you can set another order at any time and doing .so will change all texts in the application then and there

156795
put	get
it s not the most elegant solution but you could use openrowset to put the stored proc results into a table then use sp_help to get a description of it

156800
contains	set
ps since i have a 2.0 .app i m using the object-tag .approach to silverlight and it s contains in a div with height and width set in styles

156834
name-lookup	linkage
for the part of the lookup using unqualified name-lookup 3.4.1 only function declarations with external linkage from the templates definition context are found

156838
environment	execution
in addition if you wanted to parameterized it you d have to create a different types whereas anonymous-methods and lambda capture their execution environment local-variables etc .so they act like closures

156863
constructor	object
i use a combinations of having one global object and passing interfaces in via constructor

156863
constructor	object
this lets you control the setting up of program object in the main object constructor and tearing them down again in the right order .when the application stops in this main object destructor

156863
constructor	object
i also pass references to relevant data-structures into constructor of some object where i feel it is useful to isolate those object from the rest of the world within the program .when they only need to be concerned with a small part of it

156863
constructor	object
whether an object grabs the global object and navigates its properties to get the interfaces it wants or gets passed the interfaces it uses via its constructor is a matter of taste and intuition

156863
constructor	object
any object you re implements that you think might be reused in some other project should definately be passed data-structures it should use via its constructor

156863
constructor	object
object that receive interfaces they use via the constructor are probably easier to unit-test because you can feed them a mock interface and tickle their methods to make sure they return the right arguments or interact with mock interfaces correctly

156865
arrays	map
this is basically a copy of your server-side data structure a map keyed by manufacturer each value having an arrays of car types

156865
arrays	map
then in your onchange event for the manufacturers you d need to get the arrays from the map defined above and then create a list of options from that

156866
configuration	environment	benchmarking	cpu-speed
i wonder if there is a program available which would do lets say a benchmarking of your hardware cpu-speed memory performance harddisk speed analyze your database and come up with the optimal configuration for this specific environment

156880
contains	elements
i wish to make these service return bad-request .when the xml contains invalid elements

156902
environment	building
if you set your environment up to use the x64 tools by running program files x86 microsoft visual-studio 9.0 vc bin amd64 vcvarsamd64.bat then run configure.bat for your compiler and building as normals you end up with appropriate libs and dlls

156902
installation	building
unfortunately the x64 libs building to the same named as the x86 libs .so it s not possible to have a side by side installation of stlport to allow you to building with either x86 or x64

156902
packaging	building
edit i ve written up what you need to do to provide side-by-side x64 and x86 support as well as packaging up the changes required for vs2008 building on my blog

156916
bash	zsh
i am using zsh but a bash solution is also welcome

156940
web-hosting	hosting
i was recently looking at some web-hosting solutions and some of the providers offered various hosting location us or uk based servers

156941
deployment	install
now .when i need to do the deployment i would need the files to be install under home webuser railsapps helloworld and i need the cap scripting restart my thin afterwards

156963
terminate	timeout
since by default there is a timeout that kills the service after 30 seconds .when it was not able to go beyond the start methods this was the reason why it simply terminate

156970
.net	wcf	compact-framework	.net
if you re using ce 6 and .net compact-framework 3.5 have you considered using the windows communication foundation wcf

157009
web-services	api
eventhough sf has many references to best practices in api which are very good i dont find much information oriented for .net web-services

157025
inlining	inline
and .when you are at a points of code you are sure about the types of the object being called you may make an inline call that will avoid the polymorphism systemd and enable inlining by the compiler

157028
hide	show
show the windows programatically hide it immediately programatically and click cancel on it well you guessed programmatically

157037
comma	words
your words delimiters are going to be many spaces tab beginning of line parentheses periods comma exclamation question marks etc

157066
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
see my example spreadsheet in excel and openoffice.org versioning

157094
tuples	set
well you could do one list-comprehension expression to get a set of tuples with that stat test in them and then reduce that down to get the sums

157103
search-engine	seo
one other consideration unrelated to performance is search-engine optimisation some seo people believe that hosting sites on servers in other geographic location can have some affect on placement in results

157105
contains	any
.net 3.0 contains things which were great for new project but which many existing project wouldn t want to take for the sake of updating - it would required significant rework to integrated any of them

157109
xsd	xml
using a standards like xsd or dtd allows you to have a well know and recognized language on how to describe the structure of a xml document

157144
numericupdown	datagridview
for a project i built a custom datagridview column which contains numericupdown controls

157151
png	ico
furthermore setting the icons of the form from a png is an unessecary performance hit it should have been an ico in the first place

157152
expression	evaluation
the previous expression was evaluation to a boolean which explains the exception-handling error

157180
directory	folder
first create a directory inside your eclipse installation folder for example opt eclipse called links

157185
.net	wcf
if you re using .net 3.0 or later i would encourage you to consider implements your service using wcf

157185
.net	wcf
with wcf you can make your service compatible with asmx service regular .net web-service .so other applications and other languages can consume the service as though it was a regular .net web service

157186
bazaar	git
maybe you could look at something other than subversion if you dont want a server like a distribute vcs bazaar git and mercurial are popular these days or you should look at subversion hosting service

157192
associations	model
it would help me a lot to develop this project attending some more academic aspects of the subject such as the entity associations model etc

157211
python	c++
are there any open-sourced fractals map creators available preferably in python or c++

157215
emacs	vim
.so instead of using an ide which you ll probably do all your professional life get a taste of using old school editor like vim emacs

157215
ruby-on-rails	django	ruby-on-rails	cakephp	cakephp	django
object relational mapping take a look at ruby-on-rails cakephp django and sql alchemy and model-view-controller frameworks on various platform

157222
environment	execution
log as much detail about the environment in which you re execution as possible probably on startup

157230
environment	execution
log as much detail about the environment in which you re execution as possible probably on startup

157236
logging	trace
provide a mechanism for capturing what the user was doing .when the problem happened a logging or tracing capability that can help provide you and your colleagues with data what exception-handling was throw stack trace program state what the user had been doing etc. .so that you can recreate the issue

157238
lwjgl	jogl
consider using opengl use jogl of lwjgl

157238
lwjgl	jogl
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

157244
directory	folder
one .solution would be to use iis-manager to configure the website created for your asp.net .app by visual-studio and add a virtual directory for each of the common folder .so that by the virtual nature of the virtual directory they will .appear to be in the same root folder as your asp.net .app

157263
getter-setter	getter	getter-setter	setter	getter	setter
in c# there was a conscious decision to disallow changing the types .when overloading properties even .when they have only one of the getter-setter pair because it would otherwise have very inconsistent behavior you mean i can change the types on the one with a getter but not one with both a getter and setter

157266
decrement	increment
i think using the first form is probably the way to go since it s probably by far the most common loops structure in the known universe and since i don t believe the reverse loops saves you any time in reality still doing an increment decrement and a comparison on each iterator

157271
ssl-certificate	ssl
however it is our opinion that sites conducting more than 50 transactional will required a professional level ssl-certificate due to the increased likelihood that the website s customers will expect ssl from a highly credible and established ssl provider and well

157328
stax	sax
but if you really need to reduce your footprint then you need to use a non-dom api like sax or stax but that s considerably more work

157401
multiplication	division
in about 99.8 of all cases it s just plus minus division and multiplication in some intelligent combinations - in most cases it s about algorithms not math

157412
associations	model
it would help me a lot to develop this project attending some more academic aspects of the subject such as the entity associations model etc

157441
reserved-words	keyword
i m wondering if there may be some issue with naming it the same as the keyword date javascript keyword and reserved-words

157446
64bit	x86
as for the size of the .net 3.5 deployable file is that it s .net 2.0 3.0 and 3.5 for x86 x64 and the other 64bit architecture in one big file

157451
mstest	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mbunit	nunit
it seems to combine all the best of nunit mbunit and mstest

157534
tcp-ip	tcp
java s socket class seems to be designed to provide an abstraction comparable to a bsd tcp socket probably because this is the level of abstraction to which people are used to .when programming tcp-ip applications

157594
sftp	ftp	sftp	scp	ftp	scp
however it is possible to use a repository on another server with any combinations of supported protocols including http ftp scp sftp and more

157624
children	nodes
the only way i managed it was to create an xml fragment contains the nodess in the nodes list and then passing in the children of the fragment

157636
tuples	any
you can programmatically building a selected statement to see if any tuples points to more than one row

157636
tuples	any
if that returns any rows your index is not unique since more than one row maps to the given tuples

157636
tuples	set
this will return a single row result set denoting the numbers of duplicates tuples sets

157662
instrumentation	trace
sampling with activity monitor instrumentation shark will show stack trace full of c functions for the python interpreter

157680
32-bit	64bit
microsoft offers a free downloading of virtual-pc 2007 in both 32-bit and 64bit versioning

157696
command-prompt	cmd
open windows command-prompt cmd

157696
directory	folder
change directory to mysql installation folder

157717
contains	any
i do think tdd would be a good approach in large teams or any size team contains at least one unreliable programmer

157718
stderr	stdout
in that case my advice would be to use stderr rather than stdout

157721
.when	ready
4- email sms on screens messages .when report is ready seems great.

157728
platform	anycpu
platform anycpu c windows microsoft.net framework v2.0.50727 microsoft.common.targets 490 9 crm_deploy

157740
player	movie
personally i use media player classic if i have ac3 or acc tracking on the movie and prefer to enjoy full digital output i can easily switching from the sound filtering settings

157770
background-color	width
i can set background-color width etc. but can t set the font-weight

157771
put	get
assuming you use lazy-evaluation matches you can get a set of matches on a string which you can put into your arrays

157781
capitalization	uppercase
however there seems to be a bug in this methods it returns all nodes named in uppercase and all attributes named in lowercase regardless of the capitalization i used to create the nodes

157785
vbscript	vba	vbscript	basic	basic	vba
the on error goto labels syntax is supported by visual basic and visual basic for applications vba but vbscript doesn t support this language feature .so you have to use on error resume next as describe above

157801
carbon	cocoa
but in short if you re using carbon use the gestalt call and if you re using cocoa there is a constants called nsappkitversionnumber which you can simply checked against

157826
web-applications	frontend
i think that it s not as i have switched web-applications built with extjs from a java backend to a .net backend without changing a line of client frontend code be it html or javascript

157850
checkbox	textbox
right now my prejudice is that css is good for relatively positioning blocks artwork text etc but not good for input forms where it is important to line up lots of labels textbox ddl s checkbox etc

157853
ms-access	oracle
i ve used this for oracle sql and ms-access databases flat files and excel spreadsheet

157862
project-management	project
potentially project-management project status hours entry

157877
ms-access	oracle
i ve used this for oracle sql and ms-access databases flat files and excel spreadsheet

157911
windows-xp	windows
i m developing a windows similar to the windows-xp error report .when an application crash but that gives as much imediate information as possible imediatly about the exception-handling throw

157959
linux	unix
i want to updates the scheme of terminal.app not know how i would do this in a pure linux unix env

157960
instrumentation	trace	logging	trace
you could instrumentation the troublesome call with trace logging via aop or even use its exception-handling interception features to conditional log without having to litter your code

157984
textwrangler	textedit
you can then open .bashrc in textedit or in textwrangler and add the previous cmd

158057
scheme	lisp
.so you see the following .when editing lisp scheme

158063
required	checked
apparently the activestate people didn t checked much into the package because it required templates stash xs but that s not actually available in ppm

158077
binaries	install
luis lavena maintains the ruby one-click install binaries

158104
concat	where
in my troubleshooting i ve dumbed it down as much as i could .so please don t mind where i concat plain text to plaintext.

158120
addition	modulo
the .net include math.ieeeremainder x y in addition to the standards modulo

158121
spaces	output
i expect the write to complete only partially if the amount to be written is greater than the amount of spaces in the socket s tcp output buffering this is what i expect intuitively it s also pretty much my understanding of the docs but that s not what happens

158144
put	get
i bet if you put your send code in a for 1 100000 loops you would eventually get a write that succeeds with a value smaller than requested

158151
paint.net	photoshop
do i really have to open an image program like paint.net or photoshop simply to paste an image then save it

158175
solidworks	autocad
anyone that s worked with engineering tools solidworks autocad etc. is familiar with this sort of relative positioning

158187
textbox	button	selected	textbox	selected	button
click it and then click the selected button to place it down in the character map textbox

158200
put	get
sets recognized properties for an ftp-server to put and get xml input and a jms queue server that keeps tracking of jobs

158210
python	perl
but more often on linux you would see python or perl being used

158232
32-bit	64bit
i need to be able to link to both 32-bit and 64bit versioning of the libs on my workstation .so i don t want the 64bit versioning to clobber the 32-bit libs

158253
directory	folder
as a user navigates between folder it s changing your application directory to the one currently being looked at

158274
desktop-application	web-applications
i once saw a team used to writing java ee web-applications try to write a cocoa desktop-application

158275
ip-address	hostname
my guess is that that s browser behavior because there can t be a http link without a hostname or ip-address you can t just access the protocols

158292
directory	folder
the current working directory of the applicaiton will be c folder 1

158310
postgresql	oracle
is there a tool preferably free which will translation oracle s pl sql stored procedure language into postgresql s pl postgresql stored procedure language

158319
firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
can someone points me at some sample cross-browser code firefox opera safari ie â that solves this problem

158319
safari	opera
iâ m familiar with firefoxâ s pageshow event but unfortunately neither opera nor safari implements this

158323
webserver	upload
if you re using apache as your webserver you ll need enough ram in your machine to fit the whole file size in memory of all files being upload at a given time

158324
value	field
is there a way to repopulate the field with the entered value .so the errors can be corrected easily

158343
webserver	upload
use ado.net to open xls file using jet engine connection to locally upload file on webserver

158343
environment	restart
i haven t had to change any environment variables and have therefore not restart after making these changes - but i shouldn t have to for windows folder file-permissions to take effect

158347
postgresql	oracle
there is a tool available at which can be used to transalate oracle schema to postgresql schema but i m not sure if it will also translation the stored-procedures

158361
data-structures	dictionary
this means that you cannot modify your dictionary while you accessing it for read or write from the other thread it can just broke internal data-structures

158378
windows-vista	windows-xp
note that this is the location in windows-xp i m assuming it is the same in windows-vista

158387
credentials	account
your scripting should have its own credentials and the account it uses should have no access other than exactly what is necessary

158401
shell	bash
it could also be a problem with your versioning of the bash shell not correctly execution your .profile

158457
daemons	systemd
.so i have a daemons running on a linux systemd and i want to have a recording of its activities a log

158465
switching	router
then its really easy to switching your test case from any of the available components and most importantly camel comes with some really handy mock endpoint which makes it super easy to test complex router logic particularly with asynchronous operations

158489
ubuntu	debian
if your code is c++ then you might consider log4cxx in the apache project apt-get install liblog4cxx9-dev on ubuntu debian but it looks like you are using c

158505
python	c++
python doesn t use statically defined types like c++

158509
enterprise	platform
as a .net developer i m asking whether jboss alternatives exist to be more suitable for .net development as an enterprise application platform

158514
revision	svn
according to the manual git dcommit â œwill create a revision in svn for each commit in git.â but is there a way to avoid multiple subversion revision

158519
required	checked
i can easily checked whether that recording has required permission by doing where permissions canread canread

158536
contains	set
once we have the correct fieldtextbox we need to be able to set the focus on the actual textbox contains within the controltemplate

158536
contains	set
my code contains in the code-behind for the fieldtextbox to then set focus on the control would be

158539
google-chrome	firefox
break line tag is not working in firefox neither in google-chrome

158545
linq-to-dataset	linq-to-sql
you can use linq-to-dataset directly but the linq-to-sql query translator converts expression-trees into sql statements and that can t be changed

158548
firefox	opera	firefox	safari	safari	opera
ok i tried this and it works in firefox 3 safari 3.1.1 and ie7 but not in opera 9.52

158548
button	popup
but if you then go to another url and then hit the back button to go back to this page you don t get an alert box popup in opera but you do in the other browsers

158557
latitude-longitude	street-address
i ve seen that it s possible to get the latitude and longitude geocoding like in google-maps api from a street-address but is it possible to do the reverse and get the street-address .when you know what the latitude-longitude already is

158564
debugging	trace
trace debugging info warn error critical and have your daemons re-read that configuration file on-the-fly by trapping a signals allowing you to manipulate log levels on a running server

158571
triggers	insert
do you leave it up to the developer to insert sequence.nexval or use a triggers

158587
boolean	int
true boolean are coerced to unit int and false boolean to zero int

158587
contains	elements
.so if you re happy to use scipy or numpy make an arrays of int for each elements of your sequences each arrays contains one elements for each of your tests and sum over the arrayss

158588
contains	set
you set the triggers s properties to templatebinding isfocused .so it fires .when the contains control is focused

158603
processor	cpu
thus the bigger problem might be that you rely on a certain speed you assume the processor can perform that many operations a second however .when the core frequency is lowered it will behave like a slower cpu less operations per second and the core frequency doesn t jump to max just because the cpu is not 100 idle

158603
virtual-machine	vmware
windows fails to correctly updates the internal clock as it seems to not detection that powernow is in effect i guess because it runs within a virtual-machine and vmware for linux fails to handle the situation correctly as well

158608
any	set
...as any bit being set to 1 will result in a non-zero value for the operators

158617
multi-user	updates
