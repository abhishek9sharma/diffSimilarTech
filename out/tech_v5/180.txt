python	perl
as suggested by ikkebr python is probably as good as or better than perl

1800320
python	perl
i just had the misfortune to learn perl first .so am much more familiar with it - if i was to start again i d learn python instead i think

1800323
contains	any
google if they were feeling evil today could certainly rewrite the action of your to points to themselves or log every keypress or create an contains another page on your site and simulate the user click on any action in that page

1800338
ubuntu	debian
in debian and most likely ubuntu each versioning of php cli cgi and apache has its own copy of php-ini

1800344
linked-list	arrays
with a linked-list you can have a really large text file and not worry about allocation enough memory to the arrays

1800348
perl	awk
i would use perl over a bash sed awk combinations

1800361

the lists are very deep nested set tree and way beyond the scoping of any mailing list i ve come across

scripting	shebang
as chirael said it sounds like your shebang line the directive at the top of the file that tells the shell how to run the scripting is invalid somehow

oracle	mysql	enterprise	platform
originally i developed the application for use with mysql on my workstation as it was originally for a once of analysis task but now wish to move it to an enterprise oracle rac platform as it has proved to be useful to continue to continue import data and retaining it for a couple of months for use by myself and a few other analysts

1800421
sequences	unique
each has a unique primary id column which is auto-generated using a sequences and before-update triggers

1800425
value	field
if i understand your reply right how about you have a yes no column field in your list named isvisible with a custom view where only items where isvisible equals yes on the web part and the administration will just edit the list and change the value for the visible field

1800436
arrays	map
i have a google map using ym4r + geokit within ruby-on-rails anyhow i basically have an arrays of markers which are populate in the following manner

1800446
joomla	drupal
i love wordpress but it s not the only cms out there you should look at drupal joomla movable types or one of many other open source or even commercial cms

1800446
buddypress	bbpress
you may also want to look at other product in the automattic family such as wordpress mu buddypress and bbpress

1800458
contains	any
no the list_head struct doesn t contains any lock and the operations are by no means atomicity

1800464

operator-overloading has no performance penalty over any other function and may like any other function be inline to remove any function-call overhead

1800481
constructor	object
this code assumes that the various object in question have no-parameter constructor

1800498
cryptography	security
it s like security or cryptography or even the locks on your car house - someone with enough time and resources can probably break through anything

1800501
python	java
in general memory-leaks in automated garbage-collection languages java python etc. occur .when you repeatedly initializer object but either a

1800504
application-pool	iis-manager
also make sure your application-pool iis-manager is running under an actual never-expires user account not the systemd account

1800531
filtering	grouping
inorder to accomplish this what i ve done is created a sql query where i join the events for each location and then grouping by the location named and only use location groupinging having more than 10 entries that filtering out the somewhat non-reliable entries but i still end up with some very different spelling and entries resulting in duplicates properties location

1800531
latitude-longitude	location
i restrict my searches by latitude-longitude .so i don t get location with the same named in different cities grouping together

1800531
latitude-longitude	location
i was going to take each result and then do a regular expression match against all the location in within the latitude-longitude range

1800536
double	int
finally image wants either int between 0 and 255 or double between 0 and 1.0 .so you need to cast or rescale your numbers

1800537
asp.net-mvc	webforms
.when is the masterpagefile properties of a view page checked that it exists in asp.net-mvc webforms view engine

1800541
collapse	sidebar
i have built a sidebar navigation that collapse expands .when the nav title are click

1800546
python	c++
i know and wrote c++ but for screen-scraping i d rather use some scripting-language like python with some handy libs

1800547
value	field
i have some page with tickboxes for each field the user would like to filtering and also a textbox to enter each filtering value

1800547
value	field
then my webservice receives list of query object and now comes the big question how to translation it to linq query if the field count and filtering value may vary

1800555
silverlight	wpf
i believe this was developed back .when .net 1.x was the new hotness .so i don t believe it uses wpf or silverlight

1800555
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
in addition the monodevelop ide is also built-in c# and gtk# originally based on sharpdevelop

1800574
python	perl
another possibility would be to call the jms through a proxy service using either perl python or any other language that is available for postgresql stored procedure development

1800586
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my pysqlite2 installation to the newest versioning .so that extensions can be loaded and i specified spatialite_library_path in my settings file

1800589
perl	ruby
both perl and ruby support the -n -e and -p options

1800593
xsd	xml
is there an simple transformation process xslt which can take an old xml file and order its elements in a specified way .so that we can use the new xsd to validation it

1800601
ref	out
alternatively a complex return-value or integration with ref out parameters might be necessary finally the extension may be complex fragile despite its utility and as such only the partials class implementer may be in a positioning to adequately handle this

1800608
subclassing	base-class
my problem is that a user can change the types based on a combo box and i need to be able to either cast it back to the base-class or change it to a totally different subclassing with a different subset of additional properties

1800612
getter	setter
google does not say to avoid getter setter and make your variables public for android

1800612
getter	setter
they do advise to not use getter setter from within a class to access its own field

1800612
getter	setter
avoid internal getter setter

1800612
getter	setter
it s reasonable to follow common object-oriented programming practices and have getter and setter in the public interface but within a class you should always access field directly.

1800617
hide	show
i frequently have object in my pages that i want to activate deactivate hide show etc. but - having missed the rigorous introduction to javascript - i ve no idea how these things get named

1800622
least-squares	regression
i m using drej to do non-linear least-squares regression on historical progress

1800628
base-class	inherited
i d create the inherited hierarchy as you see fit using normals inherited then look into activator.createinstance or a static factory-method on the base-class to create instances of the object

1800653
python	ruby	python	c++
as myyn suggested .something like beautiful.soup or hpricot really excels at this .sort of thing .so if you aren t ab.solutely convinced that it has to be in c++ you really should look into those the basic of both python and ruby can be picked up pretty quickly and are certainly much simpler than c++

1800654
blacklist	whitelist
why would you need both a whitelist and a blacklist

1800655
any	set
because httpcontext.user has not been set by any authentication module

1800659
expression	evaluation
output the result-of expression evaluation

1800663
attributes	properties
i used the subsonicignore attributes on my properties and it fixed the issue

1800670
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
google-chrome and firefox do not do this i m assuming opera and safari do not as well

1800671
dfa	nfa
this however neglected the fact that the numbers of states in the dfa after conversion from an nfa can end up being 2 m where m is the numbers of states in the nfa

1800671
dfa	nfa
.so for now i m just going to go ahead with the regex nfa dfa approach

1800685
contains	elements
now i ve got a nested arrays that contains nil elements if the size of the arrays is odd

1800695
unmanaged	bstr
what if there were a way to get a char or byte of the unmanaged bstr string

1800712
implements	extends
the only way to change typess is to assign a different instances of a compatible types to the variables if the variables will accept typess implementss foo and typess foo1 and foo2 both implements extends foo then an instances of either can be assign to the variables

1800712
value	field
if you wish to maintain some state in this transitions you can either defined a common way for one instances of an object to copy all relevant value from another compatible instances perhaps through reflection if the field properties are of the same types and named or make it easy to shared the sub sections via delegation this is however a dangerous practice id the subsection typess are not immutable unless your design is structured to never care

1800727
double	int
one field can be double one field string one field int

1800732
order	add
i want to use a view that make it possible to add a new order with some orderdetails object

1800786
any	set
if i need to create any official artifacts i ll take what i ve draw and set it up using a tool

1800793
filtering	grouping
this works but how do i filtering by a certain grouping

1800794
json	xml
in my experience it works really well with ajax features since you only need to change your view to return the necessary information as json or xml

1800808
vistadb	ado.net
using sql-server integration service to migrate vistadb 4 data - most of what s in this .post applies to any ado.net provider

1800808
data-access	ado.net
all the data-access is through the getschema call to the ado.net provider

1800834
javascript	dom
if you want to access specific elements like it sounds like you are wanting you need to learn the dom and not use the syntax that you were suggesting that sounds like 1990s javascript

1800840
csv	xml
it s worth mentioning that context switching works well in making a request available in different formats - html xml csv etc

1800864
protected	public
i have .some attributes which are const .so should these attributes be made public or protected

1800864
protected	public
i was in support of protected because it is used by some of the derived classes but my friend argued that since it is const it doesnt make any difference even if it is public which also makes some sense

1800866
scriptaculous	jquery
cakephp comes with prototype and scriptaculous or jquery future release

1800868
peer	p2p
i m creating a p2p java application in jxta for simple messaging between peer

1800874
regular-language	decidable
and the question of whether a regular-language is-empty is decidable

1800892
shell	bash
with shell scripting all you ever need to know is a bit bash sh and a lot of awk

1800892
python	perl
perl python are very useful sysadmin tools as well

1800892
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
you can learn about ruby if you want but in terms of sysadmin i would say go for perl python instead

1800896
scheme	lisp
i develop in lisp and in scheme but i was reading about clojure and then i want to know in which cases is better to use it than using lisp or scheme

1800898
direct3d	gdi
i know how to do it in previous versioning of windows but would really like to keep everything in the direct3d stack without resorting to gdi bltbit call

1800909
triggers	insert
in theory you could do an after insert triggers on a table that automatically sets off dbms_stats

1800917
latitude-longitude	great-circle	latitude-longitude	haversine	great-circle	haversine
some general latitude-longitude related scripting haversine formula to calculate the great-circle distance between the two points â that is the shortest distance over the earthâ s surface

you have a list of something and a details panels with field and cmd button that are connect to the selected item in the list

1800943
python	c++	python	java
anyone who already knows c++ or java can become productive in python in about 4 hours

1800949
numeric	digits
you can chance your regular expression to accept only numeric digits only int numbers

1800950
callback	methods
if #1 means what i think it does i d use that -- have the service catch the exception-handling and call a methods on an aidl-defined callback object created and supplied by the activity

1800971
gnome	kde
i want both support for gnome kde desktops

1800971
gnome	kde
updates do i take there isn t an easy solution and one must aggregate together multiple sources gnome kde inorder to craft a solution

1800973
key-value	key
i am not sure if this can be done -- it looks like it should be a straightforward thing but i keep getting the entity sale is not key-value coding-compliant for the key sum .

1800976
any	set
is there any way to programatically set the comment in the iphone sdk

1800978
decrement	increment
it may be a counter that is increment .when the listener is execution and decrement .when is not

1800979
iprincipal	iidentity
iprincipal is then inject into service-layer and user iidentity is used to filtering data

1800989
gnome	kde
i might be shooting myself in the foot but this could give you a hint on how to do the clipboard for kde not sure about gnome myself but try it the scripting is in python and demonstrates how to get set stuff on the clipboard via using dcop and klipper it is on this site here

1800994
verilog	vhdl
i tried multiple time to learn some verilog and vhdl

1801012
attributes	properties
you have to declare those attributes in the properties class first

1801027
web-services	api
i am working on an api for several web-services which all return a list of product

1801038
attributes	properties
using reflection you can easily get the properties named and the from the attributes the column named that this properties is mapped to

1801046
private-members	object
however inorder for the input to actually do anything to the object it needs access to its private-members

1801057
put	get
because parsechildren was true the child controls would be put into a properties rather than into the contains control s child controls collections and would never get their onprerender function called

1801062
contains	any
does your username or passwd contains any funny characters that could confuse the shell or php

1801070
dictionary	arrays
i want a dictionary settings to hold my arrays such as debugging option 1 option 2 etc

1801070
dictionary	arrays
how would i access debugging arrays under the settings dictionary

1801076
content-disposition	content-length
right now i m sending content-disposition and content-length headers and then send file to user with fpassthru php function

1801081
ubuntu	linux
i have a process that is running as a java daemons on ubuntu linux

1801096
scheme	lisp
if your problem domain involves concurrent-programming clojure s arrays of integrated tools for managing concurrency may be a better fit than the implementation-specific or lowest-common-denominator libs available in other lisp and scheme

1801107
primitive	int
the reason you do not have to say new with int is that it is a primitive instead of an object

1801112
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
i was able to figure it out by putting a reference to the viewcontroller in the mainwindow nib and then autoreleasing the viewcontroller after i added the navigationcontroller rootvc to the uiwindow

1801114
any	set
if you need any environment variables set set them in the startup scripting and export them

1801125
textchanged	textbox
if you do choose to react to textchanged then be aware that intermediate value may not parsing to the required types â for example if the textbox is constrained to a date and the user is attempting to enter 26 11 2009 then the text will be 2 after the first character which is not a valid date

1801139
silverlight	wpf
the microsoft expression community gallery provides a community site for sharing wpf and silverlight resources

1801140
player	movie
basically i m looking to adjust the movie player code inorder to allow the application user to tap on different portions of the screens while a video plays and call other cmd for example a video of puppets talking if you touch one of the puppets the video pauses and a second smaller windows appears with a list of information about that puppet

1801167
widget	button
i have a widget and inside it are 32 button

1801167
widget	button
i have done .something similar but i was working with custom widget .so i could just create a new signals in the code of my class but i would like to avoid creating a custom widget for just a single button

1801185
verilog	vhdl
logic these days is implements using programming languages like verilog and vhdl which are pretty close to existing software programming languages

1801214
communication	messages
one thing to realise is that the erlang concurrency model does not really specify that the data in messages must be copy-paste between process it states that sending messages is the only way to communication and that there is no shared state

1801221
rollback	commit
it doesn t mean anything special a suspended transactional is just a transactional that is temporary not used for insert updates commit or rollback because a new transactional should be created due to the specified propagation properties and only one transactional can be active at the same time

1801222
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
you can use calloc instead of malloc to have the memory be initializer set to zero or you can use memset after you allocate the memory and set the memory to zero yourself

1801224
switching	router
switching router implements functionality of a switching router

1801248
egit	jgit
a search showed that it was possibly related to jgit egit

1801268
directory	folder
edit if you don t like the registry and i don t blame you for it you can create an xml or some other configuration file in a directory under the application data special folder

1801272
.net	wcf
if your clients are also .net wcf i would highly recommend using wshttpbinding which provides a plethora of security options out of the box

1801272
credentials	security
security credentials information is available to the service itself via the operationcontext in case you need to access it directly from your code

1801273
defined	declare
in misc.h and set.h do you actually defined the functions mentioned in the linker-error or do you just declare them as stubs

1801273
defined	declare
you can either defined them in a separate .cpp file or else declare them using the inline keyword

1801278
rollback	commit
this should be make intuitive sense since everything that happens after you begin a transactional is in that transactional until either a rollback or commit

1801355
selected	checkbox
under the creating a project page there is a step which is commonly missed which says ensure that the set as main project checkbox is selected and clear the create main class field

1801369
cobertura	emma
cobertura emma and even clover only do branch decision coverage in addition to line statement coverage of course

1801412
mousedown	mouseup
it is certainly not what i would expect a click event in my terminology implies that the distance between mousedown and mouseup is below a certain threshold

1801412
click	mouse
the messages will be display only if the mouse didn t move too much between the down and up events a normals click should triggers it a drag shouldn t

1801441
spritebatch	xna
my only prior game programming experience is in microsoft s xna and c# which has a built-in spritebatch framework that makes it incredibly easy to draw scale and rotate pre-rendered sprites on screens

1801448
touch-events	touch-event
i am doing iphone web development and i ve noticed that gestures events can also be touch-events which means a touch-event handler also fires up .when there is a gestures event

it contains elements of arbitrary types each

1801459
duplicates	elements
how to delete all duplicates elements in such list efficiently

1801459
duplicates	elements
in python what is the fastest algorithm for removing duplicates from a list .so that all elements are unique while preserving order

1801475
any	set
i mean that for the set of source object s given any two object x1 and x2 that are elements of s there exists a hash-function f such that

1801475
data-structures	hashmap
that s because such data-structures as a java hashmap or hashset rely on a methods where a portion of the hashcode is used to find an elements often called a bucket in the backing storage

1801475
contains	set
assuming your set contains nothing but a instances your insert search now turns into an o n operation turning the entire insert into o n 2

1801484
python	php
although i honestly haven t used it much .when i read about what s being done with python it seems to have the kind of advantages you re looking for - robust extensibility scalability and a sense of cohesiveness that i find to be missing from other languages php in particular

1801519
player	movie
why not have a rentableitem that can be either a movie a game a game machine a blue-ray player or whatever

1801527
environment	building
you ll also become very familiar with the peculiar architecture of the playstation3 and probably be involved in developing libs for that environment that the company s game teams will building on top of

1801546
selected	cell
after loops exit a messagebox popup that tells you the value changed and then the original cell is selected again

1801574
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
while it might make some logical sense to try to embed vcs inside of each other with the exception-handling of the built-in containers vcs uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller it really doesn t workâ

1801575
linked-list	tree
an improvement would be to make it autobalancing on insert by maintaining a depth attributes keeps the tree from degrading into a linked-list

1801583
environment	restart
development environment do not required you to restart the server if you change a model

1801583
passenger	webrick
a ruby-on-rails server mongrel passenger webrick etc running in a production-environment will only load your ruby-on-rails environment once .when the process is started

1801783
rhino-mocks	nunit
monotouch has netted me some serious productivity gains from being able to use a far less terse and chatty language to being able to use libs like rhino-mocks and nunit out of the box

formatting	printing
on the same principles you could find debug_print_backtrace useful it do the same things but php handle the formatting and printing of all the information by itself

1801943
innodb	myisam
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently fallback to the myisam engine

1801943
innodb	myisam
then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you

1801943
innodb	myisam
even if you later discover and fix the innodb problem all tables created during the problem remain myisam

1801955
derived-class	pure-virtual
there is no way to determine if a methods has been overrides except for pure-virtual methodss they must be overrides and non-pure in a derived-class

1801955
protected	public
nonlegacy may make it protected or public as appropriate but default to the same accessibility as its base-class is a good idea.

1801964
pure-virtual	base-class
if your intention is to have a methods that is not pure-virtual but needs to be overrides for every class it will be called on you can just insert an assert false statement into the base-class methods implementation

subset	unique
no you need the entire guid since there is a possibility that a subset may not be unique

1801972
colorbox	jquery

1801972
click	mouse
there is functionality on the timeline for users to click and drag or use the mouse scroll wheel

perl	c++
c++ perl etc etc the simplified wrapper and interface generator allows you to interop between c based languages and others including .net and java

1802327
fileserver	smb
of course to do that would required a custom server not a smb or similar fileserver

1802330
boost-spirit	boost-regex
seems to me it would be easier to implements a bullet-proof solution using boost-regex or even boost-spirit if the overall task required order-of-operations to be analysed which can easily handle these kind of syntax with a large degree of tolerance

1802362
debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	debian	ubuntu	debian

op edit it s important to note that msxml3 was release before the w3c decided on a final xsd specifications

1802477
single-table-inheritance	activerecord
if you want to save your w l and p on your database you could use single-table-inheritance - instead of having all your types of roof model inheriting from activerecord base you would have something like this

almost all recording have about 6 field only one of them is a varchar-field and 99.99 of these varchar field contains null value

1802495

digits	base
the interpreter program is embeded as a list of base 10 digitss inside a single base 11 numbers using the digits a to mark the boundary except at the very end

1802576
silverlight	wpf
the main use case in wpf applications unlike silverlight where all controls use states is user-controls where you can create your own state grouping and states as part of the control

1802587
arrays	map
if there is no variables b maybe you add it to some map or arrays

1802587
arrays	map
in such case map or arrays points at it

thickbox	jquery
i want to launchd a jquery thickbox onload instead of click

ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	haskell	python
plenty to choose from php python ruby clojure haskell etc..

1802653
any	set	inherited	accessor
edit any properties or methods can be accesses in this way as the aspx page essentially inherited from the code-behind class but the accessor will need to be set to at least protected as a result

1802676
key-value	key
it fully qualifies to exists within the risk table according to the third normals form no transitive dependency to the key a non key-value .

1802698

1802747
asp.net-mvc	webforms
2 ignore asp.net-mvc and target webforms

1802747
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc maybe very popular in web circles right now and it provides a better separation-of-concerns though you can achieve similar results with webforms with a bit if diligence and strong design leadership - but it required a higher degree of knowledge

1802750
webforms	asp.net
the default behavior for asp.net webforms is for no namespace to be defined which can sometimes lead to confusion

1802774
click	mouse
i want the user to have the ability to click and hold the control with the mouse and drag it around on its surface and drop it anywhere within that surface

1802788
variables	boolean
i can get around this by declaring a class-level private boolean variables that acts a flag of sorts

1802797
onmousedown	onmousemove
if your control is moving within one containers panels you can overrides onmousedown onmousemove events and adjust the location properties of the control

1802802
ref	out
i also tried ref and out but it doesn t work

1802808
export	csv
besides i need to export to a text file csv

1802813
ref	out
by the way you can t capture ref and out variables in lambda but you can have them as parameters

1802814
.net	wcf
if you are using .net 3.5 you should go for wcf as remoting is slowly becoming obsolete

1802822
json	xml
use json which would be straightforward here but you need a libs to parsing it at the flex side or xml flex has native support for e4x instead

1802824
dictionary	arrays
an associativity arrays on the other hand could be called a dictionary or hash

1802825
keyboard	mouse
if you are healthy and can code at full speed with both hands you will be faster with a keyboard mouse

1802829
dictionary	map
containers map mapping dictionary

1802849
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
to get around this you probably want to look into using some sort of signals mechanism such as manualresetevent or autoresetevent to know .when the assignment is done

1802852
serialization	marshalling
however one trick is to defined your session state data if possible as marshalable class struct and serialization that using .net marshalling support this can be very fast indeed but won t handle object graphing

1802874
geocoding	geocode
each map kit application has a limited amount of reverse geocoding capacity .so it is to your advantage to use reverse geocode request sparingly

1802880
selected	button
to access value of radio button and get selected one you have to look at request.form dictionary and find it

1802890
panels	grid
to optimise the user-interface part you could try calling suspendlayout and resumelayout on the grid or its contains panels

1802896
hide	show	fieldset	labels
i want to enhance some fieldset with the option to show hide their contents upon click their labels

1802898

it seems to suggest that all registers are undefined except r0 which contains a function pointers to be registered with atexit and sp which contains a valid stack address

1802916
internationalization	localization
if you wanted to browse on stackoverflow for ideas you could try the internationalization i18n localization and l10n tags

1802927
internationalization	localization

1802930
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this doesn t happen though and i m able to navigate away from the page without any warning at all

1802935
python	php
in php i think you have to do this with nest for loops i do not think there is a construct to do the sort of multiple dimension list deconstruction that is possible in python

1802974
configuration	logging
jboss s logging is handled by log4j and the log4j configuration file is conf jboss-log4j.xml

1802980
arguments	default
default arguments value are evaluated at function define-time but self is an arguments only available at function-call time

1802980
arguments	default
it s a common pattern to default an arguments to none and add a test for that in code

1802996
selected	button
you must return string that will be show to user in a messagebox and he decides if he want to leave or stay on the page by selected either ok or cancel button .so you need to write your code like this

1803015
background-process	restart
i want .some way of monitor this process with monit .so that it can restart the background-process if .something has gone wrong

1803015
communication	messages

filtering	sorting
support sorting or filtering and hash lookup must be enabled by calling

1803021
children	nodes
the only solution i see at the moment is to get the children for each nodes already order

1803022
any	set
if you make a managed clr vc++ project i believe you can just set this in the compiler settings though i m not 100 sure if you need to change anything else in code to get it to work properly you can use the .net code without any com code though you will have to write managed-c++ code this way you can also get the advantages of both managed .net code as well as the advantages of standards c++

1803030
revision	svn
now i want to send the committed revision numbers output of svn status -u also in the email

1803058

1803075
groovy	scala	openjdk	jruby
as a hint testing non-standard jvms j2me android gcj openjdk apache harmony ... and common languages on top of the jvm groovy scala jruby .. should be especially yielding

1803079
data-members	constructor
why is it preferable to have a constructor written with initializer above than a constructor that initializer the data-members within its body below

1803097
contains	set
i have a project that contains an empty database set to be embedded a class with one methods as below and entity-relationship that s about it

1803107
implements	abstract
i want to create a factory for creation of object implements an abstract interface which would return a reference to the object that is kept internally and object are not replicated

1803107
factory-method	singleton
i thought of using static factory-method singleton repository inside and smart pointers reference to the concrete object as returned types

1803110
constructor	object
however if your members are object with non-trivial constructor copy constructor then it s a lot more efficient to use the initialisation list approach

1803113
constructor	object
a constructor is always called for object attributes before entering the constructor s body

1803139
memcached	apc
you want to compare apc key-value store vs memcached right

1803139
memcached	apc
memcached has more functionality but is intended for distribute environment while apc works on single servers only

1803139
memcached	apc
however if you use multi-threads or multi_get with memcached it gets very close to apc performance

1803156
constructor	object	exception-handling	try-catch
in addition the first form gives you the ability to catch any exception-handling throw in the constructor of the member object or base-class that is being initializer by using the function form of a try-catch block

1803156
exception-handling	try-catch
if you do put another set of brackets around the try-catch block it will not catch exception-handling in the memberobject constructor just the try block

1803191
autoscroll	panels
the picturebox is in a panels with autoscroll true .so that scrollbar appear .when the picture is larger than the panels

1803249
scrollable	panels
i believe your instinct is correct but your mistake is to attempt to adjust the scrollbar rather than moving the picturebox within the scrollable panels

1803263
delphi	vb6	delphi	c++
the usual primes suspects then are c++ delphi vb6

1803306
scriptmanager	updatepanel
at the moment i get around this by using the scriptmanager to tell me which button or whatever caused the updatepanel to triggers and then i use that to run the increment methods before it rendering which works

1803319
spotify	last.fm
also the licensing from both likely prevents you from doing what your suggesting your best bet is with last.fm spotify has an incredibly restrictive api

1803325
account	api	administration	account
th msdn doesn t really say anything about this special situtation but the hint this value can be used only if the process is in the context of a user who belongs to the administration grouping or the localsystem account. gives the only logic result that the administration privileges will be used to move the file since the account that called this api might not be there

1803332
required	checked
i al.so set up a validation grouping for the radio-button list .so that should the user hit submit without checked a radio-button the required field validation should fire

1803397
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
also asp.net-mvc does not depend on asp.net webforms they are built on the same foundation

1803403
derived-class	base-class
this is how you create a function in base-class that returns the collections of derivedtypess .when called from an object of types derived-class no magic just generics

1803405
maven-cargo	cargo
use the maven-cargo plugins to deploy your application with the filtering cargo allows to merge web.xml .so you can add the filtering only for the validation test and run a set of basic selenium tests to browse your pages and checked if the little box inject by the w3cmarkupvalidationfiltering into the html page is green.

1803459
any	set
in a report model i have some entities which have attributes which are int set to int datatype but should not be summed or aggregate in any way

1803489

if you are using variables outside the globals scoping you could use getattr with its default arguments

1803499
silverlight	wpf
if you expose your database via a service it creates a really great separation between your user-interface and back-end .so you can write wpf silverlight asp.net winforms user-interface that all consume the same service s if you .so desire

environment	building
the problem is .when building the value for the environment variables declare in the msbuild file mybindir mylibdir do not make it into the properties sheets but seem to be local to the msbuild file only within the msbuild project mybindir expands to d buildsysroot bin but within the vc project mybindir expands to d project bin which is the value that i set globally eg via mycomputer- advanced- environmentvariables and which must stay there because it s how my main development-environment is set up

1803646

maybe you can also keep the value by how much you increase decrease match during loops in an arrays to get another 2 sizewindow speed-up

1804951
innodb	myisam
basically you have three options innodb myisam and memory there are others but i don t really know them

1805164
abstract-factory	singleton
this is much simpler than implements a registry of abstract-factory in a singleton

1805164

in those cases it would have to run the compiler again an outrageously slow process or it would have to also have the interpreter around at runtime anyway

1805172

1805242
.when	ready
and .when the mass of test document is greater than the vehicle weigth - it s ready to fly

1805243
python	java
exactly like in the typical implementation of java or c# python gets first compiled into .some form of bytecode depending on the implementation cython uses a specialized form of its own jython uses jvm just like a typical java ironpython uses clr just like a typical c# and .so forth -- that bytecode then gets further process for execution by a virtual-machine aka interpreter which may al.so generator machine-code just in time -- known as jit -- if and .when warranted clr and jvm implementation often do cython s own virtual-machine typically doesn t but can be made to do .so with psyco or unladen swallow

1805254
memmove	memcpy
as an aside it s important to use memmove instead of memcpy .when the destination and source buffering overlap as in this example

1805258
textbox	button

1805328
reflection	runtime
the default is compile-time which means annotations are available in the class file but cannot be accessed at runtime using reflection

1805339
autotools	cmake
ps cmake is much more powerful than autotools too

1805354
any	set
it is also declare as static which means that any house object that you create would end up with the same set of windows

1805375
asp.net-mvc	webforms
another option - you can make a hybrid application webforms + asp.net-mvc

1805377
instances	destroy
if you are running into a circumstance where you feel you need to open a resource on the class-template and destroy it afterward you might consider the singleton software pattern to have only one instances of that class and possibly also implements the system.idiposable interface to aid with cleanup in addition to the destructor

1805384
jquery	.post
if you re just getting started and interested in unobtrusive ajax with jquery i have a blog .post you might be interested in

1805385
static-classes	static-class

contains	elements	contains	any
i d like to be able to query any of the xelements to see if they contains the elements or below them and return true if .so false if not

1805482
javascript	dom
.so if you need only deep-linking - swfaddress is your choise but if you need extended javascript fearutes like dom manipulations or data exchange with ajax application or external re.source management you can load data from many re.sources at a time or environment control windows size and placement swfaddress can t give you tools to do this

1805486
firefox	safari
i m trying to reproduce the behavior of the search field of firefox or safari or the search field of stackoverflow.com on the top right of this page

selected	checkbox
what i would like to be able to do is to allow the user to click on either the list items or the checkbox s to selected the item

1805594
inno-setup	nsis
depending on your setup requirements you might also want to checkout a script-based install such as inno-setup or nsis which might be easier to create dynamically

1805596
.when	ready
originally the data was in a sqlite db and while the search was ready instantly the search always took several seconds making the user-interface feel sluggish even .when i ran the search in a thread and updates the results list only once the search was finished seconds later

1805611
order	join
join to the people table and then order by the field that you want

1805623

dacl	acl
a good exemple of that simplification are the system.security.principal namespace classes that make it very easy to use acl dacl object which used to be a hell in plain api

1805645
samba	vfs
use alfresco s smb implementation and just expose the vfs as a samba shared

1805646
conditional	parentheses
updates i just noticed that obviously in a c99-like language the conditional of an if-statement would be enclosed in parentheses

1805649
naming-conventions	getter	getter	setter
in this all i assume that your properties and getter and setter are named according the javabeans naming-conventions

1805650
expression	evaluation
i would call that a side effect from evaluation an expression for each row of a query

1805664
output	mode
it is however strange that you only get an empty logfile try to start the process manually either by doing as john is suggesting or the easier one pg_ctl start as the user postgresql as long as the silent mode is not enabled it will still output things to your terminal

1805686
splitter	panels
the control is placed right into the form no panels or groupbox to place a splitter

1805688
filtering	sorting

that s because a html elements can only contains one file as per per specifications - it s simply impossible to upload multiple-files through it

1805790
void	main
public static void main string arguments

1805795
perl	tcl
i ve started a project developer text-editor in a interpreted-language tcl tk and another with perl both are open-source but with some time .when it gets in a beta versioning i will need to distribute it for the users developers of course but i want to know some things about this

1805795
perl	tcl
in the users machine he will need to have tcl tk or perl

1805796
user-input	output
the shortest code by character count to output ulam s spiral with a spiral size given by user-input

1805800
freeglut	glut
for glut just get the source code of freeglut and compile it as a 64bit .lib

1805865
asp.net-mvc	wcf
.so if that is the case then what possible gain could you get from using wcf over normals asp.net-mvc functionality .when you are serializing maybe 2 or 3 k of data

1805869
xerces	xom
must i install xerces to use xom or can i use tag-soup without xom

1805876
handler	service
we ve inject custom handler into shindig to proxy everything to the ruby-on-rails .app using rest service

1805880
value	field
the guid used is the value from the principalid field

1805883
perl	tcl
both tcl and perl can be compiled into executable

1805885
xerces	xom
xom may required xerces to be in the classpath - it may depend on the versioning of java

1805899
python	c++	python	java
and optimization techniques here are very different from what you have with c++ or even java jit - an optimizing compiler for a dynamically typed duck typed language such as python needs to do some very creative type-inference including probabilistic - 90 chance of it being t and then generator efficient machine-code for that case with a checked branch before it and escape analysis

1805905
data-structures	tree
my data-structures class is working with tree

1805906
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
updates question about the unanimous libcurl - does it come bundled by default in major distributions like debian ubuntu gentoo slackware redhat and arch

1805909
perl	tcl
a binary would only work on .some very specific systemd but tcl tk perl runs on .so many systemd .so that would be a really big restrictions for no real rea.son

1805910
selected	checkbox
though it s essentially faked because the checkbox don t really do anything yet checked them does selected the list item

1805912

1805932
coalesce	nvl
you can use nvl or coalesce for that

1805955
getter	setter
for the purpose of databinding i created a bndengineparameters class which encapsulates all the relevant field with getter and setter

1805957
parentheses	operators
variations on that might be more useful to you you might want to have an optional concatenation operators .so you could have or but i d likely do that by constructing a succession of where strings and concatenation them with or line by line in code since you d likely want to place your parentheses carefully to make sure the and or priority is properly execute

1805958
callback	methods
one obvious choice is to pass a callback into each async methods which effectively resumes the calling foo function and then call the callback global at the very end of the methods

1805958
callback	methods
however that makes the code brittle ugly and i would need to add a new callback for every call to an methods

1806024
hide	show
i m trying to show one div and hide other divs with the same class .when a link is click

1806024
hide	show

firefox	safari
.when i play the video in one tab and click to another in firefox or safari the video stops along with the sound click back to the video tab reload the content - as expected

1806033
tuples	any
however the same issue applies on the server side - once it has 64k connections in time_wait state for a single client it can t accept any more connections from that client because it has no way to tell the difference between the old connection and the new connection - both connections are identified by the same tuples

1806035
haskell	sml
small research grouping typically take 5 to 10 years examples sml nj haskell clean cecil lcc objective caml mlton and many others

1806047
updating	updates
you can furter improve the updates scripting to restart the server in case some classes are changed and do not restart in case of updating scriptinging jsp

1806048
shortest-path	max-flow
this is neither shortest-path problem nor a max-flow problem

1806056
installation	building
i have tried going through the tessnet2 demo here but for .some rea.son i can t install the c++ stuff in my current vs2008 installation .so can t building it

1806065
triggers	insert
this query also returns tables with one insert triggers and one updates one which is not what i want

1806084
ado	jet
if you re not using ado and you shouldn t be in an access .app with a jet back end then you don t really want to use jro

1806085
modifiers	final
the final modifiers only means that the reference cannot be reassigned

1806097
buffering	streaming
for example if you are receiving data from a network connection providing a moveprevious would required buffering the entire streaming just in case you called that methods

1806098

selected elements which contains p

1806119
any	set
other than that it s set up as well as any other methods

1806121
continuous-integration	teamcity
we have just move from cruisecontrol.net to teamcity for continuous-integration

1806132
stderr	stdout
the first is the stderr and stdout of the start of the process

1806159
display	width
then given a specific axis width and a specific time interval to display simply iterate over your list calculating how many ticks it would produce and how close the ticks would be in pixels would be if you used that scale

1806183
decrement	increment
if all the runs have length 1 it will create a new replacement string .when it could easily just increment or not decrement or whatever the reference count of the input string and pass that back

1806198
put	get
my question is if i get a month in from a user and a day and i put it into a mm dd format and evaluate it then is there an easier way to checked if the month and the day is valid and after i checked it for being valid i can either printing the mm dd in the format that i have

1806199
double	int
java s numbers internally are always in network byte order even on systemd where the native int double are not

1806205
seam	jsf
but then i read somewhere else that seam transparently propagates the conversation context including the temporary conversation context across jsf postback and redirects

1806224
value	field
value of new field or to add new

1806242
hashtable	set
this means that the uri is used to uniquely identify each taglib in an internal registry of taglib much like a key is used to set get value from a hashmap or hashtable in java

1806276
firefox	safari
it works in firefox and ie but fails in safari

1806325
domain-driven-design	poeaa
.so go ahead and read .some domain-driven-design books and al.so buy martin fowlers poeaa patterns of enterprise application architecture

1806331
callback	methods
i would suggest adding the callback of the load methods to initializer the tinemce editor

1806335
debian	linux
maybe this article geared at debian linux running mysql might help you and save you the pain in having to remove mysql and reinstall again

1806360
.net	wcf	asp.net-mvc	wcf
as a side note asp.net-mvc currently uses the javascriptserializer even though it has been marked as obsolete .post .net 3.5 for serializing json data where wcf uses the datacontractserializer

1806362
value	field
i just made a separate function which sets the value of my hidden field then i bind it to my search-box s mouseover event

1806369
put	get	proximity	distance
the proximity determines .when the zoom will be triggers but you only get to put in one distance -- same for height and width

1806414
difference	zero
my guess would be that there is going to be zero difference in execution-time

1806415
if-statement	loops
if you are bothered by the one assembly instruction this uses inside loops place the if-statement outside loops

1806453
javascript	dom
no frameworks prevent you from learning the dom which is not javascript but a language neutral api designed by committee and different in every browser in infuriating ways

1806453
javascript	dom
in fact they will make it much easier to learn javascript by keeping the dom out of your way

1806464
javascript	dom
but in terms of a real world javascript is always used with things like dom css etc and without understanding it you cannot be real-world javascript guru-dev

1806476
javascript	dom
javascript browsers and apis like the dom have some bad and tedious qualities

1806477
any	set
the object returned by that methods is completely set up and calling any of the client methodss on that class work correctly

1806487
malloc	free
you need to call free once you ve finished using memory alloc d by malloc

1806503
contains	elements
in the else case you remove symp from the list assuming previous actually contains the elements before symp but you don t free it s memory

1806509
put	get
change the output to an empty directory and copy all files that get put there

1806511
binary-tree	tree
are there any object in c# or in .net that represents a binary-tree or for curiosity and n-ary tree

1806524
variables	boolean
i d do a small touch file at .app start to set a global boolean variables useruserhome

1806533
data-structures	binary-tree
the ngenerics project is a awesome collections of data-structures and algorithms including a binary-tree

1806542
javascript	dom
more knowledge never hurts if you have time to learn about the javascript dom methods and experiment

1806584
triggers	insert
however the second event triggers s target anchor does not exist until the first event s methods is complete since it insert the second event s target anchor into the dom

1806605
asp.net-mvc	webforms
please note this is not an asp.net-mvc vs webforms general debate question

1806605
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i understand that asp.net-mvc is not a replacement for webforms and they both have their advantages disadvantages

1806605
webforms	asp.net
i am a .net developer with 7 years on off using asp.net webforms

1806605
webforms	asp.net
i d say i m ok with asp.net webforms

1806628
asp.net-mvc	webforms
but generally server side controls are not usable in asp.net-mvc .so if your project is all about user-interface then you d be better of using webforms approach

1806638
authentication	login
or better use the filtering authentication and return null if you don t want the user to login

1806648
put	get
it would either be a get or a put inline with rest

1806661
contains	any
actually the problem is that in 3.0 nsxmlparsingr is more restrict and it will not parsing any file in 3.0 which contains any error.answer given by yannick compernol is correct.to sove the problem i used libxml2.you can see this link to get the code for the parsing

1806683
bing-maps	mapbox
if you are not wedded to bing-maps you could look into mapbox which provide maps based on openstreetmap in any styles that you desire

1806687
abstract-class	superclass
i have an abstract-class called camera which pointcamera uses as its superclass

1806691
postback	ajax
i have this implementation in asp.net using c# and calling a web service however i want to avoid postback .when doing the table search and i know javascript or ajax is the way to go

1806718
launchd	daemons
at the init launchd a power-off daemons as root user

1806725
interrupt	delay
also there can be a delay between .when you send the interrupt and .when it is received and process by the target thread

1806740
command-line	cmd
if you want to do this within c as opposed to piping something to sqlite3 s command-line program that has those nifty dot cmd then you will have to use a callback

1806741
python	perl
whoever is working on tools or the build-system will typically use scripting languages such as python perl bash batch-file scripting or others

1806741
python	lua
game programmers will typically also use an in game scripting-language that can range from standards like lua python or unrealscript to in house scripting-languages created just for that engine

1806744
java-3d	jogl
java java-3d which has binding to opengl jogl java opengl

1806748
authentication	login
i took this route because i couldn t find a means by which to redirect the client to facebook s login from the authentication servlet if called directly from the entry-point page

1806749
sql-server-express	sql-server
i have bought your book sql-server 2008 query performance tuning distilled and got to know that my sql-server-express edition won t support many of the important tools i will need inorder to run the necessary performance tests

1806759
constructor	private	defined	declare
the only problem with this was that you had declare your constructor destructor private like other singleton but never defined them .so i did that as well

1806795
put	get
i tried to put some cmd to do this before showing the form but i get an error saying the textbox is inaccessible due to its protection level

1806806
profiling	trace
server-side trace are preferred over using the profiling user-interface anyway

1806813
profiling	trace
first sql express supports sql trace which is what profiling runs on top of

1806819
oracle	mysql
the explain plan is also common across other databases - oracle mysql etc

1806823
default-value	arguments
setting the default-value to true allowed me to program lazily without thinking of such error cases and i was able to exchange exception-handling for speed by passing an additional arguments

1806827
cross-validation	naivebayes
i load this .arff file use 10-fold cross-validation no test file and choose naivebayes then i classify the data and it gives me 5 incorrectly labeled 100 correctly labeled

1806828
triggers	insert
because there will likely be multiple-instances of this worker role running i created an insert instead of triggers on the sql table

1806828
triggers	insert
using t-sql i was able to verify the insert instead of triggers functions correctly new rows were insert while existing rows were updates

1806831
derived-class	base-class
in that case if you don t recompile the binary contains the derived-class it s vtable will not be setup properly and the call will start behaving weirdly and as strager said you need to have the virtual-destructor in the base-class

1806855
constructor	object
a couple of examples here would be of a required properties that has to be set in an object constructor but the value is not specified properly or if you have a scenario where a methods should not be called on an object you might want to throw an exception-handling if it gets called

1806861
getter	setter
you have the recursion in properties setter or getter

1806876
python	c++
try nsiqcppstyles a c++ styles checker written in python

1806880
linked-list	nodes
i am using my own created linked-list nodes

1806897
value	field
there is a need to updates one field to the same value in a heap of recording

1806897
value	field
it would be faster to just write the sql updates table set field value where criterion specified

1806901
decimal	hex
i would like to generator 16 char length hex decimal value as sequences

1806903
arrays	loops
i have tried to loops through the arrays using multiple get_object_vars but because the depth and location of the nested object is continually changing i haven t been able to yield desirable results

1806940
user-interface	look-and-feel
it gives programmers who prefer the look-and-feel of native user-interface but dislike the official programming language an alternative

1806940
javascript	dom
you won t be able to use popular javascript libs such as jquery that assume the existence of an dom object

1806940
user-interface	look-and-feel
while web user-interface still lags behind native user-interface on performance and native look-and-feel such gap is being rapidly closed

1806947
pointers	stack
if you pass a pointers to a recording on stack or to a object field you need to make sure it is still valid .when the messages is process which is more difficult for posted messagess than for sent messagess

1806949
database-table	mysql
i have a mysql database-table photos with a column filename

1806959
value	field
.so the problem is .when the field is blank or zero or .some int value that has existed the custom error messagess can be show well but if the value is .some non-int value like a i can not find a way to use the custom messages to replace the default messages like the value a is invalid

1806981
codeigniter	kohana
.so i ve been reading about oop and asp.net-mvc and now i m trying to decide whether it s worth refactoring for codeigniter or kohana

1806991
linux	unix
most of this only works on unix linux mac os x but you can do similar though less convenient things in windows

1807025
show	next
.when i mouseover any one of them i want to show a nother div next to them

1807026
constructor	object
i m a looking to initializer an arraylist of object that are not empty -- the class constructor generator data

1807042
http	ssl
am trying http ssl connection in my c# application...i am getting

1807043
constructor	object
there isn t a way to implicit call an object constructor for each elements of an arrays like there is in c++ recall that in java each elements of a new arrays is initializer to null for reference-type

1807050
g++	gcc
if yes i don t think it s compatible with gcc you have to compile the libs with gcc g++ and use that file or to use a compatible binary if you don t have access to the source

1807061
children	nodes
also a nodes can have any numbers of children with the same named which you can t emulate with an associativity arrays

1807063
zipfile	archive
i use python zipfile module to extraction a .zip archive let s take this file at for example.

1807064
contains	any
change to w+ and it will work for value that doesn t contains any symbols

1807082
directory	folder
to put the native dll to systemd folder i need a post-build scripting to xcopy the file to the directory after building the solution

1807094
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s difficult to give a recommendation based on your requirements - based on what you indicated i think both webforms and asp.net-mvc will do what you want

1807094
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this is the one feature of asp.net-mvc that will make me choose asp.net-mvc over webforms every day of the week

1807094
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in terms of long-term maintainability asp.net-mvc will simply blow webforms out of the water

1807116
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i suppose the wcf serialization could possibly be faster than the asp.net-mvc one but the bottleneck is always going to be getting this data across the wire

1807119
if-statement	loops
after a few runs of loops the processor will be able to notice that your if-statement always goes one way

1807119
if-statement	loops
the compiler has the ability to transform loops and if-statement into what it thinks are more optimal forms

1807120
cvs	git
you need cvs not git to work with separate files

1807133
response	timeout
this way you won t have to wait for the default tcp timeout to see that this ports is blocked by a firewall without any response

1807150

a telnet server is almost trivial to write from scratch the only thing easier is the obsolete rlogin protocols which is still accessible from ssh

1807192
telnet	ssh
you are about to be told i am sure not to use telnet but rather ssh

1807192
telnet	ssh
it s good advice but you have two good choices here implements telnet in open code locally and connect via an ssh-tunnel or use an ssh server to login via a secure channel

1807196
firefox	safari
firefox creates an xml document but safari just create a document .when it reaches this part xmldoc.load it fails cause safari doesn t recognize this .so in the code if the try fails it means that its safari then enters catch and use the right functions for safari and everything else its the same

1807211
click	mouse
i could only think of having a guimanager that always knows which tool is selected then .when the canvas drawing area detection a mouse click or mouse drag it asks guimanager which tool is selected and applies that tool s behavior

1807212
callback	methods
if you need to hide and then remove the elements use the remove methods inside the callback of hide methods

1807221
python	ruby
i see ruby and python answers .so i ll chip in

32-bit	64bit
i even ensured i manually registered the ocx with both the 64bit and 32-bit regsvr32 executable

1807267
32-bit	64bit
first of all c++ ulong is a 32-bit int and becomes uint in c# - ulong is 64bit

1807282
tcp-ip	udp
most of the software we develop has to communication with hardware devices in the local network using tcp-ip udp ip or serial ports

1807282
silverlight	wpf
this is probably the only reason we still target wpf instead of silverlight for our user-interface

1807282
tcp-ip	udp
to create tcp-ip or udp ip connections with devices in the local network without

1807285
digits	zero
however further inspector reveals that numbers that have three decimal digitss in them 500.001 are read from the database in such a way that the string representation of the decimal has a fourth zero digits 500.0010

1807285
digits	zero
since this particular piece of data is defined to have at most three decimal digits the extra zero causes a validation error

1807304
python	c++	python	java
i recommend you look at c++ python and java and figure out which one you like to use

1807304
.when	ready
working in two dimension is much simpler and a lot of the math involved extends nicely to three dimension .when you are ready to advance further

1807306
order-of-operations	parentheses
you don t need all the parentheses but i think it s easier to see what s going on if the order-of-operations is explictily indicated

1807444
directory	folder
if you meant recursively go down a directory hierarchy to delete all folder starting with a certain string then the following might suffice

1807454
selected	textbox
the value of that textbox will be populate based on what the user selected

1807468
udp	tcp
basically i want to know how can i intercept sniff all tcp udp network traffic for some specific application like the tunnel applications do

1807468
sniffing	traffic
.when i start wireshark sniffing which is based on winpcap drivers i see only traffic from step #4 .when it goes to the internet

1807472
irrlicht	ogre
also take note that while xna is a more complete game development framework there are many other available libs such as ogre opengl and irrlicht that cover everything from audio to physics

1807486
double	int
if it was arbitrarily restrict to double s and int s then you couldn t use the templates with a or run a test with a types which supports interval arithmetic even though those typess provide those operators and the matrix libs would be valid using them

1807540
keyboard	mouse
my ddd windows doesn t take any keyboard input .when my mouse cursor is move out of the windows

1807561
lookup	any
you ll still have to do a lookup to access any data in that field .so sql performance-wise for finding the data is a non-issue

1807562

1807639
firefox	safari
it works in safari etc but not firefox

1807672
expression	evaluation
i find them questionable not because i think they wouldn t have any effect but i find them questionable because that s optimizing the 80 of your code where your application spends 20 of its time rather than the other way around those figures are obviously made up but i guess everyone agrees that most android applications don t spend the majority of their time in evaluation loops expression

1807676
contains	elements
i need an xml document contains a mix of xhtml and user-defined xml elements to validation and having trouble doing .so

1807677

if it needs to upgrade several versioning it must run each scripting inorder

1807683
attributes	properties
an attributes is used to decorator a methods properties class .so that you can give an additional extra meaning to that methods

1807683
attributes	properties
if you want that behavior you will indeed have to take a look at a code-weaver like postsharp for instances to weave additional code to the methods properties you ve decorated with an attributes

1807694
contains	elements
either you can iterate through the list with while looking for the necessary elements and return the found value afterwards or you can recursively call the same function on the list which contains one elements less each step and then look only for the first elements of the list

1807696
attributes	properties
this attributes is applied to properties of business-objects which need to be include in search

either have an arrays with a cell for each possible value easy if the cypher text is all lower case characters - 26 - harder if not or go for a map where you pass in the character and increment the value in either case

1807883
contains	elements
presumably whatever is doesn t contains a spaces .so is an arrays containss a single elements .so refers to an undefined offset

1807888
child-process	spawn
i think you can t do that with simple command-line utilities as ie actually spawn child-processes for each tab if ie is not yet running you would get one parent ie process and a child-process for the tab and if ie is already running you would simply get a single child-process

1807890

asp.net-mvc	wcf
you could have your asp.net-mvc .app talk to your wcf layer to make the uis more consistent from a business layer interface perspective

1808319
arrays	loops
.so for example add the events to an arrays in the delegation methods with as little code as possible in there make the arrays pre-allocated block that you loops over using head and tail indexes then every n events deach a thread to process them and have that postback to the main thread with the glview updates value or even better keep a background-thread alive that does the process periodically protecting the data with a semaphore if needed

attributes	properties
what it actually does is read javascript object properties only using attributes named instead of properties named in the few places they differ

1808494
click	mouse
adding event false to the accordion intitialization code will prevent mouse click on the accordion menu from execution the default action and then i can write custom click handling code to run the validation function .when user click on the menu essentially overrides the accordion s built-in click function if the form fails the validation checked

1808494
google-chrome	firefox
works with ie7 8 google-chrome 19 firefox 3.0.3

just use your shell if you have bash 4

1808659
operators	keyword
i need to use the like keyword or some other similar operators for this purpose

1808663

you re using md5 hash but if you look at the linked articles you will see that md5 alone is not enough and one can easily pick most of your passwd back if they have your database

1808748
hash	md5
for a quick test just throw an md5 hash into google and you will see that unless your passwd is really wicked you will get it back

1808757
callback	methods
the base api the example you use seems to automatically insert the callback methods named i conclude from your example .so it might be you need to change the url and append to make it work in the first place

1808771
unsigned	bigint
p_areverseiter- m_value is 32-bit unsigned int while a b are bigint

you either have to aggregate your buildid and analyzed columns or add them to the grouping by

1808814
postgresql	mysql
.so lets make the points i have a generics database postgresql or mysql doesn t matter that contains many generics object

1808814
memcached	apc
memcached around 4-5 time slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touch everywhere in my environment

1808824
filtering	grouping
whilst you are filtering buildid to only be one value sql-server required that it be specified in the grouping by list

1808833

1808874
callback	methods
i m aware that .net does not support methods callback hooks as is common with aop

1808897
account	api
this way you can have a database on the developer s workstation with the test account s api information stored hopefully encrypted in it s local database but .when the code is mirrored onto the production server it will still use the live real gateway information stored on the production server s database without extra code configuration

1808917

1809473
configuration	environment
required configuration environment

1809473
configuration	environment
beware that this will load your whole application environment you should think to use something like app-configuration or simpleconfiguration insert other tool here to store configurationuration then you need only load the tool which process your configuration files

1809503
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera	developer-tools	web-inspector

1809566
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but not in iexplorer

1809568
attributes	properties
of course you need to further tune both the behavior and the appearance of the form by using attributes on the data classes and or properties on the form-control itself but for feasibility studies or for early usage testing it is usually enough and very useful to have it working quickly with the default behavior

triggers	insert
i m toying with the idea of using a global temp table and checked the insert recording set at the triggers start exiting the triggers if the rows already exist in the global temp table

1809803
sql-server	mysql	hash	md5
passwd hashing or any other form of encryption or hashing should be done within your scripting and not through other client-server request ie create passwd hash before sending them to mysql dont do insert-into users value 1 jblow md5 passwd as this query is viewable in logs and by administration of the sql-server

protected-mode	vga
first write a bootloader which will give you full access to the hardware then you can start playing with protected-mode vga programming and .so on

1809835
decimal	octal
the reason phpseclib expects permissions to be represented as an octal value 0755 is cast to a decimal value - not an octal one is because that s how ftp_chmod does it and that s what net_sftp chmod is modeled after

1809931
setinterval	settimeout
of setinterval and or settimeout

1809934
put	get
to get anywhere beyond key you need to perform your checkeded at application level before you put an entity or a change to a unique set of properties you make a suitable query key-only for speed and checked that it comes up empty but that gets pretty costly and hard to make transaction-safe

1809936
htmlspecialchars	echo
the best strategy to avoid the problem is to avoid concatenation text into other contexts as much as much as you possibly can for example by using parameterized queries instead of sql string building and either defining an echo htmlspecialchars function with a nice short named to make it less work to types or using an alternative templating systemd that html-escapes by default

1809937
abstract-class	pure-virtual
my initial approach was to have an abstract-class that had all of these methods defined as pure-virtual and any concrete class would have to implements them

1809980
memcached	apc
look into caching - opcode caching for the php pages and memory caching apc memcached for reference data and other static or close to static data

1809987
create-table	insert-into
this doesn t need to have anything more than the pk column in it create-table nonprop5s pk int primary key not null the key is that the insert-into the parent pktable would always insert a row into nonprop5s with the same pk value except where the properties value was equals to 5

1809987
triggers	insert
you will also need an updates triggers to insert remove the row whenever the properties value in pktable changes to from 5.

arrays	loops
i m trying to loops through an arrays fsel.si and based on the data inside pass them as value not reference on to a numbers of function declarations

1810594

i am trying to set a full width image-gallery to show fairly large images the way that selected by a mouse click image is centered on the page whilst other images are partially show as well as much as the screens width allows

1810753
binary-tree	tree
.so i overloaded the operators of the binary-tree class to use cout tree and ofstream f tree but i receive the next error messages undefined-reference to operators std basic_ostream binary-tree

1810753
binary-tree	tree
edit tree in savetofile is declare binary-tree words tree

1810764
variables	boolean
where _isprocessing is a private boolean variables on your form

1810765
any	set
that way i can set ok to false at any points skip any further code but still have all the relevant cleanup including frees in c as show at the end

1810787
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox the tw cen mt is display great but in ie time new roman is display

1810793
export	csv
they re all ultimately stored as google document .so you can export them into csv excel

1810805
attributes	properties
before .net 3.5 sp1 if you didn t mark your properties with a data-members attributes it was not exposed in the wsdl and not serialization

1810805
attributes	properties
starting from .net 3.5 sp1 the datacontractserializer will automatically include all public properties .so you no longer need to decorator them with this attributes

1810811
temporary	copy
each call to gettiles will return a separate temporary copy of a vector

1810828
background-position	background-image
i m using the css based rollover trick that switches the background-position of the elements s background-image on hover

1810838
binary-tree	tree	ostream	std
friend std ostream operators std ostream os binary-tree tree

1810848
literals	hardcode
no loops no conditional and no hardcode literals output aka divide-and-conquer ftw solution

1810872
crossover	mutation
mutation crossover selection population gene - all this are separate classes

1810882
assign	add
now how can i add the pagerank to the above arrays and assign them to smarty

1810891
filtering	grouping
now my question is how can i take the myuser field and filtering it .so only users of grouping foo show up

1810904
listbox	textbox
i ve done some reading on ajax and would like to create a listbox that controls what is display in a separate textbox located within the same form

1810904
selected	listbox	selected	textbox	listbox	textbox
what s the best way of obtaining the listbox value as well as the textbox value and if your answer is javascript how do i create multiple selected in javascript

1810926
gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals
remember to overrides equals gethashcode and tostring .when doing .so

1810930
listbox	textbox
my approach would be to create a listbox with php and put an onchange event that will call an ajax with value parameter that ajax call will fill textbox

1810941
getter	setter
the telerik controls are based on asp.net-ajax and use pretty much the same coding conventions - public properties have getter and setter methods

1810941
getter	setter
the getter and setter methods are public and you are free to use them

1810943
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
the next messages should be show .when the firs hide

1810963
double	int
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive-types int double and .so on

1810968
triggers	insert
have the triggers insert a row into your outbound messages table

1810968
.when	ready
.when you get all this working you ll have a functioning messaging notification systemd ready for systemdd integration

1810987
aggregate	grouping
another but i think probably worse option is to create a new staging table with the grouping that haven t been aggregate then drop the original and rename the new table to replace the staging table

1811012
callback	methods
without having heard his points i can only assume that he suggests staying away from such things because of the nature of this and how it is prone to change depending on the context in which a particular methods is execute directly upon the original object or as a callback etc

1811033
gw-basic	qbasic	gw-basic	basic	qbasic	basic
then it is likely that he would be able to load it in any of gw-basic 3.32 qbasic quickbasic and perhaps even visual basic and then be able to use this cmd

1811036
revision	svn
remember to ensure your revision control systemd for google s benefit - subversion svn will correctly handle the files

1811059
calloc	malloc
.when using malloc it would be better to calloc instead as it initializer memory to zero instead

1811087
value	field
.when you open that view you ll be asked to types in a lookup value for that field

1811093
any	set
edit i am attempting to make the purchase non-consumable if it makes any difference in how the button would be set up

1811098
variables	boolean
in povray there are no boolean variables

1811108
margins	padding
unfortunatly at least outlook 2007 ignore all background related css-tags and from my experience rendering margins padding totally different or not

1811119
hide	show
actually this is over-kill unless some items are show and some are hidden - if you know for a fact that all items are initially visible you can use the greater-than selector to simply hide items with index 8 and above - as corey demonstrates

1811134
getter	setter
and that the form uses getter and setter methods of the class to work with those attributes

1811134
hashtable	set
the advantage of a hashtable is that you can dynamically change the set of value stored

1811134
getter	setter
disadvantage is that the populate hash instances will probably use more memory than your fixed set of attributes accessed via getter and setter methods

1811134
getter	setter
getter setter should be quicker too - no hashing of the key object is needed - a methods is associated with only one stored value

1811140
textbox	button
.when the user is entering a numbers into a textbox i would like them to be able to press enter and simulate pressing an updates button elsewhere on the form

1811140
put	get
.when data has been put in the textbox and enter is pressed all i get is a ding

1811142
attributes	properties
in simplexml you access nodes using like an object s properties and to attributes as if they were arrays indic

1811176
listbox	textbox
i d suggest you create a form with a textbox search at the top then either a listbox or subform below to display results

1811176
textbox	button	listbox	textbox
you can either add a search button which requeries the listbox or do the requery via the change event of the search textbox

1811186
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
works in firefox safari and google-chrome

1811195
selected	checkbox
does anyone know of a way to add a checkbox or similar .so that a user can selected any of the recording which will then be used to create new recording via code

1811195
filtering	sorting
i prefer to use a subform to a list as it features lots of column sorting and filtering functions

1811201
perl	php
suppose i wanted to have all files named .myexcellentpage to be parsing with php or with perl or as html or what have you

1811206
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
on win32 i wonder how to detection whether left shift or right alt is pressed using perl python or ruby or even in c

1811208
defined	declare
.when you declare and not defined a friend-function within the templates class body you are declaring a free function with that exact arguments

1811208
defined	declare
those free functions are declare but not defined

1811208
defined	declare
.when it finds the call f t1 there are two f symbols that match the non-template declare and not defined .when template_test was initializer and the templates versioning that is both declare and defined at 1

1811219
ubuntu	debian
i use debian and ubuntu .so the main logfile for me is variables log syslog

1811230
any	bag
try the grid bag layout or any of the others and see if you get better results

1811233
onresume	onpause
using onpause and onresume to start and stop the timeout gives me the following semantics

1811234
code-coverage	ncover
one example of such a tool for c# is called ncover for links to this and other tools see code-coverage for c# .net

1811265
attributes	properties
.when i call this custom control i have to put the attributes value in the correct order since the third dependency properties itemtypeidcode accesses the value of the first two keyfield valuefield to lookup data in the database and if they come after the first attributes then their value are empty

1811292
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
use a different scripting-language like perl python ruby etc.

1811316
put	get
all the tables get created correctly but nothing ever gets put in the userfriend table and every user that comes back has an empty friend list

1811318
constructor	object
problem it is bad practice for a constructor to invoke a methods on the object being construct if there is any possibility that it might be overrides in a subclassing

1811318
subclassing	superclass
the problem is that the overrides methods from the subclassing might be called on the object before the superclass initialization has completed

1811323
oracle-data-integrator	pentaho
there is the oracle-data-integrator and pentaho suite open source available for downloading and trial

1811330
xlib	xcb
while another language and set of libs are technically possible i think the best language choice would be c and the xlib or xcb libs

1811330
xlib	xcb
xcb - a 21st century replacement for xlib

1811337
haskell	python
qtile and xmonad are good examples written in python and haskell respectively

1811349
jdbc-odbc	jet
now it could be that there are memory-leaks somewhere in the jdbc-odbc jet chaining where you think you are releasing resources and they aren t getting release at all

1811356
xlib	xcb
you can use the xlib binding for your language of choice or you can use the higher-level xcb binding

1811356
gnome	xfce	gnome	kde	xfce	kde
conforming to these means your windows manager will behave nicely in gnome kde xfce and any other desktop environment that comes along although simply ignoring them is certainly easier on your first try

1811356
haskell	python	haskell	lisp
a windows manager needn t be a huge complicated ball of c â successful windows managers have been written in high-level languages like lisp haskell and python and even some in c have remained small and readable

1811361
affinity	cpu
i don t think its cpu affinity that you have to worry about .so much its how i o bound each process is bound pardon the pun to become

1811367
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
and this control is going to use by both asp.net-mvc and asp.net webforms application

1811378
ostream	std
std cout is an std ostream object .so you have to overload for ostream which takes as an arguments assuming you use from the standards header complex

1811378
ostream	std	istream	ostream	istream	std
takes a std istream object which does the opposite of what std ostream does

1811378
cout	cin
i assumed you wanted to use cin and cout here

1811423
vbscript	jscript
users can write some vbscript jscript code and feed the server

1811430
cvs	git
it s well documented modern ie none of the older issues of cvs and relatively simple compared to more powerful distribute systemd like git

1811437
radio-button	button
assume user has click a radio-button and the submit button

1811442
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc s controls inherited from system.web.asp.net-mvc.viewusercontrol while webforms inheriteded from system.web.ui.usercontrol .so you ll have to have another class shared between your actual .ascx files

1811454
key-value	key
error setting value for key path selectionindexes of object from bound object entity page numbers of selected object 1 valueforundefinedkey the entity nocolpage is not key-value coding-compliant for the key side

1811461
tcp-ip	tcp
if you re using tcp-ip it can do this automatically for you -- see tcp keepalives

1811464
contains	elements
this is an arrays called drink of object machine that is being assign a new elements consisting of an arrays of arrayss where each elements contains drink named and then a float price and an int quantity

1811469
javascript	dom
in javascript you could do with dom functions + regex

1811526
instances	destroy
delegation clients are created and destroy many time throughout the lifetime of the bossofeverthing instances which in fact exists throughout the lifetime of the entire application

1811526
retaincount	dealloc
rather than clientx calling bossofeverthing removemefromyourclientlist from its dealloc methods it call it from its release methods only .when retaincount 1

1811527
redmine	trac
with assembla you also get a copy of trac which will give you a project-management systemd as well though i ve used trac for the past 3 years now i ve since move onto redmine

1811531
oracle	mysql
target at mysql mssql oracle

1811534
factory-pattern	service-locator
this is most like the factory-pattern or possibly service-locator not strategy

1811539
click	mouse
.so if you have a conventional tooltip behavior the tooltip link is going to disappear before your mouse move to click it

1811545
oracle	mysql
assuming you really must cater for mysql oracle and mssql

1811605
triggers	insert
then you can either split it in your application before insert updates or use a triggers or pre-computed columns if your dbms supports it in the database to do it automatically

1811607
instrumentation	profiling
i recommend using instrumentation performance profiling tool that is bundled with xcode and the developer-tools

1811621
value	field
you can also use the calendar class to do something like this by switching lenient interpretation of value off then setting the field and then forcing the calendar instances to recompute it s internal counters

1811621
value	field
this will throw an exception-handling if the field value are inconsistent

1811692
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.1.5 gecko 20091102 firefox 3.5.5

1811720
strdup	free
if you do use strdup be sure to free the result later

1811721
switching	screens
i ve already started with this code as a base i just need to plot the location of hospitals without switching to another screens

1811728
strdup	free
i dislike strdup because it returns a heap allocated string and in the case of your functions it should be clearly documented that the user of the functions has to free it

1811734
any	set
i set up my main form with four controls just button for this example could be any controls you want

1811737
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
to test that paste following in address bar firefox and opera fails while ie8 and google-chrome is working

1811747
stderr	stdout
stdout subprocess.pipe stderr subprocess.stdout

1811749
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
then in the viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods i can use the navigationcontroller to display the toolbar

1811753
radio-button	checkbox	radio-button	selected	selected	checkbox
selected the characters radio-button and pick a character types and then click the numbers checkbox

1811755
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.1.5 gecko 20091102 firefox 3.5.5

1811766
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
surely .when the new view controllers s view is added and becomes visible it will call the viewdidappear rather than the viewwillappear

1811781
wordpress	blogs
here are some sites that i ve done with wordpress that are more than just blogs

1811784
haskell	erlang
haskell or erlang will force you to learn functional styles all at once before you can actually do anything of interest in them

1811784
haskell	erlang
erlang is an honorable language but has nothing comparable to haskell s types systemd

1811784
haskell	lisp
just substitute haskell for lisp -

1811785
shell	bash
using bash shell

1811788
boost	stl
to keep the long story short i am unable to use the containers from the stl and boost libs and have to create my own

1811802
copy-constructor	deep-copy
if the elements types is not a class types or a class types without appropriately defined copy-constructor the deep-copy will not take place

1811806
put	get
.so it ll have slower get put contains operations than a hashmap but to offset this it supports the .sortedmap and navigablemap interfaces

1811810
key-value	key
if you need quick single key-value pair addition and quick single key lookup use the hashmap

1811814
python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
it will be less code than c++ and java for sure to do the same thing probably less code than python or ruby even

1811819
json	xml
you might want to use that data in json xml shell mysql libcurl or html and each will have it s own way of escaping the data

1811819
command-line	cmd
if you are on the command-line you need to separate cmd from data

1811820
installation	building
the ports cmd install the libs for the darwinportss python installation which is different to the framework building .so step 2 and 3 shouldn t work

1811837
keyboard	mouse
i have always used autoit s dll for sending keystrokes as well as blocking keyboard and mouse

1811872
arrays	loops
you could sort the arrays and choose the item at the second index but the following o n loops will be much faster

1811894
textbox	button
im trying out the google-maps api geocoding feature.the map loads fine but im facing an issue with geocoding.i have a textbox on the page where i enter the location and on click the submit button i would like to pinpoint the entered location on the map

1811920
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
possible duplicates what is the difference manualresetevent and autoresetevent in .net

1811920
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
what is the difference between manualresetevent and autoresetevent

1811939
jruby	mri
if you have to run in jruby it seems like it s probably because your sysadmin doesn t want to have a building of ruby mri install .so requiring that to run is odd

1811939
jruby	mri
i would talk to your sysadmin and make sure that it s cool to be running mri as well as jruby

1811953
credentials	account
by the time you get your account you would have time to fix any potential problems and only need to recompile with your new credentials and deploy

1811965
wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt	pygtk	pyqt
there is .so many great freameworks like wxpython tutorial pyqt tutorial pygtk tutorial already

1811980
textarea	textbox
like input textarea in html and textbox in xul

1812017
contains	elements
then the stl uses .so called value-semantics containsers will always contains their elements by value

1812047
filtering	sorting
and if you want more functionality that it offers such as column named databinding support sorting filtering then you can derive encapsulate and add that functionality

1812054
perl	lua	python	lua	python	perl
you could wrap your function declarations into an interpreted-language like lua or perl or python boost has some nice framework for that

1812115
temporary	copy
a better option would be to write to a temporary file somewhere and .when the write methods has finished you copy the temporary file to the original file

1812115
temporary	copy
now if the copy somehow fails you still have correctly saved data in the temporary file

1812115
temporary	copy
and if the copy succeeds you can remove the temporary file

1812118
fadeout	fadein
however then i came across another problem one that i would like the hover image to fadein and fadeout

1812122
margins	padding
ie7 is adding me some mysterious padding or margins on the left and right side of my div#image the gray div and the paragraph in the div#content is suffering from the css propieties of the h2 tag

1812122
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 and google-chrome

1812122
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 and google-chrome

1812135
configuration	environment
testing this is where vms really shine it s great to have different deployment environment that can be set back to a known good configuration and multiple server instances running in parallels to test load balancing

1812145
filtering	sorting
or here linq part 1 - filtering sorting object lists

1812152
realloc	free
i know that memory blocks and reallocation are implementation .so specific but .when there are contiguous free blocks of memory realloc works better than a new buffering allocation and memory copy

1812162
any	set
the one true way to make sure you valid set 100 matches the .net set or of any other third party libs you would use is to fall for the try-catch approach unless of course this third party libs offers some validation methods already

1812175
margins	padding
css box definition in ie7 is different margins and padding count as part of width in newer browsers they are added to width

1812180
double	int
you must unbox value-type such as int double correctly

1812197

your problem fits squarely into the single responsibility principles srp one of the solid-principless

1812228
linked-list	tree	linked-list	nodes
me i d keep the linked-list .sorted at insert time .so that you can always return the first list item in a tree nodes

1812231
rollback	commit
the other session is unaffected i-e it still wait for the lock until the rollback session either commit or rollback its transactional

1812237
silverlight	wpf
wpf have had all the stuff that are new in silverlight 1 2 3 and 4 for a long time and still have more

1812237
silverlight	wpf
as i see it silverlight is and always will be a lighter versioning of wpf for web browsers

1812258
rollback	commit
transactional count after execute indicates that a commit or rollback transactional statement is missing

1812259
boost	stl
i am unable to use the stl and boost libs and i have to write my own containers in c++

1812259
primitive-types	generics
i have not actually tested the code but is concerned whether this generics containers will work with both primitive and non primitive-types like class

1812270
triggers	insert
also avoid identity which can be impacted by triggers doing insert s

1812275
hash	md5
if the hash is different then presumably the query failed to updates due to the md5 checked

1812277
click	mouse
i m now catching mouse click events on textarea elements

1812280
contains	elements
will return a jquery object that behind the scenes contains an arrays of all matching dom elements

1812288
jruby	mri
with small modification to the scripting opening the http-request only once and then rewinding the same data both mri and jruby behave about the same jruby even 2 secs out of 20 total faster

1812302
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu eclipse cdt

1812304
contains	elements	contains	set
i have a classifieds website and .when users click on an ad an arrays elements contains the ad id is set to a cookies

1812304
contains	elements
.so if the cookies arrays contains more than 10 elements i want the elements to be replace one by one

1812316
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
also while ruby borrows a little bit from perl the author disagrees with perl s tmtowtdi principles in favor of the zen of python there should be one ndash

1812318
contains	any
its worth remembering that a solution can contains any numbers of notionally distinct applications as well as the libs etc required to support those applications its just a wrapper - an application service or client in this case is just another project in the solution

1812320
getter	setter
.so the usual way to put stuff on the value stack is to add getter setter for the value to your action class

1812329
reference-type	generics
my generics collections of t should be usable for both value and reference-type value meaning that and should both be possible

1812340
copy-constructor	constructor
all one-argument constructor but copy-constructor should be explicit to avoid unwanted implicit-conversion

1812347
version-control	git
i d use simple things like scp rsync or if the data relates to my application some version-control such as git

1812356
glassfish	wildfly
glassfish payara configuration example can be found here and wildfly configuration example can be found here

1812362
16-bit	8bit
assuming int is 16-bit and char is 8bit both required same spaces and hence the union is allocated two bytes

1812372
32-bit	16-bit
if you did this on a big-endian systemd you would have probably gotten 770 assuming 16-bit int or 50462720 assuming 32-bit int

1812377
selected	button
the main problem i get is that .when i selected a row and click the button firebug complains that skillstore.deleteitem is not a function

1812386
python	c++
i need to provide a c api for the libs for compatibility with other languages like c++ and python and i also anticipate that some sections might need to be written in plain c for tuning performance

1812394
proxy-server	squid
squid is a proxy-server and a web caching

1812395
contains	any
the main execution cycle just checked the opcode of the instruction which is a struct contains union to defined any kind of instruction and execute it

1812404
any	set
you could also remember selectionstart â â selectionend properties just after the click to set focus back at any later points if the positioning might change in the meantime

1812440
realloc	free
same for realloc and free

1812446
.when	ready

1812470
value	field
edit i tried the status field value in all sort btw but no luck

1812474
any	set
just set an environment variables named android_product_out to and then running the android-emulator without any options will run your compiled rom

1812486
url-encoding	url
url-encoding does a similar thing for string value in a url like changing

1812499

zend-framework	yii
i ve seen this being used in many php frameworks zend-framework and yii among them

1812565
double	int
based on the types i parsing them correspondingly cost column in double visit column in int keyword column in string etc..

1812575
python	ruby
and you can even decode the messages with another language say python or ruby if you save them somewhere and want to throw together a html gui to inspect it

1812577
linux	unix
the unix linux sort utility is a good option

1812608
python	c++
you can also do this in jscript or vb dephi c++ c# python etc on windows

1812926
emacs	vim
i have the general feeling that vim and emacs are not the kind of editor you learn by playing with it though

1812926
emacs	vim
in the linked thread responders have essentially answered by commenting on vim often mentioning i m sure emacs has the same

1812926
python	php	ubuntu	linux
google trends seems to indicate vim is the mostly adopted between the two however my first question is knowing that i have no prior experience whatsoever on any of the two and that i use and develop mostly php and python on gnu linux systemd ubuntu arch linux is there any of the two which would represent a better option to start with

is there any points whatsoever in restricting the character set that the customer can use in the passwd - ie am i exposed to any vulnerabilities outside of injection which i am assuming would be circumvented completely by the hashing

1813078
any	set
a bit more subjective maybe but given it is a sha-512 hash - is there any points in restricting the maximum length of passwd that the user can choose within reasonable parameters assuming that a passwd of significant size complexity could raise a warning to confirm that they do want to set it

1813086
python	c++	python	java	linked-list	arrays
for achieving arrays like indexing in languages like c++ java python one would have to overload the arrays indexing operators for a class which implements the linked-list data structure

linked-list	tree
.so you would need a key-value pair for your items and then a data structure that encapsulates the tree and linked-list

1813145
base-class	inherited
that way it won t be inherited but you need to do that for every private properties in your base-class

1813147
jquery	.post
don t let the browser do the .post do it yourself with jquery

1813162
any	set
would it be possible to solve the problem by having your process do a logical delete set a delete_flag column in the table to y and then having a nightly process that truncatedd the table potentially writing any non-deleted rows to a separate table before the truncated and then copy them back after the table is truncatedd

1813183

1813301
base-class	inherited
i concur that typeclasses are even more powerful essentially because like abstract base classes they let you additionally specify useful code defining an extra methods x in terms of others for all types that otherwise match the base-class but don t defined x themselves -- without the inherited baggage that abcs differently from interfaces almost inevitably carry

1813301
haskell	python
after all it isn t as if python has any compunction against borrowing concepts from haskell list comprehensions generator-expression -- python needs a duality here while haskell doesn t because haskell is lazy-evaluation

1813320
arrays	loops
i have the following javascript to loops through an arrays of recording and alert the numbers of matches found within the arrays for each field

1813320
for-loop	arrays
i guess the problem is with the nested for-loop through the tracktitles arrays but i can t see what i can change to make it work

1813332
shallow-copy	deep-copy
you need to make a copy of the arrays but you only need to make a shallow-copy not a deep-copy -- the individual strings don t need to be copy-paste

1813332
arrays	loops
.so instead you ll need to count the numbers of non-null entries first then create an output arrays of the appropriate size then loops through the input arrays again

perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl	emacs	vim
i find myself gravitating toward vim for scripting languages like ruby perl python php and for emacs for languages that are more interactive lisp essentially

1813409
python	perl	python	java
the downside to this is that i believe it depends on java although the site does mention perl python and other languages. in the worst case you could use a specific jetty implementation just for log monitor on a specific ports

1813409
configuration	logging
for the actual logging i m not sure if you are in need of help for that but log4php which is currently under incubation might be a good place to start as it provides you with a configuration that can simultaneously log to an arbitrary numbers of loggers like database file socket etc

udp	tcp
a more complicated mechanism but one that could provide a high performance logging path write a logging service that receives log line via tcp or udp

1813500
subtract	modulo	subtract	add
i believe the answer could be the normals arithmetic average reduced modulo 360 we sum all the value divide by the numbers of angle and then subtract add a multiple of 360 .so that the result lies in the interval 0..360

1813518
solaris	linux
i don t know if all implementation have the n but solaris and linux do

.so first i wrote the query in sql-server and then i checked in google for the corresponding function equivalence in mysql and i just replace those

1814713
stop-words	trigram
some of the better techniques for these kinds of problems do really simple linguistic stuff like part of speech tagging simply removing stop-words and looking at bigrams and trigram and have a machine-learning text-classification component that s not too sophisticated on its own standards techniques like naive bayesian classifiers maximum entropy classifiers support vector machines are pretty much black boxes algorithm-wise and perform well

1814845
any	bag
the game is such that items draw by the player are effectively removed from the bag never returned to the bag or any other bag for the duration of the current game

1814845

for example the game hosts may well know that the pool bag assign to say player x does not include any say letter a thinking about scrabble but .so long as none of the player know this and .so long as the partition into pool bag was fully random the game remains fair and player x still has to assume that his her probably of hitting an a the next time a letter is draw is the same as if all remaining letters were available to him her

1814850
javascript	dom
of course there are things you can do one is to start taking tutorials at html dog checkout javascript html dom in left menu

1814850
javascript	dom
will understanding dom be of more help .when using javascript libs

a likely possibility is that p and q are elements in a doubly-linked-list often called a bi-directional linked-list

1814949
callback	methods
usually endinvoke is called in the callback provided by the begininvoke methods

1814950
callback	methods
pass a delegation for a callback methods to begininvoke

1814950
callback	methods
the callback methods call endinvoke

1814954

decimal	hex
since the passwd is hash it will be stored in the database in hex decimal format

1815133
selected	button	selected	listbox
also consider what h.appens .when no item is selected in the listview you can also checked this by putting a breakpoints on a line that assign selecteditem to a variables and then use the debugger to inspect it after you run your .app and click the button without first selected an item in the listbox in an actual .application you would usually disable the button until an item had been selected but let s not get ahead of ourselves here...

1815133
selected	button
you then checked the return-value to see which button the user selected

1815135
grouping	sorting
report features like sorting grouping joining charts crosstabs form printing etc

1815161

1815177
callback	methods
but if the value of the dependency properties is changed the defined callback methods is not called

1815177

in the case they are needed i have tried to embed project application embed manifest with default setting them but they are still external

1815236
enterprise	platform
if you already got a wtp styles project then you simply just need to install jboss tools and create a server from the jboss community or jboss enterprise platform category the jboss one is the wtp generics server which is very incomplete and deploy your project to the server and it will by default be deployed explode

1815286
lan	vpn
my take is that you d need to connect to a remote lan via vpn passing through a firewall to be on the same subnet and similar ip-address as where the webservice is running on

1815299
contains	elements
every assembly whether static or dynamic contains a collections of data that describe how the elements in the assembly relate to each other

1815329
solaris	linux

but even if you switching the user-agent of lets say firefox to safari it will still use the gecko renderinging engine to rendering it s page

1815339
shell	bash
it s for reasons like this that i migrate from writing shell scripting in bash sh etc. to writing all but the most trivial scripting in perl

1815339
python	ruby
note that other shell-scripting languages python ruby will no doubt have similar facilities and you may want to evaluate these for your purposes

1815372
emacs	vim
vim and emacs are certainly editor that you learn by doing

1815394
protected	public
as long as the member is available in your page at the public or protected level you can push it into your javascript it in this way

png	gif
this works for gif jpeg and png only of course and you may run into some issues like alpha channel and colour .profile problems

1815929
fflush	gets

a most consistent solution is to replace reload with either execute which means not using import in the first place or restart the interpreter entirely

1816449
contains	set
if you checked the row s height after you resize it it is unchanged the actualheight is the properties that contains the row s actual height .when you resize it and actualheight cannot be set because it does not have an accessible set accessor

1816466
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
it s not really nice but at least it does only 1 fork+execve and it doesn t rely on secondary programming language perl ruby python whatever

1816475
postgresql	mysql
compare that to the pentaho stack which will typically end integration with postgresql or mysql

1816475
postgresql	mysql
i can t vouch for how postgresql performs in the olap realm but i do know from experience that mysql - for all its undoubted strengths - has issues with the types of sql that typically crops up all over the place in an olap solution you can t get far in a cube without using grouping by or count distinct

what i m not sure of is whether .is animated will return true .when run against an elements that is being animated via fadein and fadeout

1816637
fadeout	fadein
i know that jquery has a .animate function and i assume animated certainly works against elements animated using that function but will it work with those using fadein and fadeout

1816637
fadeout	fadein
in the end i have found that yes animated matches those elements animated using fadein and fadeout because the jquery source uses .animate to achieve these effects

1816665
specifications	w3c
all the doctype does is to triggers standards mode and is only needed becasue many sites are not built to standards let alone w3c specifications

1816667

ruby php python or c# runtime implementation written in c

1816668

1816695
order	add
it sounds like you have a datagrid types of display and want to add more columns inorder to display the order information for a given client

1816695
listboxitem	datagrid
secondly i would recommend using an actual datagrid control to display rows instead of templating a listboxitem

1816695
gridview	listview
the listview with a gridview built into the framework isn t great .so i would recommend the wpftoolkit s datagrid for a free option

1816705
perl	php	python	php	python	perl	python	java
however python perl and php all beat it .so you are presumably more likely to find employment working on them or on java or c

1816705
ruby	php
since i can t imagine anyone willing doing straight-php work it s safe to assume that all of the php activity is in web programming and in that case it s even safer to assume that all the ruby work is web .app work

1816706
directory	folder
to create a test website on the same webserver you can just copy the entire website into a new folder and set the virtual directory in iis

1816715

just like int numeric limits the limits for float double and long-double are import from the c standards

1816728

the xcode grouping the yellow folder like your resources are completely independent of the filesystems - they don t directly represent directory

1816768
bitwise-and	modulo
this really helps for hashtable because you compute the index modulo the size and if that size is a power of two the modulo can be computed with a simple bitwise-and or rather than using a much slower divide-class instruction implements the operators

1816778
put	get
its funny though once you get around to setting aspectj up its remarkable the numbers of uses that you will put to

1816870
glsl	hlsl
i am not familiar with hlsl but i am with glsl

1816870
vertex-shader	shader
vertex-shader understands vertices to rendering and pixels shader understands textures to rendering

1816870
glsl	hlsl
your only option is to pass a variables to the shader program in glsl it is called a uniform but i am not sure about hlsl

1816871
filtering	grouping
if you added a dropdown to choose the category geographic region product grouping or some other filtering then the user could choose a category

1816910
callback	methods
if the latter the problem is most likely that .when calling the methods this will no longer refer to spz.sequenceeditor but your callback object

1816913
aiff	wav
i sort of cobbled them together to successfully make a small utility that converts a aiff wav etc file to an mp3 file

1816932
arrays	loops
you see it loops through arrays of styles and returns an object of the right styles which eventually gets passed to the animate function internally

1816945
textbox	button
i have a textbox control and a button that says recording keyboard macros

1816954
keydown	keyup
i would suggest using keydown keyup events and capturing the key pressed

it is simpler then your case but show main points defining object with standards __iter__ and next methods and implements iterator behavior including raising stopiteration .when appropriate

1816965
fadein	show
jquery s show slowly show with a duration does a slidedown and a fadein simultaneously

1816973
double-quotes	single-quotes

alignment is a real pain though that s why i only used sse for arithmetic operations add subtract dot-product those kinds of things

1817017
order	add
.so then you can display items from your order list and al.so add a form that will allow the

1817017
order	add
then you can create a new orderdetails object and add it to the order object and then save

1817027
arrays	loops
also unrelated to the question rather than using hardcode value for the limits of loops here 6 and 13 use the arrays length attributes instead

1817033
bazaar	git
the reason i believe that there are none is because the merge algorithm for each scm whether it is git hg bazaar svn etc works on the lowest common denominator which is simply plain text

1817033
groovy	java	python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
it seems like this is simply too big a task for any scm to include the ability to parsing java c# python ruby groovy c++ etc. not to mention that each one of these languages have different syntax between versioning java generics did not exist until 1.5

1817067
dictionary	arrays
why not use c arrays and int rather than what appear to be dictionary

1817072
haskell	scheme
haskell and scheme have the strongest support but aren t web languages and .so far as i know don t have gui libs for the most part

1817075
stax	sax

1817093
dictionary	arrays
instead of a dictionary of dictionary which is really inefficient i d use a regular old c arrays and malloc the memory myself

1817102

attributes	properties
this is built into linq-to-sql and ef with updatecheck properties of the column attributes

1817147
entity	poco
my option would be to go with linq-to-sql with detached poco entities as long as you are definately only ever wanting to work with ms sql-server and you dont required complicated datebase to entity mapping

1817150
rollback	commit
create a unit of work that basically wrap the session and transactional and store that away for the request and commit or rollback .when the request is over

webserver	upload
you need to unzip the file he sent you and upload it to the webserver where the website is hosted

1817196
perl	c++
this is what i originally did not want to do because creating the data-structures in a higher-level language in this case perl was more convenient than having to do this in c++

1817212
callback	methods
as you can see im affecting the custom currentframeproperty dp which has a callback methods that i printing out the current frame

1817212
callback	methods
the completed event does not get fired and the callback methods stops getting called

1817215
gridview	listview
aspx in that case it would be relatively simple to have an aspx page that contains either a gridview or listview which you bind your data in to or you could just generator an html page with the data formatted in to a table

1817229
any	set
i don t think as3 has any way to set the seed for math.random but a quick web search turned up a few results for custom prngs that do

1817245
database-table	mysql
if your only option is to store temporary data in a database-table sessions are unavailable in some environment then i would suggest storing all that temporary data in a table separate from your real data and using mysql s memory table engine for that temporary table

1817247
expression	evaluation
i think these are important things to consider whenever evaluation regular expression for the appropriate tool to process some html

1817248

1817300
base-class	inherited
while we can inherited from base-class interface why can t we declare a

1817315
contains	any
a file named can contains any character--even weird ones likes symbols spaces newline and control characters--so trying to figure out if you have a file named by looking for letters and numbers isn t the right way to do it

1817315
double-quotes	spaces
you should by the way put in double-quotes .so your scripting will work if the file named does contains spaces

1817327
getter	setter
i will suggest first turn this variables into a properties with setter and getter

1817327
getter	setter
then refactor your code to make sure all the places that directly write and read this variables are not changed to use the setter and getter of the properties

1817354
integrated	activation
are there any service that will integrated activation into the installation file or are there any service that are easy to integrated hopefully will take at max an hour to implements

1817361

for example you can create a separate form that will contains a set of editor that will provide the ability to edit a specific object directly

1817526
temporary	rvalue
alternatively if your compiler doesn t support this and you really want to cut back on temporaries but keep the + operators you may want to look into emulation c++0x move-semantics and provide your vector with a rvalue move-constructor which will be invoked .when it returns a temporary by value

1817528
listviewitem	databound
the penny finally dropped that i could use inline-code to doctor my markup on a per databound listviewitem basis

1817538
fflush	gets
your server is calling printing and never fflush the streaming .so the time never gets sent

1817538

1817659
updating	updates
you don t updates lowprov as you are updating low value

1817662
arrays	loops
you ve gotten most of the way there with your second loops but you re setting low to be the first entry in pop before you ve put anything in the pop arrays .so seed the value with .something like integer.max_value

1817690
hide	show
.when using the asp.net-ajax libs i could register a modal async indicator by registering a show methods and a hide methods with the pagerequestmanager

1817697
nsmutablestring	nsstring
is there any way to initializer nsstring to nsmutablestring

1817698
annotations	mapping
as i am unable to make the one-to-many relationship by using annotations one-to-many working in google-app-engine after .so many attempts i decided to manage the relationship manually instead of using the mapping

1817701
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you can set an nsmutablestring to an nsstring but not the other way around

1817701
nsmutablestring	nsstring
this is because an nsmutablestring is a subclassing of nsstring .so it is a nsstring

1817702
revision	svn
the most straight forwarding way to do this is to get one revision from svn which is in sync with one revision from hg

1817702
revision	svn	revision	updates
from there i updates to the next revision from hg then commit it to svn

1817704
contains	set
the list contains a set of category and .when one is selected a separate form is loaded into the deckworkspace showing more detailed information

1817704

.when the user selecteded the printing button they can selected which of the category they want to printing

1817714
derivative	sin
derivative of sin 3

1817714
derivative	sin
derivative of sin 2

1817714
derivative	sin
derivative of sin 1

1817714
derivative	sin
one can only assume that you want to evaluate the derivative of sin x period

1817714
derivative	sine
a possible interpretation is that you are looking for a numerical approximation of the sine derivative and want to recursively narrow the interval over which you are calculating the slope

1817715
selected	button
the user has one simple page where he selected some parameters and pushes a submit button

1817715
panels	grid
the user then has a second simple page where he can now search for his job a searchable combo box sorted by date display multiple field related to that job and then display the data corresponding to that job on the screens - most of the field from the job table started time completed time status etc display as labels in a panels and the actual data we pulled from the 3rd party vendor rendering as a grid below the panels

1817715
private-members	private
it has a few simple private functions and several private-members which are interfaces to classes like iparser ivendorconnection idataaccess - the classes which do all the actual work describe above

1817715
value	field
in the work state i am basically creating these field value as the job progresses - and they should all be private

1817739
python	c++	portaudio	pyaudio
if you wish to use c++ instead of python use portaudio the libs pyaudio is based on

1817743
expression	evaluation
coalesce is an ansi-sql 99 standards and works like a case switching statement in how it evaluates each expression inorder and does not continue evaluation expression once it hits a non-null expression

1817743
coalesce	nvl
another benefit of using coalesce is that the data types do not need to match which is required .when using nvl

1817750
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
do most ie firefox safari google-chrome opera make multiple http request for a pdf file .when display the pdf in a browser

1817752
credentials	account
i would suggest that you use a sql account to login to your sql-server rather than a windows account and place the credentials in the web-config file

1817756
database-agnostic	oracle
ps the traditional way to generator pk with oracle is to use sequencess you could let hibernate guess the best strategy for your database types using generationtypes.auto or force it using sequences but i ll assume you want the resultant data structure be database-agnostic

1817763
bazaar	git
aside from the git vs bazaar issue i identified in my comment above i was able to confirm that you need to escape the parens as in

1817806
bazaar	git
if you are using a local server anyway why wouldn t you consider using one of the distribute revision control systemd instead of subversion git mercurial bazaar

1817807
mapping	unique
i think this will give unique value as long as the hash value of strings is not too huge and that h p.second will give 1-1 mapping

1817813
directory	folder
.when i try to enumerate directory paths under private variables mobile libs it does not list callhistory folder but everything else

1817870
shell	bash
the -l lowercase l tells bash to act as if it had been invoked as a login shell and in the process it picked up my normals path

1817871
sql-server	oracle	coalesce	nvl	coalesce	isnull	isnull	nvl
you might ve noticed i didn t have any left join examples - this would only be necessary if columns from the subquery use null testing coalesce on almost any db these days oracle s nvl or nvl2 mysqls ifnull sql-server s isnull etc...

1817873
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
and that s just parts of sql-server i m sure oracle db2 mysql and most every other player has their own extensions that break the purist relational-model

1817885
show	next
i have implements the following in to one of our sites to show an external link icons next to external links

1817890

1817915
margins	padding
i think i have set all padding margins border-spacing etc to 0

1817938
any	set
go over you code and checked that you retain any reference you assign to field and that you set such field to nil whenever you release them

1817940
order	add
add closingdate getdate to the selected field and order by that field

1817986
ruby	php
just an amusing side note this feels like php yet is ruby from earlier today but the first answer feels like elegant ruby

1817993
ready	live
does anyone have any advice as to how i should structure my pages and sites in such a way that i can keep them hidden until i m ready to go live

1817995
internet-explorer	firefox
as for general profiling i use the firefox firebug plugins and .when i need to see exactly how internet-explorer is failing me the ie8 developer toolbar also has a good profiling

1818017

since mysql doesn t offer a nowait methods like postgresql or oracle does i ve run into locking issues where worker threads hang and wait for the locked row to become available

1818056
decimal-point	digits
d is the numbers of digits to the right of the decimal-point the scale

1818057
decimal-point	digits
.so m stands for maximum numbers of digits overall d stands for decimal numbers of digits to the right of the decimal-point

1818063
decimal-point	digits
d is the numbers of digits to the right of the decimal-point the scale

1818102
selected	checkbox
but now if user selected a checkbox item1 its gets selected

1818102
selected	checkbox
and he tries to selected an 2 checkbox item2 then firstselecteded checkbox item1 should be unselecteded

1818102
selected	checkbox
only checkbox item2 should be selected

1818103
unix	aix
please tell me does sqlplus uses tns_admin variables on unix and aix

1818110
default	reset
types rvm default to reset your ruby versioning back to 1.8.6

1818121
double-quotes	single-quotes
you can fix that by replacing the single-quotes with escaped double-quotes

1818134
32-bit	64bit
the hash output can be either a 32-bit or 64bit int

1818143
contains	set
the below code is contains in a custom-component .so i easily should be able to set different icons per application including the component

1818144
selected	listbox
i know how to refer to the currently selected item by setting the datacontext on a shared ancestry with the listbox and use

1818148
logging	trace
you should al.so trap the service-closing event .so that you can finish process cleanly and include your own logging .so that you can trace what s happening once you get several simultaneous writer

1818151
radio-button	selected
the onclientclick function can checked whether radio-button is selecteded if it is not selected it else deselected it

1818154
postgresql	oracle
b priority is optional - like postgresql like oracle or raise exception-handling

1818155
exception-handling	try-catch
you could wrap the try-catch into a template-function that handles the exception-handling in the event that you do not already have exception-handling in-place

1818158
value	field
for the make i want to display the six makes with the highest popularity...there s a field in the model i m using to assign the popularity of a make with a value of primary highest secondary or tertiary

1818170
triggers	insert
as always your table structure presence or absence of indic and triggers does indeed have a significant impact on your insert speed

1818170
triggers	insert
if you need to load a lot of data it s sometimes easier to turn these constraints and triggers off for the duration of the insert and then back on - but again there s really no way to give you a clear indication whether that s the case in your specific situation or not - just too many variables we don t know about that play a siginificant role

1818173
data-structures	hashmap
hashmap and other standards data-structures do do this in their internal bookkeeping

1818181
expression	evaluation
is it possible to instruct the scala libs or repl to printing out the code paths that are execution while evaluation an expression

1818182
treeview	grid	treeview	expander	treeview	listview	expander	grid
the outer listview and expander is to replace a treeview that was used to have a list of collapsible nodes but the treeview s internal use of grid means the textview items were squashed horizonatlly the same as if you remove ether horizontalcontentalignment stretch attributes

1818189
uitableview	uitextview
i have insert text through uitextview which is in uitableview cell.but i want to increase the height of cell

1818189
uitableview	uitextview
based on uitextview which is in uitableview cell.suppose if it has 4 line one height...otherwise other height...i want to also calculate how many line are in uitextview...and also set height at runtime

1818196
dialog	pop-up
you could also create a dialog as a page and then use a pop-up windows to display it as a real native os modal-dialog but this is perhaps more annoying.

1818200
textbox	button
drag button and textbox onto the form move them around add some labels

1818200
swing	swt
in eclipse you either have to use netbeans instead ie not eclipse... or use ibm s swt or code the swing forms by hand

1818218
uitextview	nsstring
to calculate the approximate size of your uitextview based on a string try nsstring s methods

1818221
nsstring	uilabel
you can calculate the fitted size of a uilabel based on the nsstring content using the uikitadditions category on nsstring

1818221
uitextview	uilabel
you could should probably use a uilabel rather than a uitextview since you don t need the scrolling behavior of the uitextview

1818233
scons	cmake	build-system	cmake	build-system	scons
is a huge opensource rts game that used to use scons as its cross-platform build-system and now uses cmake

1818233
scons	cmake
cmake is in any case one more option to add to those of using a custom building tool or using msbuilding or running the scons building from the command-line by hand

1818257
one-to-many	entity
i can only think of this as a one-to-many relationship in the database but since there is no identity it didn t seem adequate to make the class an entity

1818260
versioning	upgrade
i complained with them 3 months ago and they upgrade passenger on my server the day after .so i could install the current ruby-on-rails versioning

1818280
vb.net	vb6
edit alternatively you can write code in vb6 .net c# vb.net python for automation

1818289
expression	evaluation
evaluation the expression sequences is

pygtk	pyqt
i ve written reasonably large apps in both pygtk and pyqt

1818323
autotools	kbuild	autotools	gnu
i m porting an old versioning of a software that is partly a linux kernel-module to el5 after doing the relevant hacks the horrible gnu autotools mess that is used to compile the thing no it does not compile the kernel-module via kbuild i keep getting lots of warnings including config.h is deprecated - i am told by google-search results that i should be using -i flags instead but cannot seem to find what flags and where i should put them

1818340
32-bit	64bit
also the benefit of generator a 64bit hash from a 128bit 4 x 32-bit numbers is a bit questionable because as other people have suggested you could just use the original value as a key in a set

1818383
serverxmlhttp	winhttp
to put it simple - serverxmlhttp xml + winhttp

1818411
arrays	loops
from the moment that the arrays is not used any more .when you exit loops where you copy from it the garbage collector knows that it can be removed

1818428
javascript	dom
take some time to learn the javascript environment and the dom

1818428
asp.net-mvc	webforms
also .when using asp.net-mvc you shouldn t use webforms controls unless you need to

1818432
any	set
in python 3.x python continue to have a rich set of functional-ish tools built-in list comprehensions generator-expression iterator and generator and functions like any and all that have short-circuiting evaluation wherever possible

1818440
16-bit	ia-32	32-bit	16-bit
it s interesting to note that at one level the opcodes for 16-bit and 32-bit ia-32 instructions are the same except for the prefix byte .so it is more efficient to issue all-32 or all-16 bit instructions depending on which mode you are in

1818460
unique	words
another example is words process where ideally you would have an object per character in your document but that wuld eat up way too much memory .so the flyweight memory lets you only store one of each unique value that you need

1818466
positioning	slider
the two first if-statement to have the positioning within a certain range should be done just before the slider positioning is set otherwise it can happen that the image will be set outside the preferred range

1818475
python	java
the common options are to rewrite in c# asp.net java python your choice but that takes away control from the users

1818482
any	set
i realize i could simply write a windows program that runs a webbrowser-control and my own set of scripting but i don t want my users having to downloading an exe from my webpage or any registry overrides to disable cross-domain checked

1818501
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	opera
firefox still fired the event but webkit opera and internet-explorer didn t although frankly i ve no idea which is correct.

1818501
javascript	dom
is this a quirk of the javascript language the dom or the integration between the two

1818503
return-value	arguments
note that you can even overrides functions in a particular dynamic-scope if you really want to .so you can wrap any function including core functions with another one that say logs their arguments return-value and how long they took to run

1818521
snmp	mib
many other concepts also involve dependency tree such as snmp mib resolution c++ source code compiling

1818532
order	add
add another int field where you manually keep tracking of this order

1818533
callback	methods
whenever a route is encountered the callback methods in the cases above they are static-class methodss is called

1818544
checkbox	textarea
handles radio checkbox text textarea select-one

1818555
credentials	account
passwd are not used while using windows-authentication your client computer credentials need to be trusted by sql-server - this is easiest to achieve for domain active-directory account

1818565
textbox	button
i ve a windows form with a textbox a button and a richttext

1818565
textbox	button
.when i press the button the text in the textbox is used as a paramter to initializer a class like this

1818572
stderr	stdout
the simplest solution to this problem is to redirect all stdout into stderr

1818586
contains	set	show	next
each time a reminder is show to user it would look at repeat_frequency - if it contains directions for repeat set remind_at to next date if not delete archive the reminder

1818590
uitextview	uilabel
uilabel automatically splits but uitextview does not do it

1818598
.when	ready
what does the browser do in the remaining time .when javascript execution takes 250 ms but it takes a second before the page is ready

1818599

the most significant use of doctype is to switching a browser between quirks-mode and standards mode rendering

1818599
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this was originally done in ie for the mac but this behavior is the same in all versioning of ie since ie5 and firefox google-chrome safari and opera

1818624
pagespeed	yslow
there are a lot of things you can do to optimize performance you may use tools such as yslow and pagespeed to analyze the page further and determine what might be worth doing

1818668
click	mouse
problem i am having is that .when a user click on the image with a single left mouse click the image correctly changes the labels is chaged to left click for a fractions of a second then it changes to move even though no moving has taken place

1818673
difference	factors
the difference between that sum and o n is at most a factors of two

1818720
application-pool	was
i was able to extends the stability of the application by tweak the settings of the application-pool i removed the problem altogether by switching to sessionstate which also allows to bring down the application and not lose session state data

1818726
environment	building
my building environment is linux-based

1818730
stax	sax
seems java have some sax implementation like stax i hope it helps

1818742
for-loop	loops
anyway as tom hawtin said it is sometimes better to use the old syntax .when you need to get the current index information by using a for-loop or the iterator as everything you win .when using the java5 syntax will be lost in loops itself.

1818746
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-ajax was designed for asp.net webforms not asp.net-mvc

1818746
asp.net-mvc	webforms	asp.net-core	asp.net-mvc
in the same way that you can hack get webforms controls to work in asp.net-mvc because it s still built on the asp.net-core you can also get asp.net-ajax to work in asp.net-mvc - but the real points is this

1818755
average	minimum
if i were the person assign with the unenviable task of providing an estimate to completion for a project being managed as arbitrarily as in the original .post i d try to figure out a range based upon the minimum numbers of folks assign 48 to 66 weeks given 2 developers 50 to 80 confident and a range associated with the average numbers of folks assign 25 to 45 weeks with 5 developers 50 to 80 confident and use the low figure from the average numbers along with the high figure from the minimum numbers 25 to 66 weeks given anywhere from 2 to 5 developers 50 to 80 confident and even then i d put a disclaimer on it plus 10 for the lost time due to context switching

1818757
margins	padding
if you have margins borders of padding applied you might have to adjust the value which is subtract for example

1818809
quirks-mode	doctype
you can use pure css height 100 where 100 is the height of the visible area in the windows value in quirks-mode by not using doctype at all or using ie-faulty html 4.0 doctype without the .dtd url

1818816
hide	show
what you might want to do is contains the image you wish to hide in a and show this div after the page and all of its content your screenshot image include has loaded ie

interpreter	runtime
please note that not all ms windows-applications interpreter the command-line the same way list2cmdline is designed for applications using the same rules as the ms c runtime

1818902
contains	elements
i would probably try with a sequences first since then you won t have to quote all the elements that contains spaces list2cmdline does that for you

1818920
selected	textbox
the selectionstart properties on a textbox will determine where text will be selected or insert from

1818927
contains	elements
and if i types b then the new list only must contains abcd and bbbb instead of contains everything and being selected abcd which is the first elements which matchs with b

1818936
apache-config	.htaccess
it doesn t have to be in the .htaccess if it will work i could put it in the apache-config but not sure if that will work

1818948
getter	setter
ok that way now a can setter y getter the options of my plugins once instances

1818986
g++	gcc
in my opinion the best way is to symlink gcc g++ to ccache but if you would like to use within cmake try this

1818989
tunnel	vpn
is it possible to set up vpn server or perhaps another proxy-server on either my mac os x machine or a debian box to tunnel all the incoming connections from my iphone through the paid proxy service

1819023
sftp	ftp
i have an application where i need to store 3rd party credentials to service like amazon-s3 ftp sftp etc

sftp	ssh
if our customers gave us access to their s3 buckets via acl we would still need to verify which bucket belongs to which user same goes for sftp and ssh key auth

1819027
debugging	trace
trace.assert works the same way except that the compilation constants that must exist is trace which by default exists in both debugging and release configuration

1819030
user-roles	userid
each user can be in lots of roles .so there is a middle table called user-roles that simply contains a roleid and userid

1819037
constructor	object

1819056
hide	show
.so my question is how do i disable the button that hide show the toolbar in ckedtor 3.0

1819070
conditional	parentheses
.so you d need to enclose the true conditional in parentheses

1819070
numeric	digits
is for numeric compari.sons and yes being a string not beginning with digits has a numeric value of 0 .so the conditional is almost always going to be true

1819084
stateless	stateful
the web application is by nature stateless .so even if your users should login it does not make the application stateful

1819087
contains	elements
you also need to make sure the contains elements probably the body has the height of the view ports

1819106
positioning	slider
how do i force the slider in the trackbar to be in the leftmost positioning

1819112

callback	methods
if the data is valid and expected use the clientscriptmanager.registerforeventvalidation methods inorder to register the postback or callback data for validation

1819224
implements	abstract
the most obvious way might be to have an abstract base methods bool validation that is implements by the subclassing

1819236
unsigned	short
unsigned short int and unsigned int 0 to 65 535

1819246
hide	show

data-access	nhibernate
i d also add that both nhibernate and linq-to-sql and probably all other orm-related data-access methods make the use of enums very enticing as they let you map a discriminator column transparently in the mapping

1819257
value	field
field value will return null

1819278
loading	gif
the search image is on one line and the textbox and loading gif appear on the next line

1819329
emacs	vim
maybe a good way is to learn vim emacs while using eclipse

1819337
where-clause	sql
normally .when i sql inject somewhere i use one of these as my always true statement for passing throgh the where-clause after ending the former string

1819355
arrays	loops
no you have to iterate over the arrays with a loops

1819371
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
for any reason this works perfectly on iexplorer 8 but doesn t on firefox safari nor google-chrome

1819385

1819465
selected	button
.when he click on that close button there is a .post form from where the parent windows should get the selected value

1819470
contains	any
the load test if it contains wide enough timing windows and a rich use of the work flow may also catch any deadlock you ve created

1819473
python	java
unlike in java in python a file named file.py does not necessarily contains a class called file as you might expect if this was a java file named file.java

1819473
python	java
in python a file is a module which is really just a namespace more comparable to a java package than a java class and not a class

1819483
simpletest	phpunit
is there any easy php testing framework and may be simpler than simpletest and not command-line based like phpunit

1819495
value	field
if most of the methods of your object operates on most of the object s field then the object is small enough for a given value of most

1819509
cout	cin
it will ignore my cout and cin usage everywhere in the code .so i can t even debugging it

1819517
getter	setter
with this syntax it s easy to figure out what is happening but it is not a standards setter and conflicts with margins getter

1819517
getter	setter
for me it is obvious the methods is a setter but this time i cannot set multiple value with just one call and there s the problem with getter again

1819538
contains	elements	contains	set
get a set of elements contains all of the unique immediate children of each of the matched set of elements

1819548
contains	elements
if it might contains more complicated text and elements nodes you d have to iterate over them to pick up the text or use the dom level 3 core textcontent properties with backup for ie which doesn t support it

1819551
implements	extends
you might have fancy knobs lockable knobs etc which can all be implements by extends your base doors knob

1819555
json	xml
it can issue a request to the server and after completion of the request response can be read in javascript in many formats like html xml json

1819559
average	max	average	min
you should use the best guess which is a function of the min and max estimates - not just the simple average -

1819585
arrays	map
matchdata#begin 0 returns the index where the match begins and since we used map on the enumerator we get an arrays of those indic back

1819605
contains	set
to ensure you get results .when there are no matches in the tbvebdorbiddetails table you ll need to use a left join which ensures the final result set contains a row from the leftmost table in the join even if there s no match from the rightmost table

1819615
quirks-mode	doctype
notice the chage in doctype i used html5 doctype here for simplicity s sake as it triggers standards mode in all browsers be sure to always use standards mode doctype unless you re preparing do deal with the hell of quirks-mode

1819621
savepoints	rollback
they just create a savepoints and does rollback for each test

1819625
linux	unix
you can use clock_gettime on linux or gethrtime on some other unix systemd

1819629
joomla	drupal
i will go with wordpress joomla and drupal on the runner up list

1819639
constructor	object
then creating the object and passing all data to the constructor

1819661
profiling	trace
i used sql profiling trace to compare time of execute queries

1819668
primitive	int
sometimes you just use a primitive variables int to represent an object and sometimes you create a data structure struct class

1819680
contains	elements
but it looks like rand is getting evaluated only once and my arrays is contains the same value for every elements

1819691
boolean	int
in theory you should make object pretty much everything until you fall down to the smallest possible elements the primitive-types boolean string int etc

1819695
selected	textbox
selected a in flagbox2 will result in labels #3 display default otherwise the text from the textbox is display

1819700
odt	odf
edit basically i want a libs that can generator odt files from odf files acting as templates and a libs that can convert the result into pdf which is probably the crux

1819704
nhibernate	ado.net
without dropping in a nasty misc db class that forgoes something like nhibernate to manually use ado.net to do these types of operations what are some other standards approaches from the oop crowd

1819705
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
python and ruby seem to be a relatively painless transitions to from php

1819733
directory	folder
i want to list all these directory and sort them in which they have created in the pc and copy the latest directory contents to batch_latest_lib_files folder that will be a new folder created by this batch-file.i want this new folder to be created in the path where this batch-file is present

1819742
value	field
if whenspecifiedmustincluderecordwiththisid.hasvalue is true it verifies whether the value matches the id field

1819782
put	get
get rid of the linq and put old stored-procedures

1819786
ruby	php
i d second learning ruby plus optional ruby-on-rails if you want to do web apps - it s a very nice language and quite an easy transitions from php

1819787
python	ruby	python	java
this means that with good java skills you ll be likely to find more easily a better job more .so than with python or ruby skills disclaimer this can of course vary between regions and countries this was the case in my area

1819794
perl	php
then i discovered perl and i never looked at php again

1819794
perl	php
perl like php was dynamically typed but far more modular

1819794
perl	php
running a perl scripting from the command-line was far quicker than php which needed all possible libs loaded - perl permitted me to choose what extra functionality i wanted at runtime keeping simple scriptinging light-weight

1819825
decimal-point	digits
imagine if you were converting a double into a string you could allow 2 digits after the decimal-point or none these will give you different strings

1819831
click	mouse
one of the great things of using linq if not the only one is that refreshing the model only takes a mouse click whereas in the old days with stored-procedures it could take hours to propagate a schema change through the various persistent and data layer

1819844
textchanged	textbox
for checked the text entered in a textbox you might want to use the textchanged event which is triggers only after the textbox loses focus

1819847
callback	methods
callback that don t get passed any context have to call a class methods of your objective-c part anyway

1819853
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox it s ok

1819870
mouseover	mouseout
i ve had this problem .when i ve added a mouseover and mouseout on a div which showed a div which covered the div which had the mouseout event set

1819870
mouseover	mouseout
if .so then .when the div show it will fire the mouseout event and then end up in a loops on mouseover and mouseout until you truly move the pointers out

1819946
arguments	default
without any arguments the default is head

1819960
credentials	account
in the scripting it specifies options for a api-key passwd account # and meter # - .so i would have to actually know the site owners credentials since it charges for creating shipments labels i can t use a normals account that doesn t have a cc setup can i

1819961
python	ruby
if you want to learn a new language to do your day-to-day work more effectively i would suggest python or ruby

1819961
ironpython	ironruby
as .someone else has pointed out there are versioning for both the jvm jython and jruby and for .net ironpython ironruby .so if you want to learn either of those platform they are a good way to start

1819969
python	php	python	java
as far as i know java is much faster than it was in the past what about python php etc

1819992
textbox	button	contains	elements
the combobox is composed of a textbox a pulldown button and somewhat a table elements contains the list

1820009
compact-framework	.net
however the framework is the full .net versioning not the compact-framework

1820009
compact-framework	.net
one as the full .net versioning and another as the compact-framework versioning

1820025
directory	folder
i m trying to design a program in php that would allow me to find files with specific file extensions example .jpg .shp etc in a known directory which consists of multiple folder

1820062
default	reset
i ran it through a debugger and it does go into the if clause correctly but i still get redirected to the default firefox error page with the messages the connection to the server was reset while the page was loading

1820086
deep-copy	object
deep-copy will create another copy of the object and the data

1820088
any	set
and you must set and anchor for sorting in my example i used _rowid but any other field can do the job

1820094
value	field
you can create a new object on the heap and copy the value of the original object properties and field into the new object

1820130
contains	any
at the very least it contains some startup code setting up the environment and if necessary loading any external libs before the program launchd

1820134
xsd	xml
you can validation xml data against xsd

1820134
xsd	xml
you can easily provide contracts as xsd to other parties that should either create consume xml data without literally describing them

1820134
csv	xml
xml is arguably more readable than csv

1820145
value	field
csv is useful .when you just have a series of a value that relate to some piece of information and you know you will always store value for each field

1820147
csv	xml
csv is more lightweight if you want to move things about since its normally 2 more time smaller than xml

1820147
csv	xml
xml is standards and won t be hit by different os es versioning of csv

1820152
csv	xml
this daily wtf xml vs csv the choice is obvious will help you make your decision

1820154
ebnf	bnf
you would consider using a lexical analyzer because you could use bnf or ebnf to describe your language the grammar declarative and then just use a parsing to parsing a program written in your language and get it in a structure in memory and then manipulate it freely

1820174
g++	gcc
i was wondering if there is some compiler parameter preferably in gcc g++ which treats the lack of try-catch blocks as errors

1820178
csv	xml
xml provides a way of tagging your data with metadata provided by the tag named and attributes named whereas csv does not

1820178
csv	xml
couple this with the ability to defined structured hierarchies and it makes xml easier to understand .when provided with just the data whereas csv would required an accompanying tool or document to describe how each value is interpreter

1820180
csv	xml
the advantages of xml over csv

1820180
csv	xml
xml vs csv

1820180
csv	xml
xml vs csv the choice is obviou

1820200
csv	xml
given that there is only one csv language not count the myriads of delimiter styles xml can handle quite a lot of complexity and that in a modular way

1820200
csv	xml
this however is the advantage of csv if you really have tabular data xml syntax is most often overkill

1820234
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in firefox safari and google-chrome it works normals

1820249
postgresql	mysql
sql mysql postgresql sqlite dialects

1820295
fault-tolerance	scalability
the way you program should not suddenly change to accommodate fault-tolerance and scalability

you d need a set of procedure triggers for insert deleting rows as flag states change

1820345
csv	xml
receive the response one of the options to be returned is csv or xml

1820346
firefox	safari
the function below works fine in ie and does what i expect it to but in any other browser firefox safari it doesn t do anything am i missing something or do i have a syntax-error

1820351
any	set
i looked for a way to set a base_url but can t find any

1820358
tuples	any
any other ones that you create or get from third parties can be added at the end of the tuples above

1820375
value	field
whenever the user click one of these textbox the value in all of the other controls will be cleared .so i don t see how the user would be able to fill out the whole thing unless these field are mutually exclusive and the user is only supposed to enter data into one of them

1820376
populate	row
the load and display of collections in the gridview works perfectly however .when i click updates after click edit to edit a row the value collections which comes through as the second parameter to executeupdates in my datasourceview is populate with the old value as is oldvalue collections

1820379
value	field
the usual approach i take is to create a search view or calculated column using a triggers that puts all of those value into a single field

1820380
firefox	gecko
i believe firefox is supposed to be in the firefox ua string on ubuntu...but i know for a fact gecko is in the string as that s the rendering engine used

1820384
contains	set
i have some dynamic text contains in a div that is set to whatever a user enters in a textbox field

1820391
google-chrome	firefox
with firefox in google-chrome mode browserid google-chrome instead of firefox this works as expected

1820397
csv	xml
i don t have enough reputation to comment on the relevant answer but someone suggested compression the xml as a way to gain size parity with csv formats

1820409
quicktime	vlc
your alternatives are quicktime for java and systemd wrapping mplayer vlc etc

1820411
panels	grid
as the item is selected in the grid you can edit the details in the detail panels below and presto as you tab off the field in the details panels the updates are show â œreal-timeâ in the grid data

1820412
standard-library	boost
the c++ standard-library has access to these functions as well without using boost

1820460
.when	ready
our custom loadimg function accepts a callback that fires .when the image is ready

1820460
document-ready	ready
of course it goes without saying that you wanna do this after the dom is ready .so document-ready is your friend and all that jazz

1820460
.when	ready
perhaps i should ve specified this in my earlier answer but in this case it s better to do all your dom-manipulation in the image s callback .so it fires .when the image is actually ready

1820465
function-handle	cell-array
you first get the function-handle from the cell-array then call it using parentheses as you would any other function

1820466
subclassing	base-class
.when you extends it twice in the base-class and in the subclassing you are not import two versioning of order

1820479
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i had to do same thing year ago and found that even internet-explorer from versioning 6 opera and safari can do it but no firefox

1820480
google-chrome	safari
it currently works in ie versioning 6 and up as well as safari and google-chrome

1820492
placeholder	required
is really only required .when you use false as a placeholder value and in practice this is rare

1820500
subnet	ping
i want to try to ping all subnet of a wireless network at my school from the subnet that i am connect to

1820500
subnet	ping
.so suppose the network has 4 subnet a b c d and i am connect to a i want to try to ping at least 1 computer in subnet b c and d

1820500
subnet	ping
once i have finished ping i want to connect to the next subnet b and repeat this process until i ve connect to all subnet and tested all the other subnet

1820503
triggers	insert
once the information is insert in the tables of the 2000 server some instead-of triggers are fired to process this information

1820507
base-class	inherited	base-class	accessor	inherited	accessor
my standards methods is to make a singleton class that acts as the database accessor and a base-class that everything requiring such access inherited from

1820529
put	get
you may well find that in lots of cases you get out the first key that you put into the dictionary - but you absolutely must not rely on that

1820537
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the background-image rendering fine in ie and firefox but on webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari the background-image only partially rendering .when the page is initially loaded

1820538
contains	any
il code doesn t contains any box instructions

1820540
base-class	inherited
there s also a base-class collections of types baseobjectcollections which inheriteded from and some other collectionss that inherited from it taskcollections baseobjectcollections

1820544
constructor	private	instances	private
you can make the true constructor private or protected .so that outside code can t misuse it by creating additional instances

1820584
instance-variables	accessor
i have two instance-variables that have accessor created via properties

1820603
value	field
but if i change the types to hidden and set the value of field using then try to read the value using it returns

1820618
attributes	properties
i head to set the properties attributes to the action which should get the custom data

1820657
python	c++
though there can be many but as i am very new to python .so which modules or classes within standards libs i should know .when programming in python especially .when i am practicing programming challenges from a c++ book

1820666
reflection	runtime
the reflection namespace represents static data about an assembly and you would need to retrieve value at runtime

1820722
put	get
i get an error .when i try to put in a date elements inside a fileset

1820749
versioning	upgrade
overall i d like to be able to release new versioninging of my libs and have a simple upgrade process for any project using the older versioning

1820752
excel-vba	vb6
to be able to send messages easily from excel-vba and vb6

1820769
user-input	output
if it s important to display special characters from user-input like on stackoverflow for example then you ll need to store this information in the database and sanitize it on display - in this case you ll want to at least use htmlspecialchars to display the output if not something more sophisticated

1820828
user-input	output
htmlspecialchars on every text-to-html output step whether that text came directly from user-input or from the database or from somewhere else entirely is the right way to achieve this

1820831
radio-button	selected
the getselectedvalue methods simply returns a string checked for the radio-button to be selected lets say the repeater had 3 items to loops and .when the markup rendering and if i inspect the elements i see the correct value for the first radio-button checked checked but on the user-interface the 3rd radio-button gets selected even though its checked value false can someone guser-interfacede me as to what i am doing wrong

1820843
highlight	selected
i am using the jquery treeview plugins and i would like a know how i can highlight identify the last selected nodes

1820844
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
i would say use xml and or json because someday you or someone with a short temper and a large gun collections may have to go find an error in the csv data

1820864
decimal-point	digits
int float bcd - 4 bits per digits use 15 as decimal-point

1820864
16-bit	8bit	32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit	double	int
or just the raw bits themselves might want different datatypes for 8bit int 16-bit int 32-bit int 64bit long 32-bit float 64bit double

1820869
jms	jta
spring does not attempt to replace certain advanced parts of the javaee specifications such as jms and jta

1820869
jms	jta
if your application required the power of the likes of jms and jta then you can easily use them via spring

1820883
google-chrome	firefox
as a side note i think this is unnecessary micro-optimization and you should probably look elsewhere for performance improvements ie .profile the scripting through google-chrome s developer-tools or firebug for firefox or similar tools and look for slow long running call functions

1820898
highlight	selected
i want to submit part of a textarea user has entered multiple line and selected one line either by highlight or by placing the cursor on the line

1820898
selected	button
if user press the submit button then i need to get the line or words user has selected

1820903
put	get
holder.compareandset is put in a while true loops .so that if the value did change before you were able to write it then you get a chance to read the value again and re-try your write

1820905
selected	button
excuse my lack of html knowledge but is it possible to set up a set of say 3 radio button .so that each one links to a different selected list of items

1820905
radio-button	selected	value	field
i m kind of hoping there is some plain easy way to link the radio-button to each selected list but i can in the worst case imagine just having the appropriate selected list place its value into the radio-button s value field via a javascript methods

1820910
filtering	grouping
we can grouping by action diff find max and min within the groupinging and filtering on them

1820916
archive	backup
archive logs are used during recovery from a backup - the backup is restored then archive logs are applied to the backup to bring the database back to it s current state or some prior points in time

1820925
python	c++	data-structures	dictionary	tuples	set
actually to work problems from a c++ book using python you mainly just need to master python built-in types especially the data-structures tuples list set and dictionary

1820931
contains	elements
pltlist 1 is a list contains the first elements of pltlist

1820947
selected	button
user selected one of the button

1820947
selected	button	hide	show
then add a javascript event to the radio button to show the selected one and hide the others if necessary

1820970
base-class	inherited
my only concern with this approach is that whom ever creates a new controllers will have to inherited form the base-class

1820974
credentials	account
try setting the credentials explicit to a user account known to have the required access

1820997
contains	elements
if probs contains fewer than 100 elements you ll get that exception-handling for trying to read past the end

1821008
lighttpd	apache
hi guys after this question i ve started to use lighttpd for a long-polling service on my server inorder to not to nuke apache and the database forn this kind of request

1821008
lighttpd	apache
.so actually i have example.com served by apache and polling.example.com served by lighttpd both using memcached to reduce the database hits

1821008
lighttpd	apache
now im wondering if there is a way to retrieve the apache server load in php inorder to redirect even other ajax request on lighttpd if apache have an high-load

1821025
account	userid
as far as i can tell from looking at code you have two tables in your database- one for baseaccount which only stores userid and account which stores all field associated with account + baseaccount id

1821039
hide	show
you can use css to hide the #command div until you want to show it

1821039
hide	show
then use blur focus to show hide the #commands div

1821045
arrays	loops
just wondering if there is any way of checked if value a is equals to any value within an arrays without using large loops functions - sort of like a where function

1821047
google-chrome	firefox
.so far i ve tested this in firefox 3.55 ie 8.0.6001.18702 and google-chrome 3.0.195.33 with similar results

1821048
gtk	x11
it has the gstxvimagesink that is capable of renderinging video using x11 and you should be able to configure it to rendering on top of a gtk widget

1821073
order	add
contract work to our erp vendor to add a special feature for this order process are you kidding me

1821074
highlight	cell
in excel it is possible to highlight a range of cell and view the sum in the status bar

1821079
localization	translation
not to mention that localizing your .app will merely be a matter of translation which is the best-case scenario not mentioning other localization issues like currency which is a whole separate issue

1821088
compact-framework	.net
i m developing a windows-mobile 5.0 and above application with .net compact-framework 2.0 sp2 and c#

1821100
selected	cell
if you implements the behavior of selected the cell sure why not

1821100
selected	cell
one approach to do this would be to set each cell of the table td with the class selected and .when you wish to sum the value just go over the table s td tags read their value and display the result wherever you wish

1821100
selection	cell	mousedown	mouseup
a more sophisticated and advanced solution would be to use the mousedown mouseup to emulate the multiple cell selection behavior of excel but this too shouldn t be too hard to implements

1821104
subtraction	time
calculate offset between application s time zone and utc and add it manually after automatic subtraction in the calendar.settimezone

1821114
value	field
but it doesn t work like in javascript using onchange and the value properties of the field - it seems that the value properties contains the original user-input not what he chooses from the autosuggest list

1821114
value	field
for the life of it i can t find out how to copy the chosen autosuggest value to another field using javascript

1821126
click	mouse
the best way is to right your own mouse button handler with a timeout - if the event is fired again within the timeout period then fire your doubleclick messages otherwise call the single click handler

1821127
linux	unix
i m assuming you re using linux or a unix

1821131
selected	cell
for the last one to make it work you ll have to actually disable text selectedion using onselectedstart event and then use events to programatically selected certain cell in your value column

1821153
duplicates	contains
one of the plugins contains copy-paste code from the main application .so contains symbols named that are duplicates to those in the engine

1821165
value	field
foo in this case is a table in the db with two field - a numeric and a text value

1821166
radio	click
what i am trying to achieve is that .when ddlbuyer is click radtopx has all it s radio button unchecked

1821180
external	embed
use an external javascript file and embed it once - put all the javascript you required in it

1821201
hide	show
i want to hide remove the whole div id twittertrackbackswrapper .when there is nothing to show on a div class twitter-trackbacks

1821205
selected	textbox
from an html points of view i would suggest having an associated textbox which populate the value initially set and then change the value .when the selected list changes

1821211
scanf	feof
you should always checked the result-of the call fscanf sscanf scanf etc. for success before checkeded feof or ferror and you should never make feof loopss test conditional since it won t return true until after you ve attempted to read past the end of the file your loops will always execute once too many time

i would instead write a button class that had positioning width height etc then you could write a methods that returned if the mouse was click not requiring any hard coding which you should avoid at all costs

1821441
click	mouse
if you want to implements a very basic and non-flexible gui you could detection mouse click like this

constructor	object
is it possible in c# to create an object of generics types with non-parameterless constructor

1822046
any	set
i find that if you use a plain old pencil and some graphing paper or a whiteboard that you can easily figure out a basic set of tests before you even write any code

1822077
arguments	default
the way hash.new with a default arguments works is if you do it checked whether that key exists in the hash

1822085

this is a rather simple example and it won t switching the show more to hide more but you should be able to figure that out from the context

1822139
configuration	upgrade
this is in part necessary to allow for in service upgrade adding newer machines that may or not be of the same architecture as the starting cluster configuration

1822143

1822263
checkbox	button
i d like to disable the submit button if the agreement checkbox isn t checked individually for each form

1822263
selected	checkbox
you can see that the code runs at page ready selected all the form s on the page and attaches a click handler to each of the agreement checkbox within each form

1822263
checkbox	button
what i ve struggled with and what looks particularly inelegant is the methods of getting from the checkbox object that triggers the click event back to the parent form object and then to the sibling of the checkbox submit button to disable it

1822271
xsd	xml
i generally use the xml functions xmlelement xmlforest etc. because i have control over the xsd

1822388
arrays	loops
loops over the item arrays

1822420

profiling	trace
profiling allows you to monitor trace all communication between your application and the sql-server including which procedure are called parameter value etc without having to modify your application

1822479
decltype	auto
edit2 i should also mention that c++ 0x has a new definition of the auto keyword along with a new keyword decltype that make a fair numbers of things like this considerably easier to handle

1822479
return-type	arguments
i haven t tried to implements this exact function with them but this general kind of situation is the sort of thing for which they re intended automatically figuring out a return-type based on passed arguments

1822496
environment	building
your best bet is to use some sort of scripting which will pull the building from subversion if use svn export it won t bring along subversion file hooks building any necessary files using msbuilding which can be scriptinged remove the unecessary files such as .aspx.cs files since you ve built the thing and copy it over to your environment

1822498
gksudo	sudo
why gksudo instead of just sudo java main

1822530
jsonp	ajax
the right way to do this would be to have the methods detection if the request is coming from ajax and return jsonp instead

1822540
python	java
for example all modern-languages c# java python have the concept of sets

1822556
updating	updates

json	xml
also consider the response will be served in xml and json soon

1822600
contains	sorted
x 2n-1 is the sorted list there is always an optimal solution that contains x 0 x 2n-1

activities such as count and linking login to logout etc take more complex queries and a little more resources

1822649
.net	wcf
the wcf default serialization the datacontractserialization doesn t support attributes .so that might be .something to take into consideration but it s roughly 10 faster than the more flexible xmlserialization in .net

account	api
paypal subscription handling via api .so that the user doesnt have to have a paypal account

1822722
optional-arguments	arguments
using optional-arguments that way in general is fine but optional and keyword arguments play horribly together and having both in a single function is a extremely efficient way to create all sorts of hard to debugging errors

1822726
javascript	dom
i think choosing a javascript dom ajax libs you like is important and it will almost always be appropriate to use said libs but don t let that stop you for learning important javascript features idioms techniques as well as some browser and dom

1822731
python	php
the other two approaches could be any platform that speaks http php python .net .

1822736
64bit	x86
i think edit-and-continue is only supported for x86 binaries .so if you re running 64bit target you won t be able to make it work

1822741
ip-address	hostname
to solve the first try using ip-address instead of hostname

1822741
ip-address	hostname
this is often caused by wrong ip-address or a wrong ports or an unresolveable hostname or some software hardware firewall in the network line which is blocking the connection

1822750
any	set	enumerator	any	object-reference	instances
upon further examination it appears that any enumerator of machinelist will cause subsequent enumerators of machinelist to throw an exception-handling object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1822753
contains	elements
then if i want to sent a summary list for instances i just send the top elements plus its attributes and leave out the contains elementss

1822866
perl	c++
in early web days it was mostly perl and occasional brave souls who didn t like perl or wanted more performance used c++

1822866
perl	c++
then sun developed jdbc and servlets for java and then other j2ee pieces and java became a higher performance alternative to perl and easier than c++

1822866
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
perl php python and ruby have their fans but not the corporate backing

subclassing	base-class
due to a bug in sti the activerecord finder was returning a base-class instances user instead of subclassing instances consumer

if you called git-rm default.aspx.cs or git-add -u then you can reset the file

1822989
deployment	install
i realize if i use the standards deployment techniques it can prompt the user to install java if they don t have it or their versioning is too old for my code but i d still like to have a sense of what features i can realistically code for without most users having to install anything

1823002
any	set
use that custom properties in a scripting which runs after any svn updates which will set the permissions on those directory as required

1823007
instances	private
c is a private variables that is static or class specific different instances of clazz will shared the same c variables

1823007
instances	private
the overall issue i have with my understanding of the variables scheme is that there s no way to declare a private variables that is not static a unique versioning for every instances of the class

1823018
revision	updates
updates to revision using tortoisesvn and put the branch revision in the indicated

1823018

i have a messages controllers thats declare as a resource in my routes

1823029
duck-typing	mixins
that is the tip of the iceburg mixins dynamic-dispatch callback object individuation duck-typing and a killer introspection api are probably my favorite things but i find this example is the easiest to grok for someone without any real experience in modern scripting languages

1823057
testng	junit
if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get it done in junit

1823092
interface-builder	iboutlet
the iboutlet are all set up in interface-builder .so i m never calling alloc manually

1823094
hierarchicaldatatemplate	binding
then i m binding my testcvs in a hierarchicaldatatemplate

antivirus	security
if really this is a concern i think your security team should force you and maven to go through a proxy running some kind of antivirus

1823138
constructor	private
c is a private variables accessible only within the constructor function

1823138
constructor	object
the d declaration is invalid because the prototype object is meant to be used only on constructor functions like if you do it like this the variables will be shared but you can assign a value on an specific instances and the default-value will be shadowed through the prototype-chain

1823138
constructor	private
privileged methods are public but they can access private variables declare inside the constructor function

1823138
private-members	instances
and if you want private-members on your singleton instances you can

1823138
private-members	object
this is has been called the module-pattern it basically allows you to encapsulate private-members on an object by taking advantage of the use of closures

1823138
constructor	object
by using the new-operator you are declaring and using in one step an anonymous constructor function which will generator a new object instances it is valid but i personally would prefer the module-pattern approach to create my own object instances and avoid new

1823140
.when	ready
.when you re ready you can export the files again to run your .app

1823140
yaml	ini
it works with php arrays php defined po yaml ini and .strings formats

attributes	properties
checked the file attributes right-click and selected properties in windows-explorer

1823185
rvm	gem
have you tried rvm gem

1823200

1823265
value	field
after each addition of such new data iterate through such span elements and sum the value and display them in a field like

1823268
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
have the alert code be in viewdidappear rather than viewwillappear

1823275
checkbox	button
while i definitely agree with the consensus that radio button are the way to go for your describe use-case here is a little snipped of jquery that will cause checkbox to behave like radio button

1823288
attributes	properties
activator will figure out which constructor to use and i will get an instances of my attributes class and can use its properties

1823288
constructor	object
i already know which typess are available in the attributes s constructor .so i wrote a little methods that parsing the stuff between the parans into their correct types string int guid etc and then i pass that object arrays to the activator

1823295
bufferedwriter	filewriter
bufferedwriter fileout new bufferedwriter new filewriter

1823298
direct3d	directx
you can do the charting in direct3d using directx embedded in a windows

1823311
populate	row
it s highly configurable and flexible you can use ajax to populate manually or automatically the rows it can read directly from a mysql table with a simple php backend and you have all the facilities to iterate all the rows to .post the results to the server to do paginator if you need a lot of row we ve used it succesfully with more tha 15.000 rows and to do additions other operations

1823332
debugging	exit
regarding skipping code .when your in debugging mode under the run menu you can selected step over skips going into a methods step return to exit a methods and run to line in addition to setting breakpoints by right click

1823343
credentials	security
though this sounds like a security risk making your application take on the credentials of a network user rather than the anonymous user default

1823354

1823380
keyboard	mouse
if you want another layer to help you with various parts of game programming keyboard and mouse events sound etc.. you can use sdl with opengl

1823384
value	field
enums get stored in the classfile as static field .so the maximum numbers of enum value and enum member field is 65 536

1823384
value	field
long story short there is no easy answer and the answer depends not only on the numbers of enum value there are but also the numbers of methods interfaces and field the enums have

1823390
python	java
start with a little python scripting to generator the java files

1823395
python	perl
i m pretty sure both perl and python have something similar

1823399
xsd	xml
i have generator a set of c# classes from an xsd schema using the xsd.exe tool and deserializing xml files works fine

1823399
children	tree
note that i want to avoid keeping a separate xml hierarchy structure like a dom tree but rather make the generator object keep tracking of their parent and children

1823399
contains	any
this base-class contains a list of children and a reference to a parent object if any

1823415

this is accomplished with newer web-frameworks like asp.net-mvc django ruby-on-rails etc.

1823420
scrollbar	tooltip
the grid can show a tooltip with the current row numbers or row id while dragging the scrollbar

1823426
directory	folder
in the first case you don t need to create the directory through a preinst scripting the folder hierarchy will be created if necessary by the package manager .when the package is install

1823438
push	pull
you should append to the end of the arrays with push but pop just pull elements from the end of the arrays which is probably not the right order

1823441
scala	java
i m building a site in appengine java using scala and it s working really slow .when accessed from my domain

1823445
optimistic-concurrency	nhibernate
i have an entity mapped in nhibernate with optimistic-concurrency control using a sql timestamp column as the versioning numbers

1823445
subclassing	base-class
childentity is a subclassing of the entity base-class which has the optimistic-lock set to versioning

1823457
python	c++
python is by far the most popular choice there and personally i m happy i also chose that even though i already knew c++

1823473
python	c++
and if you really need the performance then you can always write c++ extensions and use them in python

1823479
data-structures	hashmap
you can emulate data-structures on-top of the python hashmap primitive

1823487
managed-code	unmanaged
people are mostly familiar with using it to wrap unmanaged apis to expose to managed-code but it actually works both ways - it is possible to compile with clr and yet produce a .dll assembly with plain unmanaged export which can be called from unmanaged-code as usual

1823487
managed-code	c++-cli	managed-code	native-code
in practice it will load clr runtime into the calling process unless it s already loaded there and dispatcher from native-code to managed-code transparently - all the magic is done by c++-cli compiler

1823493
instances	self
i m wrappering the functions .so that i can store the results of the functions in self but .something is going wrong in a non-threadsafe way that i get the right numbers of threads started but .some instances aren t the right function

1823496

1823512
backslash	regex
to match one backslash in the input you put four of them in the regex string

1823536
mongodb	couchdb
furthermore libs for db technologies like couchdb mongodb and other object or document aka nosql databases seem to obviate the need to checked if a malicious user is injecting database manipulation cmd

1823542
sniffing	traffic
but this doesn t do anything i am sniffing network http traffic to see if it works

1823547
execute	declare
while slower to execute the binding will resolve properties named that are not visible on the types declare by the templates

1823548
lightbox	jquery
i ve written a small lightbox plugins for jquery yes there are several ready made package -- unfortunately the designer in my co

1823549
put	get
sql-subsets like gql obviously still concern themselves with it -- but pure non-sql databases like couchdb voldemort etc should put get data without concern for sql-injection-style attacks

1823551
firefox	opera
the page below looks and works great in firefox opera et al

1823572
callback	methods
i ve registered flickr_callback as the callback methods that flickr call after the authentication process

1823577
python	c++
i love the python recommendations but if i could use stl i d reconsider c++

1823578
python	c++
you shouldn t write your own graphing libs .when there are already plenty read too many available both in c++ and in python

1823578
python	c++
using libs mitigate the gain of the higher level language of python since you won t be working with raw c++ per se but with a c++ libs

1823585
click	mouse
and it goes without saying make your stackpanel background at least transparency or it won t be caught by the mouse click hit test .when you click on the background

1823587
value	field
the maximum numbers of enum value will i think be just under the 65536 maximum numbers of field constants pool entries in the class

1823589
python	c++
with c++ you d .sometimes be concentrating more on the language issues than the problem itself .so python

1823597
versioning	upgrade
the unpack syntax has been upgrade in the recent versioning as can be seen in the example

1823615
packaging	building
i know about sgen.exe but do not want to complicate my building and packaging process

1823621
environment	building
it has been developed both with the intention of building a productive compiler development systemd and with the intention of creating an easy-to-use academic environment for people interested in how parsing table generator is done general in

1823621
linux	osx
javascript cc itself has been entirely written in ecmascripting .so it can be execute in many different ways as platform-independent browser-based javascripting embedded on a website as a windows scripting hosts application as a compiled javascriptcripting.net executable as a mozilla rhino or mozilla spidermonkey interpreter application or a v8 shell scripting on windows nix linux and mac osx

1823642
dsa	rsa
i also tried adding a dsa key because the rsa won t work

1823645

filtering	sorting
see sorting and filtering data using a dataview

1823692
arrays	loops
i already know the basic variables loops arrays if else some logic but i m looking to learn in a structured way

1823714
python	perl
although the language is sort of arcane and the libs is at least in principles available in other languages notably python and perl the toolkit in its native language is really very clear and concise

1823720
environment	building
use ant or even better use ant with a continuous building environment like hudson and a scm like svn

1823726
temporary	copy
the following tutorial show you how to use jquery s simplified ajax and php to upload an image to a temporary location resize it and save the resize copy where you desire

1823751
contains	sorted
considered a sorted arrays contains

1823758
arrays	map
granted the above way works and is fairly straightforward but i m curious if there s a way to get from the hash to the string without first creating an arrays the result-of the map methods

1823783
contains	set
the only alternative is to generator a third collections myself that contains the aggregate set of entities and it feels like that should not be needed

1823802
attributes	properties	getter	setter
the object that it takes as arguments and returns must be marked with the datacontract attributes and each properties that you want to include in the json serialization should be marked with data-members and should have a getter and a setter even if the setter does nothing

1823803
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works in firefox 3 but it doesn t in ie8 goggle google-chrome 3 adn safari 4

1823815
instances	private
that will change the behavior of nsnull for all instances in the application including ones created by the underlying frameworks solely for their private use

1823834
hash	md5
how are you creating your md5 hash

1823851
nsinteger	int
there s a similar question here on so.com in cocoa do you prefer nsinteger or int and why

1823851
nsinteger	int
i prefer using nsinteger because it s future-proof apple now uses it over int and it s the recommended way of doing things

1823858
getter	setter
you need to have a setter as well as a getter

1823858
getter	setter
usually the compiler complains if you have just a getter and no setter and try to mark it bindable

1823860
children	nodes
the readouterxml methods returns the current nodes and all of it s children if positioning on an elements or attributes nodes otherwise it returns an empty string

1823873
show	next
i have an x and a checked mark that i am trying to display next to the field to show if it is valid or not

1823876
while-loop	loops
but .when data not available .when readline called in while-loop loops exit and thread terminate

1823882
lighttpd	apache
code with a server with x-send available lighttpd has it .so does apache

1823890
highlight	selected
is highlight the selected item supported in jquery treeview

1823912
administration	account
i was already running sql-server under an admin account not the local systemd account but my personal domain account which is an administration on the box

1823918
wicket	spring
the migration has caused hundreds of warnings to spring up out of nowhere -- for those unfamiliar with wicket many wicket classes are derived from a common ancestry which became generified in v1.4 -- and i m not sure what parameters to apply in some cases mostly assorted forms and tables

1823920
contains	any
pointers to a buffering contains any optional data to be sent immediately after the request headers

1823927
frame-rate	fps
i am using the sdl_delay and time_left to maintain a frame-rate of about 33 fps

1823936
hide	next
in the 1st dialog box i have next button .so .when i click that it has to hide the 1st dialog box and move on to the 2nd dialog box where i have .some controls in 2nd dialog box

1823957
32-bit	x86
it include usr include bits setjmp.h to declare jmp_buf to have an arrays of six 32-bit int apparently specific to the x86 family

1823978
value	field
is it good to checked that some field are blank or not from a table and return true or false from a sp or is it good to fetch the value and checked in the code

1823994
touch	drag
.so .when we touch and drag the balls around the screens they should move along the tracking

1824013
return-value	arguments
current continuation is a function of 1 arguments this arguments is then used as a return-value of call cc and here is eventually ignore

1824013
return-value	arguments
since cont is now a function which represented the continuation and it s arguments is the return-value of call cc we just call that function the arguments gets ignore and we need to call the cont #f again

1824014
contains	elements
each request messages contains an elements that specifies what process is required

1824019
profiling	trace
you need rights to run profiling sysadmin or grant alter trace .so it s not an implicit right

1824021
groovy	java
this is actually a part of java not groovy that many people aren t aware of

1824037
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	java
i dont see any solution that supports all your requirements either you ditch all the com .net stuff and go java rhino linux open source or you question the use of javascript as your server language even in the linux world we use php python ruby more on the server if we cant run java

1824047
32-bit	64bit
many existing apis incorrectly for historical reasons used int in 32-bit mode but must use long in 64bit mode

1824047
32-bit	64bit
in c int and long are not equivalent types .so if you use int you may be incompatible with the 64bit api and if you use long you may be incompatible with the 32-bit api

1824047
32-bit	64bit
by using nsinteger your code will be compatible with both 32-bit and 64bit versioning of these apis

1824047
nsinteger	int
the reason you wouldn t necessarily use nsinteger for everything is that 8-byte int are overkill for many purposes

1824051
tabcontrol	panels
.when only one tab move the panels put to replace the tabcontrol or something of that nature

1824091
contains	set
i also see a set of other panels user-controls each of which contains a title and a series of checkbox

1824099
any	set
is there any way to set memory settings per web application

1824100
derived-class	base-class
i have a derived-class that adds only methods to a base-class

1824100
derived-class	base-class
how can serialization the derived-class .so that it matches the serialization of the base-class

1824102
arrays	loops
i think you should just put all the urls in an arrays and loops thru it by index

1824111
jquery	.post
the .post i made to jquery user-interface s mailing list include relevant code-snippets

1824118
arrays	loops
given that the size of arrays is known can i loops through with index i and say

1824128
arrays	loops
the usual approaches are to make a public function which returns the numbers of elements in the arrays or to provide an iterator function which loops over all the list s elements

1824135
pointers	stack
if you have insert addresses of object created on stack automatic variables not by new or malloc inside a function and are trying to access them outside of it then the pointers would be dangling and your code will crash

1824138
arrays	loops
size of arrays is known can i loops

1824144
contains	elements
or is it better to just create 1 form on the page that contains all of the input submit elements and then just use code to figure out which part of the form the user is submission

1824149
integration-testing	system-testing
system-testing or integration-testing is about testing that they all glue together correctly

1824151
classname	inherited
add new new classname is navigationcontroller and inherited from uinavigationcontroller

1824183
32-bit	64bit
you ll need to either create a 64bit versioning of this control or you need to force the .net program that uses it to run in 32-bit mode

1824203
svnadmin	dump
to svnadmin dump your repository then

1824216
lookup	any
i don t see any either as an attacker s scripting can just lookup the image and string from the real login page

1824231
exception-handling	error-handling
.when you throw an exception-handling in the doget methods of an httpservlet you are essentially throw up your hands and giving up any sensible error-handling

1824235
show	next
checked format with multiple-columns this should show the layout tab next to color tab

1824236
postorder	inorder	postorder	preorder	preorder	inorder
tree traversal preorder inorder and postorder is very easily done using recursion

1824249
postorder	inorder
if you want to be tricky you can even create a generics traversal that allows you to choose the flavor pre-order inorder or postorder at runtime

1824253
entity-framework	data-access
it al.so promotes better separation of layer and less coupling as clients will interact via interface methods on the repository rather than use linq-to-sql directly for data-access .so if you do decide to chuck linq-to-sql in favour of the entity-framework shudders it s easier to do the refactoring

1824265
hide	show
i m working on a two level unordered list menu and .so far was able to take .some decent newbie step in figuring out how to show and hide the menu using jquery as well as animate it a tad

revision	svn
exact same code with same line break linefeed checked out at the same revision # from the same svn repository on all 3 machines

1824359
jquery	dojo	mootools	extjs
you should use one of the prevalent javascript libs like jquery dojo yui prototype extjs or mootools to attach the event in a to ensure that your your page structure is decoupled from the event logic

1824370
www-mechanize	lwp
is your perl code managing the socket connection and the data scraping itself or are you using a higher level perl libs like lwp or www-mechanize to extraction data

1824398
constructor	object
you ll have to pass gettypes derived-class to the serialization constructor it must match the types of the object you serialization

1824407
aggregate-functions	sum
the key is summing the meta_values but flipping the sign of price .so you actually get retail minus price groupinging on each id .so the aggregate-functions sum deals with each grouping independently

1824417
python	php
i m a php developer just entered python programming maybe a month and am very used to the ternary operation which is done in php like this

1824476
directory	folder
i have one browse button but i m not getting what code i have to write there for invoking required file directory folder .when i click on browse button one windows is open from which i take single file at a time like gmail compose email form

1824493
derived-class	base-class
i can say that you ll need some more code and implements ixmlserializable for your base-class declaring all interface methods as virtual and overrides them on your derived-class

1824497
any	set
on the other hand it you need to make many searches and parsing over an existing set of data repeatedly you may benefit from having it stored in any form which suits your needs better

1824510
put	get
you get into trouble sooner or later if you put variables declarations at the beginning of loops or conditional blocks

1824524
scala	java
for a java scala project i have some dependencies that are not in a remote repository but somewhere else in my filesystems

1824524
directory	folder
i can add a .lib directory in my project folder

1824543
selected	listbox
preferably i would like a datatrigger which .when a certain properties is false disables this item make it impossible to selected without affecting other items in the listbox

1824553
positioning	embed
i m trying to embed the chalet fonts to some dynamic textfield and it is causing the vertical positioning of the text to jump up above the actual textfield

1824558
literals	hardcode
because strings are immutable in these languages they can pool frequently-used strings include hardcode string literals like in your example and use multiple references to that one string in memory to save spaces

1824561
uitableview	uitextview
but you can do uitableview grouping with 1 section and 1 empty cell and use it as a containers for your uitextview

1824584
mta	sta
if you mark your component as mta and your component is created from within a sta then your component will be created in a separate mta apartment and the resultant inter-apartment marshalling might degrade performance enough to negate all the work put into making an efficient free-threaded component

1824584
mta	sta
if your component was marked as both then there could be excessive apartment switching between the both component running in the sta and the mta

1824588
contains	any
if i understood your question correctly you need to find strings which can contains any characters in a large binary file

1824592
nsstring	nsnull
instead of creating category on nsnull for which you would also have to add a similar category to nsstring that s why it crash because real strings do not respond to stringvalue - instead try creating a helpers category on nsdictionary like stringforkey that uses the code johan posted and returns an nsstring probably also should enforce all other types get mapped to empty strings as well

1824594
pixels	line
but scrolling is being made by pixels not by line

1824653
required	checked
i have checked a few testing solution for osgi including pax and had a quick look at the abstract testcase within spring-dm but they both appear to required one to jar up and bundle associated bundles

1824657
expression	brackets
you original regular expression doesn t seem to need capturing at all if all you want to do is checked for the existence of an opening angle brackets

1824693
getter	setter
this is a simple change - just create getter setter and dispatcher your change event in the setter after changing the value like this

1824700
contains	elements
this handler reads out the tagname of the click elements and move up the dom tree until the contains row is found

1824708
controllers	routes
this will try to load the controllers at .app controllerss account profiles_controllers.rb and will generator routes such as account_profile_path

1824710
contains	set
this converts the nodes into a jquery result set contains that nodes

1824735
click	mouse
the problem is how can we get if the touch leaf red belongs to the bird or other father how to get the following output give some mouse click

1824857
ethernet	wlan
.so it doesn t matter if you are using wlan ethernet or .something else as long as you don t go below layer 3 which isn t possible with java anyway

1824901

hey guys lately i use the combinations of struts and velocity frameworks to create some website the problem is that .when i tried to input utf-8 japanese character say a field named which i putted in the value of ç then i click submit using the data would be passed to an addform which i have the string named field to handle the named field

1824915
stderr	stdout
you can probably avoid the need for an additional thread if you use stderr stdout

1824921
dictionary	arrays
neither arrays nor list nor dictionary are the right data structure for tracking the boolean status of a set of object

1824956
contains	set	value	field
i think the easiest way is to connect a hidden dbtext to your dataset then set the dbtext to display which field you need this way that dbtext will always contains the needed value of the activerecord

1824986
selected	checkbox
i would like all the checkbox to be selected by default.

most form elements are intended to contains text

1825033
contains	elements	contains	any
unless the form has peer nodes under a div parent simply direct any presentation directly to the form elements and not a parent elements that exists only to contains the form

1825038
boolean	int
yes if your webservice only takes int and strings you can use the built-in testpage that the webservice serves up but often you have boolean userobjects or strongly typed dataset that will be passed in the functions and then you have to create a program that create a dummyobject and fill some default properties for you to test it out

1825047
hash	md5
why don t you simply calculate md5 sha-1 or oher hash calculation on the folder content

1825049
directory	folder
you can put this sln in one of your project directory usually in your gui csproject folder

1825051
version-control	git
a possible not perfect solution would be a version-control systemd such as svn or git

1825063
version-control	git
for content match i recommend using some sort of distribute version-control systemd such as git

1825072
uiactivityindicatorview	addsubview

object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1825115
contains	any
the project file does not contains any reference to any containss .solution .so that does not need to be touch

contains	set
each project entry contains a relative-path to the project whcih must obviously be set correctly

1825145

create svn ignore attributes on generator folder such as the .obj and bin directory .so svn status will give you useful feedback .when you ve forgotten to add an important file

1825149

i don t know what you exact problem is but if you re receiving xml and want to return json or something you could also look at jax-b

1825149
json	xml
this is a standards for marshalling unmarshalling java pojo s to xml and or json

1825180
any	set
think if fflushmode is set to autoit should fflush before making any hql or criterion queries that could have been affected

1825183
abstract-class	pure-virtual
if it s merely an abstract-class then a mix of pure-virtual and implements methods is perfectly reasonable

1825218

1825359
ruby-on-rails	django
are they faster than django ruby-on-rails

1825369
udp	tcp
you should probably just use tcp for this nothing in your requirements that indicate you need to use the more complicated and error-prone udp rtp-based solutions

1825370
rtsp	rtp
use ffmpeg libs for encoding your streaming and use rtp rtsp stack to streaming them

1825371
udp	tcp
as for the tcp or udp that depends on how you want to use it

1825371
udp	tcp
udp makes sense if you want to make your streaming multicast otherwise i would prefer tcp because it is more reliable

1825398
default-value	default
until then the advice to create an after_initialize or to set the default in the controllers is good advice however i do think that sometimes the best person to decide on the default-value is the designer who may not be comfortable the controllerss or model which is why we added this as part of the formtastic dsl

1825404
treeview	gridview
many articles have gridview inside a treeview which is ok but i need my inner elements to have headers too

1825429
groovy	java
while it doesn t use java it uses groovy it is very ror-like

1825429
groovy	java
it uses spring and hibernate under the hood if i m correct and the advantage of groovy is that you don t have the strict static-typing of java

1825429
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby-on-rails and django benefit heavily from the dynamic nature of the language in which it is implements a feature java misses because of its static-typing

1825484
memcached	apc
my experience say that apc is nearly 7-8 time faster than memcached

1825484
lighttpd	apache
but memchached can be accessed by different service for example if you run mainly on apache and delegation some traffic static contents like images or pure html to another web-service like lighttpd that can be really usefull if not indispensable

1825484
memcached	apc
apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs

signals	aio
has anyone rolled-their-own with an epoll loops using eventfd for the aio signals

1825622
double-quotes	single-quotes

if .so you could try adjusting the padding margins on the li elements

1825872
expression	evaluation
in particular if all references are from uninitializer templatess members of a templates or a sizeof expression or similar things that don t use the entity since they are either not potentially evaluation it or they just don t exist yet as functions member-functions that are itself used such a static data-members is not initializer

1825872
data-members	constructor
it won t however initializer definitions - that is to say initializer are not initializer and constructor of the types of that static data-members are not implicit defined marked as used

1825872
constructor	object
nothing uses .so it s not initializer and .so no object of is ever created which makes its constructor not being used which in turn will never assign .something to you will just output an empty string

1825872
constructor	object	data-members	constructor
commented uncommented same problem - again both static data-members are used is used by and the initializer of will cause its constructor to be initializer which will use - but for your compiler the order is different in this particular run unspecified-behavior is not required to be consistent among different runs it initializer first which will operate on a not-yet-constructed string object

regarding compiler enforcement in c++ the compiler will not allow you to directly access private data-members from outside of a class or friend of the class

1825953
constructor	object
and regarding syntactic convenience c++ offers all sorts of conveniences not found in c such as operator-overloading references automated object initialization and destructor in the form of constructor destructor exception-handling and automated stack-unwinding built-in support for polymorphism etc

1825957
primitive	int
otherwise for example with string or boxed primitive such as int or if you don t acees the object of the generics types i would go for methods 2

i d suggest learn some java oo first then play around with the java servlets jsp pages which should give you the basic and finally pick a framework like grails or tapestry to learn

1826168
json	xml
if you don t need a webapp and your just accessing exposing another service over the web then you have most of what you need for network io in the core j2se stack with the addition of possibly some xml json parsing libs

1826168
web-services	api
java also has a full blown web-services api - but it s may well be overkill for your needs

1826168
json	xml
you could implements a simple http webservice by simply using tomcat and servlets and reading writing the request response as xml json

1826170
put	get
always let them know that everyone started at the beginning and this industry is always about learning - try to find some positive that they can shared with you very early on - you will find this will put the emphasis on sharing and communication and not be dictatorial and autocratic in styles and you get to learn stuff also

1826194
subtraction	addition
for the sake of completeness i would like to mention another less powerful algorithm with addition subtraction

1826198

also the pull model might be more decoupled as the variables of load is kept local to the worker whereas in the push model one would need a communication-protocol and overhead to communication this state

1826330
push	pull
think of the success of the pull model in the auto industry it went from the traditional push model where inventories would be difficult to tracking and required lots of feedback to the now successful and ubiquitous pull model

1826868
zero	nan
it either null nan or zero

1826901
filtering	grouping
do you think these filtering files should be kept per-user or should they be shared across the whole dev grouping and checked into scc

1826933
contains	set
alternatively if you re not using ruby or you re sure that your strings contains no line break or you have set the option that and do not match on beginnings ends of line

1826934
copy-constructor	temporary
but in both the output and the function plop below where i create a temporary object i don t see the need for the copy-constructor

1826939
contains	any
the complete string mustn t contains any numbers or simbols

1826945
directory	folder

1826958
udp	tcp
works with both tcp or udp connections and has decent log viewer and database integration

1826964
reflection	runtime
even in languages that do not officially support eval such as java they support reflection and modification of classes at runtime which are similar

1826982
primitive	int
variations if you need java primitive int or float change the types of the arrays and do not use equals to compare but the operators

1826998
prolog	lisp
one example is implements prolog in lisp and then defining a predicates that allows direct use of lisp functions via eval

1827006
hide	show
- using jquery i click an image link to show and play the video click it again stops and hide the video - vice versa

1827025
substring	charindex
while splitting the city is easy combinations of charindex and substring extraction the country seems to be more challenging

1827036
filtering	sorting
you filtering out later with the sorting

1827042
tokenize	parsing
generally .when indexing document that contains html markup with lucene you should first parsing out the html into a textual representation with the parts you want to leave and only then feed it to the tokenize to be indexed

1827054
xsd	xml
how can i defined it with xml schema xsd

1827059
difference	zero
i know the basic difference as releasecomobject only decreases some counter by one and finalreleasecomobject decreases it to zero

1827070
value	field
the api also returns a field column named value through mysql_fetch_field_direct -- a separate function-call after obtaining the query results

1827070
linked-list	tree	binary-tree	tree	binary-tree	linked-list
i use a helpers function as a wrapper around query execution that stores each row in a binary-tree with the column named being the key and returns a linked-list of tree for me to do with what i need

1827086
binary	hex
you have the binary wrong - it should be 0100 0001 - your bin to hex is fine

1827095
push	pull
if the threads user-interface and facade wait for one another to finish their request then this should prevent a pull updates happening at the same time as a push updates

1827097
scriptmanager	updatepanel
you can use a combinations of the asyncpostbackerror event on the scriptmanager server-side and the endrequest event on the pagerequestmanager client-side to fully handle server-side errors .when using the updatepanel

1827114
linux	unix
i don t know why that oserror is not raised in some cases but it s important to note that there is a max pid value on linux and unix based os

1827118
hash	md5
if you need your whole column to be the primary key calculate sha1 or md5 hash and use it as a primary key

1827152
macros	vba
whatever you are trying to do you could selected then manually perform the operation you need then stop the macros and edit it in vba to see the corresponding vba cmd to use in your program

1827186
nsstring	nsurl
i am attempting to load a variables with types nsstring into an nsurl with the following line

1827196
hide	show
you have not subscribed to the uikeyboardwillhidenotifcation only show - thus it will not do anything .when the keyboard hide

1827223
.when	ready
.so if there is a change then the developer needs to be alerted because product management will need to communication to the clients about the change .so they can be ready to re-compile their stubs .when the new wsdl is published

1827250
attributes	properties
go to connection caching properties for more info on this attributes

1827269
player	movie
assuming that the total animation sequences is static you re best bet is to compile it as movie and use the movie player framework to play it

1827305
moss	wss
the great sharepoint adventure - wss 3.0 and moss 2007 for developers

1827308
xsd	xml
or would it be better to right some code that loads in the xsd as xml and then matches the response elements to the elements in the xsd and derives the correct namespace that way

1827319
youtube	vimeo
i am working on an embedment section on my site where users can embed different media from various service youtube myspace music vimeo etc

1827321
web-inspector	webkit
i m using the built-in javascripting-debugger in safari 4 on windows the webkit web-inspector but .when i m stepping through code i keep getting the slow scripting dialog pestering me to abort continue the scripting every few seconds

1827326
configuration	environment
the decisions carried out by controllerss may be shaped by numerous input configuration user-input environment etc but at some points a model is passed to a view by the controllers

1827330
python	java
it s written in c and features according to the webpage binding for qt glib java c# python etc.

1827375
mbunit	nunit
c# - nunit xunit.net mbunit msunit etc etc

1827381
ruby	php
there are several unit-testing libs which are language specific junit for java phpunit for php ruby has some inbuilt classes for testing as well as libs like rspec among others you can also use resources like link text which sometimes have good tutorials articles on testing

1827391
ruby-on-rails	django
i recognize that you are looking for a ruby-on-rails solution but you can still checkout how it s done in django and copy some of the useful features to the other side

1827391
ruby-on-rails	django
if i like a ruby-on-rails specific feature i ll ports it other to django python

1827394
temporary	copy	temporary	rvalue
in this case the compiler is allowed to either bind the reference directly to the object representing the rvalue or create a temporary copy of the rvalue and bind to that temporary copy

1827397
modal-dialog	colorbox
how would i use colorbox to create a confirm overrides modal-dialog that can interrupt a form submission until yes is click

1827397
simplemodal	colorbox
simplemodal has a similar function but i much prefer colorbox s implementation and documentation otherwise i d use the latter

1827412
youtube	vimeo
youtube vimeo myspace have only columns specific to each one

1827427
hide	show
i m looking for a wordpress-plugin that hide to start with the .when i click say an arrow image an ajax feature pops out with say a contact form inside and also another show hide feature at the bottom of the page to show and hide multiple divs

1827440
databound	gridview
say i have a labels inside a gridview templates column and i assign the text to the databound item orderid

1827440
double-quotes	single-quotes
because padleft required a char i can t use my single-quotes because i ve already surrounded the value in single-quotes and can t do double-quotes because of the databinder.eval expression

1827453
value	field
then you lose no precision as future arithmetic operations using instances of this struct could be coded to use the two original exact integral state value stored in these field instead of the slightly less accurate rounded double you got from the division operation

1827475
assign	add
the more fancy way would be to add a as the first elements in the structure and assign str and id as pointsers that points to mem where you malloc the memory

1827493
.when	ready
i m assuming that doing it outside doesn t work because the tag doesn t exist until document is ready and doing it inside doesn t work because .when the document is ready the tag has already become ready .so it won t ever be ready again .so f isn t called

1827498
portrait	screens
i want to lock the orientation programmatically for my application screens to be display only in portrait mode

1827500
crystal-reports	birt	crystal-reports	jasper-reports	business-objects	crystal-reports	business-objects	birt	business-objects	microstrategy	jasper-reports	birt	microstrategy	birt
and crystal-reports brio cognos business-objects microstrategy actuate jasper-reports birt etc should all work fine

1827512
.when	ready
how do i first deploy to a private development page and then deploy to the main page .when ready

1827516
expression	evaluation
i m not sure about the c# compiler but i know that in assembly a switching statement can actually be programmed as a jump to a specific line rather than evaluation the expression like an if-statement

1827572
spaces	output
you can store the data as an xml document and parsing it on input output but you will most likely need more than 4k of spaces and you will incur the cost of parsing xml

1827583
.net	wcf
wcf is a very different beast than straight-up .net - and since a lot of stuff needs to be reduced to what xml schema can express you cannot use interfaces for the most part and generics

1827592
updating	updates
you say no row is updates but it sounds like you are updating the is_current column on that row

1827600
dynamic-programming	memoization
but essentially its exponential most of the time until you do some sort of memoization or use dynamic-programming which again takes a huge amount of memory if not done well

1827616
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on google-chrome firefox and even works in 64bit ie 8

1827616
32-bit	64bit
i also wonder why windows 7 x64 comes with both the 32-bit and 64bit versioninging of ie 8 and why the 32-bit versioning was pinned to my taskbar.

1827621
32-bit	64bit
i don t know about your other issues but the reason the 32-bit versioning is the more visible one by default is that most plugins still don t have 64bit versioninging eg

1827622
arrays	loops
could you just pass an arrays of row numbers instead of one rownumber then in your function just loops through each elements in the arrays i don t remember i haven t programed in vba for a while

1827642
instances	private
for the columns collections create a backing private variables to hold an instances collections and remove the set accessor -

1827642
datagrid	listbox
i can t help feel there is some re-invention of the wheel here does datagrid or listbox or some other similar control not cut it for you

1827653
contains	any
std string by itself doesn t specify contains any encoding

1827654
submission	contact
i am new to asp.net and i am trying to create a contact form which send an email at submission as well storing the data in a database

1827659
contains	elements
i have a page contains the following div elements

1827672
type-safety	generics
scala maintains type-safety through the use of generics as does c# but loses the reliability of the named of each field e.g i use _1 instead of id

1827681
portrait	screens
i have a wide screens monitor rotated 90 degrees to the portrait orientation

1827687
textbox	button
ideally i would like to expose some sort of choice radio button or a textbox for altering a url at runtime in my web .app demo project such that i could have a late-binding of sorts for the desired fileserviceproxy.dll to be used at runtime

1827704
httpwebrequest	webclient
httpwebrequest or webclient

1827705
environment	building
i m in the middle of setting up an building environment for a c++ game project

1827709
selected	button
i have an asp.net fileupload control and a button that postback for upload the selected file

1827715
http	ssl
obviously http vs http performance has lots of details but remember that a lot of the cost of ssl is in the session setup .so the encryption for the transfer will be less costly relatively for a large transfer

1827723
httpwebrequest	webclient
i believe though that webclient is simply a helpers that implements httpwebrequest under the hood

1827725
google-chrome	firefox
focusing primarily on google-chrome and firefox btw

1827736
any	set
on the other hand if the definition of trade user is has any address for which trade_user is true then you will need to do something more complicated -- checked all of the addresses and return true if any of them have trade_user set

1827737
formatting	printing
you can printing things out with vhdl using the report statement but you have to do your formatting in a very non-sw way

1827760
unrecognized-selector	uncaught-exception
2009-12-02 09 51 47.343 coredatabooks 17981 20b terminating .app due to uncaught-exception nsinvalidargumentexception reason - __nscfdate length unrecognized-selector sent to instances 0x3e79850

1827776
order	add
i was wondering if .when you are retrieving the user data from a mysql table you can add an extra column with the karma arrays and order by that extra_column

1827780
attributes	properties
attributes on your properties of you own class

1827782
linux	unix
the worker have been designed to behave just like classic unix linux daemons thanks to simple shell scripting in etc init.d and cmd like

1827782
launchd	daemons
and as it relies on standards linux features even people with a limited knowledge of your .app can launchd a daemons or stop one if they know how it s called system-wise aka myworker in the above example

1827795
data-access	ado.net
then it came a pleasant surprise to us that there s something called ado.net data service offline astoria offline which allow us to make data-access call through web service support synchronized and even support offline

1827797
value	field
i have an xml file that describe 1 a custom object that is derived of a base types and 2 the internal field named and associated value

1827797
value	field
i extraction the types of object as a string and i place all the object data into a dictionary where the key is the field named and the value is the field s value

1827807
spaces	output
you can types in the same spaces where you see output it s lake windows-console but withe and embedded into ide

1827822
user-controls	ascx
in the user-controls s ascx do something like this

1827823
configuration	logging
you can create a custom appender or whatever it s called and register it - either via a test-only configuration file or runtime in a way dependent on the logging framework

1827827
postgresql	mysql
thus if sqltypes were to return postgresql dialect would map it to int2 and h2 mysql to tinyint

1827854
autotools	gnu
the most common one for source stuff is gnu autotools which i ve heard is a source of extreme grief

1827857
nonblocking	epoll
i m building a very high performance linux server based on epoll nonblocking sockets and async disk io based on io_submit io_getevents eventfd

1827875
contains	elements
find all siblings of the parent that contains a p.find elements and then find those p.find elementss and change their colour to blue

1827877
value	field
maybe just create a form and set the field s initial value

1827883
firefox	safari
it could be cross-browser at least safari and firefox

1827884
linked-list	nodes
this only works if nodes is at the top of the structures and only allows you to thread one linked-list through these structures

1827899
scons	jam	scons	bjam	bjam	jam
two examples i used to work with are scons and jam bjam

1827900
apache-config	httpd.conf
looks like you might have a problem in your apache-config file - can you show the relevant section for your site setup from your httpd.conf file

1827901
datagrid	listbox
it works quite happly .when the second datagrid is swapped out for a listbox

1827901
datagrid	listbox
i ve also swapped out the first datagrid for a listbox and then the second datagrid starts working quite happly

1827926
autotools	automake	autotools	gnu	automake	gnu
i have been using gnu autotools autoconf automake libtool for the past couple of months in several project that i have been involved in and i think it works beautifully

1827926
python	c++
truth be told it does take a little bit to get used to the syntax but i have used it successfully on a project that required the distribution of python scripting c libs and a c++ application

1827926
autotools	gnu
the gnu autotools page provides the best documentation on the systemd as a whole but it is quite verbose

1827926
configure	libtool
autoconf configure the project based upon the platform that you are about to compile on automake building the makefile for your project and libtool handles libs

1827926
autotools	gnu
one thing that i am not certain on is any types of windows wrapper for gnu autotools

1827927
value	field
both the html helpers and model binding which is what gets used to pass parameters into action methods need the full named of the properties or field inorder to retrieve the value

1827931
defined	declare
and that is where the good ide comes in you can leave namespace which can become quite large really for big systemd out but .when debugging editing the code the ide can perfectly hint you where the symbols was declare defined referenced etc.

1827940
restart	reload
it apparently resolved itself on its own apache or other service weren t restart reload

1827942
perl	ruby	perl	php	perl	c++	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	c++	python	perl	python	java
activemq provides client apis for many languages including c++ java .net perl php python ruby and more

1827955
parentheses	let
well let s put some parentheses there to make sure we know what we are doing

1827959
nmake	cmake
once all the source is there cmake and a building tool gcc nmake msvs etc. is all you need

1827975
buffering	streaming
repeatedly fill the buffering until the response streaming ends

1827975
buffering	streaming
.when the buffering is full or the streaming ends attach that buffering content onto the string or whatever you re using to store the messages

1827985
.when	ready
ideally you setup your model as you need to and .when you re ready you go and manually solidify your relationships in the db

1827996
contains	elements
generally inline elements may contains only data and other inline elements

1827996
contains	elements
the conditional generally appears to introduce enough ambiguity to say that html 4.01 does allow inline elements to contains block elements

1828021
ifstream	fstream
i m reading a file in c++ using streaming specifically fstream not ifstream

1828032
contains	elements
html 4.01 specifies that elements may only contains inline elements

1828063
openfiledialog	streamreader
.when i pass the entire filepath hardcode i am able to add recording to the db but as openfiledialog in silverlight doesn t allow to obtain the filepath s due to security reasons i tried using wcf service and pass either the fileinfo properties or streamreader and then perform the operations

1828070
vbscript	jscript
note that it s much more difficult to use wmi in jscript than it is in vbscript and most examples you find on the internet are for vbscript which makes porting the code a pain

1828071
value	field
also since value in the questionoptions is varchar you need to be able to parsing stuff a lot and you may even want to introduce another field for conversion hints

1828084
selected	button
use something like first-child to selected for example the first button and styles that one differently

1828087
selected	button
i suggest you take a look at the html that the code spits out and see if theres a way to uniquely identify one or both of the button possibly the id or named attributes then use jquery to selected that item and apply a css class to it

1828092
base-class	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	base-class
if you don t want to implements subclassing that has the same interface as base-class why do you inherited at all

1828098
webforms	asp.net
edit the application is using asp.net 2.0 webforms

1828100
http	ssl
i somehow gain access to your cookies or i sniff one of your http request impossible with ssl and find out your sid 123456

1828130
expression	evaluation
still i can understand the logic behind the way the laguage is evaluation expression

1828132
while-loop	arrays
the program never enters the second while-loop .so the contents are never copy-paste to the arrays and then into the file

1828133
datagrid	listbox
any ideas for both listbox and datagrid

1828143
json	xml
makes it easy to do json jsonp and plain ol xml-simple xml types serialization of the return data

1828168
selected	button
selected the div which has role dialog then get the appropriate button in it and set the css

1828176
contains	any
if a.c could at any time contains 0 or false but you still needed the test to pass then use the full typeof test

1828178
alter-table	insert-into
is there any option in sql-server 2005 management studio to change columns in a table by hand and by the sql cmd alter-table or insert-into

1828185
windows-xp	windows
i have a dll made in delphi 7 windows-xp that i want to statically load in a hosts application on windows made in delphi too

1828233
python	c++
a question posted yesterday encouraged me to find the fastest way to compute dot product in python using only the standard-library no third-party modules or c fortran c++ call

1828245
pretty-print	tidy
i looked at this .post php pretty-print html not tidy but it s seems like this won t work since i m grabbing my html from smarty

1828255
pagespeed	yslow
after this using pagespeed and yslow can help you find more about the load speed bottlenecks

1828263
.net	wcf	openrasta	wcf
if you re considering .net there s openrasta a really nice rest framework simple yet powerful where rest was not retrofitted as an afterthought like it was in wcf

1828280
triggers	insert
if .so you can use a triggers to send the email each time a row is insert or updates

1828319
windows-mobile	symbian
since there was a clear void many companies have created stores for mobile apps most of themes support non-j2me apps windows-mobile symbian etc.

1828336
environment	building
edit on another note if you have a project large enough that you re noticing a real difference in compile-time you should probably be considering implements some sort of continuous-integration see environment which will keep a current building ready for you as well as letting you know if something s broken

1828339
atom-feed	rome
i try to publishing atom-feed generator with rome using java 6 se httpserver

1828388
telnet	ssh
is it possible to connect to an ssh server through a telnet connection

1828408
triggers	insert
this allows us to work with hibernate as usual .so .when an insert delete or updates is issued by hibernate on the view in the db instead of triggers are fired for these respective tasks

1828408
any	set
.so in your case create a view hibernate doesn t know any better and is totally transparency and the triggers as appropriate to set your flags and whatever else

1828419
telnet	ssh
you could telnet to a proxy-server that you operate and that then establishes ssh connections to where you want

1828438
telnet	ssh
if you have control over client machine you can write for example in c ssh proxy to telnet proxy

1828451
.when	ready
then .when you are ready to use it just

1828470
value	field
.so far looking good except what i would like to do is return the myfile that not only matches the file named but that al.so has the highest value in field pos

1828479
callback	methods
the jsobject.call java methods converts all the callback parameters to plain jane object

1828489
attributes	properties
i use attributes to decorator the methods with types resource and right properties value

1828493
show	next
i want to show the category named again on the next page .so that the user can see what category the items belong to without going back one page

1828495
windows-vista	windows
i have a wcf syndication service that works fine .when run locally on windows-vista or windows 7 but .when it is deployed to a windows 2003 server it gets a 404 resource cannot be found

1828495
.net	wcf
non-rest wcf service work fine on this machine .so i know that .net 3.5 is registered correctly in iis

1828501
textchanged	textbox
the event that you can use is the textchanged event handler here s an example .when the textbox is-empty the background changes to crimson .when it s filled the background changes to the default colour

1828523
pixels	line
each column of pixels needs to be shifted vertically by varying amounts depending on which column - such that a horizontal line the image would become like a u shape

1828537
margins	padding
the way it is intended that you would handle this is you would use a containers wrapper that has the grid assignment and then add the div with the arbitraty padding margins inside that

1828552
sql-server	sqlcommand
we are talking about a sqlcommand which implies microsoft sql-server

1828554
json	xml
the nice thing is that since it is javascript you can create form field that once filled out regenerate the graphing using json xml data from the server using the new data that the user just typed

1828558
triggers	insert
a triggerss my first idea didn t solve the problem either because it doesn t consider the insert complete until the stored procedure the triggers is calling is complete

1828565
javascript	dom
keep in mind though that with javascript the biggest bottlenecks might not be the actual code but the time it takes for the browser to updates the page if for instances you re constantly changing the dom in your sort algorithm

1828567
subclassing	inherited
qt widget classes have a great many methodss .so inevitably i m going to end up adding a methods to the subclassing with the same named as one inherited from the qt widget

1828567
python	c++
on the other hand maybe all the pyqt methods are just wrapper for c++ code which would of course be unaffected by anything i do in terms of python subclassing

1828569
compact-framework	.net
i was involved in development of a simple in-house mime parsing took few days to hack and parsing 95 of received email which envolved into a commercial product few months of work tons of unittest and hudreds of really vierd test email from the wild and then was modified .so it can be used in compact-framework changes because of memory-constrained devices changes because only small portion of .net is ported to .net cf

1828585
any	set
another alternative if you want to set up a methods that can be overloaded with any user-supplied function or with another of the object s methodss is building a custom descriptor

1828607
python	c++
if the underlaying c++ methods are virtual your python methods that overrides them will be called any time c++ code call them

1828607
python	c++
if they are just regular methods any c++ code will call the original c++ methods by default python code will call the python methods though because it sees the python object and all methods are virtual there

1828611
perl	ruby
i would also use a different language such as perl or ruby for this

1828613
keydown	keyup
the biggest issue seems to be that after some period of time the key begins to repeat firing off keydown and keyup events like a fiend

1828615
any	set
well .when i open any of these cfwindowss it takes the background-image i have and puts it on top of the content even if modal is set to true or false and then after you close the windows it will stay that way

1828616
protected	public
one of the requirements of cls compliance is that public and protected member named should not differ only by case thus ensuring that your libs can be used safely by visual basic code or any other .net language that doesn t differentiate based on case

1828622
opengl-es	fps
with careful programming it is possible to make an opengl-es game with parallax scrolling and relatively small amount of object work at 60 fps even on 2nd gen devices

instances	destroy
office apps do not destroy the first instances created

1828626
selected	button	listboxitem	selected
i want to know how to catch the click for the button not selected the listboxitem

1828637
onkeydown	onkeyup
look at this answer and use onkeyup and onkeydown

1828639
directory	folder
could you not just navigate to the folder where the mysql.data is stored for the old database server copy the directory for each database from the data folder to the new one and then attach the databases to the new mysql.database

1828649
keydown	keyup
i think the answer is that the keydown event and its twin keyup are all the info you get

1828649
keydown	keyup
essentially you can evaluate keydown and keyup yourself but ignore a keyup event if it takes place too quickly after the last keydown .

1828649
keydown	keyup
or essentially you should delay your response to keyup long enough to be sure there s not another keydown event following with something like 0.25 seconds of the keyup

1828654
put	get
i m ready to put a bounty if i still can t get an answer

1828670
highlight	selected
close but i want to highlight the selected category and it doesn t feel like menus are made for that

1828672
click	mouse
for example if there are two mouse button the text would say right click whereas if there s only 1 button the text would say ctrl+click

1828672
carbon	cocoa
is there any api in cocoa or carbon that can identify the numbers of available button on the attached mouse

1828679
keydown	keyup
then using the document pages controls keyup and keydown events updates the arrays with that key s state

1828681
hash	md5
btw to avoid checked the content of the whole file a solution might be to add a new column to your upload table to store some kind of hash of the file see md5 and or sha1 for instances

1828700
python	c++
i m guessing c++ is faster than python and can probably handle larger files more intense algos

1828747
profiling	debugging
such as debugging profiling searching refactoring and many more

1828775
http	ssl
once you have jsse correctly install secure http communication over ssl should be as

1828776
arguments	default
according to the mako docs about filtering you can set the default filtering that are applied inside templatess .when creating a new templates as well as for the templateslookup in which case this would apply by default for all the templatess that it looks up with the default_filtering arguments

1828776
arguments	default
pylons uses this arguments with templatelookup to set the default for your project inside the configuration environment.py file

1828778
contains	set
if you have a detailed functional specifications for the work to be done i can give you an estimate at no charge and we can agree upon a set price for what is contains in and only what is contains in that function specifications

1828784
interlocked	atomicity
the interlocked operation is atomicity

1828802
keydown	keyup
the only possibility is monitor each keyup and keydown and remembering

1828802
keydown	keyup
after some period of time the key begins to repeat firing off keydown and keyup events like a fiend

1828802
keydown	keyup
you ll definitely get keypress repeat and in many browsers you ll also get repeated keydown but if keyup repeat it s a bug

1828802
ubuntu	linux
unfortunately it is not a completely unheard-of bug on linux chromium and firefox .when it is being run under gtk which it is in popular distros such as ubuntu both generator repeat keyup-keypress-keydown sequences for held key which are impossible to distinguish from someone hammering the key really fast

1828813
keyboard	mouse
that cmd might be implements by a right mouse button but it might come from the keyboard or some custom setup for some other hardware

1828814
exception-handling	try-catch
i ve put try-catch blocks both arround the .mymethodasync and in the handler for mymethodcompleted both to no avail as the exception-handling occurs in the generator reference.cs file

1828821
cygwin	gnu	utility	gnu
you could install cygwin then use the gnu utility head

1828829
.net	wcf
if your wcf will have .net clients in other machines choose net.tcp

1828829
.net	wcf
if your wcf will have .net clients in the same machine choose message-queue

1828836
contains	set
you can now test whether a points is in the set using the contains methods such as

1828839
interlocked	atomicity
the interlocked class essentially combines the two step above into a single step providing an atomicity operation

1828840
contains	set
uses a self-signed certificate which obviously isn t contains in the default set of trust managers

1828869
hide	show
hide and show the modal pop-up in code-behind

1828875
put	get
if you put all of this in-place and you still get a blank code file consider reinstalling visual-studio

1828878
nunit	moq
i am starting a new project with nhibernate asp.net-mvc 2.0 and structuremap and using nunit and moq for testing

1828879
put	get
like most tools you get out of them what you put in

1828884
exception-handling	try-catch
inside the main methods put a try-catch and use smtpclient to send notifications about unhandled exception-handling

1828896
python	c++
my advice is to get a prototype working in python and then use boost s python integration to rewrite the performance intensive parts in c++ once you have your algorithm working

1828916
sql-server	oracle
we re using both oracle 11g and sql-server 2008 and need to perform the searches on both .so i d like to stay away from server-specific paradigms although if i have to rewrite .some code to translation from t-sql to pl sql and vice versa i don t mind

1828940
internet-explorer	firefox
which seems to do the job nicely at least in firefox don t have internet-explorer install here to test it...

1828951
gridview	listview
.so i am not using the gridview of the listview anymore

1828951
gridview	listview
however i now have to rework out of a listview with a gridview that i had styled and use this methods

1828959
environment	restart
i ve been meaning to take a look myself - from my understanding jrebel makes it possible to make source code changes and then be able to immediately see the results in a live environment such as tomcat without redeploying and or restart service

1828998
directory	folder
there you can tell which folder from your project should be copy-paste live to what directory on your machine the tomcat webapps yourapp

1829023
javascript	dom
try moving all your javascript include to the bottom of the page and deferring any dom-manipulation or request until the dom is loaded

1829028
nsstring	nsdata	nsarray	nsdate
the possible return types from this methods are nsdata nsstring nsarray nsdictionary nsdate and nsnumber

1829039
derived-class	base-class
if you have a base-class base and a derived-class derived and they both have a non-virtual function in them named foo then

1829042
environment	building
this allows you to write a shell scripting accessing most of the xcode environment variables related to the current building

1829042
environment	building
if you checked the show environment variables in building log and view the detailed building output you can see all the variables available

1829049
derived-class	base-class
a virtual-destructor is needed if you delete a pointers of base-class points to an object of derived-class and expect both base and derived destructor to run

1829095
sniffing	traffic
if you re still transferring over http it s as easy as running a traffic sniffing program like wireshark to see where the application is downloading from

1829099
contains	any
from an seo points of view any of those would be fine since they contains the keyword and search engines generally ignore symbols characters in searches

1829105
credentials	security
i .post a user s credentials to a login action of a security controllers

1829117
aggregate	grouping
in sql you should grouping by all the field that are not aggregate not just val1

1829124
subclassing	superclass
if you use a specific superclass types you ll have to cast the pointers every time you call a subclassing s methods inorder to avoid compiler-warnings

1829126
joystick	mouse
this is true of right-click ctrl-click left-click on a button-swapped mouse 18th-click on a highly configurable mouse a tablet or joystick configure to work as a mouse etc

1829155
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
i would recommend checked out chapter 8 of that book which covers all of the different methods for db2 oracle postgresql mysql

1829156
debugging	trace
i m using fastmm together with jcl debugging info to trace memory-leaks in my application

1829165
shutdown	restart
you can get this kind of error from tomcat if you either try to restart before a previous shutdown has completed or after a shutdown that s not clean - e.g if you have a webapp that starts some manually managed threads and leave them hanging and then call the tomcat shutdown scripting the tomcat service will stop responding on the ports but the process will not die

1829165
shutdown	restart
it looks like the apache scripting on that page call tomcat restart shutdown startup and you then have the tomcat service configure as well .so if the apache scripting loads first tomcat start will be called with tomcat already running and if tomcat is first you ll call shutdown startup with tomcat already running

1829179
contains	set
i d like to manually set the icons to use the 16x16 one contains in the icons i have and if possible change it dynamically at runtime

1829182
javascript	dom
i am a bit new to javascript and was trying to understand how the w3c dom standards and javascript as defined by ecmascript interoperate

1829182
javascript	dom
basically what i am after is - where is it explicit stated that .when execution javascript in a webpage i can call document.getelementbyid someid note lowercase d and that the document properties represents the dom of the document in which the javascript is execution

1829182
javascript	dom
since the abstractview interface implements the document properties as per dom 2 views specifications this presumably is what defined the existence of the javascript global document properties

1829216
value	field
how can i programatically obtain the max_length value for the named field

1829217
selected	textbox
the user will selected which column she he wants to search for then types the text to match in the textbox

1829217
selected	textbox	textchanged	textbox
i then handle the textbox textchanged event to search the datagridview based on the column that is selected in the combobox and the text in the textbox

1829219
arrays	loops
for example let s say i wanted to loops through an arrays of books as input by a user

1829219
arrays	loops
is there a way to achieve what i m after and with each loops of the .times methods create a new arrays

1829250
arrays	loops
a small change i made to your code is instead of doing books.count.times to defined loops and then dereference arrays elements with the counter each is a much nicer way to iterate through a collections

1829259
32-bit	x86
i have a asp.net web .app .net 3.5 sp 1 compiled on a windows-xp x86 32-bit box

1829266
typedef	struct
what i mean is header guard include typedef enums struct function declarations class definitions classes templates etc etc

1829273
value	field
all of our forms retain the previous value that were submitted for each field

1829274
64bit	x86
you shouldn t have too many problems - we building and develop on xp x86 iis 5.1 and deploy to a 64bit server 2008 iis 7 platform

1829274
installation	environment
just make sure you ve got a staging environment to test on even if it s just a windows 7 installation for iis 7

1829284
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
a user can selected as many checkbox as they like then click a button that says create a new quote it ll take the items they checked and clone them into a new table .so they can edit them as apart of the quote

1829302
perl	php
gitstat sourceforge project web-based git statistics interface written in php and perl

1829311
updating	updates
i am basically updating three field in tablea from tableb but the updates should only happen if any of the three field are different

1829314
any	set
for any unit test call to the database object you create a mock for that object set its expectations and result for the call and then hand the mock to your code under test cut instead of the real database object

1829314
typemock	nmock
mind you tools like nmock and typemock make the job easier but it s still hard -- you need to design your code to be tested not just write the code first and pray that you can test it later

1829321
contains	set
that works fine however the _modules object contains mutiple permissions roles depending on what has been set in the database how can i store the multiple value and access them via a switch-case block

1829336
contains	any
nsarray contains any random object and thus objectatindex will return an object of any random types

1829336
contains	set	subclassing	nsobject
first an arrays can contains non nsobject subclassing as long as they implements a certain small set of methods and secondly a specific return-type would required casting

1829336
nsmutablearray	nsarray
now you can call +array on both nsarray and nsmutablearray

1829347
instance-variables	class-variables
the big thing for me was what self means at different points in a class definition and the idea of instance-variables vs class-variables vs singleton variables

1829352
gitolite	gitosis
beside gitosis mentioned in marcin gil answer which required python and setuptools best known probably from seminal hosting git repositories the easy and secure way blog .post and describe in chapter 4.7 of pro git book there is also similar gitolite tool

1829376
put	get
i can get the result i want using a subquery but i can t put a subquery into a view

1829404
ms-access	mysql
let s say i want to transfer data from mysql to ms-access any sample code to do .so

1829412
stderr	stdout
try redirecting the error streaming to stdout like .so and then you should be able to capture both stdout and stderr in a single variables

1829424
build-system	cmake
the author said that the boost cmake build-system had some really good stuff in it that help him get the whole thing building smoothly

1829445
boost	stl
given the numbers of different compilers and the very cryptic warnings that use of the stl and boost gives i usually use google but i stripes as much unique strings from the query as i can removing line numberss etc

1829460
gridbaglayout	miglayout
now that i have custom button that take care of uniformly sizing themselves i could meet these requirements fairly easily with gridbaglayout and probably even more easily with miglayout

1829466
required	checked
the solution is to checked every header to make sure it include any libs it required starting with the ones giving you the errors

1829480
udp	tcp
how udp is different from tcp

1829480
udp	tcp
one last words of caution - you may find yourself re-inventing tcp over udp

1829485
attributes	properties
this is how attributes properties of an asp.net web control can be used

1829485
contains	any
any web link that contains the comprehensive list would be appreciated

1829516
webserver	upload
no the control uses the http protocols to upload files to your webserver

1829517
contains	set	value	field
give that list to fields_for and set up each field_for region .so that it passes the item_id as a hidden value and contains a checkbox such that they modify the _delete field with default-value evaluation true and checked value equating to false

1829560
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade to versioning 2

1829587
pixels	line
one thing we have noticed is that the line tend to take on a mind of their own often out by a few pixels in the preview or running off the bottom of the page

1829597
playlist	playing
i don t know your exact limitations but i have to wonder if the memory required to store a playlist is significant compared to the amount required for playing audio

1829600
getter	setter
if you need any custom logic in either getter or setter you cannot use auto-properties

1829606
rvm	gem
ruby versioning install with rvm are built from source and needs to be reinstall on snow leopard to work with the sqlite3-ruby gem

1829609
authentication	login
.when i run it the web application takes me to the login controllers whereas i m expecting that it should already be authentication given i m populating the credentials

1829635
arguments	default
if you omit the optional arguments in square brackets section is used by default

1829677
base-class	inherited
is there any way to have a model binder for a base-class that will apply to all inherited classes

1829698
gentoo	linux
i would like to believe that the linux kernel i m using gentoo 2.6.30 happily takes care of these details and i can use fcntl and it all comes out in the wash

1829702
value	field
.so say for the sake of simplicity i have a master table contains two field - the first is an attributes and the second is the attributess value

1829702
value	field
if the second field is set to reference a value in another table it is denoted in parentheses

1829718
triggers	insert	put	get
the only other way i can think of to get the numbers of rows that would be returned for a query without doing much work is to put a triggers function on the table that updates the count every time a row is insert updates or deleted based on whether it matches the query

1829732
value	field
i have another similar example where one field depends on the value of another but i don t have the syntax correct

1829744
required	checked
the longer way plus it is much slower is to use reflection to iterate over members of a class namespace and compare by checked if the reflected member .tostring is the same as the string input this required having the assembly loaded beforehand

1829746
versioning	migrate
i migrate a delphi 5 application upwards to delphi 2009 and i m sure it would compile for 2010 including changing to the latest versioning of the jvcl

1829750
getter	setter
writing getter and setter for properties

1829758
textbox	button
but once that button is click i would like to have a textbox that is bound to complexobject.id start showing the id

1829761
shell	bash
just have your administration change your default shell to bash

1829769
cvs	git
i m resurrecting a rather old code project from .when i was using cvs regularly as a component in a new project that i ve already been working on using git

1829769
cvs	git
it s entirely possible i need to do this as a multistep process where i go cvs - fresh git repository and then use something else to get it into the existing git repository

1829773
versioning	upgrade
i used to be able to do this prior to an upgrade from the last versioning of the os but it s been .so long i don t remember what i did the last time

1829774
google-chrome	firefox
my goal is to have the div raise a click event on the file input and this seems to work exactly as i d expect in ie and google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox no file browser is opened .when you click on the div

1829798
postback	ajax
in webforms i would have to not use ajax or use a postback triggers

1829800
click	mouse
having this you could triggers creation of your complexobject from mouse click which you should ideally set up as a cmd binding

1829803
abstract	super
use an orm to abstract the database away and it s super easy

1829822
configuration	environment
.so i want to freeze the rack gem in my dev environment and add it to the project but even though i have this in my configuration environment.rb

1829825
constructor	object
i personally don t want to use it because it required that i write extra code to map flatten between object properties code imo better left in constructor logic

1829825
constructor	object
i use the methods you gave in your .post having the constructor of the model take an object and do all the work

1829825
constructor	object
in addition i always create an empty constructor that takes no parameters .so that i can manually set the properties value of the viewmodel object

1829825
constructor	object
automapper is a great idea and i can see it helping in many situations however i think at some points .when you use it you ll be writing as much code using it if you were to use object constructor

1829826
credentials	security
i .post a user s credentials to a login action of a security controllers

1829829
any	set
if you set the userid stored in the session to be the empty string .when you query on it you will only get users for whom the id is the empty string which shouldn t be any of them

1829838
updating	updates
it would be nice if somehow the file updates was atomicity like updating a database with sql wrapped around a transactional

1829840
logging	trace
would you get anywhere with libunwind to get stack trace and printf-style logging

1829854
put	get
words right 3 more time to put the cursor after the get

1829861
worksheet	excel
do you control the excel worksheet in anyway

1829884
double	int
a class - items which holds a string int and double members

1829884
textbox	button
.when i click the forwarding button on the form i expect all prices over 50.00 to be display in the txtprice.text textbox but it s display all prices instead

1829886
overwrite	copying
how about copying the new versioning of the file with a different named and then do file-move setting the overwrite arguments to true

1829893
autoscroll	panels
to implements this i have tried to set the autoscroll to true on the panels control

1829909
exception-handling	try-catch
i would probably put a try-catch on that block and see if you are getting an exception-handling there

1829926
logout	login
this means a messages is show again to a user if they dismiss it .when logged in logout and then login again

1829935
selected	listbox
anyone know of a smooth way to get all of the selected items in a listbox control by using extension methods

1829946
selected	checkbox
under blackberry-jde choose code-signing and make sure the three rim checkbox are selected

1829949
callback	methods
note you can t just used synchronized with a regular object as a lock as fast callback can release the lock before the lock s wait methods is called

1829951
target-platform	platform
i created my own target-platform and i added rap sdk and other many eclipse platform libs

1829962
hashmap	arrays
since the set of key that would be like variables named of the hashmap does not change over time for each hashmap you could keep an arrays of its key for iterator efficiently

1829968
visualworks	squeak
i m familiar with the visualworks and dolphin versioning of smalltalk but have not previously used squeak

1829973
sinatra	gem
inorder to get the application up and running at the very beginning before adding pony i had to gem unpack rack and gem unpack sinatra into the vendor directory .so this was my config.ru

1829997
updating	updates
regardless of how you are updating your underlying table there is going to be a refresh of some kind unless you are editing just one field and then .post the updates later

1830004
value	field
object members can represent identity state or scalar value per field

1830006
keydown	keyup
also there are keypress keydown and keyup events.

1830026
csv	xml
i ve looked at datasource attributes but it caters to 1 datasource xml file csv per test methods forcing me to write 100s of test methodss

1830028
switching	screens
.when switching between windows in my full screens wpf .app if it is the first time the screens has been show the monitor will go black momentarily before the windows is display

1830033
any	set
i tried it but it doesn t seem to set the inherited for any of the subdirectories

1830033
directory	folder
i need to be able to set the permissions for a particular folder that i create and have those permissions be inherited by all of the files and directory within and beneath it

1830043
default-value	arguments
i would like to pass a pointers by reference to a function such that i can actually change the address the passed pointers is points to and i d like to assign this arguments a default-value

1830043
arguments	default
error c2440 default arguments int cannot be conveted to sometype

1830055
dos	wsh
i m trying to use wsh in-place of dos batch-file

1830069
getter	setter
cocoa s properties are just syntactic-sugar for getter and setter methods

1830080
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari however the call to scrolltop apparently does nothing at all

1830080
google-chrome	safari
is there something funny about the rendering under safari and google-chrome

1830088
textbox	button
for example i would like to replace a button with a textbox in the same positioning and the same dimension

1830090
derived-class	base-class
the trick there is that by defining a methods with the same named and different arguments in the derived-class you are actually hiding the base-class unless you add using base f in the derived-class but then the call would be ambiguous

1830090
default-value	default	default-value	arguments	arguments	default
at the same time since the only added arguments has a default-value you can call it without argumentss and the compiler will add the default arguments for you

1830091
ip-address	proxy
for individual users polling the rss atom-feed there are http-headers involved in the request .so users are tracked by ip-address and .when behind proxy a numbers of proxy include original ip in header this helps .sort between proxy .sources

1830094
hide	next
put them next to each other and use the visible properties to hide one visible false and display the other visible true

1830139
jquery	.post
i also have a blog .post about making .post request from jquery to ruby-on-rails that you might be interested in

1830150
export	report
though not the same as using the report in an asp.net webpage i ve fought similar formatting issues .when export to html pdf and other output

1830162
mocking	stubs
note that here both stubs and mocks can be provided by a mocking framework - the distiction is as much about how they re used as the technology used

1830165
put	get
it works .when you put a button in the panels because it can get the focus

1830179
machine-code	disassembly
can someone come up with a disassembly machine-code assembler listing

1830187
groovy	java
i have some jars that part java part groovy classes and they are compiled using groovy 1.6.5

1830200
any	set
have you used setnet32 to set any informix environment value - a question that only applies to windows platform unix uses regular environment variables and not a central registry

1830204
interpreter	runtime
java doesn t compile directly to machine-code it compiles to bytecode which is then either interpreter or compiled to machine-code at runtime--i have no idea how to get to the machine-code at runtime i just imagine it as this huge mass of shifting changing bytes that just ends up execution damn quickly and reliably

1830215
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
the question why php python and ruby aren t doing this is pretty simple to answer the technique is extremely complicated to implements

1830222
pointers	stack
if the methods is not inline but still compiled into native-code you have an equivalent overhead to calling a methods function using a pointers in c++ plus the machine-specific requirements for instances setting up stack stace arguments epilogue prologue

1830226
value	field
i m trying to make an atomicreference class in c# and i want to keep the field reference protected but i also need to return the value in the get methods

1830229
javafx	swing
we found this 100 swing component called flexgantt and curious to know whether there are any specific requirements for a swing component to be run in javafx environment before we actually spend time to learn javafx

1830236
xsd	xml
you pick the xml file then the xsd file

1830247
getter	setter
my question is simple is using the get set properties of c# considered good better even than writing getter and setter methods

1830249
.net	wcf
if you are using .net 3.0 or better look into wcf windows communication foundation

1830254
data-members	private
in your first example c# automatically generator the private backing field .so technically the data-members is not declare as public only the getter-setter

1830262
selected	button
it works until i come across radio button and selected inputbox

getter	setter
don t worry about getter setter slowing down your code through indirection

1830287
versioning	upgrade
you may want to upgrade to a new versioning of visual-c++ to have the compiler help you

1830294
checkbox	button
radio button and checkbox can have different behavior then other elements

1830301
data-members	private
data-members should be private and automatic properties allow it and give public access on right way

1830301
data-members	private
in that case a setter methods updating the two private data-members in a proper way makes more sense

1830304
pyinstaller	virtualenv	environment	building
the problem is that the manifest embedding support relies on the pywin32 extensions inorder to building which is a pain because without including the hosts s site-packages folder .when i create the virtualenv kinda defeats the points in a building environment i cannot find a way to install the required extensions .so they are accessible to pyinstaller

for query one since you selected from your table it returns one single row with one cell into it value of this cell is 5

1830550
licensing	platform
the licensing is straightforward and if you restart your own company working with a platform you re very good at can give you an edges over working with one that you re just learning

1830555
keydown	keyup
as far as i know the way it works is if a keydown event is received with no keyup event for a certain period of time the repeat delay the key is considered repeat until a keyup occurs

1830555
keydown	keyup
since sending press press press release doesn t work always have you tried recording the time between the keydown and keyup then repeat the cmd in that same time

use either a multple selected box or a series of checkbox to manage many at once

1830580
rome	feed
i created an rss feed with java rome .lib

1830583
protected	public
esentitycollection is a metadata file .so i could not change the access modifiers there from protected to public

1830598
entity	poco
the second way is to use linq to entities or entity sql with entity-framework 4.0 and create the query in code across our conceptual layer and would populate poco object via iqueryable

1830599
contains	elements
this works fine but how would i create a new file that contains the last elements in rides

im trying to add and subtract the time here

1830632
contains	any
continuing with the crescent fresh approach some time ago i had to do numbers validation but i needed to verify if a variables contains a numbers without knowing its types it could be a string contains a numeric value as in this case i had to consider also exponential notation etc. a numbers object basically anything i couldn t make any types assumption

1830639
llvm	gcc
gcc 4.2 apple + llvm

1830639
llvm	gcc
for the way i write i found that gcc + llvm generator the best code

1830649

sscanf returns the numbers of matches that succeeded .so if the int value returned is less than the numbers of field you expected to match you know the string doesn t match your input format

1830663
put	get
put the changes together to get

1830678
cvs	git
figured out how to do what i want based on this answer for combining git repositories using git-filter-branch to make it as if the module import from cvs had been merged directly into the subdirectories desired in the existing git repository

1830678
cvs	git
assuming the target subdirectories in the git repository was completely new or at least contains no files that shared named with those in the cvs module the merge should go off without a hitch

1830679
external	root
is it possible to run external php scripting located inside the root folder of my webserver from within phpmyadmin

1830724
configuration	environment
i have a configuration file at the root directory of my project which contains a class of constants that are environment specific

1830728
python	java
if you have access to a hash-set implementation i believe java c# and python all have them you can just construct two sets a and b and take the set-difference

1830728
hashtable	set
a hash set is implements with a hashtable .so it can be construct in linear time and membership can be tested in constants time

1830731
object-reference	instances
i am getting error in scheduling task messages object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

1830735
highlight	selected
.when i click one row the color of the row has to be changed and .when i click the other row the color of the previous selected row should become normals and the current row should be highlight with the color

to do a proximity search you ll have to calculate the distance from your starting points to all the pointss in your dataset

1830925
pointers	stack
i can t seem to find a pointers in the right directions i am not even sure what the terms are that i should be researching but countless hours of googling seem to be spinning me in circles .so hopefully the collective hive of intelligence of stack overflow can help

1830925
children	nodes	children	tree	expression	evaluation
i m thinking of something like a tree where each nodes represents and expression evaluation its children to true or false

1830925
expression	evaluation
but how would you go about representing this types of expression tree and evaluation the items in a collections against these filtering

1830925
children	nodes
.so for a given nodes evaluate the chilren if you are an and nodes then return true if your expression results in true and all your and children evaluate to true or any or child evaluates to true and recurse up

1830949
selected	button
.when a touch up accurs at the button i want to call the uiimagepickercontroller methods to selected a picture from the iphone libs and display it in the imageview

make a function in main such as public function gotopage ipagenum int void

1831003
perl	awk
in the end no other methods i tried awk perl and other approaches with sed fared any better except -- of course -- a plain ol c implementation

1831003
perl	awk	python	perl
if anything i think it certainly places an upper limit on what kind of performance you can expect from other methods sed awk perl python etc

1831005
value	field
problem here is that iâ m not able to retrieve the value of the privates field like i do with the visible one

1831045

value	field
how to display multiple recording from database having the same field value by using result set statement

1831058
selected	checkbox
try explicit blurring the checkbox before calling selected

1831059
udp	tcp
a key thing you need for this is really fast communication between the client and the server -- udp rather than tcp sockets

1831063
postorder	inorder
the tree s order properties gives you a numbers of order iterator capabilities inorder depth-first breadth-first pre-order postorder

1831067

i have a problem with an nsdata object -writetofile methods and the same with the nsstring object as well

1831067
nsstring	nsdata
.when i compile to software it gives the nsdata or nsstring may not respond to -writetofile messages

1831070
attributes	properties
use attributes on the properties

1831095
arrays	loops
.so you can use a loops to fill in a numbers for each arrays elements - .so go through each pair of nodes and randomly assign a weight 0 for no edges or .some numbers if there is an edges as per weighted-vs-unweighted.

1831154
localization	translation
frameworks frequently utilize a concept of localization files .po files as a standards to do user-interface translation

1831165
value	field
as a side note allow me to note that your database-schema - storing a set of value in a plain-text field - is improper

1831172
clearinterval	setinterval
setinterval returns an id that you can use to cancel the interval with clearinterval

1831201
relational-database	schema
there are better ways using commercial databases like oracle but the star schema makes it available to anyone with an open source relational-database and some time

1831203
python	perl
otherwise there are other tools like perl python you can use

1831212
python	c++
i have been using python native bignums for an algorithm and decided to try and speed it up by converting it to c++

1831212
python	c++
.when i used long longs the c++ was about 100x faster than the python but .when i used gmp binding in c++ it was only 10x faster than the python for the same cases that fit in long longs

1831229
directory	folder
this is because with every directory that is checked out as a working copy the metadata regarding modifications file revision is stored as an internal hidden folder .svn _svn

1831267
instances	private
in my understanding a .lib can access it s own field anyways but .when i give the methods an other instances of .lib it should not be possible for the first instances to access the seconds private field because.

1831267
instances	private
well because it s an other instances and private

1831277
python	c++
of python and c++ whole applications

my intent is i shall only add a bare gridview on the aspx page i wouldn t even add itemtemplate in design-time

1831334
dictionary	namedtuple
namedtuple object can of course be used in other structures e.g a dictionary as mentioned in other answers

1831354
instances	private
private means private to the class not the instances

1831360
private-members	private	private-members	instances	instances	private
it s just accessing a public methods of the instances of the .lib class which in turn accesses the private member field which it is allowed to do since a class may access its own private-members

1831370
put	get
if people feel this would be of benefit to the community please .post a comment if i get enough i ll try and put something up on my github account

1831375
user-controls	tabcontrol
just for the context i m trying to go through the tabcontrol and in each tabpage we have a user-controls .so that s why the getchildatpoint is that particular positioning

1831394
string.format	stringbuilder
string.format and other places where you can use format strings like .appendformat in stringbuilder is an oft overlooked tool

1831408
digits	base
the first .solution treats the positioning as a 64 digits base 16 numbers but as demonstrated there is redundancy in this information being the 3 unused possibilities per â œdigitsâ .so we can reduce the numbers spaces to 64 base 13 digitss

1831416
ubuntu	linux
this is windows on ubuntu linux firefox and tb works ok always

1831423
value	field
i am selected some field from a database which are numeric id value 10 20 100 110 etc

1831519
arrays	loops
assuming that curr_data is an arrays of pointers and what you want to do is to run loops while the second of these pointers is not null while assign its value to curr_ptr i would do

1831526
administration	account
and yes to register an ocx you need an administration or power user account

1831558
union-all	union
you can use union or union-all to combine results from multiple queries

1831558
union-all	union
simple union will remove duplicates union-all will return all results.

1831566
csv	xml
xml would be a good way although if it really is just plain id and string value then a simple csv text file would suffice

1831571
external	root
pygorex1 is correct you should use external configuration-files where external means a file outside the web root

1831594
contains	set
it contains a set of libs called otp and it is possible to reload code into the application on-the-fly without shutting down the application

1831594
interpreter	runtime
that said there are .some fundamental difference between languages to the extent that .some are interpreter .some run off bytecode .some are native compiled .so the performance and the availability of types information and .so on at runtime differs

1831594
interpreter	runtime
python has a global interpreter lock around its runtime libs .so cannot make use of smp

1831598
semantics	keyword
do they just find keyword like we do by using ctrl + f and count or they use some obscure semantics technologies to single out keyword

1831602
value	field
front end versus model requirements a particular form might not know of model s requirement for related data object for example if there s a business-logic rules that value of 3 in a particular field should not be present if the numbers of related recording is less than 5 - the only place that would know that is the model

1831623
webforms	asp.net
here is a image uploader i originally wrote in asp.net webforms for ffckeditor hence the themes no longer matches that i ve modified to work with fckeditor

1831623

updates i ve now added an example showing how you can add this webforms image uploader to a asp.net-mvc project

1831644
invariantculture	cultureinfo
by this definition it must be language independent and follow the xmlserializer conventions or iso 8601 or a cultureinfo invariantculture

1831664
void	main
not sure what your question is but at least change void main to int main

1831672
selected	checkbox	selected	cell
my problem is at the time of replacing text with given text im focusing the particular cell and using setvalueat to replace.but the checkbox in the 6th column are disturbed and text is appearing in that column like yes or no for selected checkbox i used yes and deselected checkbox i used no strings

1831675
eventlet	gevent
gevent is eventlet cleaned up

1831693

i d like to put some interactive widget in the right panels such as checkbox radio button etc but the numbers of things i want to put in may be larger than the size of the whole application

1831693
scrollable	panels
if i want to make that panels scrollable in wxpython or equivalently wxwidgets how would i go about it

1831704
virtual-functions	base-class	virtual-functions	derived-class	derived-class	base-class
it is possible .when there is not virtual stuff in class if derived-class does not overrides any base-class functions but if derived-class has virtual-functions overridess .so to achieve runtime polymorphism its necessary for compiler to initializer vptr of base by vptr of derived and it augments that code

1831704
derived-class	base-class
1 .yes the interface function-prototypes has to be same else base-class function get hidden by derived-class function if parameter defers in derived-class function

1831729
children	nodes	children	tree
the huffman tree would be encode by writing each nodes down as they are traversal in inorder that is first the nodes is output then its children from left to right

1831730
compare-and-swap	atomicity
that s why you should do the selected and insert as a single stored proc read up on atomicity operations - more specifically this is an instances of a compare-and-swap

1831742
http-redirect	request
you could put your static contents on a different domain like static.example.com and disable the http to http-redirect for such request

1831782
callable-statement	jdbc
in jdbc you need to create a callable-statement to execute the procedure

1831788
gtk	gdk
you should go through and see that all the various gtk gdk call succeeed

1831811
canvas	scale
i used a gears worker in conjunction with gears canvas to scale down the selected photos before upload

1831835
gethashcode	equals
it uses il-emit to generator the entire equals and gethashcode function on the first run once for each types used

1831844
space-complexity	time-complexity
as you can see the time-complexity is o n ansd space-complexity is o n

1831850
json	xml
if for whatever reason you end up bypassing qsettings and considering xml for your configuration file i suggest you go look at json or yast depending on how you like the available libs

1831893
order	join
al.so although i don t use mysql my understanding of the straigh_join is that it join that tables in an explicit left to right order .so it may make a difference if the tables are listed in size order from smallest to largest and vica versa

1831894
semantics	keyword
either has keyword semantics close to cars like vehicles

1831896
any	set
you need to set it to accept connections from any ip there is an ip-address overload function for this

1831906
erlang	scala
some languages like erlang scala oz etc

1831921
gethashcode	equals
it uses il-emit to generator the entire equals and gethashcode function on the first run once for each types used

unfortunately the system.net.mail.mailmessage object does not allow me to precisely set the from and sender headers within my email - it forces the value .so that the resulting email contains the phrase on behalf of and does not allow me fine control over the relevant mime headers

1831974
any	set
every uiview has a transform properties that can be set to any affine transform

1831983
implements	extends
bitmapfilter the superclass of all filtering doesn t extends from eventdispatcher class nor does it implements ieventdispatcher interface

1832011
reflection	runtime
also someone mentioned the reflection overhead and i just wanted to points out that there really isn t much of an overhead with this approach - there is no runtime reflection or expression compilation involved see

1832033

please note it is not possible for me to upgrade to the latest versioning and my php knowledge is non-existant

1832101
perl	lua
.so i was wondering are there any alternatives to capistrano written in either perl of lua

1832101
shell	bash
although i found out it can run with the mingw32 bash shell that comes with git for windows

1832136
derived-class	base-class
if you know for sure that the_integer points to a known base-class that has at least one virtual member there might in fact be an advantage knowing that the object is of a specific derived-class

spaces	output
if you want to avoid the spaces at the start or end of the line you must split the output

1836333

its application-pool is set to .net-framework-version .net v4.0.21006.

1836422
selected	checkbox
if you absolutely want a solution that degrades gracefully if javascript is disabled one approach could be to include an extra checkbox that means selected all child items without actually checked the children

1836455
binary-tree	nodes
for a binary-tree that s 2 2 13 nodes which i very much doubt you ll see

1836467

1836478
radio	click
i go into the properties of my project go to the web tab click the user local iis webserver radio box and change the project url to

1836484

then .when the paintcomponent methods is invoked you just loops through the arraylist and draw the circles

1836488
http	ssl
i thought it might be an ssl redirect issue the link before was just http .

1836492
aptana	pydev
i think that the aptana distribution of eclipse the the easiest way to get pydev these days...especially since it s now free for the full versioning

1836497
vb.net	vb6
i have been tasked to convert out vb6 program to vb.net

1836510
derived-class	base-class
this is useful for testing object hierarchies where the unit test class for the base-class is itself the base-class for the test classes for each derived-class

1836521
exception-handling	try-catch
but i find code of if-else on return-value is generally easier to write and read than code of try-catch on exception-handling

cck for drupal has the handy feature of allowing a single cck field to accept multiple value via a add another item button that results in an arrays of data in the nodes

1836562
glassfish	weblogic
now they ve bought sun and glassfish s technology is going to be better going forwarding than weblogic which imo is a bit of a dinosaur and .so expect glassfish to suddenly be rename oas at .some points in the future

1836565
key-value	key
essentially you d need to determine .when the value is an object and use that to append the key in the object to the outer key .when constructing the key-value arrays

1836568
similarity	distance
this is a purely distance based metrics linear relationships do not play into the similarity score .so the 4 5 6 and 3 6 9 users would not have a perfect similarity score

1836580

1836613
perl	ruby
you could do something using perl or ruby

1836622
implements	final
this seems to indicate that the final approach above implements insertmenusb ... should work

1836632
compact-framework	.net
the full .net has the enum pixelformat.format1bppindexed but the .net compact-framework does not supported it

1836638
32-bit	64bit
with regards to the hash it should be a wide as possible ideally a variables length hash made from append say 32-bit or 64bit hash one per page

1836654
firefox	safari
the same code run in firefox and safari does not alter the height of the div

1836654

the stored procedure would have an output parameter that you would populate with the identity of the newly insert row

1836712
cucumber	selenium
there is a ruby-on-rails plugins named mainline which could be the glue you re looking for to get cucumber + selenium watir + rcov working together

1836716
selected	checkbox
you can overrides the selected properties for the checkbox

1836733
persistent	transient
it will however still cascade the save operation through the collections onto the contains entities which include persistent transient instances

1836733
persistent	transient
this is why you get an insert with no sortorder - nhib is persistent your transient child object

1836735
contains	elements
the form being show is contains within an absolutely positioning div and is laid out using ol li elements

1836742
any	set
anyone got any suggestions for a better way to set this up

1836767
web-services	api
you can get all from alexa api alexa web-services

1836776
duplicates	elements
i m not sure if you are using to duplicates your elements but if you are the issue might stemming from passing in the true flag

1836785
contains	set
that way the height of the contains text won t matter .so long as you take the tallest of the three and set that as the default height

1836812
shell	bash
if your remote has bash shell

1836818

1836838
difference	factors
benchmarking this will only show difference that are not significant and due to other factors gc kicking in etc.

1836838
double-quotes	single-quotes
i used to suggest you use double-quotes everywhere makes it easier to actually add that later on but i now use single-quotes unless i need interpolation n etc.

1836838
contains	any
i like it visually and it s slightly more explicit since there s no need to parsing the string to see if it contains any expression

1836841
display	height
querying scrollheight may triggers a non-performant dom recalculation and manually managing height tops with positioning absolute is likely faster since it s not a recursive checked on margins for blocks and other css display types

1836851
versioning	staging
aside from interactive staging the other important usage of the index is during a merge conflict git stages the three versioninging of the file .so it knows the file isn t ready .so there s a versioning on hand that isn t littered with conflict markers

1836869
msbuild	nant
obviously msbuild will continue to advance but given all the extra tasks that can be accomplished using nant why has development suddenly stopped given that many open source and i assume commercial applications depend on nant

1836871
telnet	ssh
also you don t want to allow configuration of your firewalls via either telnet or snmp - ssh is the only way to go

1836887
linux	unix
there are linux unix cmd of all levels of complexity

1836902
msbuild	nant
from the looks of it it can do building without requiring nant looks like it can do some msbuild stuff directly but i haven t used it

1836903
revision	svn
however .when you use hgimportsvn to set up your copy of the svn tree you set the initial repository to import and there is no way using hgsvn to remove those initial revision .when they move out of the six month windows

1836921
entity-framework	nhibernate
finally you may want to consider introducing a data-access-layer into the project that can return object from your datasource might be worth having a look at nhibernate linq-to-sql or entity-framework for this

1836933
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
also see if you can use a webkit browser safari or google-chrome or maybe firefox to see if the javascript files are being transfer

1836935
groovy	java
i ve found that more experienced java programmers have been very productive with the groovy and grails stack .when compared to more junior programmers

1836935
groovy	java
productivity one of the primary advantages here - quick prototyping rapid development is a breeze with groovy grails though it helps to have folks on staff that have developed in java or ruby to understand what the grails framework is actually doing under the hood

1836936
32-bit	64bit
you cannot invoke a 32-bit libs from a 64bit executable currently in windows

1836941
spaces	output
how many value are there in your output spaces how many different value do you map to in the range 0-0xfffff

1836941
spaces	output
using randomized universal hashing you can come up with a collision-free hash-function with a table no bigger than 2 time the numbers of value in your output spaces for a static table

1836948
google-chrome	safari
as dcneiner points out html text are jquery properties and supported across browsers while innertext is not implements by all browsers although it works in the most recent versioning of ie safari and google-chrome

1836948
jquery	.post
see dcneiner s .post or the jquery docs for some other things that make text awesome

1836959
textbox	button
how do i add a new item from a textbox and button on a windows form at the end of an arraylist which references a class

1836963
value	field
to get the value of a field for a specific object use getvalue and pass the object for which you want to get the value

1836993
linked-list	heap
they are frequently implements in continuation-passing styles which means the call stack is probably a linked-list allocated on the heap

1836993
pointers	stack
this makes it trivial to pass a pointers to stack as a continuation since you don t need to overwrite stack context .when you pop the current frame and push a new one

1836997
selected	textbox
acts as a prompter that is the person types say a letter l in the textbox and the options starting with l are display for the user to click and selected

1836997

in the upcoming c++ standards rvalue references can be used to keep your temporary object alive and would fix the issue that you re having

1837075
hide	show
wrap the bighairydommanipulation and hide call on a callback for the show animation

1837077
archetypes	appfuse
i think you have to run these from within a project created with one of the appfuse maven archetypes

1837084
implements	extends
basically you can just extends it and implements your logic in onrun methods

1837085
value	field
what you re missing is that in the ieee-754 formats value that have a zero exponent but non-zero significand field called denormals do not have an implicit leading bit

1837087
data-members	private
this class will contains the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers in private data-members defined as double

1837087
data-members	constructor
your class should contains a constructor that allows the data-members of the imaginary numbers to be specified as parameters of the constructor

1837087
data-members	constructor
a default non-parameterized constructor should initializer the data-members to 0.0

1837100
dbd	dbi
if oracle cannot readily be made to handle that then consider whether perl + dbi + dbd informix + dbd oracle might be a toolset to use - this allows you to connect to both the oracle and the informix se databases and transfer the data between them

1837104
firefox	safari
in firefox or safari in developer mode click the red div and the console will show

1837108
constructor	object
the clr will initializer field to their default-value during object constructor

1837111
for-loop	arrays
edit if you have an arrays of object and you wanted to do it in a way other than a for-loop with tests you could do this

1837137
anonymous-class	nested-class
3 convert member types to top level - frequently after making an anonymous-class into a nested-class i discover that the class is useful elsewhere

1837150
constructor	object
since there is a constructor which can accept the arguments passed into the f function the complier creates the object on-the-fly before putting the argumentss on stack

1837156
sniffing	packets
packets sniffing

1837157
account	api
then you can either access that account using regular pop3 or imap api or simply forwarding all email to your real account

1837162
nsbutton	nscell
on cocoa desktop there s nscell which is a lightweight alternative to nsbutton but that s an older technology before calayer and core-animation they don t conflicts with each other

1837166
contains	elements
you arrange calayer in a heirarchy .so - whilst the complexity of the tree of views will depend on other user-interface elements you wish to have - you ll have a calayer contains the 900 sub layer

1837176
groovy	java
grails_home src java org codehaus groovy grails plugins web taglib applicationtaglib.groovy

1837178
value	field
look at the value of the assembly named field

selected	cell
this will cause only the selected text to be display .when then cell is not being editing the combobox will not show up until you edit the cell

1837217
put	get
not sure how to get started but one idea was just to put logic statements comparing the dates between these blocks then adding the total trues

1837233
linux	unix
if you want deep dive into linux hacking read already mentioned advanced programming in the unix environment

1837233
python	java
data crunching solve everyday problems using java python and more data crunching solve everyday problems using java python and more - book not about c nor linux but it s help to solve data-processing task smartly

1837234
selected	button
as the title says how do i disable the selected button text in a gridview after click it once

1837283
python	perl
jdk s concurrency package boost s thread libs perl s thread libs not in python though all implements barrier i haven t come across a need for using a barrier .so wondering what would a typical use case be in multithreading applications

1837337
attributes	properties
properties like .backgroundcolor and .size are these the same thing as the properties and synthesize and if .so is this the same thing as an attributes

1837337
attributes	properties
meaning can properties and attributes be interchangeable terms in objective-c or are they different

1837356
attributes	properties
i personally use attributes and properties simultaneously in objective-c although other developers may disagree

1837364
show	next
.when viewing the slidershow it performs one too many next s resulting in no image being show for one slider

1837369
selected	button
is there a javascripting or jquery scripting that can vertically centering the screens around a focussed input textarea selected button field instead of aligning to the bottom

1837370
subclassing	base-class
.when you overrides the function declare in the base-class all other functions with that named becomes hidden in the subclassing

1837374
object-reference	instances
if for some reason the user left the textbox firstname blank the resulting properties person.firstname become null and model.firstname.trim throw an exception-handling object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1837394
shell	bash
this assumes your default login shell is bash .

1837397
mechanize	selenium
twill and mechanize don t do javascript and qt and selenium can t run on .app engine 1 which only supports pure python code

1837397
python	java
.app engine .app versioning in java and python can use the same datastore .so you could keep .some part of your .app in python.

1837400
build-process	ant
words cannot express how freeing it is to test changes by saving the file you re working on and click reload on a browser vs running an ant maven build-process

1837404
.when	ready
.when tomcat runs the jvm loads the classes required for any given page and keeps them in memory .so they re ready to go .when an http-request hits the webserver

1837410
getter	setter
there is a designer.cs file attached and each field has a getter and setter

1837418
margins	padding
the problem i m getting is that for some reason in only internet-explorer 6 is that an extra padding margins of 10px is being added on the right hand side of my #wrap class

1837418
margins	padding
as you can see there is no margins padding on the right hand side the red area with ie7 but in ie6 there is an extra 10px

the standards setup for programmers really required three hands two for the keyboard and one for the mouse

1837440
keyboard	mouse
i m not blessed with an extra hand .so my hands have to shift from mouse to keyboard to mouse

1837441
instrumentation	profiling
alternative frameworks rely on things like profiling api or the java 5 se instrumentation feature the java.lang.instrument package to modify cil or bytecode at runtime which makes any dependency mockable

1837441
rhino-mocks	moq
as for the conventinal mocking frameworks for .net the two most popular ones currently are rhino-mocks and moq

1837448
document-ready	ready
al.so imho i am not quite sure you have to call the ready handler even after the pages ready event was triggerss because if you install the ready handler if the document-ready event was already triggers jquery call that handler immediately .so it never loses that event even if your code added a handler too late - that is way after document-ready was still done

1837448
document-ready	ready
well in the end please just take care of ready events and handler that will be install after the document-ready is already done

1837471

additionally the get methods returns the xmlhttprequest object data .so you might want to look into setting the types of data to be returned to callback xml html scripting j.son j.sonp or text

1837494
rendering	redraw
setneedsdisplay is a nstextview methods that tells the graphics rendering it needs to redraw the image because the data has been modified

1837502
input-field	textbox
the model binder is smart enough to set an empty input-field textbox to

1837506
value	field
i thought you only wanted to remove the field value pair from the get request

1837507
jquery	.post
you can take advantage of that now if you want by using jquery s datafilter callback to avoid the eval .when possible put it in .ajaxsetup to affect all .ajax .post getjson call automatically

1837511
triggers	insert
you could change the triggers to an instead of insert

1837521
javascript	dom
disclaimer i m professionally involved in the creation of javascript dom based games and programs

1837530
32-bit	64bit
the most likely explanation is that you are trying to link a 64bit versioning of the mysql libs with a 32-bit-only versioning of python currently all of the python.org install for os x are 32-bit only

1837540
keyboard	mouse
most things that can be done with a mouse while you re programming can be done with a keyboard

1837555

1837567
hashtable	sorted
put the cases in a sorted structure with non linear access like a hashtable

1837591
any	set
however without more info about the system.in question it s hard to suggest an alternative .so i d say use a crontab to remove any transactional older than 10 mins that haven t been set to accepted

1837605
apache-config	.htaccess
most likely your apache-config does now allow auth directives in .htaccess in that directory and or location

1837638

1837659
constructor	object
creates a complexnumber object using the user provided value as parameters to the complexnumber constructor

1837686
binary	hex	decimal	hex
the basic idea i have is to make a function from the current hex decimal binary value used for each character to the 128 value i would have in the seven bit encoding then scan through the file and write each modified value to a new file

1837686
decimal	hex
.so if the file looked like i ll use a decimal example because i try not to have to think in hex

1837686
binary	hex	decimal	hex
how do i open the file to read write in binary decimal hex rather than just text

1837687
codeigniter	cakephp
with that knowledge you should be able to jump into a framework like cakephp or codeigniter with a strong appreciation for what they re doing for you

the idea is that if the person selecteded a particular value of a selected box an onchange event handler will make a particular div contains those form elements disappear.when they choose any other option the div will reappear

1837972
value	field
because you re testing a calculation against a field and not against a literals value any index on startdate can be used

execute	declare
execute sql declare acursor cursor for selected col1 col2 into var1 var2 from t where pk a

1838100
cursor	row
i think declaring a cursor to fetch a single row from a table based on primary key make less sense if the single row could be retrieved directly instead

1838104
defined	declare
generally as mahlerfive points out it s good practice to declare all of your functions before you defined them and not to place function declarations inside of other functions

1838105
user-controls	tabcontrol
create a tabcontrol user-controls with all of the tabs that you want to display

1838105

i had a try-catch around the code logging the exception-handling didn t realise that a listview item i had set in a class also required a delegation to make a call to it as well as the form component

1838227
hide	show
alternatively you could use a decorator where you use a regular asynccallback and decorator it with another one that show hide the pop-up

1838227
hide	show
alternatively if you use a command-pattern you could just add these events to your command-pattern implementation and you can register a handler that show hide a pop-up every time a request is send received

1838230

in case you are interested i take the view that it is ok to leave out the getter and setter methods for a private inner class especially if the field are declare as final

1838348
groovy	java
i see this for mixing java and groovy

1838348
groovy	java

keyboard	mouse
there are literally hundreds of keyboard mouse automation apps out there

1838351
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
updates just re-read the question i dont think what you want is the ability to recording keyboard mouse actions as its not guarenteed that the application will keep up with the mouse click windows could open in slightly different places or there could be a slight delay etc...

1838355
keyboard	mouse
you should hook keyboard and mouse events see process global mouse and keyboard hooks in c# low-level mouse hook in c# or process global windows mouse and keyboard hooks in c#

1838358
linux	unix
and surely all operating systemd rely on high performance tcp-ip .so much that it cannot be significantly slower than unix .sockets - linux does all .sort of zero-copy tricks even for network traffic .so it surely must be fast for loopback

1838395
display	width
if you are using a textblock within the control to display the text then simply set the width to the width of the parent control and the textalignment properties

1838400
gridbaglayout	miglayout
i tried miglayout for something recently and was disappointed to find that the miglayout actually ended up being more complicated to use than the gridbaglayout in that particular case

1838400
gridbaglayout	miglayout
it s fine to split a gui into panels for different logical sections but i think if you re creating a whole bunch of unnecessary extra nested panels just for the purpose of positioning components you clearly need to learn how to use a gridbaglayout or other similarly advanced layout like miglayout

1838420
removeclass	addclass
i m thinking i am going to need a lot of if s with hasclass removeclass and addclass but i want to see what the .so community thinks

1838421
any	set
i don t know of any methods that checkeded for this specifically however i imagine it d be possible to set up an nsdictionary with paired value for each table of characters encode into unicode then run a checked to ensure that the generator value falls within the ranges specified by one of the paired value

1838458
communication	messages
all caching communication between cores and tile will thus be handled by the mesh data communication systemd and the dedicated messages buffering on each tile

1- after textchanged for textbox checkedchanged for checkbox selectedvaluechanged for combobox..

1838494
keyvaluepair	key
the first versioning will add a new keyvaluepair to the dictionary throw if key is already in the dictionary

1838498
constructor	object
my current theory is that since .when you invoke a constructor there s no object yet .so it should be a bit different maybe there should be a predefined function of the same named in object or protoobject but if that s the deal then how would one go about defining a none standards namedd constructor without changing object

1838516
key-value	key
use the add methods to add new key-value pair existing key will not be replace an argumentexception is throw

1838516
key-value	key
use the indexer if you don t care whether the key already exists in the dictionary in other words add the key-value pair if the the key is not in the dictionary or replace the value for the specified key if the key is already in the dictionary

1838564
value	field
i have some code to find and replace field in a words document with value from a dataset

1838575

all this could also be done using ajax but iframe solution is quite easy as you just need to load ready page and all postback are already handled by original page and separated from master-admin-page

1838594
serialization	unmarshalling	serialization	marshalling
this will involve some kind of serialization although it might be called something else - marshalling unmarshalling depending on the rpc protocols

webforms	asp.net
please end your session and start again in my asp.net webforms

1838782
constructor	private
since assistant is essentially a collections of free functions i would go with the static approach maybe even make the constructor private

1838786
constructor	object
i d use the object approach - it seems a bit more standards and similar to the way you pass functor to stl algorithms - it s also easier to extends by allowing parameters passed to the constructor of the assistant to influence the results of the operations etc

1838791
put	get
i ve got all of the field on the edit form bound to the appropriate core data entity via an nsarraycontroller and i ve got an awakefromnib methods install to handle calling the recording but i m not sure what to put inside the methods to get the recording to display

1838800
push	pull
i believe clickonce is a pull model although by specifying minimum versioning we can kind of push

this is on windows-xp but other windows os s should be similar

1838894
administration	account
a simple thing to do if you re in a dev environment is to just give the service an administration account temporary firstly cause it ll tell you whether the crash is being caused by lack of access cause it ll work and secondly if it s not it ll allow it to write to the event-viewer

1838897
highlight	selected
call it doesn t highlight until you click into the treeview anywhere in the treeview not necessarily on to the nodes that you want to be selected

1838933
exception-handling	try-catch
if you are going to get into a deep nasty error testing statement like you have then you might want to consider wrapping it with a single try-catch and throw the appropriate application specific exception-handling from within the if-statement and catch those specific exception-handling in the catch block letting all the others go to be caught further up the chaining

1838936
put	get
if we wanted to put a mockups on a website which allows the user to get a feel for the user-interface gather .some data change .some settings etc. what are .some good methods to do .so

i have also tried to set up the job from sratch with settings identical to mainline with the addition of the newbranch specifications without any luck

1839003
hash	md5
to ensure that no one messes with the information during the transfer a md5 hash is calculated at both ends-with a special key that is not sent to them

1839003
hash	md5
is there a way to calculate md5 hash in java with iso-8859-1 strings

1839010
linked-list	arrays
use a linked-list instead of a fixed arrays then you can easily and cheaply delete entries as well as add

1839020
attributes	properties
this problem could be solved if there were a way to change a properties inside the attributes lets call it autocalculatedstringattributes at runtime

1839026
codeigniter	cakephp
commonly-used php frameworks out there at the moment include codeigniter and cakephp

1839029
exception-handling	try-catch
depending on the complexity of logical evaluation going on if the first clause evaluates to true and you possibly implements lots of other tests any numbers of which could result in errors all of which you want handled in the identical way i d consider it mandatory to either raise a specific exception-handling call a methods to handle the error or put the whole thing in a try-catch block which can be quite ugly if there s a lot of code

1839047
callback	methods
basically you ll be constructing your callback as a hierarchy of classes .so that the signature of the main methods is the same a methods that takes an iasyncresult and returns an image but the way each delegation which is now a full class implements the call is unique for each implementation

1839055
updatepanel	datapager

1839208
xml-libxml	xml-twig
for large xml files you can either use xml-libxml in dom mode if the document fits in memory or using the pull mode see xml-libxml reader or xml-twig which i wrote .so i m biased but it works generally well for files that are too big to fit in memory

1839214
sql-server	ms-access
in sql-server it is apparently possible to use compute or rollup but these are not supported under ms-access

1839219

but you can add properties and methods to an attributes class that can run code and return relevant info after the attributes object is construct

1839474
supervisor	yaws
a quick look at the kernel supervisor tree or mnesia or yaws will show you what a normals supervisor tree looks like

1839478
zeromq	qpid
therefore i would look at product implements in c++ such as qpid or zeromq

1839478
zeromq	qpid
zeromq will probably perform a lot better because you can have peer to peer channels whereas qpid is using a broker architecture which had a step

order	add
add an auto increment only if the order will ever be relevent in later uses

1839603
attributes	properties
if the caller respects system.componentmodel you can attach attributes at runtime to types etc very easily - but much harder on individual properties especially in the case of datatable etc since that has a custom descriptor model via dataview

windows-vista	windows
prior to windows-vista and windows

1840526
margins	padding
i think the problem is that you re using simple_list_item_2 which has some padding margins built into it

1840532
sql-server	oracle
if you use sql-server and oracle at work then i d go for one of those

1840541
punctuation	words
if you try doing it by hand i would suggest applying some kind of normalize to your strings lowercase them remove punctuation maybe replace common abbreviations with the full words dr

1840548
similarity	distance
i would look at producing a similarity comparison metrics that given two object strings perhaps returns distance between them

1840568
multiplication	division
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loops and it s clear that a does not change between two iterator for instances because it s a const variables then the original versioning can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler move the computation of 1 .

1840570
32-bit	64bit
this compiles just fine in c# but try and fine a machine that doesn t throw on it is a rather futuristic thought and frankly the field in the arrays class holding the length is an int which means this will always throw on 32-bit but not necessarily while extremely likely on any 64bit implementation

1840571
dictionary	arrays
however i d like to deserialize my object to a dictionary consisting of either strings arrays or dictionary such as system.json does with silverlight .when i say jsonobject.parse myjsonstring

1840608
xelatex	latex
just don t forget to replace your favorite latex compiler by the appropriate one xelatex or lualatex

1840609
primitive	int
since java 5 primitive and their wrapper classes int and int will be automatically converted between each other as necessary

1840612
arrays	map
given that it is easy to create associativity arrays there is no reason why you can t map a key to a function or value which will probably outperform switching statements for anything other than trivial dataset

1840614
highlight	cell
what would cause a tableview cell to remain highlight after being touch

1840614
highlight	cell
i click the cell and can see it stays highlight as a detail view is pushed

subtraction	addition	subtraction	division	addition	division
i know i can split the numbers between two variables and i have done that for addition and subtraction but never division

1840670
margins	padding
in css2.1 the padding border and margins are all outside the height and width of an elements

1840670
margins	padding
this means your elements are 100 of the windows height plus the padding plus the margins plus the border

1840674
logout	login
the web .app is on a single jvm uses tomcat and has standards web functionality - login logout basic security etc

1840705

1840720
exponent	modulo
i m looking for a python libs where i can import public or private ca signed certificates and automatically encrypt or decrypt messages in string.format i viewed the crypto libs embedded in python source but i don t know how to use the hex modulo and exponent in this part of the certificate

1840723
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
it s sql is much more ansi-compliant than mysql - .so later using oracle sql-server sqlite etc should be very straight-forward

1840723
postgresql	mysql
in 2002 i d say mysql definitely but in 2009 i d say postgresql instead most of the time

1840752
quirks-mode	doctype
you ve got a bad doctype that will throw ie into quirks-mode as well as missing tags double charset call that should be utf instead of 8859 duplicates meta-tags etc...

1840762
verilog	vhdl
it s not vhdl specific verilog and vhdl examples are presented side by side or even hdl-heavy ndash

1840778
udp	tcp
this is done using the more fragments bit in the flags field and the fragment offset field combined with the identification field to distinguish fragments from different datagram then you use the protocols field to identify tcp and udp packets and the header length field to find the start of the corresponding header

1840778
udp	tcp
the next step for both tcp and udp is demultiplexing separating out the various connections in the capture packets streaming

1840790
derived-class	base-class
for example if a customer is a kind of per.son then you d probably have a per.son base-class and a customer derived-class and .so on

1840792
versioning	upgrade
you only need to load the new module and the gen_server running the old versioning will upgrade since it call the new module

1840795
subtract	add
now we have to add up the volumes of these solids for the upper faces and subtract them for the lower faces to get the volume of the poyhedron

1840795
cartesian-coordinates	points
the first is easy if you have the cartesian-coordinates of the points the second is easy if the points are order and you can combine them and kill two birds with one stone

1840813
tapestry	jsf
take the presentation layer of your code written with jsf and then rewrite it using tapestry

1840823

if it does contains the accno in the list already dont add the line to the recording set and move to the next line

1840847
export	csv
he wrote an sql adaptive sybase sql anywhere query to export the students to a csv file like we needed

1840855
binary	octal	binary	hex	octal	hex
this is part of why ada uses the form 16# to introduce hex constants 8# for octal 2# for binary etc

1840855
octal	hex
in fact studies have show that octal and hex are pretty much the sweet spot for human-readable representations that are binary-compatible

1840855
octal	hex
hex is actually a bit too much already but octal has the problem that it doesn t evenly fit in a byte

1840920
contains	set
if you want users proxy to caching your site s images the best way to do that would be to set up the caching in iis on the folder contains your static-content images javascript css with suitable caching-busting strategies in-place to ensure that if you do updates them the calling clients get the latest versioning

1840924
octal	hex
it should also be noted that some languages use o### for octal and x## or h## for hex as well as many other variations

1840928
updating	updates
locking on something while the data is being updates won t work because the updating could take several seconds

1840931
void	main
int main void

1840968
unsigned	short
i recently wrote some code that uses the same unsigned short to store two value a result and an id for example

1840982
nsstring	nsdata
i guess i will use nsxmlparsing initwithdata nsdata to construct the parsing but how will i format or cast my nsstring of xml formatted text into a proper nsdata object that nsxmlparsing will understand and parsing

1840990
required	checked
i was thinking about creating a setinterval that would checked a blank page that required auth

1840991
serialization	marshalling
.when using coldfusion multiserver configuration with clustered coldfusion instances you can use session replication in the cluster but use it sparingly since caching data is constantly serialization and marshalling to the other servers in the cluster

1840992
constructor	object
a well-structured systemd will demand dependent object as constructor parameters

1840992
constructor	object
how you invoke those constructor is independent of structuremap or any other technique but can only be specified at the points at which the top most object is used

1840999
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
as you are coming from a background of oracle and sql-server i would definitely recommend going the postgresql route it runs native on windows as a service much like mssql oracle as well as on nix systemd

1840999
postgresql	mysql
also starting with versioning 8.3 of postgresql it is pretty much on-par performance wise with mysql it isn t like the older 7.x versioninging which were s-l-o-w

1840999
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntax and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely

1840999
postgresql	oracle
in fact postgresql acts a lot like oracle in how it handles database locking and simultaneous reading

1841001
callback	methods
because of this error the post_image methods does not complete successfully .so the javascript callback won t ever fire - i basically don t have a way to tell if the image was saved successfully

1841001
jquery	.post
.so i thought i would use the get_img_binary methods of ofc2 to get the binary-data of the image and use jquery to .post the binary-data to my perl scripting

1841006
apache	vhosts
i use php and apache and i know about virtual hosts but i m wondering where i need to put the vhosts code

1841017
tapestry	spring
spring or tapestry would be good options for new learnings

1841020
nsstring	nsdata
the way you get the nsstring into the nsdata is going to dictate the encoding using datausingencoding

1841025
32-bit	64bit
recently someone tried to run my application on a powerbook g4 and got a bad cpu types in executable error which i think is because their cpu is powerpc rather than intel and also possibly 32-bit not 64bit

1841047
jquery	.post
i have a page with an input box whose onkeyup fires a jquery ajax .post based on what was typed a search field

1841047
jquery	.post
here is the jquery ajax .post

google-chrome	firefox
now in firefox and google-chrome all those divs show up fine and dandy but in ie only the first div is display in the containers div on the page

1841091
.net	wcf
though .net syndication is part of wcf it is part of .net 3.5 not 3.0

1841091
.net	wcf
the 2003 server had 3.0 install which is the reason why the other wcf service present on the machine were functional but did not have .net 3.5 install

1841094
subclassing	superclass
you are shadow your named variables .so that the subclassing s named variables and the superclass s named variables are two different variabless

1841101
hide	show
if your scrollview is going to be show full-screen in portrait orientation you should use the following sizes assuming you don t hide the status bar

1841113
worksheet	excel	selected	cell
user selected a cell within an excel worksheet

1841113
selected	button	selected	cell
the click of the button inside the web application causes a string to drop into the open excel spreadsheet at the cell that was previously selected

version-control	git
much of pinax is django-apps which are developed separately from pinax and are brought in via version-control systemd subversion mercurial git etc

1841172
display	width
.so if it s certain the elementss are going to be ab.solutely-positioned .so they don t cause a layout change .when display simply use css visibility hidden to hide your elements instead of hide and you should be ok measuring the width

mstest	moq
i m creating tests with mstest and i ve mocked the contains class igetrightsproxy in moq

1841176
callback	methods
how can i invoke the callback .when this methods is called in the test

1841185
pixels	line
start on line 0 and find the first non blank pixels

1841185
pixels	line

1841192
radians	cos	radians	sin	cos	sin
just remember that cos and sin are your friend and there are 360-degrees in a cricle or 2pi radians depending on your math package

1841192
any	set
you would al.so set a bounding circle .so that any points outside that circle would not be draw

1841195
derived-class	base-class
this appears several time in virtual methods of a base-class where a derived-class is expected to offer an implementation where applicable

1841207
hide	show	fadein	show	fadein	hide	fadeout	fadein	fadeout	show
replacing my fadein fadeout by show hide solves my problem but it would be more usable if i could add those animation on this.

1841215
selected	cell
for these cell with the formula answers i need to apply conditional formatting but i have 7 conditional .so i ve been using selected case in vba to change their interior background based on their numbers

1841215
macros	let	.when	ready
i can input my data let the formula work and .when everything is ready i can run the macros and format those specific cell

1841215

facebook-page	facebook
is there any way to add a comments tab to the facebook-page that would show and allow the user to add their comments direct in facebook

1841229
hosts-file	hosts
to determine if your apache instances will handle it edit your local etc hosts-file or windows equivalent - systemroot system32 drivers etc hosts .so that the desired virtual named is points to your server

1841239
value	field
in the run event the field don t appear to have value yet

1841249
contains	set
what this involves is setting positioning relative on the table you can then set positioning absolute on the contains divs these will then scroll with table and is a more reliable way of setting the divs location and will work better across browsers

1841262
exception-handling	try-catch
if it crash put it in a try-catch and see what the exception-handling is

1841295
constructor	private
try removing the public constructor leaving only the private one

1841337
communication	messages
twitter has been useful where i work for communication messages on a broadcasting level

1841352
arrays	map
you may need another hashtable to map from cluster to arrays index value but that s not too much aswell

1841356
scripting	shebang
since i put my scripting into distributions the installation process automatically fixed up the shebang line .so it doesn t matter what i put there

1841362
callback	methods
i am not sure how to get around this...i thought i could use the callback of the filetree options callback methods provided but that is not fired on selection of the file only the initialization of the file tree

1841368
default-value	arguments
note that you can solve this by adding an extra arguments to the lambda and assign it a default-value

1841369
scala	java
as i understand martin odersky s rationale for including null in scala is to easily use java libs .so all your api s don t appear to have object

triggers	insert	updating	updates
you could have a after insert triggers which does what you want now plus an after updates triggers which would be updating rows in tablea instead of insert new ones

1841435
deployment	install
is there a way to install the clickonce application without any user integration inorder to automate the deployment process

1841435
deployment	install
my problem comes from the fact i don t know how the clickonce deployment works under the hood i don t even know if it is possible to run an clickonce install from the cmd line... and as clickonce application are not packaged at all like windows-install i am not sure of anything

1841438
contains	any
one holds a row per session with some session data id timestamp ip username if any other stuff and a session_data table with a few rows per session each row contains a sid referencing the sessions table

1841438
log4net	nlog
one caveat i did setup nlog one time to log the sessions and session data but nlog and i suppose log4net as well logs on its on thread and does t always write to the database

1841442
triggers	insert
you said you have a triggers that fires .when a row is insert into tableb

1841442
triggers	insert
.so you have the triggers to fire on insert

1841461
unsigned	short
how can i declare an unsigned short value in java

1841479
any	set
i m guessing there might be some -xx option we can set to achieve this but i an t see any such thing in the docs

1841507
contains	set
but the proof of the statement the surfaces of a convex polyhedron are constraints in a delaunay tesselation is rather simple by definition a simplex or subsimplex is a member in the delaunay tesselation if and only if there is a n-sphere circumscribing the simplex that strictly contains no points in the points set

1841517
rollback	commit
first of all you shouldn t commit in loops - it is not efficient generator lots of redo and if some error occurrs you can t rollback

1841519
account	api
you will need a salesforce developer account or enterprise account with api access and token to login and use sforce explorer

1841520
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
now my question is if i could also use them to enable me to gradually switching from development in asp.net webforms with vb to asp.net-mvc with c#

1841520
asp.net-mvc	webforms
could i use the areas feature to incorporate asp.net-mvc into an existing webforms application

1841520
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
lets say i have a asp.net webforms application but i want any new pages to be written using asp.net-mvc could i create a new asp.net-mvc project and then jack it in as an area into the existing webforms application

1841536
right-join	union
this is per what you are asking if you want the opposite you can either union to it or use right-join

1841551
.when	ready
which will triggers it .when the jquery is ready on the page load

1841568
protected	public
what i can think about is also checked all links accessible cffunctions fuseactions etc. accessible by the search result are either secure to be public or being protected to necessary level like

1841573
any	set
instead the modified by is set to jake for versioning 1.0 effectively erasing any trace that bob touch the item

1841578
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i d say yes - it will help to keep your asp.net-mvc stuff separate but of course you will need the basic bootstrap stuff in your base webforms project

1841578
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i ve recently started introducing asp.net-mvc into an older webforms site and it s well worth the effort

1841584
revision	svn
in my environment we use svn for versioning a bots runs the tests against every revision and returns the failing tests and messages with the named of the revision which broke it and the contributor his login

1841603
button	popup
i ve already begun replacing the ms ajax.net javascript on my site with jquery javascript and now i m looking at some of the html i m using for things like popup tab controls and button

1841612
variables	boolean
if you want to avoid that add boolean variables in the checked expression

1841626
scriptaculous	jquery
incidentally i started using jquery today for the first time i am only new to jquery but i ve dealt with enough javascript and other frameworks prototype scriptaculous etc.. to know whats going on

1841633
click	mouse
add a listener to the text widget i d use a keyboardlistener and make the text disappear .when the user starts entering text and not on the first - maybe accidental - mouse click

1841636
glib	gtk
there is one major disadvantage though -- to stay compatible with debian stable you have to stick to ancient versioning of gtk and glib or at least make any functionality depending on newer versioning optional

1841668
spring	seam
framework - spring seam struts

1841676
temporary	rvalue
obvious that in step 2 we get an incorrect situation - on the left side of is rvalue - temporary object which can not be assign by any value

1841676
expression	evaluation
i assume that syntactic analyzer break the rules of priority evaluation of expression .when encounter such situations

1841700
credentials	security
the most likely difference and culprit is that the service is running with a different set of security credentials than your console .app and might fall victim to security vagaries

1841701
oracle	mysql
i don t care what that looks like oracle mysql or nosql but become also an equals master at the data store

1841706
contains	elements
you could also extends the conditional option and make a meta.jsp for example which contains a map for each of the head elements - meta-tags css hrefs scripting hrefs and use the named of the jsp as a key in that map

1841711
h.264	mp4
mp4 video h.264 aac for safari

1841723
deployment	install
obviously you can keep your clickonce deployment in-place in case someone wants to install your .app manually but it will make things easier if you package it seperately for automated deployment

1841726
contains	any
in general the view should contains little if any code that changes or does things

1841733
python	ruby
also learn python ruby visual basic.net c# classic asp java.

1841735
defined	declare
.so that if you have #define making_dll before that section all functions that are declare like foo_api int bakeacake will be exported based on whether making_dll was defined

1841741
spring	jsf
it would be much much easier if icefaces used spring to match backing beans to jsf pages -- then you could simply defined the test-beans in an application.xml with the relevant test classes

1841771
exception-handling	try-catch
it is possible that the exception-handling being throw is not cls-compliant which really shouldn t be catchable by a try-catch with a filtering

1841771
exception-handling	try-catch
you should only be able to catch a cls-compliant with a try-catch with no exception-handling arguments

1841772
postgresql	mysql
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

1841780
button	popup
the answer to use a button that popup a jpanel with a jtree is correct

1841803
windows-mobile	windows-ce
pythonce is a python ports for windows-ce and windows-mobile

1841803

i never use a shebang line in my .pl scripting nor do i use use .lib path to special .lib .so as to allow these to be customized for each invocation

1841933
javascript	dom
the menu markup could just be styled with css or if you need something fancier than mere and elements you can massage the dom with javascript once the page loads read progressive-enhancement

1841938
value	field
thus the c compiler may align field in your structure to this value to make them easier to access 4 byte value should be 4 byte aligned further it may pad the bottom of the structure to line up data which follows the structure

1841978
runas	cmd
line using the runas cmd

1841980
spaces	output
the sed removes the first spaces and everything after it from the output of md5sum

1841990
populate	row
on a subreport i have arranged a row of textbox that will be populate with dynamic data

1841996
png	gif
a 8bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixels gif and everything will still work as planned

1842001
put	get
1 i noticed that if we donâ t bind gridview to object datasource control then .when user puts gridview into edit mode we have to handle gridview.rowediting event else we get an exception-handling and in this event put gridviewâ s row into editing mode

1842001
value	field
but for some reason these textbox donâ t display current field value but instead they donâ t display any text at all

1842007
buffering	streaming
.so a streaming could be backed by a file a char buffering etc

1842009
decrement	increment
lets say i m integration with a systemd that has two increment counters which depend on each other these counters will never decrement

1842041
parsing	comma	comma	words
then i would parsing out the beginning and end bits .so you re left with a list of words split it by comma and or amp

1842048
contains	any
however the only usage of these keyword in this particular index.php file include a file that doesn t contains a definition of get_header nor does it have any include or required of its own though it does call .some more functions it has no right to know about much like index .so clearly that s now how it knows about this function

1842055
data-structures	tree
from a practical implementation perspective particularly .when dealing with data-structures and algorithms a nill often will represent a sentinel in a data structure or an object that represents nothing for example in a red-black tree technically all of the leaf nodess are nill but they still have the same or similar properties operations of a leaf nodes color pointers to a parent etc. - in those cases it is really a nothing object .

1842086
ole-automation	com
if you want to write plugins for your delphi .app and not use com ole-automation consider remobjects sdk

1842088
python	perl
i d learn either python or perl

1842089
sharp-architecture	nhibernate
you should checkout sharp-architecture if you go with nhibernate

1842094
selected	textbox
i was able to selected all the text in the textbox by adding a gotfocus event handler to the textbox in the datatemplate

1842100
linked-list	hashmap
however doing this turns hashmap into a linked-list which significantly degrades performance

1842108
value	field
we ve not yet been able to identify a way for us to be able to make a local schema change eg add a field and some value for that field and then export some kind of scripting or diff file that the other can import in

1842112
google-chrome	firefox
i append it to the document before calling initelement and it works for ie8 google-chrome and firefox

1842138
hide	show
to be more specific what i m trying to do is set this up .so that click the link will show or hide the div.b s

1842150
pygtk	gtk
you ll need to compile gtk on directfb and or pygtk from source some pointers here

1842151
any	set	.when	ready
in any case stringbuilder and string formatter have to execute actual code with real memory if you just construct a string it gets set aside during compile-time and is ready to be used .when you need it in essence it has 0 runtime cost while the other options have real cost since code actually needs to be execute

1842157
selected	textbox
on mousedoubleclick event of textbox you can call selectedall methods of textbox to selected al the text inside it

1842159
revision	updates
what i did was to save my versioning to an unrelated directory updates to the latest revision and then change the given server file with the one i saved locally with my changes

1842166
hide	next
will hide the div.b s in the next div.a following the tag

1842168
endpoint	uri
i also want to pass a configuration variables namely an endpoint uri for use within the test cases

1842185
databound	gridview
.when not using a datasource control with a gridview or other databound control which hide the complexity of the manual data-binding you must manually handle rowediting rowupdating and rowdeleting etc

1842189
prism	mef
there was this .post today that discusses two scenarios where mef and prism work together to provide solutions

1842191
32-bit	64bit
and as it is not possible to load 32-bit libs from a 64bit process you re running into troubles

1842219
any	set
i can t find any reference to this in any documentation .so i m worried that it s a private api set in the uikeyboard or .something

1842229
contains	any	double-quotes	dollar-sign
any time you use double-quotes in a command-line you have to deal with variables expansion especially if your passwd contains a dollar-sign

1842236
python	php
python is better suited for practically anything that doesn t fall within php s specialty domain which is building website

1842250
environment	building
i make sure not to use any 1.6-specific apis but i do want the building environment to let me use resolution-specific icons and assets which the 1.5 sdk doesn t know how to do

1842263
cassini	iis
change your project to use iis instead of cassini

1842263
cassini	iis
now .when you run you project it will use iis instead of cassini

1842266
reportlab	platypus
file usr local .lib python2.6 site-packages reportlab platypus doctemplate.py line 1010 in building

1842266

google-chrome	firefox
they may or may not have google-chrome and firefox already install

1842312
windows-xp	windows
in windows-xp the messagebox was being display nicely over the full screens graphics but it seems that something has changed in windows 7

1842312
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
now the application behaves like the messagesbox is display mainly the keyboard and mouse are not operational until i click the button on the box but the messages is not show on the screens

1842322
webserver	security
it isn t a fully featured webserver and is probably full of security problems

1842327
player	movie
even with flash player 10 and the unloadandstop methods with nothing happening but the captivate movie being loaded memory usage being traced out to a textfield and forcing garbage collections i can see the captivate file will not unload ever even in the most simple situation

1842361
double	int
you should use f instead of d as you are using a double and not an int

1842364
version-control	git
the way i solved this was to put everything in version-control i like git your mileage may vary

1842364
push	pull
then i do my work on on comp push my finished work back the repo and .when i switching computers i just pull from my repo

1842410
selected	cell
as in if the value of that cell is null or the empty string then you can make the rendering combobox have a single option that says pick or enter a value or selected a value and then have the editor be the actual combo box that i defined up above

1842421
rhino-mocks	moq
i ve only used moq on .net 4.0 no problems but i see no reason rhino-mocks and other libs shouldn t work either

1842421
versioning	upgrade
most dynamic mock libs are just .net libs .so the backwards-compatibility of .net will normally ensure that they still work even if you upgrade to a newer versioning of the clr bcl

1842437
temporary	copy
as such you may need to leave room for 13 characters 11 for address 1 for newline 1 for nul terminator or else you may want to read the data into a temporary buffering and copy it to your list only after you ve stripped off the newline

1842456
contains	any
original answer contains methods to find the largest possible addressable arrays on any systemd by divide-and-conquer see history of this answer if you re interested

1842477
defined	declare
because every time it is include the needed entities are forwarding declare include right before it .so everything is defined at the points of inclusion

1842481
row	col	value	field
alternatively is there a way to tell the database to updates a particular field row col to increment an int value by some value

1842496
linux	unix
classes for producing plot with the unix linux gnuplot tool

1842512
windows-server	windows
backing to festival text-to-speech on windows after many obstacles and tons of wrong downloading cygwin before then make and other exotic c++ tools forgotten in the installation of cygwin then visual-studio 2008 then windows platform sdk 2008 but it lacks of system.h .so just now i am downloading windows-server platform sdk 2003 etc.

1842523
32-bit	64bit
it s only .when you look for 32-bit information from a 64bit application or vice versa that you run into problems

1842524
virtualbox	vmware
but if it s really all that new to you it might be a good idea to install linux in virtualbox or vmware

1842538
linux	unix
see step 4 in this article apples introduction to porting unix linux applications to mac os x is also worth a read

1842544
32-bit	64bit
how do i determine if my python shell is execution in 32-bit or 64bit mode

1842544
32-bit	64bit
depending on whether you re running python as 32-bit or 64bit the key-value will be different

1842544
32-bit	64bit
how do i detection if python is running as a 64bit application as opposed to a 32-bit application

1842544
32-bit	64bit
note i m not interested in detection 32-bit 64bit windows - just the python platform

1842589
apache-config	.htaccess
i m guessing it actually occurs in your .htaccess or apache-config not kohana specifically

1842594
mousedown	mouseup
using jquery i detection a mousedown and mouseup and replace the src attributes like .so

1842603
order	join
this particular query would not allow extension across fiscalyear boundaries - if you wanted to extends to cross these year boundaries you would simply want to drop the partition by clause and fiscalyear join conditional and instead order the set by a combinations of the fiscalyear and fiscalweek something like this

1842605
.net	csla
we are using csla a rather ancient versioning in our .net 3.5 applications and we make use of it s netrun application loading for some of our users

1842619
silverlight	wpf
in my first few hours with silverlight 3 as an avid wpf user i am greatly disappointed at the many things it doesn t support

1842635
.war	jar
i have a .war file my.war..war and a jar file externaljar.jar

1842635
.war	jar	put	get	linkageerror	classpath
.when i deploy the .war in jboss and put jar in jboss classpath i get a linkageerror on initializer externalclass .when i run the .app

1842643
callback	methods
imageobserver is an interface that provides a way for you to have a callback methods that is called .when the image is updates in some way

1842643
implements	extends
imageobserver is implements by java.awt.component .so if you extends that in the contains class you could overrides imageupdated and store the image height .when the function is called asynchronously if image.getheight returns -1

1842678
constructor	object	contains	any
it appears that there are no member variabless in class a yet in a s constructor it initializer an object b even though class a does not contains any member variables of types b or any member variables at all

1842685
virtualenv	buildout
you don t need virtualenv buildout already provides an isolated environment just like virtualenv

1842685
virtualenv	buildout
.so the sys.path gets completely replace with what buildout wants to have on the path the same i.solation methods as virtualenv

1842699
32-bit	64bit
while it may work on some platform be aware that platform.architecture is not always a reliable way to determine whether python is running in 32-bit or 64bit

1842711
coff	elf
see references on the coff and elf formats for example

1842718
bug-tracking	workitem
do you have a bug-tracking system.in place already you get workitem bug-tracking as part of a tfs roll out

1842719
linked-list	tree	linked-list	nodes
rather than modifying a list for example you could append the old linked-list to a new nodes then with a compareandset operation on an atomicreference ensure that you won the data race to set the words collections in current tree nodes

1842719
children	nodes	children	tree
you could use atomicreferences for the left and right children in your tree nodes too

1842721
put	get
in a normals string to get a you need to put two backslashes in a row like .so 1 but you can use a python raw string to conveniently write the replacement pattern

1842728
arrays	map
then map over the arrays of triples like .so

1842728
arrays	loops
if there are more than 2 nils in a row this won t work .so put it in a loops and keep calling it until there are no more nils in the arrays

1842741
data-members	constructor	base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
since construtor cannot be inherited .so base-class data-members are to be initializer by passying arguments in derived-class constructor and with the help of initialization list

1842746
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu include a whirlpool package

1842746
shell	bash
-execdir bash -c cmd dummy + has the dummy arg there because the first arg after the cmd becomes 0 in the shell s positional parameters not part of that for loops over

1842751
.when	ready
however .when you are ready here s a rough outline of how you do variables height cell

1842769
arrays	loops
the reason this is happening is because the empl is the same reference every time you loops through your arrays

1842776
mouseover	mouseout
then dynamically change the positioning of the background-image on mouseout mouseover

1842804
directory	folder
display the files and folder in the current directory

1842815
simplesamlphp	shibboleth
since this is the case for both simplesamlphp and the shibboleth service provider modules you can use either really

1842824
emacs	vim
as someone who has switched back and forth between vi emacs vim several time in the last 25 years i m now finally trying viper-mode in emacs and i like it

1842832
derived-class	base-class
i need to write a load methods for base-class order that would correctly create respective derived-class

1842837
perl	ruby
use a libs like faker ruby or data faker perl to generator random phrases or write your own utility

1842858
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think i could get away with it if i could mix webforms and asp.net-mvc but there seems to be little literature on the technique

1842858
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i d need to be able to go to asp.net-mvc pages from webforms pages and vice-versa seamlessly

1842868
32-bit	64bit
it works for up to four-character strings with 32-bit int and up to 8 characters using 64bit longs

1842883
margins	padding
some browsers default styles give the body elements a padding and some give it a margins

1842895
subclassing	base-class
one approach could be to have a static defined in the base-class and allow subclassing to register themselves with the base-class inorder to add a specific creation function for their types to the base-class dynamically

1842909
fclose	fopen
is it ok to have two process writing to same file multiple time in a certain span of time usign fopen append mode printf fclose functionality

1842930
switching	screens
the problem is .when i launchd a particular screens default menu is popping up with show keyboard switching applicaiton and full menu automatically .when launchdd a particular screens

1842933
asp.net-mvc	webforms
chapter 12 in professional asp.net-asp.net-mvc 1.0 is called best of both worlds webforms and asp.net-mvc together

1842941
python	c++
unfortunately looping over all the key in python isn t really fast enough for my purpose and i would like to translation this code to c++

1842941
python	c++
what is the best c++ data structure to use for a python dictionary that has tuples as its key

1842956
hide	show
if i were you i d suggest taking a look at the jquery libs and using their show hide functions to building a custom accordion control to do what you want

1842972
.war	jar
i needed to repackage the code to run under apache and all my code including the entry-point class from the old jar has ended up in a .war file for easy deplyment into the webserver

1842972
.war	jar
i presumed the .war was just like a jar .so

1842976
dictionary	map
a dictionary would be a std map in c++ and a tuples with two elements would be a std-pair

1842987
glsl	hlsl
syntax-wise both hlsl and pbj are c-like and based on glsl

1843003
python	c++
it s for integration between python and c++ basically building python libs using c++ but also for embedding python in c++ programs

1843005
any	set
finally you could altogether reject any string that does not consist solely of characters in the permitted set

1843021
executable-jar	.war	executable-jar	jar	.war	jar
if you want to reuse this class in both the .war and outside from the java command-line consider building an executable-jar you can run from the command-line then putting that jar in the .war file s web-inf .lib directory

1843022
python	perl
i m familiar with the basic session concepts having used them in classic asp and gotten into the nuts-and-bolts of them in perl but i am not seeing a lot for python

1843023
repository-pattern	lazy-loading
if i use repository-pattern and add the object to a partials for the class then i m using lazy-loading

1843035
.war	jar
you could try simply putting a copy of the classes on the root filesystems of the zipfile which is what a .war jar is

1843038
python	c++
it provides a c++ versioning of python dictionary class already .so if you re doing cross-language stuff it might be useful

1843051
any	set
is there any way to set a labels s text in the designer to a value stored in a project-level resx file

1843102
32-bit	16-bit
for instances if you two int are int between 1 and 65536 you just could use a 32-bit int with each 16-bit part one of the key

worksheet	excel
this gives you the most control as you have complete control over how you map from db or flat-file - excel workbook worksheet

1843110
any	set
create a procedure that accepts a character-based comma-separated list of code value you are looking for in the sequences you want them in - use any of a dozen possible ways to split this list into a table set that is made up of the sequences and code value resulting in a table with a structure like this

1843114
abstract-class	subclassing
without any code in the subclassinging i d like an abstract-class to have a different copy of a static variables for each subclassing

1843126
perl	php
going from perl to php was a natural progression because they shared many of the same methodologies and syntax

1843126
perl	php
i loved that php was .so heavily install and widely used and was much easier to code in than perl

1843126
perl	php
except like perl php makes it way too easy to do things the wrong way and ushered in a new era of poorly-written and insecure web-applications

1843126
switching	router
network-programming router switching

1843132
utility	gnu
the gnu strings utility has been around forever and does more-or-less exactly this by using a heuristics to yank any data that looks like a string from a binary

1843138
subclassing	base-class
your base-class should have no knowledge of subclassing in traditional object oriented theory

1843149
children	nodes
if .so then assuming a zero-indexed list the children of a nodes at index i are found at indic 2i + 1 and 2i + 2

1843180
pixels	line
i m using vista my old java .app ran on win xp has thin borders about 2 pixels thick but now on vista the borders deafults to thick line maybe 6 7 pixels thick can i specify in java how thick my jframe borders should be

1843189
wait	hang
if you don t have the synchronized blocks then the notify might happens-before or during the wait and then the wait misses the notify and you can hang thread 1

1843191
punctuation	words
if words is a single punctuation mark as would be the case for the above input after it is split then it is converted to an empty string

1843207
environment	building
this has caused our integration grouping to create systemd building that developers then use to create an adequate environment to develop their software and manually pull in dependencies zip files patches etc.

1843221
any	set
sprocket has a set of methods which i want to be callable from widget but not from any other class

1843221
any	set
i can simply add this new class to the sprocket friend list or i can add yet another set of protected wrapper in widget that specialwidget and any other subclassing can access but you can see that this is now becoming a maintenance issue

1843237
perl	ruby	perl	php	perl	c++	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	c++	python	perl	python	java	haskell	ocaml	haskell	perl	haskell	python	haskell	c++	haskell	erlang	erlang	ocaml	erlang	perl	erlang	python	ocaml	perl	smalltalk	ocaml
it combines a software stack with a code-generation engine to building service that work efficiently and seamlessly between c++ java python php ruby erlang perl haskell c# cocoa smalltalk and ocaml

python	c++
use python to call a c++ function wrapped using something like swig taking the yaml string as a parameter

1843330
key-value	key
exception-handling was caught during core data change process valueforundefinedkey the entity grouping is not key-value coding-compliant for the key null

1843348
samba	svn
other answers aside as they seem to suggest this is doable i can report categorically that sharing a working copy in our case via a samba shared where we had svn eol-style native in use did cause problems for us and we try to avoid it

1843355
any	set
you can set any valid .net namespace as the target namespace for your generator code files

1843362
python	c++
thats what i ended up using going from visual-studio c++ .net to doing python

1843377
contains	set
if you parsing the j.son with eval you re allowing the string being parsing to contains ab.solutely anything .so instead of just being a set of data you could find yourself execution function-calls or whatever

1843393
windows-server	windows
as to microsoft oses for sharepoint development you have two choices windows-server 2003 2008 or windows 7

1843410
build-system	cmake
i have built the opencv libs using the cmake build-system as describe here and have added the header .a and .dylib files to my terminal c++ project

1843429
deployment	install
better would probably be to ngen the assemblies if you have controlled deployment environment or an install that can install the correct assemblies to customer machines

1843430
constructor	object
i do wonder though what the benefit of this is over simply calling the constructor on your object

1843438
value	field	hide	show
i was having same scenario and was using datatrigger in the tooltip s styles to hide and show field in tooltip based on their value

1843452
sharepoint-designer	wspbuilder
as for using sharepoint-designer i would avoid it for sharepoint 2007 development and instead focus on getting a solid solution structure defined and use some tools like wspbuilder and your be off to a good start

1843455
groovy	gsp
gsp allows you to run arbitrary groovy code inside brackets

1843484
value	field
i am trying to write to an oracle clob field a value over 4000 characters

1843484

the getter and setter looks like

1843510
parser-generator	antlr
antlr parser-generator

1843515
keyvaluepair	key
ideally i d like to be able to modify both the key and the value of the keyvaluepair display in the listview

1843572
base-class	inherited
i have a bunch of stored serialization classes that all inherited from a base-class in c#

1843579
jquery	dojo
gone are the days .when it s okay to use the especially if you re using a libs like jquery dojo extjs or the rest

1843583
assign	add
first add the classes logodesign marketing webdesign printdesign that apply to each project to the div your are assign the numeric class to

1843583
hide	show
then assign a click event that will hide the others and show the selected one

1843585
keyvaluepair	key
if you look at the keyvaluepair implementation it is a struct with both key and value as readonly properties .so my guess is that it s not possible to make a two-way binding in this case

1843593
deprecated	javadoc
prior to this most ides could still pull a deprecated out of the javadoc comments for a particular methods but this annotations was a nice way to make it meta-information about the methods itself rather than a comment in documentation.

1843616
directory	folder
what i would like to do now is allow anything mydomain admin to direct to the admin directory inside the systemd folder

1843618
contains	elements
this means that thread1 only needs to wait if the list only contains one elements

1843618
contains	elements
.so the way to make this work is for thread2 to lock the list if it only contains one elements

1843627
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
well actually it s still running because they never end. a perl golfer by the named of eyepopslikeamosquito decided to win all four languages perl php python and ruby and .so he did

1843653
parser-generator	antlr
if you re going to use a parser-generator there are really two good choices byacc and antlr

1843683
selected	textbox
i want to submit the data from the textbox as well as the selected items ie those in the second grid as part of a formcollection object back to my controllers

1843687
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it struck me as what webforms was meant to be. but at the time it seemed too fringe and too immature and i had already been burned by webforms .so i went a different directions and started developing in asp.net-mvc

1843687
jquery-plugins	jquery
if you eventually venture into asp.net-mvc or ruby-on-rails there are a raft of jquery-plugins you can use in the browser and usable client-side programming via jquery is very cool

1843697
downgrade	upgrade
at the points where you have to modify the b-tree you acquire the write exclusive lock or upgrade from read to write lock insert the nodes and downgrade to read shared lock

1843737
margins	padding
i ve tried to positioning it absolutely and turn off all padding and margins but nothing works it still appears in the centering as it does on the screens versioning

1843739
filtering	grouping
tickets created this way match the value of the filtering and the filtering groupinging value - there s a textbox at the bottom of each grouping

1843742
order	add
1 add iif-function on the county column and order by that function such as iif county lincoln county 1 2 -- you re using the iif to overrides the alphabetic order by replacing it with a 1 or 2

1843742
order	add	order	join
you then join to this table and add sequences to the order by clause

1843778
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsentitydescription
secondly the easiest way to get yourself an nsmanagedobject into a nsmanagedobjectcontext from an entity named is to use the nsentitydescription insertnewobjectforentitynamed inmanagedobjectcontext selector

1843783
perl	awk
i ended up using something very similar to kinopiko s answer but i used awk instead of perl

1843783
perl	awk
this is useful if your stuck on windows machines which have awk install by nature of mingw but not perl

1843790
python	php
if you re writing a php scripting and you re reaching for functions in the pthreads extenstion shared-memory or other low-level stuff then that s generally a sign that python would be better suited

1843790
python	php
it s not that php can t do it but python just does it better and less buggy

1843790
stderr	stdout
also some functionality is much easier and clearer in python redirecting stdin stdout and stderr

1843790
python	php
.so python has libs that php doesn t have opengl multimedia etcetera

1843794
bubble-sort	quicksort
i know it s a quadratric time algorithm but how does it compare to other sorting algorithms such as quicksort or bubble-sort

1843797
pointers	stack
a buffering overrun may clobber a previously saved versioning of the frame pointers on stack

1843812
entity	pojo
entity - to tell that a pojo is a jpa entity

1843812
persistent	transient
transient - this properties should not be persistent

1843816
ready	live	.when	ready
then .when you re ready to go live merge the dev branch onto the trunk and updates your live checkout

1843818
selection-sort	bubble-sort
however while bubble-sort and selection-sort are easy to understand and implements sorting algorithms their runtime is o n 2 i.e the worst time that you can possibly get

1843831
pointers	stack
the most likely explanation from you description is that the overrun in b corrupt the saved frame pointers on stack for a

1843834
databound	gridview
large amounts of databound to data display controls like gridview and repeaters

1843839
pointers	stack
.when a call b b s preamble instructions save a s frame pointersâ the location on stack where a keeps local-variables before replacing it with b s own frame pointers

1843852
quicksort	mergesort
for an nlog n algorithm like quicksort or mergesort that s n 262

1843853
version-control	git
as some of the replies indicated distribute version-control like git or mercurial is what you need

1843856
any	set
it s a simple task to reset a timer whenever this happens and if the timer goes off without any movement detected it will set your status to idle

1843882
fread	eof
instead of querying for the file size i would simply call fread or other input functions in a loops until the eof

1843886
deprecated	javadoc
in general deprecated says this was in here in the past but it may go away in a future version. make sure you also use the associated deprecated javadoc flag in conjunction with this too to tell people what they should use instead

1843893
bmp	png
additonally unlike the bmp format png assuming and jpg do not store the pixels format in the same fashion or representation

1843894
lightbox	thickbox	lightbox	colorbox	colorbox	thickbox	colorbox	.post
i will now integrated them into the website itself into the content and have for instances links like create new .post which would fire up the view in a chosen lightbox clone don t know yet which one maybe colorbox or thickbox but that doesn t matter

1843906
python	php
i need want to run in a lot of different server configuration a lot of people use shared-hosting and can t install don t have support to python but php is a default in any web-hosting company

1843906
python	php
you can write almost everything you write in python with php

1843912
value	field
how do i get or pass in the flow xml the value from a selectonemenu field in an xhtml page

1843914
defined	declare
if you do want to defined some of the predicatess in the file and others with assert then declare in your file that the predicates is dynamic

1843930
constructor	object
in the object being passed to the dojo.dnd.target constructor one needs to set the skipform attributes to true

1843952
.when	ready
until wix s burn is ready we really don t have much of a choice .when it comes to bootstrappers

1843958
put	get
i want to make a project in which more than one xml files will be process at once .in this project i tried to put xml files in arrays and then i used but always i get errors.my code is like that

1843972
swing	awt
you can find more infomation about the repaint manager in the article on paintng in awt and swing

1843987
swing	awt
let s go a bit deeper and it s my view of the working of swing awt

1844003
paradox	bde
i m working at finishing up a conversion of a large application that has used bde paradox for a local database and oracle 8i for a remote db

1844017
32-bit	x86
however i can force individual project to run as 32-bit assembly by specifying the platform target as x86 rather than any cpu

1844017
32-bit	64bit
can 32-bit assembly and 64bit assemblies be run together

1844021
document.write	getelementbyid
if i were building this whole thing i would probably have an empty div with an id be part of the widget code you have the user copy or i might use document.write in the first javascript file to write out a holding div that the second scripting can populate via getelementbyid

1844027
scala	java
pick my final target as clojure since as i understand it you get the entire java standard-library with clojure making it immediately more useful than something pure like scala

1844038
python	ruby
python is a close second but ruby s habit of implicit returning the result-of the last expression in a function block is the tiebreaker for me

1844038
ruby-on-rails	django
both have excellent web-frameworks ruby-on-rails and django respectively and both will definitely broaden your horizons after programming php

1844038
imperative-programming	imperative
neither of them use s-expression and both allow imperative-programming .so there won t be anything to force you to give up the imperative styles cold turkey

1844038
scheme	tcl
finally the much-lamented tcl is basically scheme as a scripting and extension language

1844074
jquery	.post
as for documentation you could start with this .post on ajax in drupal using jquery

1844093
margins	padding
consider replacing by css margins padding properties and keep the trimspaces setting

1844100
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have an asp.net-mvc site that i would like to allow the owners to edit the content of the views in the styles adobe contribute allows for traditional webforms sites

1844116
contains	any
open a html file which will sort of rendering the html sort of but won t contains any actual html in cell

1844118
python	ruby
short versioning -- how do i do python rsplit in ruby

1844119
json	xml
over the years i have tried quite a few options or serialization deserialization including json xml soap protobuf and some others i am embarrassed to named here -

1844135
show	next
you get a nice display of information automatically show to you a page at a time hit the spaces bar to see the next page

1844138
cakephp	symfony	codeigniter	symfony	codeigniter	cakephp
eventually you ll probably want to jump into a framework like codeigniter cakephp or symfony to named a few to start doing all this dirty work for you .so you can concentrate on the fancy stuff

1844145
selected	button
selected the button and the flowlayoutpanel and set their anchor to top-left-right

1844147
32-bit	64bit
taking a total shot in the dark i would guess that somewhere you ve got a 32-bit libs running on a 64bit machine

1844167
dialog	pop-up
by the way i once worked on a gui application where the assert was a special gui modal pop-up dialog

1844169
keyboard	mouse
using mouse events only alienates users proficient at keyboard based browsing

1844199
user-controls	itemtemplate
in wpf i have a listbox with a user-controls as its itemtemplate - all data show ok

1844211
selected	cell
using the first suggestion that insert the custom uiview into the cell does manipulate the cell but it doesn t show up .when the cell is touch only after the selected action is completed which is too late because i m pushing to a new view

1844211
selected	cell
how do i get the selected view in the cell to display before the beginning of the selected operation

1844250
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
the relational databases i know oracle postgresql mysql do not have built-in currency support and i don t expect any others do

1844270
triggers	insert
this pattern lets us create multiple elements and insert them into the dom triggers a single reflow

1844270
triggers	insert
now we can use this function to updates the anchor within an elements that is out-of-the-flow and only triggers a reflow .when we remove the elements and .when we insert the elements

1844273
attributes	properties
do i need to handle the binding in my server control the text properties already got the bindable attributes set to true or it should just work

1844275
shipping	tax
shipping amount and tax amount may both be on the invoices recording

1844287
nested-loops	arrays
nested-loops are the traditional way to handle multidimensional arrays

1844299
javascript	dom
the this keyword is a javascript fundamental and in your example would return the tr dom nodes

1844309
boost	stl
garbage-collection cuts your memory in half but using some of the fancier stl and boost features will have the same effect but with many time the bug potential

1844370
callback	methods
unfortunately even if the callback of the getjson methods is called i get the messages request failed before the callback has the opportunity to set the requestok variables

1844377
constructor	private
private constructor and static-methods on a class marked as final

1844382
constructor	private
al.so even though it isn t strictly necessary to make the constructor private it is a good idea to do .so

1844382
constructor	private	instances	private
marking the constructor private prevents other people from creating instances of your class then calling static-methods from those instances

1844388
constructor	private
item 4 enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor

1844388
constructor	private
- a default-constructor is generator only if a class contains no explicit constructor .so a class can be made noninstantiable by including a private constructor

1844388
subclassing	superclass
all constructor must invoke a superclass constructor explicit or implicit and a subclassing would have no accessible superclass constructor to invoke

1844404
while-loop	cursor	default	reset
however during the while-loop in which peekmessage is called the cursor keep getting reset back to the default arrow

1844405
primitive	int
at the risk of bikeshedding storing degrees as an int rather than as its own class might be a case of primitive obsession

1844416
git-commit	git-diff
the difference show by git-diff --cached are what will be committed on git-commit

1844429
contains	set
.so firstchild will be set to the text nodes that contains whitespace in those browsers which you probably don t want to happen

1844430
contains	elements
under the hood there are concrete subclassing of nsarray that are appropriate to different use cases such as large sparse-matrix arrays or arrays contains a specific numbers of elements that are known at compile-time

1844461
selected	textbox
my idea is to be able to write in for example named surnamed and occupation textbox in the application and receive a list of all people in the selected table that correspond to all 3 search parameters

1844511
aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions sum avg ignore nulls except for count

1844528
google-chrome	firefox
i tried this in firefox 3 ie 8 and google-chrome 3

1844529
input-field	textbox
i have a php form with various input-field and textbox

1844529
input-field	textbox
if you submit and go back all of the data that was submitted in the input-field remains however the textbox are blank

1844532
constructor	private
comment on the private constructor arguments come on developers are not that stupid

1844539
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	scrypt	pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	salt
salt your hash with secure random salt of at least 128bits or longer to avoid a rainbow attack and use bcrypt pbkdf2 or scrypt

1844558
selected	button	itemtemplate	gridview
.so in the itemtemplate markup of the gridview specify the image you want to replace the selected button with but make it invisible then disable the selected button in-place of the image by swapping visibility between both object within the event handler methods gvsample_selectededindexchanged in the code-behind which is what gets triggers upon click selected button

1844558
selected	button
since findcontrol returns object of types control you ll have to cast to the linkbutton types of your selected button

1844563
switching	router
it s tough to tell if a computer is on the internet because for most computers the internet starts at the switching router modem router etc.

1844577
hash	md5
say you have a list of email maybe you d concatenation all their ids and read unread statuses and take an md5 hash using that as your fragment-identifier

1844589
contains	any
also they won t contains any useful value because nothing has been assign to them

1844591
double-quotes	spaces
2 can i ever use if to compare two strings contains both double-quotes and spaces

1844619
doubly-linked-list	nodes
the idea of a doubly-linked-list is to be able to grab a nodes and go in either directions or to be able to splice into the middle of a list

1844621
constructor	private
final class and private constructor good but not essential

1844630
qwidget	qlayout
i can t find any way to hide it in one step as qlayout doesn t have a hide methods like qwidget does

1844633
fortran	pascal	fortran	ada	pascal	ada
it is also why fortran pascal and ada pass arguments by reference and why bliss made dereference an address an explicit operation

1844651
firefox	safari
to get this working you ll have to embed a windows from a web browser that does firefox ie safari etc

1844651
python	c++
alternatively you can use python c++ interface integrated the gnu gnash project an open source flash player into your program

1844655
biopython	bioperl
the best-maintained all-purpose language-specific bioinformatics libs are supported by the open bioinformatics foundation bioperl biopython biojava bioruby and biolib c++

1844678
hide	show
if you want to hide show them as a grouping use a widget

1844710
compatibility	legacy
there is considerable legacy and small systemd compatibility with the x87 sse is a relatively new processor feature

1844729
.when	ready
sometime you want to see something right away even if it takes longer to rendering the whole thing- other time you want to wait a little longer and show it all .when it is ready

1844736
row	col
how to access elements by row col in opencv 2.0 s new mat class

1844740
associations	model
now if there s a relationship or associations as it s normally called between your rides model and registrant model like a has_many associations you can use nested resources to nest one controllers in another

1844747
header-only	boost
boost is open source and mostly header-only

1844752
value	field
my index contains document with a location field contains value like

1844760
contains	any
do your pages or master pages contains any declarative controls

1844760
contains	any
if you have an action decorated with validateantiforgerytoken be sure that any form posting to it contains a call to html.antiforgerytoken

1844796
python	java
if you frame the question as i know for instances python and java but not c please teach me you could end up with a very informative interview

1844819
any	set
otherwise you don t seem to have any code to set it to any particular value before you write it out

1844820
contains	any
it s a regular expression that roughly searches for a string that doesn t contains a period followed by a period and then a string containss any characters

1844825
hide	show
once the listbox has finished loading you would then hide the animation control and .so the listbox would show instead

1844825
any	set
any time you need to perform another long operation you set the animation control to visible again

1844827
instrumentation	profiling
the first thing i would do is run instrumentation profiling on the hardware device that is slow

1844844
parentheses	let	order	join
now the parentheses may need to be changed in the join i always do my equi-joins in the access qbe and let it take care of the getting the order and parens correct

1844857
windows	ms-dos
if this is on windows or ms-dos the open modes need to be text

1844864
textbox	button
then add another button then add an elements to the arrays from the textbox

1844875
selected	button
.when click on the delete button after selected one or more entries a modal-dialog windows is display showing the entries that the user has selected with a confirmation button

1844875
selected	button
i ve managed to get it all set .so that the confirmation button which is a link_to using the has a url of entries 12 13 16 17 where the numbers represent the id s of the entries that the user selected

1844879
double-quotes	single-quotes
the points is that if you use single-quotes on the outside you need to use double-quotes on this inside

1844880
directory	folder
you could put both the database and the files into a single directory that your coder keeps as a folder reference in xcode - .so all content in the folder you change is added to the coding project automatically

1844889
windows-server	windows
it runs on normals windows boxes unlike dryad which required windows-server high performacne computing hpc

1844897
simulator	platform
in monodevelop open your .app s project settings click on iphone building and with the configuration set to debugging and the platform set to iphone simulator ensure that building debugging-mode binaries is checked

1844897
connect	inet
if your .app is properly configure and if its settings on the simulator are correct then try debugging your .app - if monodevelop still sits and tries to connect without success open up a terminal windows while your .app is still running and types netstat -n -f inet - do you see 127.0.0.1 10000 anywhere in the list under the local address column

1844907
any	set
however keep in mind that starting with vista internet-explorer runs as a low integrity level process .so any pipe you connect to will need to have it s access-control set accordingly

1844909
value	field
you could also assign the field value to variables and use these in your value list

1844909
environment	execution
you could also try execution the cmd directly in an sql environment rather than running your code each time

the clientheight and offsetheight properties are both 24px but since those properties include any padding set on the elements i m not sure if this is the browser expanding the elements height or adding padding

1846911

it is supposed to be a utility base-class for the cmd classes .so they don t need to typedef and declare .some members on their own they would simply inherited from base with the types they refer to

1846938
groovy	java
use my groovy class into a java class of the grails project

1846944

1847072
emacs	vim
choose one you want to become amazing at vim emacs etc. and never look back

1847083
put	get
if this is completely blocking or youâ re trying to debugging code running at startup like the page startup event one possible way to get around this would be to put in a call to system.diagnostics.debuggingger.break start the program and then attach .when dialog pops

1847101
variables	boolean
if this is the case i would create a boolean variables and call it something like isoldformat

1847101
contains	set
by double click on your predence constraint you would then set the evaluator operation properties to expression and types in the expression box isoldformat true for the constraint going to the data flow that contains the old flat-file source and isoldformat false for the other data flow

1847103
while-loop	cursor
4 there is essentially no difference between a cursor and a while-loop - the underlying mechanics are essentially the same

1847107
implements	extends
instead of implements tablemodel from scratch extends abstracttablemodel instead since it handles all the events and listener aspects and will save you a lot of time

1847120

1847131
digits	base
the problem is to derive a formula for determining numbers of digits a given decimal numbers could have in a given base

1847131
digits	base
for example the decimal numbers 100006 can be represented by 17 11 9 8 7 6 8 digits in base 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 respectively

versioning	upgrade
.so rather than people being tempted to commit their upgrade to the mainline i prefer to keep the branches seperate and required the user to pick the versioning they need on the first updates after the clone

1847172
digits	base
in the second versioning the + 1 is necessary to yield the correct answer for any numbers n that is the smallest numbers with d digits in base b

1847201
versioning	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade to ruby-on-rails 2.3.3 from 2.0.1 to take advantage of the caching stuff built into the more recent versioning

1847201
boolean	int
all of those 30 columns except one are boolean and small int that last one is a short string .so it shouldn t take up too much memory

1847205
hide	show
i would put two divs on the page and show hide each div depending on which tab is selected

1847205
switching	screens
the advantage of this dual-natured solution is that the tabbed approach will work the way you want it to work for the majority of cases but for users with say two screens or who prefer switching between browser tabs they will still have the flexibility to work in multi-window mode

1847205
firefox	opera
this can all be done without any browser extensions and it should work equally well in ie as well as firefox opera etc

1847205
safari	opera
one day a customer will need to use opera or safari and you ll be stuck

1847224

if using union consider if union-all will work

1847309
.when	ready
i d like to add some personal project to source control .when they are ready

1847321
frame	width
think what would happen if the user made a systemd setting change for the width of a windows frame or the border for the icons or even worse apply a themes that makes your user-interface pretty glarish as a result-of the perception of the eyes of the user this can have a knock-on effect - the user will end up not using your application as a result

1847321
textbox	button
it would be prudence to just leave the natural colours of button etc as defined by the systemd settings such as gray button white background on textbox etc

1847325
digits	base
if your numberss are int then you can verify -- using integer-arithmetic -- that one power of the base is less than or equals to your numbers and the next is above it the first power is the numbers of digits

1847333
contains	elements
is there a way to wrap the border around the elements it contains without specifing an absolute width

1847352
updating	updates
and if you re updating many items at once it is better to surround the updates in a way like this

1847357
private-key	rsa
as far as i can tell from what i ve read .net uses the rsa algorithm and the private-key to sign the assembly checked it with the embedded public key

1847359
assign	add
i need to assign a color to the row i add at runtime to the datatable

1847364

that said i take the imploded arrays approach .when i need to building up a string with comma or and between words

1847417
contains	set
assuming you have a set of points s in a cartesian plane with coordinates x i y i given an arbitrary circle with centering x c y c and radius r you want to find all the points contains within that circle

1847428
private-key	rsa
in rsa the only actual difference between a public key and a private-key is which one you keep secret

1847437
attributes	properties
i believe these are the right properties attributes named but i m typing off the top of my head.

1847447
shipping	tax
shipping prices include tax

1847473
malloc	free
i mentioned this in another posting for every malloc there is a free if there isn t you have a memory leak

1847489
versioning	upgrade
also make sure you use the module and any other extension points to implements your functionality rather than making changes to the actual dotnetnuke core code since any changes to the core will make it that much more difficult to upgrade to newer versioning of dotnetnuke

1847489
packaging	building
i strongly suggest getting some automated packaging in-place the templates that i linked to has a nant building scripting with it that you can use to package your module

1847500

the idea is that i can create multiple copies of a single promo box each with different field value

1847501
slideshow	loading
i i want to load a jquery-cycle slideshow and after loading pause until the user click the play button

1847505
rounding-error	logarithm
i think that the only way to get the rounding-error eliminated without producing other errors is to use or implements int logarithm

1847513
contains	any
i strongly suspect that you shouldn t be building up your strconverted as a string in the first place - any xml-generation code which contains manual tags is begging to be rewritten to use the api more idiomatically

1847530
constructor	private
using a factory or making the constructor private will not stop it being initializer in the constructor of a class that is initializer before main

1847559
32-bit	64bit
on some processor variables and instructions have to begin on memory addresses that are multiples of some memory-alignment value often 32-bit or 64bit but the alignment depends on the processor architecture

on the change event of your first textbox call a function that will modify the options in selected box 2 removing value that are no longer viable

1847687
python	php
if you re doing any multithreading development pick python over php

1847695
union-all	union
i suggest using a union-all in a query like this because you re sure that the tables returned by the subselects will not contains the first rows .so a plain union which effectively does a distinct on the combined data is not necessary and is likely to run slowly

1847699
environment	execution	environment	building
we use a tfs building scripting to call out to the msbuilding-task for deploying the databases along with execution the data generator plans for pre populating the testing environment with data

1847706
32-bit	64bit
i believe that debian has been dropping the .la files because it can cause problems .when you re building for both 32-bit and 64bit

1847706
32-bit	64bit
if libtool finds a .la file it has a nasty habit of putting the full path to the libs in the link cmd and this is sometimes the wrong libs 32-bit instead of 64bit or vice-versa

1847719
required	checked
i have added some dataanotations to mark field that are required and i am using regular expression to checked valid email addresses

in normals situations it is common to choose either special-case value typical in older or more basic languages like c or assembler or exception-handling typical for more structured languages like c++ java python

1847771
freebsd	linux
this is probably the easiest way or alternately have a look at the source of tail in gnu s coreutils specifically it s -f function although thinking more you ll probably want to look at how the freebsd implementation works as i believe that the gnu versioning uses some linux specific callback

1847773
webforms	asp.net
be careful if you re using asp.net with webforms as they only allow the definition of a single form elements

onmousemove	onmouseup
why is firing onmousemove and onmouseup on control1 if i click over control2

1848020
event-listener	listener
if you make sure to run your binding after the line your code should work but i think you might be better off here registering a live event-listener which says all items that match this selector ever should be bound to this listener even if they re added to the dom at some points after this code is being execute

1848035
erlang	lua	c++	lua

edit as the op has now mentioned that the issue is one of relative-import being preferred to absolute the simplest solution for the op s specific problem is to add at the start of the module from __future__ import absolute_import which changes that preferences order

1848762
double	int
the biggest largest int that can be stored in a double without losing precision is the same as the largest possible value of a double

1848762
double	int
go on ask me what the largest int is such that it and all smaller int can be stored in ieee 64bit double without losing precision

1848762
double	int
or another way of looking at it once the bias has been taken off the exponent and ignoring the sign bit as irrelevant to the question the value stored by a double is a power of 2 plus a 52-bit int multiplied by 2 exponent âˆ 52

1848783
xsd	xml
how can i create a empty xml file trough a existing xsd schema

1849155
3des	des
another alternative that might be easier is des or 3des more specifically

1849155
3des	des
if you go with these then use triple des not des 3des actually uses two key doubling the key size of the algorithm which is the only real weakness of des

1849155
3des	des
3des goes through des using one key to encrypt the other to decrypt and the same one to encrypt again

1849172

1849372
python	ruby	python	c++
if i used ruby 1.8 very slow would it make a difference compared to using python 3.1 faster or compiled c++

1849376
python	ruby
ruby uses required python uses import

1849380
json-rpc	xml-rpc
it supports both xml-rpc and json-rpc for javascript and asynchronous as well as synchronous request

1849412

cassini	iis
while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual-studio

1849457
queue	fifo
and have some other process launchd via a crontab every minute for instances checked that fifo queue

1849457
queue	fifo

always test in a standards-compliant browser first like firefox or safari google-chrome

1849614
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
as far as .when do i cross draw the line it s 99 internet-explorer issues and if it s close enough to looking like firefox or google-chrome safari i m done

1849617
javascript	dom
alternatively it could be a tag that you return javascript to and have it add an img to the dom

1849642
json	csv	json	xml	csv	xml
if you re using pickle as a data transport mechanism you might want to consider less-implementation specific formats for data storage such as json xml csv yaml etc

double-quotes	single-quotes
sometimes i would actually go as far as separating the line break in double-quotes and use single-quotes for the rest of the string

1849660
textbox	button
putting a textbox in the content of a button in a windows or control works fine why not in a styles

1849662
mysql-workbench	phpmyadmin
i suppose the table has been created with some tool like phpmyadmin or mysql-workbench

if you have any chance of compression that data on the server side to 5 mb in a zip or something you could definitely streaming that across to your client

1849747
simplemodal	jquery
i use the jquery simplemodal to show my option list page

1849761
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
you can access the local filesystems provided you go via the openfiledialog for reading files and the savefiledialog for writing files

1849768
constructor	object
instead of having mywfcclass somehow know the types that you want to implements and using reflection just pass the iuserdal object to the constructor allowing the test harness to pass in a mock object .when needed

1849768
constructor	object
pass a types object to the mywfcclass constructor then use reflection to find and invoke the constructor you want

1849782
stored-procedures	ssis
i have the same issue - it works fine in one database but .when i copy this database to another using ssis import not the usual restore this issue happens to most of my stored-procedures

1849785
exception-handling	error-handling
error-handling is difficult writing clean code with and without exception-handling is - difficult

1849809
set-intersection	subset
this regex inverter written using pyparsing works with a limited subset of re syntax no or + allowed for instances - you could invert two re s into two sets and then look for a set-intersection

1849831
contains	set
in java is there an object like a set that can contains only unique string value but also contains a count on the numbers of occurrences of the string value

1849832
postback	ajax
if you need to execute php you will need to postback or use ajax

1849844
delphi	c++
also we are open to reasonable language choices like c++ c# delphi the application is written in this etc

1849870
trackpad	mouse
you can overrides nsresponder s -scrollwheel methods and use nslog to see how magic mouse scrolling differs from trackpad and traditional scrolling

1849874
dependency-injection	singleton
if you re using a dependency-injection containers you could expose it as a singleton and satisfy the parameterized constructor by using that singleton

1849875
value	field
and the key for each value will be the named attributes of the corresponding field

1849882
contains	elements
you will then have a 180x360 elements arrays and you will only need to search a small numbers of boxes including the box contains the new points and all the boxes immediately around it for which one of the corners is within the user-specified distance

1849892
difference	zero
the difference between one and zero is infinite - the answer is unequivocally yes apple will approve monotouch apps

1849982
memory-management	out-of-memory
i have an .application which predictably generator out-of-memory errors on very very very large dataset - we re trying to fix the problem by optimizing the .app s memory-management but the very very large dataset in question required .so long to run days that it s difficult to iterate through testing cycles and find the problem empirically

1849983
value	field
the value attributes of and the checked or selected attributess of radio and option correspond to the initial value of the form field not the current value the user or scripting has set

1849983
attributes	properties
consequently changing the checked properties does not alter the attributes value and setting the checked attributes does not alter the real visible value that s going to be submitted with the form

1849983
attributes	properties
the attributes corresponds to the defaultchecked dom properties not the checked properties

1849993
erlang	prolog
if you write them as you would in prolog i can show you how to translation them into erlang

1850120
strncpy	strcpy
avoid using strcpy and use strncpy instead

1850121
python	c++	python	java
instead if you want something with user integration i would suggest you to write a little scripting program in insert your favorite language here could python c++ c# java with an oracle connection to perform the sql queries or pl sql programs you need

1850122
shutdown	restart
i could not find anything about wicket or tomcat being able to be triggers with a shutdown and restart from their applications although there are some internal methods in wicket that might be able to do that

1850122
shutdown	restart
my thoughts are that since the application is running in a servlet-container it should have some way to shutdown and be restart

1850127
push	pull
if you have admin level credentials that apply to all your pcs and can get a list of all you r pcs network named you could push the files out through the c shared or if they login to a domain you can have them pull them via a login-script

1850143
multiplying	subtract
it doesn t make sense to compare an arrays to zero multiplying it or subtract it.

1850156
arrays	loops
3 loops where you printing the and s list is dereference the arrays using the wrong variables

1850156
contains	any
4 as far as the newline goes it s very likely the case that network i .name for any i contains a newline character that you re copying in

1850315
triggers	insert
for now i would make a new column to store the concatenation of all the rows you want to search add triggers to add all the text to your new column .when data gets insert or updates and just search off that one new column

1850329
midl	idl
the midl compilation can be handled by making the com-interop project a managed-c++ project instead of a c# project then adding the idl and h to the project as regular source files

1850392
pentaho	birt
it s hard to give a precise answer as you didn t give many details .so i d just suggest to have a look at jasperreport and ireport eclipse birt or pentaho report

1850400
display	width
depending on your visual display you may need an additional wrapping div to provide the 100 width background

1850405
exif	xmp
it also supports exif iptc xmp gps etc

1850438
margins	padding
i really haven t looked at the code closely but something to look at in this situation is the padding or margins set on the menu item divs

in current compilers we can t use short 16-bit if write short use 32-bit

1852362
ubuntu	linux
for example i compile same code with gcc4 in ubuntu linux 32-bit

1852363
glib	gtk
also gtk include glib which is a handy tool to have available for handling common data-structures and algorithms

1852381
fopen	fread
i would like something similar to fopen and fread where would return as soon as the first 1000 bytes have been read and the second call would be return after 2000 bytes have been read etc

1852385
solaris	linux
this should work for solaris and linux

1852385
solaris	unix
i guess other unix es works the same way as solaris does

1852386
binary	hex
convert binary to hex

1852386
subtract	add
for one s complement if the top bit is set you need to subtract 2 numbers of bits then add one

1852389
versioning	upgrade
you can as of iphone os 3.0 upgrade an applications from within an earlier versioning of that application but you cannot downloading and install other completely separate applications

1852397
unsigned	short
new because you are using variables as an index to an arrays you should declare it as unsigned short instead of short

1852397
negative-number	short
the short variables could be interpreter as a negative-number

1852398
decimal	hex
0100 in hex and decimal is 4 and 0011 in hex and decimal 3

1852407
32-bit	64bit
that dll is a 32-bit dll and it doesn t work .when execution in ssis on the 64bit production server

1852428
triggers	insert
however if you have control over the insert if all insert are done via a pl sql api then it is more efficient to use the sequences directly in the insert statement - because it avoids the overhead of firing a triggers

1852430
linux	unix
especially on unix linux systemd where it should be install using the distribution s package manager

1852433
look-and-feel	substance
i m using mac os x and use substance look-and-feel non-default systemd look-and-feel

1852433
look-and-feel	substance
.so we didn t have the mac os x feel by using non-default systemd look-and-feel substance look-and-feel

1852436
unsigned	short
use an unsigned short which just gives you enough room for this example but will go wrong if you want to get another 4 step forwarding

1852460
simplemodal	colorbox
i can t help you with colorbox but if you have a specific question or issue with simplemodal i d be happy to help

1852471
callback	methods
as an example let s take the nsurlconnection we don t know or can t predict .when it s going to call didreceiveresponse or the other callback methods can it be the case that didreceiveresponse get s called .when i m in the middle of another function

1852474
assign	add
inorder to add a hotel to a specific country you have to assign it using category

1852482
scala	java
since you are using java you may consider moving your code to scala since it interacts well with java then you can use traits to get the functionality you want

1852490
windows-xp	windows
the existing application is windows forms application c# .net v3.5 and the client is using windows-xp

1852492
hash	md5
you could use an md5 hash which has a theoretical possibility of collision - albeit 1 in billions of hash that may collider - although i can t say i d understand the purpose of using a hash over using the actual words

1852492
unique	words
of course - the words obviously has to be sufficiently unique inorder for us to understand it as humans and we re way more efficient at parsing the meaning of wordss than a computer is at doing the same

1852492
hash	md5
you don t have to worry about collision and you still get the most efficient indexing mechanism for storage purposes meaning you re not storing md5 hash that are potentially longer than the original words - which makes no sense for real world use

1852495
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works in firefox ie google-chrome but safari gives me an invalid date error

1852505
pixels	line
pixels perfect allows you to add a semi-transparent background-image to line up elements on a page show up as extra tab within the firebug plugins

1852507
background-image	width
i am trying to create a full width background-image that aligns vertically with a centered div

1852512
ethernet	packets
conversely any packets that are transmitted on the virtual interface can be read from the special file as raw ethernet frame

1852512
ethernet	packets
packets instead of ethernet frame

1852524
textbox	button
on a submit button the textbox info is to be checked on server and then accordingly the

1852538
constructor	object
now if what you really want is part 2 provide a dynamic loading plugins mechanism then you do not need to enforce the constructor but a common interface both for the plugins object and the creation of the plugins object

1852538
constructor	object
there is no way of initializer an instances of an object of unknown at compile-time object and that means that you will not be able to call the constructor from your code

1852545
decimal-point	digits
convert that numbers to decimal and round to 6 decimal digits after the decimal-point

1852545
decimal-point	digits
now round this value to 6 digits after the decimal-point

1852548
jquery-plugins	jquery
on a side note i don t know of any jquery-plugins that use canvas especially since jquery focuses mainly on html and canvas is almost entirely javascript driven from what i understand

1852562
uitableview	uitextview
i have a uitextview within a uitableview cell

1852616
ubuntu	linux
i m running it on ubuntu linux systemd updates both as limited user and root

1852620
perl	c++
moving from c++ to perl or ml could take a lot longer

1852634
perl	ruby	perl	c++	python	ruby	python	c++	python	perl	python	java
factors that can shorten the time are previous exposure to similar languages technologies a solid background in c makes c++ slightly faster to learn solid background in c# helps with java solid background in ruby or perl helps with python

1852642
nhibernate	ado.net
we had similar problems .when we used nhibernate and raw ado.net concurrently luckily - just for querying - at least for production code

1852642
updating	updates
all we had to do - force updating db on insert updates .so we could actually query .something through full-text search for .some specific entities

1852644
python	java
i d rather go for a very high level language like python c# or java and use a more practical toolkit

1852644
python	java
or qt or gtk for python there are even java bindings.

1852647
progress-bar	progress
.when the application runs the progress-bar s progress show as being 100 complete even though via snoop i can see the value is in fact 0

1852647
default-value	default
i still do not fully understand though how the progress-bar value which is calculated from minimum and maximum value is affected in this way and not the slider - the default-value of maximum appears to be having an effect and it looks as if the progress-bar default should affect the measure pass

1852653
selected	cell
in other words if you selected a range of cell hit ctrl+c and then move the selectedion to another cell i need the address of the cell that were selecteded .when the user hit ctrl+c

1852656
double	int
if your double are in fact as in the example int use int instead

1852666
while-loop	infinite
the reader continually show nodes types xmlnodestypes_none and fails to complete parsing getting stuck in an infinite while-loop

1852684
arrays	loops
.so i can effectively loops though each arrays elements and output it to the user

1852693
webserver	nginx
i m using capistrano to deploy a django application it uses nginx as the webserver using instructions i found at i had to look at a caching versioning earlier today and was wondering about the last cmd in there which is

1852729
ruby-on-rails	django
what i should be doing is learning oop but all the talks about ruby-on-rails and django interest me even more

1852764
parentheses	braces
each of these has the capacity to identify syntax errors such as wrong numbers of parentheses too many defs ends braces etc

1852781
widget	button
i made a simple jquery button widget plugins which initializer like this

1852818
silverlight	wpf
as silverlight is a branding and is being heavily promoted by microsoft project sponsers and funders are more likely to know it whereas wpf although well known by us will not be known outside the community

1852818
silverlight	wpf
.so for future project development this may drive demand for sl4 over wpf particularly if there is a perception that silverlight development is cheaper than wpf if the learning curve is less for a subset technology although i don t agree with that sentiment myself

1852820
buffering	streaming
my assumption is that if you want a streaming buffering that you can clear its contents at a specified time that you d be implements one of your own that derives from one of the standards streaming buffering classes but provides a clear member or whatever named you find convenient

1852841
show	next
modified ones will be show with a next to them

1852843
pseudo-element	pseudo-class
see 5.10 pseudo-element and pseudo-class of the css2 specifications

1852843
pseudo-element	pseudo-class
see 6.6 pseudo-class and 7 pseudo-element

1852876
python	php
since i know basic php as well as python i am inclined to use django since python is a much better language

1852876
codeigniter	symfony
just seems php has .so much more documentation and add-on that could assist with my requirements plus the frameworks such as symfony or codeigniter wrap .some of the weaknesses of the php language

1852909
realloc	malloc
use malloc realloc and friend for a growable arrays

1852916
python	php
i yearn to use python on a daily basis instead of php

1852931
tracking	robot
have you tried keeping tracking of the last valor object in the robot object

1852937
background-color	width	background-color	height
then just set the width height background-color to do what you want

1852937
background-color	width	background-color	height
you could easily make this a user-controls and just expose some custom public properties to set the width height for you and the background-color of all the labels to change the color

1852940
ruby-on-rails	django
it does not get in your way while being pretty full-featured we have production ajax sites with heavy report all custom though and never regretted going with django over ruby-on-rails or especially php

1852943
perl	c++
i realized that not only did it borrow ideas from perl and c++ but the whole paradigms of coding with integrated sql statements strongly drew on some experience i had in the 90 s with of all things informix 4gl

1852943
scala	java
this is going to take substantially longer and there ll be a long period where my scala will feel like java in disguise and not be that functional

1852959
value	field
i am trying to hide some of the field on the form if a particular value is selected

1852974
command-line	cmd
it is very possible for the command-line of a running process to be changed by changing the memory which stores those cmd

1852983
jquery	dojo
checkout jquery and dojo and see if it might help you out

1853000
put	get
i get following out put

1853001
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
see oracle vs mysql vs sql-server aggregation vs join for an example of this

1853014
attributes	properties
i believe the json serialization only works against properties and not field and they need to be marked with the data-members attributes

1853031
google-chrome	firefox
if not this worked for me in ie google-chrome and firefox

1853038
python	c++	python	java
for example i picked up python really fast i m a java c++ guy but it took a long time since i stopped writing java styles code in python and started thinking functionally

1853040
double-quotes	single-quotes
the cmd above all used single-quotes rather than double-quotes

1853068
stdin	pipe
postdata is whatever is fed to php s stdin subject to the content_length environment variables telling php how many bytes to read .so to change the postdata you simply pipe in .something different

1853086
put	get
if you just put the database files inside a vhd then as said originally all is easy except you don t get the detailed treatment you probably want

1853095
selected	listbox
you should probably notice that listbox is using a selected html elements have a look at the generator html code and afaik you cannot styles the color of the arrow as it is browser dependent

1853097
key-value	key
which gives each row as an associativity key-value pair where the key is the column named

1853120
value	field
i want to fetch image named and 3 more field s value from database and pass it to the javascript s array....which would b generator from database image named and 3 field

1853129
while-loop	infinite
.so .when i run this code to try to change the background the gui crash and gets stuck in a infinite while-loop ignoring the event listener

1853131
linux	bsd
if this is for linux only you can probably go with the gnu cmd but if you want this to work on systemd with a non-gnu sed eg bsd mac os-x you might want to go with the more portable option

1853141
value	field
first of all if you can assume that bytecode is valid the types of value assign to a field should match the field types which you can read in advance using classreader api

1853141
pointers	stack
however if you need to tracking where each individual value on a stack or variables slot for given instruction pointers came from you can use the analyzer api with sourceinterpreter

1853148
boost-asio	boost
i want to use boost-asio but i don t want boost to throw exception-handling because in my environment exception-handling must not be raised

1853149
unsigned	short
in embedded systemd the short and unsigned short data types are used for accessing items that required less bits than the native int

1853149
32-bit	16-bit	unsigned	short
for example if my usb controllers has 16-bit registers and my processor has a native 32-bit int i would use an unsigned short to access the registers provided that the unsigned short data types is 16-bit

1853149
32-bit	16-bit
also this may be a performance hit on some 32-bit processor as they have to fetch 32-bit near the 16-bit variables and eliminate the unwanted 16-bit

1853152
data-structures	tree
because tree data-structures are often used to organize order elements e.g a b c

1853157
primitive	int
an id is any object but not a primitive for example int s are primitive while nsarray s are object and in extension id s

1853162
constructor	object
this is possible since i pass each parent object through the constructor of it s child

1853177
bazaar	git
git is in favour bazaar seems to have fallen out of favour

1853197
revision	updates
currently it will always run upon updates .when a new revision is needed

1853198
subclassing	nsobject
they do not have to be subclassing of nsobject but that is the most typical

1853206
contains	elements
your real xml actually contains an elements without a title attributes

1853208
quicksort	heapsort
heapsort has a worst case complexity of o nlogn while quicksort has o n 2

1853219
quicksort	heapsort
however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is

1853224
implements	extends
i m trying to implements a shell extension that extends icontextmenu3 and ishellextinit and i m insert menu items using the methods describe in section hbmmenu_callback methods but in my project the methods handlemenumsg2 or the handlemenumsg is never called

1853226
textbox	button
i have an textbox and link button in edit itemtemplate

1853227
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
say i have my application be it asp.net webforms asp.net-mvc or winforms and i decide for one rea.son or another that from a maintenance standpoint it s better to have a couple of classes move out to their own separate libs .so that i can float other applications on top of it .some time down the road

1853230
droppable	draggable
i want to make an elements droppable again but only if the draggable that was lying there is move elsewhere meaning doesn t revert

1853232
checkbox	button
if you need to use radio button or checkbox then you ll need some way of differentiating between the required form elements types

1853242
logout	login
i switched my login logout session to be purely cookies based all i need for my solution ...for a more secure implementation i think asp.net has built-in .profile s ...as well as...asp.net sessions stored in your datebase...which i did not feel like researching implimenting at the time

1853243
required	checked
you have to learn to write exception-handling safe code and even if you have some experience with it it will still be required to double checked any single line of code to be safe

1853261
value	field
due to the way checkbox are handled 0 is considered false for checkbox and boolean field but is a true value in ruby

1853267
hide	show
.so you can probably decide what controls columns to hide show bind inside this row databound event

1853268
arrays	loops
in the above loops you are reading a quantity of bsize at each positioning in the cha arrays

1853269
any	set
for sure don t use ajax to set request parameters in the session while they are sent to the server side at any way

1853276
uitableview	uiview
in my uiview nib file i ve got a uitableview which takes up about half the screens

1853278
getter	setter
get rid of all the getter and setter as jeffrey says

1853296
communication	messages
all synchronized and communication is done by exchanging messages

1853319
click	mouse
in many gui programs the main program wait for an event such as a mouse click to happen then process the event

1853319
widget	button
many gui object widget such as a button pass messages to other object

1853344
json	xml
the responsetext of the messages to the callback inconsistently varies between blank and the actual xml that the json webservice returns

1853348
json	xml
you say it s json but it returns xml

1853374
if-statement	loops
one example is loops unrolling and another using boolean programming techniques rather than using if-statement

1853396
constructor	object
hex object constructor

1853419
perl	ruby	perl	php	perl	c++	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	c++	python	perl	python	java	haskell	scheme	haskell	prolog	haskell	perl	haskell	ada	haskell	fortran	haskell	python	haskell	c++	haskell	lisp	haskell	pascal	fortran	pascal	fortran	perl	fortran	ada	pascal	basic	pascal	ada	pascal	scheme	scheme	lisp	scheme	ada	scheme	prolog	prolog	lisp	brainfuck	lisp	brainfuck	pascal	brainfuck	scheme	verilog	vhdl	verilog	ada	vhdl	ada

1853421
command-line	cmd
same limitations as passing the cmd through the command-line

1853449
exception-handling	try-catch
in addition to providing exception-handling safety the techniques above guarantee correctness in a way that is near impossible to achieve with try-catch blocks

1853449
exception-handling	try-catch
the same techniques will also help you continue to run correctly in the face of exception-handling without try-catch blocks everywhere

1853449
exception-handling	try-catch
you only want to see try-catch .when you can do something about a specific exception-handling

1853449
ostringstream	std
eschew std printf printf and arrays in general - use std ostringstream for formatting and replace arrays with std vector and std string

1853449
boost	stl
.when in doubt look for functionality in boost or stl before rolling your own

1853471
arrays	loops
as you can see no major difference only i removed the strlen from the for loops and stored it in a variables and precalculated the arrays for the index a bit clumsy.

1853474
innodb	myisam
i just went to look over one my site s databases and noticed that all of the tables had been converted to myisam they used to be innodb

1853492
background-color	border-color
if this is just about presentation put a panels that fills the form with a background-color of the border-color you want and a dock styles of fill

1853492
margins	padding
play with padding and margins of the two panelss to get the border size you wish i forget which param applies correclty to the inner panels and the outer panels

1853511
checkbox	button
this .each routine works great with one small problem - .when the last checkbox val 5 is checked and you hit the refresh button the row 6 with class hide5 is hidden

1853513
udp	tcp
then in wireshark you will be seeing protocols headers depends upon whether it is tcp socket or a udp one followed by data

1853513
udp	tcp
.so you can see this particular data in the particular s packets s data section data section of tcp udp packets

1853523
synonym	term
i think the quote from wikipedia uses the term recursive as a synonym for computable #8212

1853593
boolean	int	multiplication	multiplying
this is because multiplication coerces the boolean to an int 0 for false 1 for true and in python multiplying a string by an int repeat the string n time

1853618
attributes	properties
you need to put attributes on your entity classes and attributes on every properties or field you want to have serialization

1853662
.when	ready
any idea how i can get a div to say something similar to loading to show while the page prepares itself and then vanish .when everything is ready

1853673
python	c++	python	java
i m completely new to python but have used java and c++ before

1853677
command-prompt	runas
use runas to start a command-prompt as your webserver user from an administration command-prompt

1853691
contains	elements
create a elements that contains your loading messages give the an id and then .when your content has finished loading hide the

1853702
for-loop	loops
i have also found replacing the foreach loops with a for-loop which are quicker

1853712
exception-handling	try-catch
i know i could use a try-catch block but shouldn t you only use exception-handling for exceptional situations

1853716
export	report
i have to develop desktop base software in c#.net which only produces report and that report can be export to any format

1853722
assign	add
if i assign the value 202 to variables a and 207 to variables b then add a+b it gives me the correct answer 409

1853727
base-class	inherited
i have a family of classes that inherited from the same base-class

1853727
any	set
i want a methods in the base-class to be invoked any time a properties in a derrived class is accessed get or set

1853731
required	checked
just make the program .when they start it up checked the date and if required connect to an ftp site and just downloading the file to the client machine

1853737
haskell	c++
i m writing a haskell wrapper for a c++ libs and as much as i can import functions from the libs to my haskell program i have no clue how to import c++ data types

1853737
haskell	c++
now i know that you can create typess in haskell but still i need a starting points as to what to defined the types to whatever the c++ representation is

1853740
value	field
you can see the clear before the add value in reversemanyrelatedobjectsdescriptor and manyrelatedobjectsdescriptor in django db model field related.py

1853746
32-bit	x86
.when you say 32-bit i ll assume you mean x86

1853746
64bit	x86
however x86 can efficiently load 16 and 8bit int into 32 or 64bit registers

1853766
haskell	c++
calling c++ from haskell is quite difficult

1853769
boost	stl
it is in fact necessary .when you need to work with stl or boost code

1853769
rollback	commit
the same can be said for a strong function which enables you to write code with transactional semantics like databases with commit rollback features the commit being normals execution of the code throw exception-handling being the rollback

1853769
expression	evaluation
signed overflow is unspecified-behavior c++11 5 4 if during the evaluation of an expression the result is not mathematically defined or not in the range of representable value for its types the behavior is undefined. note that unsigned-integer do not overflow but do their computations in an equivalence class modulo 2 #bits

1853795
bitblt	gdi
bitblt is the only other gdi function that will preserve the alpha channel in any way

1853827
decimal	hex	numeric	digits
but putting them back you then unpack the string which gets you an arrays of int which are the ascii value of the digits in the decimal representation of the numeric value of the original hex string and then you .to_s that which io would have done anyway .so no blame there at least but this then results in a string with the printable representation of the ascii numbers of the unpack string .so you are now light-years from the original intention

1853835
rollback	commit
.so if i need to remove it or rollback i m not wading through a bunch of commit wondering where i actually started and finished it

1853846
digits	base
if you compute the permanent of this matrix m using the ryser formula then the kth digits of the permanent in base x tells you the numbers of permutation for which the dot-product is exactly k

1853856
windows-vista	windows
- windows-vista professional 64bit - windows 7 ultimate 64bit

1853863
debian	linux	linux	bsd	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
and best of all apt which is available for free on all debian -based linux and bsd distributions like ubuntu

1853868
boolean	int
for example say i want a function that takes two int and returns a boolean i could defined a function that uses that like this

1853875
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i ve tested it on google-chrome 4.0.249.27 opera 10.10 safari 4.0.4 and firefox 3.5.5

1853883
value	field
i am trying to do form validation by putting the .post value into variables and those variables into an arrays and then cycling through them and outputting error messages for field that are not filled in

1853883
value	field
firstly the if-statement is running for all the value even if the field is-empty or is to undefined and secondly i don t know how to printing out the actual named of a variables instead of the variables value

1853901
contains	elements
in strict mode all inline elementss must be contains in a block elements

1853909
contains	set
the request data in this example contains a file file1.dat and a form parameter submit-name which is set to larry

1853924
permutation	sudoku
however i think the idea is fundamentally flawed many sudoku permutation are solved in a matter of a couple thousands of forward+backtracking step and are solved within milliseconds on a single thread

1853928
base-class	inherited
if the base-class isn t sealed then you can inherited from it and write a new methods that hide the base one use the new keyword in the methods declaration

1853943
comma	words
to take care of that you either have to add the words separators to the str_replace call see the comment of an example but this will get quite complicated .when you want to take care of all common words separators spaces comma dots exclamation marks question marks etc.

1853945
registration	login
2 make your site s registration functionality create forum login data

1853963
vbulletin	phpbb
i ve written systemd in both php and asp.net c# that integrated with phpbb or vbulletin databases

authentication	login
the login functionality is the easiest part to implements because the hash is stored in the db usually a salt will be too and you just need to checked one field to another and voila you can authentication

1853971
derived-class	base-class
i think you re getting overloading and overrides confused overloading means you have two or more methodss with the same named but different sets of parameters while overrides means you have a different implementation for a methods in a derived-class thereby replacing or modifying the behavior in it s base-class

1853974
any	set
usually in this situation though i set up my table view controllers as a delegation for each cell and the cell can callback the controllers with any changes along with some key-value used to create the cell - after all .when you are populating a cell you know how to reach into your dataset to pull out value

1853996
vbscript	basic
there is also a visual basic runtime to run vbscript

1853999
logging	trace
if the process is getting it via kill 2 then unless the process is already logging the only external trace would be a kernel mod

1854006
managed-code	unmanaged
this wrapper does all the dirty work of converting the unmanaged secondlayer into managed-code

1854011
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
if you want an application to choose overloads at runtime and pick the best overload by looking at the object while the application is running that s called dynamic-dispatch and is only used by dynamic-languages such as ruby python php etc

1854018

cappuccino	sproutcore
i m curious about how it compares to sproutcore or cappuccino

1854144
32-bit	64bit
from what i ve done before this code works perfectly on 32-bit machines no warning have t tested the exact same code but the same but on my 64bit it gives this warning on compile

1854149
32-bit	64bit
what you describe has all the hallmarks of targeting different bitnesses as you probably know - ulong_ptr is 32-bit in 32-bit compilation targets and 64bit in 64bit compilation targets but native-code must be either one or the other at compile-time

1854165
web-services	api
if you are using the the fedex web-services api you get a test key by going to

1854187

javascript has some very odd language-features like the handling of missing semicolons at statement endings by just ignoring the parsing error semicolon insert or the behavior of the typeof operators arrays is an object

1854257
getter	setter
my entities looks like this with default setter and getter

1854278
multiprocess	stackless
stackless python didn t take a good usage of multi-core .so where is the points it should be faster than python thread multiprocess

1854288
default	reset
but after setting a variables how do i reset it to the default such that returns false

1854333
erlang	python
if you really want to scale and still use python you could look at distribute erlang with python process managed as erlang ports on a distribute cluster

1854336
credentials	security
it presents an immense security risk as a swf can easily be decompiled and a malicious individual can then use the credentials compiled in the swf to perform whatever queries they would like

1854364
default-value	default
it default to whatever the dft_mttb_types database configuration parameter is -- and the default-value is systemd - .so the optimizer would ignore your mqt

1854364
any	set
dft_refresh_age still applies -- for a user-maintained mqt the current refresh age register must be set to any inorder for a refresh deferred mqt to be considered

1854376
any	set
note that a types s properties should be able to be set and retrieved in any order

1854376
arrays	loops
as a result 2n+1 copies of the arrays will be created in the following loops

1854388
variables	boolean
sql-server doesn t have any native true boolean data types in the sense that you could use a variables in-place of a boolean-expression like

1854399
arrays	loops
furthermore your arrays will always be empty in -viewdidload because your delegation methods can t be called until you return control to your run loops

1854404
attributes	properties
if the information you need is an attributes or quality go with properties

1854451
nsresponder	nstextview
nsresponder subclassinging such as a custom subclassing of nstextview handle key-events

authentication	login
from what i read and understood which might be incorrect google federated login uses the hybrid protocols to authentication and fetch the google data

1854486
subtraction	division
there s an additional speed-up available if you do the division before the subtraction especially since inthe latter the division cancels the multiplication.

1854520
constructor	object
what i would suggest is that you either give the cmd the sendtextmessage function or object that allows for that functionality think of the sqlconnection in it s constructor

1854523
expression-blend	silverlight
can any one points me to a tutorial or tell me how to connect a mysql database to a silverlight project in expression-blend

1854533
lookup	any
some filesystems do not have any sort of data structure for filename lookup but just do a linear scan of the directory

1854533
directory-structure	filesystems
might it be a good idea to not stress the filesystems and make a nice hierarchical directory-structure

1854539
firefox	gecko

1854583
singleton	facade
i m attempting to create an instances of the singleton facade class

1854583
factory-method	singleton
this ifacade implementation is a singleton .so you should not call the constructor directly but instead call the static singleton factory-method facade.instance

1854592
contains	lookup	contains	set
the way i made it faster is by having a thread-safe set contains all usernames i had to lookup

1854607

1854652
value	field
small queries can often complete without creating temporary tables just by getting all value from the index .so long as the field you re selected and predicating on are indexed

1854681
decimal-point	digits
basically you want to look for all sequencess of digitss optional ending with a decimal-point and another digits sequences and then append a c

1854681
decimal-point	digits
d+ is 1 or more digits and then . d+ is 1 or more digits after a decimal-point

1854688
while-loop	for-loop
what are the performance issue of using while-loop v s foreach for-loop or vice-versa

1854697
while-loop	for-loop
hypothetically a foreach may be slower - a for-loop and a while-loop with the same conditional should be equivalent

1854710
python	perl
python has datetime.datetime.strptime and perl has pthreads strptime

1854713
any	set
i ran into this problem while writing a server software that keeps tracking of a global recording set by pulling the information from several producer systemd and relay any changes to the recording set to consumer systemd in real-time or near real-time in preprocessor form

1854714
matroska	avi
the containers mp4 matroska avi etc. simply contains several multimedia and or text streaming into a single file and the format of the containers simply specifies the way in which these streaming are stored into your containers file and nothing about the video inside it

1854716
affinity	cpu
it seems like cpu affinity and the concept of threading itself is separate from that

1854754
look-and-feel	substance
i have also been unable to find any easy way to inject these default into substance at the look-and-feel level.

1854756

1854761
arrays	loops
i have an associativity arrays and while iterator through this arrays using foreach loops

1854769
32-bit	64bit
even if you are allowed to compile in 32-bit mode anyone else can configure it to be run in 64bit application-pool mistakenly

1854795

1854806
javascript	dom
is there a nice libs in python that will clean out all the event handler attributes elements and other javascript cruft from html or a dom tree

1854826
document	editing
what s offered is document editing roughly similar to ms-word and spreadsheet roughly similar to excel

1854826
google-docs	spreadsheet
in google-docs you can create spreadsheet for free

1854830
expression	evaluation
for example i occasionally come across situations where i want to have a conditional statement controlled by a constants but the compiler will complain with a warning about a conditional expression evaluation to a constants

1854830
expression	evaluation
but at least one compiler i use issues a warning about the expression always evaluation to false

1854839
writetofile	nsstring
personally i would go with the log_fine log_info styles and use something like nsstring s writetofile methods

1854843
freebsd	bsd
they also create a freebsd drivers with this libs and release the source code of the bsd drivers but not the libs source code

1854861
decrement	increment
and as an aside i favor the prefix increment decrement operators --idx in for for-loops since it will avoid taking an unnecessary copy of idx though many compilers will probably recognize this and fix it for you

1854877
versioning	migrate
it migrate from svn where versioning were actually called r678 for example but someone cooked up a scripting to generator numbers from git

1854882
lazy-evaluation	maybe
maybe you re lazy-evaluation like i am

1854891
put	get
-for report asp.net it is very good because of using of controls which you can bind to data very fast and easily...if you put on top of that some asp.net commercial report tool like telerik i think you get pretty stable and robust systemd

1854896
arrays	loops
then you can loops through the arrays to insert-into the database

1854912
publishing	enterprise
i am using sharepiont server 2007 enterprise with windows-server 2008 enterprise and i am using publishing portal templates

1854942
composite-controls	asp.net
all of the examples of asp.net composite-controls always clear child controls as the first action within createchildcontrols

1854959
document	editing
everything is possible but it may required some work - one idea might be to use automation on the server side to read the document and then display a page that contains the content of that document and allow some easy reading editing that on the server side would again use automation to updates the document

1854963
vbscript	vba
if you are running ie only you can do it with vba vbscript

1854976
export	report
the export functionality provides an export format called report definition which will export the complete definition including all formula to a text file

1855045
arguments	undefined
typechecking in javascript is non-existent you can pass fewer arguments into a function than are declare in the function ... signature in which case the arguments that aren t passed get received as undefined and you can pass more than declare in which case the only way to read them is through the arguments arrays which always contains exactly how many arguments were passed in regardless of what s in the function signature

1855050
32-bit	64bit
if it s relying on drivers in the wrong way it will fail as 32-bit drivers just don t work on 64bit systemd

1855051
windows	wow64	32-bit	64bit
the system32 folder in 64bit windows actually contains the 64bit files and 32-bit programs running under wow64 would generally go looking in system32 for the 32-bit dlls etc

1855060
32-bit	64bit
windows has a technology called wow 64 windows-on-windows 64bit that allows 32-bit applications even compiled ones written in c++ etc. to run on 64bit windows

1855060
32-bit	64bit
in addition to the system32 folder a 64bit windows installation has a syswow64 folder that has 32-bit versioning of the files that you ll find in system32

1855066
filesystems	fileinfo
i have read examples that seem to advocate using the fileinfo or directoryinfo object to do checked with the exists properties but i am specifically looking for a way to search an existing collections list of files and not live checked to the filesystems for each file since i will be doing .so across the network and constantly going back to a multi-thousand-file directory is slow slow slow

1855084
hide	show
i know how to show hide the divs with jquery but the problem is that the divs will increase in height and then they will push the other tabs and divs down

1855088
hide	show
if you are only hiding and showing field then just have them all in control b and hide the ones that should not be show

1855088
any	set
most controls will not rendering any html to the output streaming if you set their visible properties to false .so there is minimal impact on the client side .when the page gets sent back to the client

1855093
nstextview	nswindow
i just needed to initializer my subclassing with a nstextview nswindow reference to the class in ib

1855096
checkbox	textbox
i have a userform with some textbox entry field on it that are enabled disabled by a checkbox

1855096
checkbox	textbox
the textbox is the next control after the checkbox in the tab order .so it seems like using the tab order to find the appropriate textbox would be a good idea

1855100
decimal-point	digits
decide on how many digits you want after the decimal-point eg

1855101
exc-bad-access	crash
my .app crash with exc-bad-access

python	java
we d mainly be running matlab java or python simulation for either monte-carlo or parameter explorations

1855142
sitecore	umbraco
there are many competitors to what they want to do with sharepoint umbraco sitecore sitefinity etc and most of them seem better than 100 custom

1855143
setinterval	settimeout
i think rather than settimeout you need to use setinterval

1855154

nsunknownkeyexception reason setvalue forundefinedkey this class is not key-value coding-compliant for the key countdown.

1855165
textbox	button
i input an id numbers unique on a textbox and click the search button

1855167
put	get
as it stands you can get stuff to mostly work but there are some seriously scary workarounds you will have to put in-place to get stuff going

1855172
hide	show
you will need to defined the pages divs to hide show and tabs in two separate divs

1855183
primitive	int
this means that in many cases the operators appears to work for strings in the same way that it does for int or other primitive value

1855185
innodb	myisam
you can t simply set the mysql systemd variables to yes to convert the table from myisam to innodb

1855185
innodb	myisam
.when innodb support is turned off even is you use engine innodb in your create-table statements the table will use the default storage engine for mysql which is normally myisam

1855196
arrays	loops
another thing - checked for a comma before explode to make sure you will get an arrays and also checked in loops if what can take place if _post tags would be for example or tag1

1855197
selected	button
and i thought that if i create an xml file to contains all data 1db for .avi .mpeg etc and other from .srt .sub files i can parsing the selected data to flash and create that button link - use to see all movie on my desktop and control swf with my remote control

1855203
sin	exp
not sure about ruby but java has for example a whole class math that contains nothing but instances methods like sin max exp and .so forth there is no math object these are just methods that embody mathematical algorithms

if both fail creates a single elements arrays contains arg unless arg is nil

1855209
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i have nsstring text containss slovo and i need that nsmutablestring currentrequest contains t e x t

1855241
expression	evaluation
note that operands narrower than int are widened either to int or unsigned int during expression evaluation anyway

1855248
base-class	inherited
if you need to make it work for this case you should traversal the inherited hierarchy and test each base-class for being

1855252
ironpython	ironruby
keep in mind with ironruby and ironpython there are 2 separate types-systemds in play there is the underlying clr types systemd and the ironruby ironpython types systemd .when they call out to c# code there is marshalling going on

1855252
ironpython	ironruby
.so even though ironruby ironpython can properly monkey patch their own types systemd they can not use the same mechanism to patch the clrs types systemd

1855254
expression	evaluation
this is why c defined typess and operations as it does - the size of int is not mandated by the standards allowing compiler author to make it correspond to a machine words and expression evaluation is defined to promote smaller int typess to int greatly reducing the numbers of points at which results must be coerced to some target types

1855274
contains	any
that global counter is increment whenever any row in any table contains a rowversion column is insert or updates

1855275
instances	private
a module function is a methods that is both a class methods on the module and also a private instances methods

1855283
logout	login
find all login logout events before 10am and filtering those such that max login max logout

1855295

selected	button
in the designer selected the form and set the acceptbutton to your button

1855303
duplicates	contains

python	ruby
but if the scripting are very algorithmic then python or ruby would be better

1855432
fopen	fread
does fopen and fread take to much time

1855436
assign	add
if you want your program to act as a real multithreading os where more process can be active than cpus available you ll have to add some sort of scheduling that can assign a part of a process on one of the available cpus then before the first is done let another process use that same cpu for a part of its work etc

the second line does initializer new the object by calling it s constructor

1855483
constructor	private
your second example is a similar thing form1 is your form class constructor and will initializer your private member field bob

1855488
constructor	object
it is important that the reference is const however or else the compiler must expect that the object can be modified by the constructor

1855510
object-reference	instances
if you try accessing dog s properties instances methods public variables without doing a dog new animal you will get a runtime error object-reference not set to instances of the object

1855520
iequalitycomparer	icomparer
here is an example using icomparer and iequalitycomparer

1855531
contains	any
.so your long chaining of findstr s would ignore every line that contains even a single work from any one search string

1855536
data-members	constructor
here in the above program form1 constructor should run first but the initializer is done outside the constructor .so how would the constructor come to know about the initializer and in return use guy s data-members cash is a data-members of of guy class

1855538
constructor	object
passing by reference gives you a performance difference the program does not have to make a copy of the whole object before passing it to the constructor

1855538
constructor	object
passing by const ensures that you can call the constructor with temporary object

1855554
getter	setter

i want it to permute through all the possible value of the exponent for each primes factors and then find the product to give the factors

1855580
getter	setter
that is a class with an implicit default-constructor and private properties which are exposed by public getter setter

1855585
video-streaming	streaming
perhaps you can use an existing solution for streaming such as rtp-h263 for video-streaming

1855753
while-loop	arrays
edit ok .so i edited the .source a bit changed from object to double and added insert value into the arrays after they were insert into the arrayslist but it still doesn t work - the while-loop isn t execute a single time

1855755
factors	primes
this returns a list of powers of primes factors while it should produce a list of these construct like this

1855755
factors	primes	factorization	factors	factorization	primes
the primes factorization of all possible factors is needed but the function seems to return just one primes factorization

1855811
order	add
the problem is that i need the range to maintain the order in which i add the cell .so that i can then collect the data in the correct order .when i go back through

1855811
order	add
is there any way to preserve the order in which i add cell to a range

1855812
cos	sin
.so you get cos foo 0 and sin foo 1 what you expected

1855831

next in your graphing plotting page put the output you want to show to the user in a div with the same id

1855839
dictionary	arrays
a string arrays or dictionary variables that gets all of the value

1855839
dictionary	arrays
i am wondering if this is a lot more process than creating a string arrays or dictionary and just returning the appropriate value

1855850
hide	show
but problem is that it hide user1 â s post and show only user2 â s post after added date

1855854
contains	set
get responsetext from the request it contains whatever your python scripting produced and set innerhtml of a control that display your graphing

1855868
ubuntu	linux
this is describe under ubuntu fix though it actually applies to other linux es as well in the cucumber wiki at

1855877
affinity	cpu
sched_setaffinity sched_getaffinity â set and get a process s cpu affinity mask

1855941
pixels	line
note that in the case of the example you give above only each line of pixels data is aligned

1855941
pixels	line
the pixels themselves are still 3 bytes long and often unaligned within the line .so there s not much benefit here

1855947
cosine	cos
the smoothest noise is a cos t function but cubic or quintic polynomials can be used to approximate a cosine

1855955
document-ready	ready
i thought document-ready was fired after all the scripting are loaded and ready to go

1855979
click	mouse
.when the original methods is fired seemingly a mouse click the dosomethingmethods should fire

1855986
.net	wcf
if your programming the methods in .net then use wcf

1855998
hide	show
i have made a very quick jquery slideshow and i m using this to hide the div s which shouldn t be show until it s their turn obviously

1856018
hide	show
then if you can be sure the user has javascript enabled you can hide the divs using css and show them using javascript

1856019
beautifulsoup	html5lib
also can use beautifulsoup and html5lib for parsing

1856019
beautifulsoup	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	html5lib	lxml
out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup

1856023
jms	jta
we re currently working on testing jta failure behavior on a systemd that receives messages using jms persistent them and send results using another class

1856050
beautifulsoup	lxml
use html parsing such as provided by lxml or beautifulsoup

1856069
switching	screens
this is as opposed to what it sounds like you were asking for which was new frame which imo doesn t really help if you have limited screens real estate because you re now having to switching frame graphical windows

1856081
boolean	int
false priority int 0 useweakreference boolean false void

1856096
any	set
the solution above setpixelbufferattributes does set the preview size correctly but once movie recording starts the preview image will get set back to it s original value 1280 x 1024 on my mbp if you ve set almost any compression options

1856160
sql-server	mysql
this is my first time i use mysql as datastorage for my c# application as i ve seen that there is no uniqueidentifier types as in sql-server i decieded to use int with auto_increment my problem is now if i execute a insert how may i get the id of the recording i just added

1856165
arrays	loops
it s a question of whether or not repeat the if test inside loops is less efficient that another traversal of the arrays

1856225
ruby	php
there is a php and ruby implementation for that

1856251
contains	any
any registry key contains javasoft is most likely only for the sun jvm and not any other like ibm or bea

1856278
getter	setter
however there are internal members in the abstract base properties with internal setter and public getter that the service uses .so it needs to be in the same assembly as the service for that to be possible

1856302
positioning	slider
the intention is that the white rounded rectangle with the textblock combobox and slider should always be positioning off to the right of the grey rectangle

1856305
windows-vista	windows
also windows 7 was designed to be compatible like windows-vista unlike how vista was sometimes incompatible with xp

1856310
instances	destroy
i suppose i could destroy the original instances and load a new configuration one for enabled one for disabled but it seems as though there should be a more elegant way of loading and unloading plugins

1856312
execution	exit
it can happen at any time basically although there are delay-abort regions such as constrained execution regions and catch finally blocks where the abort request is just remembered and the thread aborted .when it exit the region

1856313
postgresql	mysql
i guess i could required the install of a database server but a commercial mysql license doesn t make sense postgresql is different enough that i d have to rewrite a lot of my application

1856316
constructor	object
if however your object can be fixed in the constructor with default value in the event that the validation fails then use default value to provide the caller with an object that is useless but not corrupt

1856321
constructor	private	constructor	object
if you use factory-method for the construction of complex object you ll typically have a private constructor and required initializer through the factory

1856335
constructor	object
if your constructor throw an exception-handling the reference to your object is not returned .so the object can be immediately garbage collected

1856340
constructor	private
i ve primarily seen and used a static getinstance and private constructor just for use of the singleton pattern

1856357
stl-algorithm	std
however if i were to use an stl-algorithm or iterate over an other containers types such as std map i would of course use iterator

1856364
.when	ready
the main thread will need to recover that extra info and take into account that the queue will be empty if the keyboard interrupt is actually due to the user hitting control-c or the like .so use get_nowait and be ready to deal with a queue.empty exception-handling for example format it however you desire and terminate if all secondary threads are daemons s the whole process terminate .when the main thread terminate

1856385
javascript	dom
get the javascript code from the server enclosed in tags append it into dom and execute a function

1856395

1856411
hide	show
i made some progress with this but i cannot distinguish touch-events and thus i fire a toolbar hide show methods .when it should not be fired

1856411
caanimation	nstimer	hide	show
the methods -toggletoolbarview triggers an nstimer -timed caanimation that hide show a

1856411
hide	show
i can also hide show the toolbar with single-taps

1856411
instances	private
instead of messing with the uiwebview instances s private uiscroller i access its inner private uiwebdocumentview

1856411
instances	private
.so now my transparency vieweroverlayview correctly passes zoom stretch double-tap touch-events to the viewerwebview instances s private uiwebdocumentview instances

1856411
hide	show
.so far i can observe taps hide and show the toolbar and the uiwebview behaves like a webview

1856413
antivirus	security
i know that for windows its security apps such as antivirus or firewalls and maybe some other stuff

but since it s a shared server i don t have a whole lot of privileges outside of my home-directory

1856455
arrays	loops
good points about performance .when iterator over very sparse-matrix arrayss - i d suggest that perhaps using isnan parseint in loops lets you find arrays elements only

1856468
long-integer	unsigned
i have a unsigned long-integer value which represents a float using ieee-754 format

1856495
value	field
the problem is after i press submit the value remains in named and content field

1856524
required	checked
the call to hello is equivalent to the commented-out one - the route to getting an ihello doesn t matter unless it required execution-time checked or conversion

1856535
web-config	app-config
off-topic everyone i ve asked advised me to keep the connection strings in app-config web-config but ymmv

1856539
variables	boolean
btw notice that you don t need to use boolean constructor .when working with boolean variables and .when you declare you can simply use boolean literals

1856544
qcheckbox	qobject
.so if there is no ready way to differentiate between programmatic and user-induced changes to the state of the qcheckbox and the only options are subclassing adding the stateedited signals or fiddling with void qobject blocksignalss bool block why does this have to be .so is it an .some .sort of inconsistency in qt

1856546
global-assembly-cache	gac
it will still work without the codebase switching but the dll will show up in the global-assembly-cache as well which just adds clutter to the gac and enrolls you in alot of features i don t need for my com-interop scenarios

1856556
dictionary	arrays
asp.net wire format for model binding to arrays lists collections dictionary

1856558

row	col
int row col

1856597
row	col
return row other.row col other.col

1856607
base-class	inherited
normally the assumption is that it makes sense in a base-class but isn t supported for the current types treeview - but treeview inherited from control .so i m not sure what is going on here

1856619
row	col
what you need is to make a precedence between row col .so that really works like you d expect

1856623
put	get
and put a corresponding intialization in a single source file to get a modifiable value shared across translation units

1856633

1856689
environment	building
your derived-class might break with another stl implementation or just with an updates of the building environment

1856689
data-members	constructor
in your case providing additional constructor is fine since the public interface is documented and you can replicate that and as long as you are not introducing new data-members or a vmt slicing or non-virtual destructor is not a problem

1856696
updating	updates
i m updating a third party spreadsheet component gembox and the updates process involves manually dropping the new versioning of the assembly into the gac of the dev machine

1856907
any	set
if you do it in code you must set it before any call to response.write

1856908
temporary	copy
if you just want to be able to cancel edits then make a temporary copy of the file and invoke your editor on that

you can certainly store preferences as children of the user nodes

1857035
duplicates	sorted
call a sorting algorithm and then call your own function to detection duplicates in the sorted list

1857054
internet-explorer	firefox
you should use firefox and internet-explorer 8

1857064
put	get
methods you could add a hidden input to a regular get .post form with the pseudo-method and have your application translation it .so that your controllers see it as if it were a true put request as you mentioned

1857064
put	get
however get .post put and delete are supported in ajax by the major browsers .so there should be no need for a hidden input if you aren t relying on the html form

1857088
.when	ready
look at the browser s progress-bar it may be loading some counters and the document is not ready until they reload this often happens .when external resources are slow

1857103

what are the difference between np np-complete and np-hard

1857255
positioning	slider
i wanna the hpaned to remember the slider positioning then i need to catch the event of hpaned s changing slider positioning

1857255
positioning	slider
according to official .doc paned only have a few signals and none of them is about slider s positioning

1857264
click	mouse
in flash-cs3 again i could be spewing gibberish if you click on a movieclip with a child elements inside of it and you don t specifically turn off the mouse for the child elements the parent won t register the event

1857267
httpwebrequest	webclient
perhaps these are just the key helpers methods that are required mostly above beyond basic webclient httpwebrequest classes suport

1857333
fiddler	charles
i usually use a tool like fiddler charles httpwatch basic- which is free to resolve this though firebug is also equally good

1857339
np-complete	np-hard
np-complete problems are those problems that are both np-hard and in the complexity class np

1857339
np-complete	np-hard
therefore to show that any given problem is np-complete you need to show that the problem is both in np and that it is np-hard

1857342
any	set
np-complete is a complexity class which represents the set of all problems x in np for which it is possible to reduce any other np problem y to x in polynomials time

1857342
variables	boolean
where each x_vij is a boolean variables or the negation of a variables from a finite predefined list x_1 x_2 .

1857342
np-complete	np-hard
the precise definition here is that a problem x is np-hard if there is an np-complete problem y such that y is reducible to x in polynomials time

1857342
np-complete	np-hard
but since any np-complete problem can be reduced to any other np-complete problem in polynomials time all np-complete problems can be reduced to any np-hard problem in polynomials time

1857342
np-complete	np-hard
as another example any np-complete problem is np-hard

1857348
functional-programming	imperative
if you defined functional languages to refer only to pure functional languages the two aren t synonymous as you find closures in imperative languages that support functional-programming javascript and scheme which is technically imperative though the functional paradigms is what s mostly used

1857348
function-composition	anonymous-function
function-composition can rely on anonymous-function

1857352

i have a navigationcontroller with a list of options click one will do the usual push of the selected tableviewcontroller subclassing sliding the screens to the left display the usual back button and view title on the top

1857410
response	timeout
also the fact that the request scoping has a shorter lifespan from the moment that the client fires it until the client has received the last bit from the appropriate response than the session scoping which lives from the first time that the server accesses the client-associated session until the session get timeout or invalidated

1857416
execute	prepare
then you make a prepare statement bind the date variables and execute the statement to get your results

1857424

1857438
revision	svn
with at least two robust and efficient revision control systemd in existence today svn git there is very little room to justify working with a proprietary solution

1857443
annotations	mapping
the mapping from resultset to object is encapsulated in xml or annotations

1857451
contains	elements
however because the server has sent several messages the byte streaming will contains the xml for more than one elements and .when it is deserialized a multiple root exception-handling is throw

1857457

i m doing to preface this with the fact i m a relative java scala newbie .so i wouldn t rules out that there is .something obvious i m not doing

1861134
arrays	loops
then you can loops through the arrays summing lengths to figure out how many days into the year you need to start and add that into the calculation of startday before the modulo 7 and you can pass the numbers of days of the year by indexing into the arrays

1861150
websphere	ibm
ibm s websphere

1861166

1861299
textbox	button
i believe that what you really mean to do is to place the button along side the textbox

1861299
textbox	button
in other words you are not setting the textbox as the parent control of the button

1861323
profiling	debugging
the java debugging interface jdi has new methods in java 6.0 which allow tools written in java itself to do some limited memory profiling

1861340
constructor	private
it may al.so serve you well to add a private constructor to that class .so nothing else can initializer the singleton other than the static-initializer

1861354
attributes	properties
we have the proper data-members attributes on the timestamp properties for serialization

1861357
configuration	environment
the configuration file can be a bit confusing at first for more complicated environment but it soon becomes worthwhile

1861394
perl	php
i ve tested it wide on perl and php based project

1861404
constructor	private
there are no private constructor in as .so what you can do is

1861418
authentication	login
is there any way to receive mail authentication cookies without sending the login information to the client and performing form-submit operation from the client s browser

any	set
.when i try to make changes .so as to implements the above code for a set of value present in arrays l_names i don t get any result

1861433
type-conversion	primitive
although relying on automatic type-conversion makes life a little easier one should always have at the back of one s mind a good understanding of what types your primitive value and object actually are

1861451
contains	set
someone will probably crucify me for the ugliness of this solution but you can add rows and columns with height and width set to twice your padding value in between the actual rows and columns that contains data

1861457
python	java
also if not python or java then would you more generally pick a statically-typed language or a dynamic-type language

1861465
polynomials	exponent
i think you will see some strange convergences towards your destination color if you use a non-linear scale but nonetheless you can use a general formula and decide what polynomials or exponent gives you the best results

1861470
positioning	sidebar	background-image	background-color
the purpose of this background-image in my css based layout is that it provides the illusion that the sidebar background-color runs all the way down the page easy to do with tables but no .so much with css positioning

data-structures	tree
with that you can building several other data-structures lists tree etc.

1861489
value	field
unfortunately i can t convert the field to a true date field since it s a meta-table the same column contains value for different field that are just strings.

1861503
python	java
if not java python i would go for a functional language since taking side-effects into account is one of the complexities of writing concurrent software

remember that if the javascript is set to auto execute any code it will happen

1861526
python	java
i don t know about python but java along with the inbuilt locks and threads model has a mesasge passing framework called kilim

1861532
python	java
java has strong thread capabilities and it can be written using the python syntax with jython .so you got the best of the two worlds

1861532
python	java
python itself is not really good with concurrency and is slower than java anyway

1861542
scala	java	erlang	scala
by use java i actually mean scala which borrows a lot from erlang s concurrency construct but is probably more accessible to a java developer who has never used either before

also you will upgrade grails versioning more easily

1861583
logging	trace
.so usually i end up with logging trace and i debugg my full stack of exception-handling like that

1861588
value	field
the issue is that all of the variables field are connect to field that will sometimes be empty and thus i need a way to make them match any value that their respective field could take if they are empty

1861594
python	java
your single thread java program could be faster than the concurrent versioning of python on a multi-core computer.

scala	java
i d like to use java or scala f# or simply go to c++ mpi and openmpi

1861595
malloc	free
if you need to do this you should make a copy of the data into memory you allocate with new or malloc and then the caller must delete free that memory

1861616
default	reset
is there a way to reset all styles properties of paragraph using this class not limited to color to their css-defined default

1861618
ethernet	packets
i found out that i need to building a new sk_buff struct in the kernel-module and pass it to my network device but what i can t figure out is how to set the struct variables for a simple raw ethernet packets

1861628
nstextstorage	nstextview
but at a basic level all nstextview s have an nstextstorage object accessible via the textstorage methods nstextstorage happens to be a subclassing of nsmutableattributedstring

1861672
python	c++
use easy_install -b build_directory shoutpy .so it ll keep the .source code after it fails then checked the c++ compiler python tries to use against those supported by boost-python

1861672
ubuntu	linux
i tried compiling it on my desktop linux and it still works after i edit setup.py to link against libboost_python-mt instead of libboost_python which doesn t exist in ubuntu there are several depending on python versioning and .so forth

1861675
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it can be done checkout the .post here mixing webforms and asp.net-mvc

1861675
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
plugins hybrids asp.net webforms and asp.net-mvc and asp.net dynamic data side by side

1861688
linked-list	arrays
stack means filo can be implements by a linked-list but also with an arrays or vector

1861688
linked-list	queue	queue	fifo
queue means fifo can be implements by a double linked-list or maybe in other sensible ways

1861688
implements	abstract
priority-queue means highest lowest key first out this is an abstract concept that can be implements in many different ways

1861688
dictionary	arrays	dictionary	map	arrays	map
map associativity arrays dictionary means you map key to value

1861702
directory	folder
you can create an application folder on the webserver and call it something like new then install the asp.net-mvc project into the new directory

1861706
hash	md5
but i would add a price tag to this basket for each item and often it makes sense to add also the users sid md5 hash to this basket

1861718
ref	out
edit sizeparamindex is unfortunately not allowed on out and ref parameters

1861719
python	java
the java environment jvm + libs is better for concurrency than c python but java the language sucks

1861720
defined	declare
you can perfectly have several classes declare and defined in the same file

1861726
contains	any
you can deploy stand alone custom pages with 100 of your own code and it will run under sharepoint or you can create new application pages that also contains any code you want to write or you can simply add your own web-parts that can be added to any page you choose with 100 of your own code

1861734
versioning	upgrade
first the core python package as these don t change with backwards-incompatible issues unless you re upgrading a major versioning and you ll want whatever security fixed from a python upgrade to apply automatically to your virtualenv

1861751
value	field
yes readonly field can be accessed via reflection and their value changed

1861768
getter	setter
another example is properties in python - where your code can directly reference-class or instance-variables rather than always go through setter getter

1861771
value	field
you can use the second methods to save the http data just pass the kind of object it is expecting as its parameters .so instead of calling the second function with the f arguemtn provided by your cgi field value call it with f.read -- this will cause all data to be read from the f file like object and the corresponding data to be seen by the methods

1861785
protected	public
edit2 based on your comment below have two subclassing of foo one that simply provides public versioning of the protected methods and one that has overrides all of the important methods

1861786
protected	public
what i ve done .when i ve been in a situation like this and its not nice but it works is create a publicfoo in the same package as foo but in your source have it extends foo and overrides the protected methods and make it public

1861790
function-call	inline
then there is the inline optimization which consists of taking the function body and insert it instead of a function-call

1861790
inlining	inline
you should simply mark functions as inline .when 1 it is convenient for you and 2 you want to ensure that the compiler has the option of applying the inlining optimization

1861790
function-call	inline
you re merely arranging the code .so that it can if it chooses to do .so inline the function-call

1861868
authentication	login
since i don t want to store the user s passwd in a browser cookies don t want to send the passwd with every request and don t want to have to use http after the initial login i plan on using a token-based authentication systemd

1861868
.net	wcf
i know wcf supports using the .net s built-in security framework system.security to enforce access-control and i would like to take advantage of this

1861897
any	set
i want to set up an admin filtering that will allow the user to toggle between not expired and any

1861899
web-applications	enterprise
going to go a bit meta here this is how most enterprise web-applications work

1861914
any	set
which works because set.add bar will run bar.equalss against every elements already in the set and return false if any of them are equals

1861923
nano	vim
both vim and nano can do syntax-highlighting for bash

1861944
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
would there be any difference between using an autoresetevent and a manualresetevent

1861950
value	field
create one for each field you want to keep tracking of and .when you go back to save changes checked if the value in the field does not match the value in the corresponding hidden-field

1861961
click	mouse
mouse click on a calayer

1861961
click	mouse
apart from that is it the way to handle mouse click

1861973
hash-function	rabin-karp
i am familiar with the rabin-karp algorithm which uses a hash-function for its operation but this algorithm does not dictate a specific hash-function to use and the one the author suggested is o m where m is the length of the hash string

1861973
red-black-tree	tree
this may be an avl tree or red-black-tree that points to the location of the value elements in the key-value pair

1861980
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
both autoresetevent and manualresetevent derive from waithandle which is the prescribed use case here

1862006
rhino-mocks	ninject	rhino-mocks	nunit
i would like to have in my repository as tagged or submodules the different versioning of .net like is possible with other external product nunit ninject rhino-mocks

1862006
installation	building	rhino-mocks	ninject	rhino-mocks	nunit
i would like to checkout the project the versioning of .net it requiredd and other versioninged libs nunit ninject rhino-mocks etc from the repository make my change using notepad2 or someother non-visual studio editor as vs would required an installation as well as the framework install run the building scripting and commit push the changes

1862053
value	field
however i only want to set the field to the default-value if no value already exists

1862055
itemtemplate	databound
but what we will write for the databound expression in itemtemplate

1862068
multithreading	wait	wait	hang
if i cat the file into gdb it hang unless there is a 3 secondish wait between line could this be a multithreading problem or something

1862071
access-control	authentication
namely if you look at the properties of an .app under directory-structure - authentication and access-control - edit i need to unchecked enable anonymous access and checked integrated windows-authentication

1862079
checkbox	textarea	selected	checkbox
particularly with selected tags but also checkbox radio and textarea

1862093
children	nodes
it simply delete the first nodes whatever children it has

1862097
sql-server	mysql
edit 2 as elaborated some in the comments below for now i m assuming a mysql database although the fstream capabilities of sql-server 2008 could potentially change that

1862118
windows-server	windows
the only requirements are that the software runs on windows sql-server backend and windows-server

1862123
postgresql	mysql
originally we intended to use mysql but now project requirements have changed to use postgresql

1862132
any	set
you can set r to any value between 0 and 255 without effecting the other bits like this

1862132
any	set
by using bitwise ands and ors and occasionally more exotic operations you can easily set and clear any individual bit of a larger value

1862134
sql-server	oracle
as far as i know you can t use parameterized queries to perform ddl statements specify table named at least not in oracle or sql-server

1862146
bugzilla	mantis
see for example bugzilla and mantis which eric seppanen elaborates on more in his answer

1862148
callback	methods
i can t use the php code which uses the db callback methods

1862148
hide	show
i even worked with hide show but guess they wont work with

1862167
git-add	git-rm
git-add the new file git-rm the old file or git mv old new to take the simple approach

1862206
boolean	int
protected boolean keychar char c int status int time

1862208
hide	show
use hide and show as you yourself suggested

1862208
hide	show
in other words every time the #group selectbox is changed hide all options in #subgroup and show only the ones whose value attributes starts with groupval

1862248
version-control	git
btw i m coding ruby-on-rails using git version-control

1862264
boolean	int
only use null true for non-string field such as int boolean and dates

1862293
windows	wow64	32-bit	64bit
first you have to know that windows 64bit can run both 64bit and 32-bit in emulation mode wow64 .so you ll have to decide if you want to allow that or you are interested only in pure 64bit

1862293
32-bit	64bit
64bit and syswow64 for 32-bit

1862293
platform	anycpu
building it as anycpu platform

1862294
margins	padding
if you really wanted something clean you could make a padding attached properties that would handle the grid loaded event and then set the margins of all of the children

1862298
any	set
as dtb mentioned bitarray can handle bit field of any size but you can only get and set a single bit at a time--there is no support for sections as in bitvector32

1862303
push	pull
it would work for push and pull

1862305
constructor	private
their constructor added them to a private list of classes of that types in use and removed themselves from that list .when they were destroy and then deleted themselves this was not in a destructor

1862328
python	ruby	python	c++	python	java
i lookaround and just about every modern language has very firm roots in oop c++ java python ruby etc.

1862346
python	java
personally i would pick either c# or java as they force you to use object orientated programming rather than being able to fallback on a imperative styles which is a bonus over multi-paradigm languages like python

1862347
unix	bsd
i know for certain that it is available on bsd and possibly other unix s

1862358
lookup	any
this will make any lookup blazingly fast

1862382
ubuntu	debian
after getting that install and set up you can say fink install mysql-unified-dev to get essentially the same thing as asking for libmysqlclient15-dev on a debian or ubuntu types systemd

1862399
triggers	insert
if you really want to store it in the db i d look into using a triggers that fires on insert and sets your value there

1862408
associations	model
basically i use the public methods as a containers for a grouping of very specific query building or associations building private functions within the model

1862410
python	c++	python	java
till now i have an understanding of core java core python and basic c and c++

1862412
streamreader	streamwriter
however it seems like a better solution would simply be to hold onto the streamreader and streamwriter instances as long as you may need them

1862427
authentication	login
if the sites are ones that buy into using third party authentication then you want to be an openid provider stackoverflow is an openid consumer which is why you can login by using for instances your flickr photo page url

1862434
getter	setter
i reflector d the getter and setter for good measure

1862452
contains	any
the iso 8601 standards is yyyy-mm-dd which is unambiguous and does not contains any invalid url characters and works fine in datetime.parse tryparse

1862456
quicktime	qtkit
to step through the frame in a quicktime movie you can use the qtmovie class in qtkit to do this as follows

1862458
python	java
i am only aware of openid libs for java c# and python

1862478
contains	elements
.when the browser encounters a scripting elements it has to evalute the javascripting contains in that elements because the scripting might alter the content of the page via document.write or inspect the current state of the page

1862480
selected	button
regarding duplicates button after selected a tab multiple time

1862481
windows-xp	windows
i am using ni labwindows cvi 8.1 to compile and building a executable program which i need to run on either windows-xp and windows 2000 os

1862500
pygtk	gtk
gtk can be complex at time but with pygtk there s plenty of open-source example apps you can study from simple to complex

1862504
sorted	lookup
if the operations that take advantage of the specificities of tree are rare you mention taking advantage of the fact that rb tree are sorted and if on the other hand you often lookup a key that has recently been added or replace the value of a key that has recently been added a small-size caching implements with another structure may make sense

1862511
jmenuitem	jmenubar
is there a way to add a jmenuitem or similar button-type object to a jmenubar

1862511
jmenuitem	jmenubar
adding a jmenuitem doesn t play well with the layout of a jmenubar and button look too button-like

1862511
jmenuitem	jmenubar
should we be tweak the button to look like a jmenuitem or tweak the jmenubar to display the jmenuitem correctly

1862517
hashtable	sorted
store in a hashtable or sorted list

1862544
any	set
a while back i found a blog .post concerning this very issue and it was explained that you can set the z of any object in the scene to appear in 3d spaces the same size it would appear in 2d spaces by using the following

1862557
jmenuitem	jmenubar
you need to put the jmenuitem in a jmenu then you add the jmenu to the jmenubar

1862569
external	embed
the images are hosted outside the flex project and they re referenced by an external configuration file .so i can t embed them

1862578
postgresql	mysql
the above syntax works with mysql and postgresql for varous syntax used for this kins of request you can have a look there select-limit

1862584
radio-button	textbox
on my page i have a cascading ddl ddlbuyer a textbox search tbxprodac and a radio-button list radtopx

1862584
radio-button	selected	radio-button	textbox	selected	textbox
what i am trying to achieve is that the user can only selected either the ddl the textbox or the radio-button list as a methods for producing the gridview data

1862584
selected	button
if i selected the radtopx button click the button to produce the gridview this occurring on a postback

1862585
togglebutton	listview
as a simpler alternative you might consider just using a togglebutton and pop-up with a listview inside the pop-up

1862598
boolean	int
the sig for this methods is refreshnavigationimages boolean int

1862620
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

1862643
enterprise	platform
sharepoint is an enterprise collaboration platform

1862645
any	set
if 1 is yes is there any way to automatically set this in netbeans

1862647
subtract	time
it does not give the elapsed time but it should be easy enough to subtract the time .when necessary

1862647
tcsh	bash
if you can use tcsh instead of bash you can set the time variables

1862666
annotations	mapping
i ve observed the strange fact based on the questions in the hibernate tag that people are still actively using xml files instead of annotations to specify their orm hibernate jpa mapping

1862666
annotations	mapping
people don t know that annotations are a full-featured replacement of xml mapping

1862677
switching	screens
it show how you can seamlessly switching between a couple of different screens

1862687
configuration	environment
using xml to complement the annotations where environment or systemd specific configuration is needed

1862710
ruby	php
i m generator data to send from a ruby stack to a php stack

1862710
ruby	php
i m using the openssl cypher libs on the ruby side and the mcrypt libs in php

1862710
ruby	php
.when i encrypt using aes-256-cbc 256-bit block size in ruby i need to use mcrypt_rijndael_128 128bit block size in php to decrypt it

1862712
realloc	malloc
you can dynamically allocate an arrays of float of some initial size using malloc or realloc and then extends it periodically using realloc

1862727
arrays	loops
the arrays operation should be put at the end of loops .when we find a primes

1862728
blender	3ds	blender	maya	maya	3ds
also are people using any 3d model tools like maya 3ds max or blender with this 3d game engines

1862753
any	set
.so given a set of pointss for the old and new maps how do i find the and equation to automatically translation any points from the old map to the new one

1862791
put	get
i wrote a teeny tiny sinatra .app that runs fine locally but for some reason as soon as i put it online all i get is internal-server-error

1862822
any	set
in vs i have the building set to any cpu which should handle 64bit

1862839
enumerator	any
if multiple enumerator members have the same underlying value and you attempt to retrieve the string representation of an enumerator member s named based on its underlying value your code should not make any assumptions about which named the methods will return

1862842
value	field
in my implementation i am storing the recid in a treeview item s data value field

1862842
value	field
i am storing the recid in the tree value field

1862846
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox ie and google-chrome

1862847
version-control	git
what do you think of using for example git to handle version-control of upload files e.g

1862847
webserver	upload
a image is upload to a shared folder at the webserver

1862853
jmenuitem	jmenubar
the following code implements camickr s solution although i would have come up with the same thing after seeing the default way jmenuitem s are rendering in a jmenubar

1862867
priority-queue	heap
from what i ve gathered the algorithm with the best big-o running time for such problems is dijkstra with a fibonacci heap as the priority-queue although practically speaking a binary heap is easier to implements and works pretty well too

1862867
bellman-ford	dijkstra
edit otoh dijkstra s with an unsorted arrays for the priority-queue timed out. that bfs bellman-ford worked surprised me a little as i thought that the input size was quite large

1862875
solaris	aix	solaris	linux	linux	aix
websphere xd supports many operating systemd including aix hp-ux linux sun solaris windows and z os

1862876
hide	show	hide	next	show	next
i think i can do this by having the three images next to each other far enough apart that the one to the other side will not show and use javascript to hide the scroll button and then use javascript to scroll to the html anchor that specifies the location of the image

1862883
bellman-ford	dijkstra
the boost-graph libs appears to have implementation for both dijkstra and bellman-ford

1862889
put	get
i don t need to actually run a tfs server myself but i do need the ability to connect to my clients and get put files and the integration with team explorer in vs is really nice hence i d rather not have to use an external 3rd party tool

1862920
selected	textbox
the problem i am having is that .when the user makes a selection via the mouse vs places the selected text into the textbox and also simulates the enter key being pressed on the textbox

1862929
complex-numbers	nan
lack of support for important features missing value for nan infinities no complex-numbers or special functions lack or buggy implementation of rounding modes round half-even not implements in gmp lack of handler for important events loss of significant digits overflow underflow...ok this isn t even implements in most standards libs

1862929
32-bit	64bit
if you use floats 32-bit instead of double 64bit you have much less bits to compute and to transfer

1862934
required	checked
lock checked and acquiring will still be done though .so running a non smp viewmodel instead shall yield even better performance but required a rebuilding of the viewmodel from .source

1862934
processor	affinity
option one means that you run four instances of the erlang viewmodel each with a single scheduling affinity set to different processor cores

1862934
processor	affinity
option two means running a single erlang viewmodel with four schedulings each scheduling s affinity set to different processor cores

1862946
ruby	php
i don t know php but reading through related questions on the sidebar i see converting ruby aes256 decrypt function to php

1862946
ruby	php
you ll notice that the key size that you ve passed between ruby and php is 256 bits in both cases

1862947
observers	listener
finally if your observers work fine but you just want to notify them all sooner you can take a look at this related question invoke a code after all mouse event listener are execute

1862953
attributes	properties
but if a methods would instead return .when called by ods.select an empty string collections string then iâ d get exception-handling â œ the datasource for gridview did not have any properties or attributes from which to generator columns â

1862966
defined	declare
you defined inside_dll only in your dll and export all the classes declare with state_api macros

1862970
oracle	mysql
different datastores have different conventions etc and using xml is the only sane place in that situation being able to have one for mysql and one for derby and one for oracle or whatever

1862983
credentials	security
1 using transport security with windows auth i do not need to worry about again encrypting the passed credentials to ensure the validity.

1862983
credentials	account
2 how does this implementation prevent a malicious service running under some windows account within the domain to send a messages tagged with spoofed credentials

1863002
directory	folder
here s the part that is really frustrating me the fxcop documentation here says that it will load up all referenced assemblies from either the same folder that the analyzed assembly is in or from a folder referenced by the directory command-line option

1863002
directory	folder
the file does exist in the same folder as the one being analyzed and i have tried passing the folder in as a directory command-line option

1863013
g++	gcc
this can make a difference especially if you are combining compilation with the link phase as it can lead to different libs being linked g++ vs gcc and .so you can control the outcome in your makefile

1863014
credentials	security
1 with windows-authentication over transport security the transport layer will be encrypted and safe - no need to worry about additional encryption of credentials etc

1863014
credentials	account
if a malicious service manages to hijack some valid windows credentials and poses as john doe who has an account on your corporate network there s no way the wcf service can distinguish this from a valid request by john doe

1863023
associations	model
the associations is on the entity which could model the table but doesn t have to

1863049
arrays	loops
i plan on including an arrays with the 8bit samples that the program will loops through .when a function is called

1863050
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
the test case below works fine in firefox opera and google-chrome i get the expected list of nodess and depths but fails in ie8 all the nodess are at the same depth and end tags are include in the nodes list

1863056
static-typing	let
as a developer that s used to static-typing i usually let the compiler tell me if the code is correct logic flaws excluded of course

1863057
put	get
i always get does not contains rows as a result but looking at the visual-studio debugger show that the collections i m passing in containss the two value i put in there

1863095
restart	reload
aside from restart reload apache there s a few other things to checked

1863095
apache	vhosts
secondly make sure the vhosts declarations are being loaded by apache

1863097
value	field
the function is implements by str_format in strlib.c which itself interpreter the format string but defers to the c libs s implementation of printf to actually format each field after determining what types of value is expected string or numbers essentially to correspond to each field

1863102
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
looks like ie doesn t treat your xml nodes as dom nodes whereas firefox google-chrome and opera do

1863107
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc does not pass object around webforms styles

1863108
concatenation	comma
your value are concatenation together with comma like this

1863126
selected	textbox
in classic asp multiple form value with the same named are joined into a comma-separated string in the request.form request.querystring collections - .so if there s a hidden-field or textbox with named foo as well as your selected named foo you ll get the second empty value joined to the first separated by a comma

1863136
strtok	strlen
strtok can return null if it doesn t find the separator it s looking for and you can t call strlen with null

1863143
contains	elements
otherwise you ll end up with some elements that aren t in that namespace which is why the result contains xmlns unsetting the namespace for those elements

1863148
union-all	union
you tried to execute a selected statement probably a union or a union-all and all of the queries did not contains matching data types in the result columns

1863151
mta	sta
we hosed ourselves at first because one part of the systemd ran mta instead of sta - see this question for more information.

1863156
assign	add
extra details for visual-studio integration follow these step to add vim as an external tool and assign a convenient keyboard shortcut

1863165
subtract	addition	subtract	add	subtraction	addition
the two s-complement systemd has the advantage of not requiring that the addition and subtraction circuitry examine the sign of the operands to determine whether to add or subtract

1863167
temporary	copy
strtok writes to the arrays you pass it .so make sure you copy that to a temporary arrays before calling strtok on it or just allocate the original one like

1863175
dictionary	arrays
since you are creating a copy of the arrays all of the object in the arrays al.so get their retain count increased .so if the arrays becomes unreachable by overwriting it in the dictionary all the strings that the arrays contains will not be release properly and neither will the arrays

1863183
traffic	packets
if you are really certain that you need to know the packets level details of your tcp connection then in addition to creating the tcp socket for sending you need your application to use the winpcap api to look at the raw traffic as well

1863195
malloc	strdup
to do both the malloc and strcpy in one call it would be better to use strdup as it also remembers to allocate room for the terminating nul which you left out of your code as written

1863195
printf	strtok
the actual segfault you are getting is likely to be inside strtok not printf because your sample as written is attempting to pass a string constants to strtok which must be able to modify the string

1863204
contains	any
i need some way to find words that contains any combinations of characters and digits but exactly 4 digits only and at least one character

1863212
selected	listbox
just basically how do i list my listbox in strings no matter what the order selected is to represent whatever was selected in that order and the sql cmd to match based on textfile and export it.

1863228
macros	let
the 1st approach that comes to mind is to let the macros create an arrays of messages id handler function pairs

1863228
arrays	loops
your wndproc would loops through that arrays to identify the given wm and execute the corresponding handler

1863246
put	get
he may have to put days into rewriting the query and only get 500

1863279
contains	any
a program that does not contains any

1863293
stax	sax
i don t think xpath works with sax but you might take a look at stax which is an extended streaming xml api for java

1863306
organization	naming
while you may end up with more files they shouldn t be hard to keep tracking of if you have a good organization and naming systemd keeping model views and controllers in 3 separate folder or have some kind of naming conventions that tells you what is what

1863309
buffering	streaming
streaming or progressive i want to be able to detection .when the video is being buffering .so i can display .some .sort of animation letting the user know to wait just a little longer

1863323
signals	sigpipe
the process probably hang in ignoring signals like sigpipe checked with what is happening here

1863325
version-control	git
i suggest you look what applications you would like your version-control to integrated with and see if they support hg or git

1863332
subtraction	addition	subtraction	complement	complement	addition
two s complement is very nice for doing subtraction just like addition

1863341

i m looking for a web solution that will provide a webpage application that will let a user downloading our install exe all required files are contains in the exe such that they can pause the downloading and resume it at any time

1863372
any	set
since the phone-number definitions are set in stone no new phone-number typess no multiple home_phone entries etc. is there any reason i would want to split the phone-numbers into a separate relation tracked by contact_info_id phone_number types

1863373
clearinterval	setinterval
i know you can use clearinterval if you have the id returned by setinterval but there isn t one i can get outside of modifying the source code and i don t want to do that

1863378
environment	building
can eclipse be used to building appropriate targets which can then reference the common stuff .when running in a live environment

1863380
libcurl	curlpp
.so here is the question and i know it is extremely noobish how do i write c++ code that will use libcurl and curlpp and will work on the 3 major oses

1863380
libcurl	curlpp
the main thing i don t understand is if i have to compile libcurl and curlpp then how does it work .when trying to take it over to the other platform

1863388
versioning	upgrade
do not upgrade to this versioning without carefully reading the documentation and reviewing the new examples

1863396
interpolation	derivative
the main performance hurdle are function evaluation which increase with more points getting the derivative or more complex interpolation functions

1863411
buildpath	libs
you just need to add the common project to the buildpath of the webapp project and to add them as web libs dependency

1863417
dictionary	arrays
in your shoes i d be tempted to read the dictionary from a text file on server startup store the strings into a non-mutable arrays and hand-code an ultra-fast binary-search rather than suffer through the overhead of database call to an indexed table

1863418
stax	sax
there are sax stax based xpath implementation but they only support a small subset of xpath expression axis largely due to sax stax s forwarding only nature

1863419
callback	methods
if you need to only run this once just put the whole if-statement minus the else in your callback from the methods

1863422
selected	button
press filtering revision of selected line button looks like a funnel

1863434
value	field
the call to contains performs equality checked which attempt to dereference a value that has a null field

1863450
http-redirect	request
currently my request specifies the http-redirect binding

1863477
bison	yacc
i m assuming here that you have some additional rules such as commaloop expr otherwise your grammar doesn t actually match anything and bison yacc will complain about unused non-terminals

1863484
subclassing	superclass
as for finding this in the java language specifications i first missed it as well as it is not as one might expect specified where overridess or the subsignature relation is discussed but in members and constructor of parameterized types â 4.5.2 which reveals that formal type-parameters of the superclass are syntactically replace by the actual type-parameter in the subclassing prior to checked for overrides equivalence

1863500
selected	button
or if your tags are missing in the questions that because you need to tell stackoverflow to format it as code by selected it and pressing the code button or ctrl + k

1863501
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu for example it is part of the default python install

1863503
pixels	line
repeat step 4 untill the image doesn t change after a repeat all white pixels are line ends or connectors

1863510
object-reference	instances
now instead of passing the actual gamestate object-reference to the action methods you pass it wrapped by an instances of your proxy class

1863512
instances	private
one thing that comes to mind would be a private inner class implements the interface or a factory returning a private inner class instances

1863518
implements	extends
implements x509keymanager or extends x509extendsedkeymanager if you re working with sslengine

1863527
value	field
as part of this stored procedure i also want to try to feed in matched pairs of value which reference a field to lookup and a field to match it to these could either be present or

1863527
nested	order
i ve hugely simplified the code in the above example for clarity since it s the general concept of a nested if-statement with selected and order by that i m inquiring about

1863533
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1863533
object-reference	instances
nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

1863541
anchor	iframe
i am trying to automatically scroll to a anchor .when opening a fancybox iframe like .so www.example.com posts#header

1863560
securitymanager	classloader
might take a bit of googling--and i m fairly sure you ll find it s all done in a special classloader or securitymanager

1863560
protected	public
this grant code permission to query a class for its public protected default package access and private field and or methods

1863576
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
disclaimer the use of dynamic-sql is not something that should be taken lightly and proper consideration should be taken in all circumstances to ensure that you are not open to sql-injection attacks however for some dynamic search types operations it is one of the most elegant route

1863588
xquery	xslt
the optimization is enabled only if explicit requested either by using the saxon streaming extension function or the saxon read-once attributes on anxsltt xslt copy-of instruction or the xquery pragma saxon streaming

1863590
contains	any
note as i mentioned this route will not work if any of the coalesce columns contains null value

1863613
show	next
.when you list the symbols table of a static libs like nm mylib.a what does the 8 digits hex that show up next to each symbols mean

1863615
silverlight	wpf
treeview is built into wpf and is available in silverlight as part of the sdk

1863622
decimal-point	zero
trailing zero are removed but unfortunately .so is the trailing decimal-point if the fractions part is zero

1863623
decrement	increment
you could implements the wrap-around behavior directly into a new iterator-class - templates to be a wrapper for .some actual iterator that supplies a more elegant interface to the caller .so that its increment and decrement operators do the wrap-around automatically

1863631
decimal-point	zero
this types differs slightly from fixed-point notation in that insignificant zero to the right of the decimal-point are not include

1863632
postback	ajax
.so that leaves async postback or traditional ajax

1863633
annotations	mapping
i ve switched to annotations but .sometimes i miss the xml mapping mainly because the documentation was .so much more comprehensive with examples of many scenarios

1863633
annotations	mapping
with annotations i stick to pretty basic mapping which is great if you control the data and object-model but i ve done some very complex things in the xml that i don t know if i could replicate in the annotations

1863639
selected	button
if not come back and edit the stack-trace in your question don t forget to selected it and press the code button 0101011010 or press the ctrl + k

1863684
arrays	loops
loops through byte arrays

1863717
value	field
we have been having concurrency issues on updatess to tables in which we updates the value of a date field

1863724
python	ruby
the python implementation takes seconds while the ruby implementation takes around 4 minutes

1863724
python	ruby
environment is windows-xp x64 python 2.6 ruby 1.8.6

1863738
python	ruby
it could be because dictionary in python are much faster than hash in ruby

1863753
keyboard	mouse
is there a generics input windows messages that gets sent before it is interpreter as being mouse or keyboard or other device

1863753
keyboard	mouse
the behavior i want is similar to windows waking up from screensaver sleep on keyboard or mouse input

1863762
background-image	height
basically the idea building on not trying to force the divs to be of equals height but have a wrapper of the three divs with a background-image that simulates the background of the columns

1863782
windows-vista	windows
my findings revealed that this could be done under windows-vista windows 7 and mac os x although i m unsure about the latter

1863782
gnome	kde
however under windowss-xp linux with gnome and linux with kde the screenshot contains a white area where the overlapping windows obstructs the view

1863799
xts	zoo
you have several good options time-series its fts xts but the most popular of these is the zoo package

1863818
unsigned	short
note that getting the field id for a simpler variables like an unsigned short with signature s works just fine

1863828
web-config	app-config
use the app-config or web-config file to add a entry

1863837
contains	lookup
the database contains about 20 tables contains a few thousand recording in 4 primary tables and a few hundred recording in various lookup and related tables

1863848
attributes	properties
one properties with attributes and getter-setter and one field with the same named starting with an _ character

1863848
attributes	properties
it s the attributes on the properties in the designer file that causes the runtime exception-handling

1863850
decimal-point	digits
numbers always contains a decimal-point character even if no digits follow

1863858
selected	textbox
i have wired up an event .so that user-controls b is notified of the newly selected value however setting say a textbox value in user-controls b server-side isn t rendering i m presuming because the grid selection is happening over ajax and therefore user-controls b never rendering

1863870
twitter	tweets
say i have a third party twitter widget on a page which keeps updating whenever there is a new tweets

1863890
double	int
just change its types from int to double and you should be good

1863895
pointers	stack
a stack has two properties a value and a pointers to the next stack nodes

1863895
haskell	ocaml
use haskell ocaml or f# instead

1863895
data-structures	tree
its also pretty easy to write immutable versioning of red-black tree avl tree tree-based heap and many other data-structures

1863898
required	checked
upon a new request the middleware can checked a database timestamp see if the required amount of time has passed and either perform the request or return an error to the client

1863912
parentheses	operators
now you have two different operators and you have enough to represent precedence of operations and parentheses actually play a part

1863917
postback	ajax
this will triggers another ajax postback that should refresh your control

1863924
ubuntu	linux
for this example i am running ubuntu linux 64bit

1863931
setinterval	settimeout
edit knowing nothing about the widget i would probably set an interval to make request from client to server either by using javascript setinterval or settimeout .

1863950
any	set
instructions set out in any robots.txt

1863965
linq-to-nhibernate	predicatebuilder
you can use the predicatebuilder and linq-to-nhibernate to generator dynamic query s like this

1863968
linked-list	skip-lists
well you already identified the one i would typically suggest - the concurrent skip-lists but the absence of other specific requirements other than the three above i think a simple linked-list with per-node mutexes will work

1863968
contains	elements
each nodes contains one elements or a reference and one simple mutex

1863968
linked-list	nodes
in the linked-list this is the predeces.sor nodes - in an avl or rb-tree it is not .so simple

1863992
any	set
in any case i recommend doing all of your data-partitioning and writing entire output sets to s3 in a final reduce task one set per s3 file

1864019
safari	opera
trying switching over to a clean ie safari opera and see if you re seeing the same problem

1864041
google-chrome	firefox
at the moment i m getting varying results between ie firefox and google-chrome

1864041
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it looks fine an in google-chrome there are separators in the header

1864045
environment	execution
that is an is_utf8 variant will exist in the execution environment dependent only on if it can work in that environment

1864062
constructor	object
you probably want to call initkeywords from the constructor of this object

1864088
authentication	login
also you should probably be aware that the forms timeout is different to the session-timeout - the former sets how long the login cookies stays around for if the user checked the remember-me box .when logging in while the later determines how long the user can remain idle before the server treats them as a new user regardless of authentication status and is configure using

1864094
internet-explorer	firefox
it is working fine in internet-explorer but in firefox it is giving error like the elements my1div is not defined

1864111
lightbox	jquery
from the brief description you give i would suggest a jquery lightbox plugins - but of course you might have a reason not to use that option

1864116
attributes	properties
adding the border-color attributes programmatically does not use an inline styles but uses the html border-color properties which browsers apply to all borders inside the table

1864117
decrement	increment
in the posted code the call to increment and decrement are the right way to do it

1864119
put	get	inlining	inline
unfortunately for inlining you will usually no longer really get inline if it gets put into the cpp file unless it s very very simple or you use a compiler directive

1864145
firefox	safari
running this on a mac with safari firefox

1864150
sql-server	sqlcommand
you can simply submit the t-sql string to sql-server using the sqlcommand object

1864156
buffering	streaming
this is mainly due to the fact that you re working with file streaming buffering not just text on a screens

1864158
any	set
i am not sure if there are any other ways but this seems better then a set of gui forms for each one

1864160
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox ie and safari but for some odd reason i can t get it to work in google-chrome

1864160
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i attempted to switching to the .ajax function during my debugging process and found out that firefox ie and safari always return a success alert whereas google-chrome is returning an error with status 0 and a blank response

1864164
python	perl
for mysql types tasks i use perl or python

1864178
any	set
i m using firefox caching size set to 250mb and i don t let it remove any private or caching data

1864209
shell	bash
it is quite promising and can be used to hack a quick test from a bash shell

1864215
order	join
if all 3 of these tables had the same schema or they have a few field in common and you just selected those in a corresponding order you could take the union of these 3 queries if you wanted to join the results together

1864215
union-all	union
there s a nice explanation of the semantics of union and union-all in mysql on tutorialspoint

1864299
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
i m also interested in whether this can be done in perl python or ruby

1864301
directory	folder
after that i also deleted all .cvs folder inside the directory i wanted to get rid of

1864319
constructor	private	constructor	object
or make a class constructor accept the db variables and set a private variables of the foo object

1864329
dictionary	arrays
sometimes you will notice these change if you have huge arrays dictionary etc

1864370
configuration	installation
my application only has a licence screens then installation directory screens and i use this configuration block to-do it

1864380
controllers	routes
and what s really bumming me out is what happens after i revert my changes to the global-asax routes removing that file-extension after the controllers

1864384
hide	show
ideally what i would like is the ability to have the datagrid floating outside the main windows without affecting the other controls and just having a button to hide and show it .when needed

1864393
pylons	django
all other url router i ve found assume i m using django or pylons or paste or pull in lots of other dependencies or just don t let me create a simple mapping of url patterns to wsgi apps

1864405
lazy-evaluation	maybe
if the order list changes every sort you may be able to gain some speed with some clever lazy-evaluation search but maybe not

1864413
scp	ssh
linux use an scp or scripting via ssh client putty then catalina_home bin shutdown.sh

1864414
hide	show
you could put it in a pop-up and change its isopen state to hide or show it

1864466
linux	bsd	linux	unix	unix	bsd
mono can be run on linux bsd unix

1864500
telnet	tftp
for example xinetd may serve service like rlogin rsh tftp telnet etc

1864503

it s a good idea .when pulling raw-data into a struct to set the struct to have zero padding even if it s entirely composed of 32-bit unsigned int

1864513
microsoft.build	msbuild
msbuild the microsoft.build systemd

1864542
value	field
i have a field named createddate in table.it contains value as

1864563
duplicates	sorted
a different approach one that won t work if the list to be sorted can have duplicates that need to be preserve

1864565
firefox	opera	margins	padding
i ve got a simple floated horizontal list that is looking good in ie and opera but firefox has extra padding or margins at the top that i don t know how to fix

1864567
datagrid	listbox
i feel a little limited to listbox datagrid and such

1864586
buffering	streaming
flushing a streaming takes any buffering data which hasn t been written yet and writes it out right away

1864586
buffering	streaming
some streaming use buffering internally to avoid making a ton of small updates to relatively expensive resources like a disk file or a network pipe

1864589
python	php	python	c++
c++ c# using mono python php perl.

1864593
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
i haven t set any height for the contains div assuming that it will expand to accomodate any future longer lists

1864605
ruby-on-rails	django
personally i like turbogears2 but i think django would make a good starting points for a ruby-on-rails developer that wanted to try out something else

1864615
defined	declare
.so how to declare a static variables but not defined it

1864658
sql-server	ms-access

this question is a continuation of my last one regarding how to make ruby aes-256-cbc and php mcrypt_rijndael_128 play well together

1864700
ruby	php
the php generator cryptogram appears to have all the information that was provided but i cannot get the ruby code to decrypt it without error

1864702
perl	awk
that s what awk s getline does like backticks or cmd in shell perl

1864704
defined	declare
if you want to declare the variables in one place say a header file and defined it in a source file then you should use an extern declaration which tells the compiler to not worry about where the variables is

1864704
defined	declare
if you just want to declare the variables in one place and defined it in another don t use the static keyword

1864707
difference	count
last remark both time need to be in the same timezone or you are going to count the timezone difference also

1864708
grouping	sorting
for example it knows how to handle dates including sorting grouping and editing

1864726
versioning	upgrade
without knowing the exact situation versioning numbers upgrade done etc. it s hard to diagnose

1864734
ubuntu	debian
how can i know this is ubuntu debian fedora or redhat

1864748
debian-based	rpm
if all else fails checked to see what kind of package manager is in use apt rpm others checked to see if etc init.d is a symlink rpm rh distros or a directory debian-based distros

1864753
ubuntu	debian
note the ubuntu doesn t modify etc debian_version .when they pull changes from debian .so my ubuntu karmic systemd has squeeze sid in debian_version.

any	set
yes since a set conforms to nscopying and implements isequal with one catch do not use a mutable set or any other mutable object as a key

1864767
python	ruby	python	java
languages like python and ruby have this advantage over java as well thus the popularity of jruby jython

1864770
selected	button
this tells flex builder that this properties should appear in the general tab it is common in my facebook of the flex builder s properties inspector open an mxml file go to the windows menu and selected flex properties to open the properties inspector - towards the upper side of inspector tab near its title you will find button to switching to standards view category view and alphabetical view

1864781
alignment	spacing
i am using blue printing css and it works fine in firefox...but .when i look at it in ie even with the for ie lt ie8 it still doesn t seem to be working right in terms of spacing and alignment

1864784
order	add
after you have these simple cases working it will be easy to find the elements in an order list that is the first one larger than the elements to be insert and add the elements in front of the larger one

1864809
project-management	project
what other documentation do you have already which may or may not be categorized as release documentation for example do you already have software development project-management documentation how to building bug database list of requirements project backlog

1864816
stress-testing	jmeter
jmeter for stress-testing

1864830
order	add
if you implements the add methods to insert the elements in sorted order or anywhere but the end of the list you are violating the contract of the list interface

1864830
duplicates	elements
of course a set will not permit duplicates elements

1864834
perl	ruby
language support for collections clojure and ruby perl python... has already

1864834
rational-numbers	bigint
as are its auto-promotion of int to long to bigint native handling of rational-numbers and .so on

1864834
groovy	scala
the popularity of scala and groovy and jruby and jython and endless other jvm-languages-that-aren t-java should be seen as a good indication that while the jvm is good java-the-language is unpleasant for many people

1864851
swing	awt
i d say stay as far away as you can from swing awt etc

1864867
spaces	output
top 100 will limit the results to the first 100 rows enough to get an idea if there s really a spaces in the output

1864972
hide	show
i want to hide templates and want to show all files under templates on home

1864981
buffering	capture
you should really use toarrays to capture the buffering not getbuffering which is cheaper but returns the oversized arrays and should only be used in conjunction with length

deployment	install
although you need to install it sql-server-express supports xcopy file deployment where all you need to do to deploy the application is ship an .mdf file and your executable

1865146
shell	bash
if you are not using bash you can also use backticks which should work with most shell

1865176
hide	show
this particular column i have to hide should not show to the user

1865198
sql-server	mysql
if i were doing this i would export the data from sql-server to a file then import that file into mysql

1865472
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in a words the statement that we ported our webforms controls to asp.net-mvc is untrue

1865472
asp.net-mvc	webforms
indeed rad-controls for asp.net-ajax our webforms product do support asp.net-mvc applications

1865520
constructor	object
however now i want to execute code .when a task object is construct but if i had a constructor

1865521
if-statement	for-loop
the else statement attached to the for-loop as opposed to an if-statement will only execute if the for-loop iterated through each line without ever hitting the break conditional

1865524

constructor	object
.so i must argue that c++ in .some cases does not call any constructor for a class even if an object for that class is created

1865804
perforce	git
and rather than assuming that git is the problem try looking at the import from perforce

1865812
derived-class	base-class
objective-c how would i call a base-class function using a derived pointers where foo is overrides in the derived-class

1865831
constructor	object
in c++ .when an object is initializer a constructor of that class must be called

1865841
constructor	object
only .when you overload new-operator function then constructor is not called it used to avoid constructor calling else its in standards that constructor is invoked .when object is created

1865857
fadeout	fadein
another option is to use fadein and fadeout the animation is till ugly but at least it ends up nicely

1865859

the three20 guys had removed what they thought was all uses of private apis first-responder on windows and some private instances members of uitouch

1865901
constructor	object
.so i must argue that c++ in .some cases does not call any constructor for a class even if an object for that class is created

1865901
constructor	object
yes with pod types you can initializer object and no constructor will be called

1865905
administration	account
i have the following code i ve typed into the account controllers in my asp.net-mvc project and i am in both the administration and manager roles

hide	show
i created example code to do show and hide forms as you explained

1865956
copy-constructor	constructor
it is not posible to create instancesv of a without using the a int constructor except by copying which in this instances will use the synthesised copy-constructor

1865957
constructor	object
as far as i remember meyers in his effective c++ says that the object is only created .when the control flow has reached his constructor s end

1865957
constructor	object
you won t hit any constructor here but you may think that you are operating a newly created object and have a great time debugging it

1865988
constructor	object
if your class defined at least one constructor then the language will not allow you to construct an object of that types without calling a constructor

1866031
uniform	points
updates alok s answer and dan dyer s comment points out that using an exponential-distribution for the delta would give a uniform distribution of int

1866033
configuration	environment
we would like to keep the dll not registered .so that we have less configuration needed on other development machines and on the development environment

1866133
perl	php
php s syntax is influenced by perl and

1866133
perl	php
perhaps in perl and php s early non-object-oriented days it seemed like as good a choice as any

1866134
google-chrome	safari
i m really trying to find out whether there is some kind of conflict between the validation plugins and webkit browsers safari google-chrome or between jquery and webkit browsers before i embark on a bug-hunting mission although i ve already wasted several hours and got nowhere

1866134
google-chrome	safari
this all works fine in all the browsers except the webkit browsers safari google-chrome

1866137
perl	php
the use of the dot as string concatenation operators in php probably dates back to perl

1866137
perl	php
remember that php once was nothing more than a bunch of perl scripting

1866141
contains	any	base-class	inherited
i guess that this problem will occur with any generic-list contains object that inherited from the same base-class

1866146

1866154
spaces	output
notice how the spaces plays a part in the output

1866168
double	int
and in your example an int is not a double .so the cast will fail

1866176
double-quotes	single-quotes
use single-quotes rather than double-quotes

1866180
constructor	object
the ttripple object is perhaps created but its constructor is not used

1866184
selected	button
it seems however that .when ie8 loads such a blocked html file its security settings adjust somehow and - well i can only guess at the details but as soon as i right-click the html file selected properties and click the unlock button the problem went away

1866194
perl	php
the most obvious reason would probably be that php inherited a lot of its syntax from perl - and perl uses a dot

1866212
progress-bar	progress
i want to create a determinent progress-bar which progress of the file upload using javascript

1866252
google-chrome	firefox
files generator by other browsers firefox google-chrome are behaving perfectly

1866263
attributes	properties
i am accessing to properties of textbox with .text attributes

1866265
constructor	object
no parameterless constructor defined for this object

1866265
constructor	object
exception-handling details system.missingmethodexception-handling no parameterless constructor defined for this object

1866266
contains	elements
only s that have a numelements attributes are allowed to contains s and the numbers of those elements is restrict to the value of that attributes

1866278
hide	show
in addition to the other answers if you can t toggle but need to show hide explicit

1866282
hide	show
toggle display each of the set of matched elements based upon the switching true show all elements false hide all elements

1866285
callback	methods
i m trying to implements a hyperlinkdetector for an eclipse plugins and the callback methods is giving me an itextviewer to work with

1866302
toggleclass	addclass
that being exchanging toggleclass for addclass

1866318
double	int
for your average calculation you may try casting the int value to double like double total double size even though casting just one value should be enough

1866330
rollback	commit
also we did the commit inside the try block and the rollback in the exception-handling handler

1866343
contains	elements
i want to remove an elements from list such that the elements contains x or n

1866345
xsd	xml
yes xsd doesn t supports 1 3 scenarios you proposes for that xml grammar

1866345
xsd	xml
but if it s somebody else who create that xml file that xsd could be very handy cause it can be validation external before arrives into your systemd

1866385
eof	eol
there s yet another bug the eof is represented with the same symbols as line feed thus make it non-obvious to determine whether the file ends-with eol

1866390
exception-handling	try-catch
if you don t like the idea of checkeded the conditional on each line or there is no other way to checked it other than catching an exception-handling then i suggest making a help function with the try-catch in that

1866391
order	add
it s true that compilers can add extra code since high order languages have mechanisms like virtual methods and exception-handling in c++

1866400
constructor	object
.so essentially you create an instances of this object and pass it a reference-type in whichever manner constructor etc. and then on destructor of the object the original reference has changed to a reference created by the object

1866403
noclassdeffounderror	classpath	classnotfoundexception	noclassdeffounderror	classnotfoundexception	classpath
a noclassdeffounderror basically means that the mentioned class is missing in the runtime classpath while it was available in the classpath during compile-time of the api in question that is the difference with classnotfoundexception

1866420
any	set
this basically means that we can use the same types of syntax to query any set of data - whether it be a sql database active-directory or xml file - we can use the same syntax to execute queries

1866426
apache	vhosts
in terms of domains if you went with the invidual .app one per website .approach you can use apache s dynamic virtual hosts feature which effectively maps a url to the filesystems .so website.mydomain.com could be translation to automatically be severed from home vhosts com mydomain website thus deploying a new website would be a matter of simply copying the files into the correct directory creating the database and updating a configuration file all of which could be automated with ease

1866437
directory	folder
the application fails to load my plugins dll because my dll depends on a private assembly which is never found it is not located in the application directory nor in the winsxs folder but in my plugins directory whose location is not controlled by the application

1866441
defined	declare
you can declare them in the header with the protocols but outside the protocols interface itself then defined them in an implementation file for the protocols obviously it wouldn t have an implementation section - just your nsstring definitions

1866485
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari
it s distribute as a straight-forward and self-contained zip works out of the box with safari and firefox you may want to combine it with svgweb that brings svg support to internet-explorer

1866501
constructor	object
.when you re constructing an object from a class reference the compiler doesn t know what the final class types is yet .so it can t assign the right constructor in code

1866509
uniform	points
alok s answer and dan dyer s comment points out that using an exponential-distribution for the delta would give a uniform distribution of int

1866528
specifications	w3c
just a thought afaik the behavior .when setting src to a different value isn t really specified in the w3c html dom specifications or is it link anyone

1866531
32-bit	64bit
we had the same problem .when trying to remote debugging a website that is running as 32-bit inside 64bit iis

1866538
csv	xml
the same goes for other data sources csv and xml files

1866544
profiling	trace
all sql profiling does is execute stored-procedure on your sql-server these procedure start configure and stop trace

1866544
profiling	trace
to start and stop trace automatically you can use sql profiling to create a scripting

1866552
textbox	button	selected	button	selected	textbox
for example a date parameter would have a textbox where you can types in a date range and a button that opens a datepicker where you can selected a date range

1866557
expression-blend	silverlight
silverlight has got expression-blend as well for kind of wysiwyg

1866574
scriptaculous	jquery
it look like that you re at least under the hood mixing jquery with prototype or scriptaculous and that the whole thing is colliding with each other

1866600
silverlight	wpf
wpf and silverlight both offer the ability to derive a styles from another styles through the â œbasedonâ properties

1866600
silverlight	wpf
this feature has been around in wpf for a long time and itâ s new in silverlight 3

1866600
silverlight	wpf
neither wpf nor silverlight provide a solution for this problem out of the box

1866600
silverlight	wpf
wpf and silverlight use markup extensions to provide properties with value that required some logic to obtain

1866600
silverlight	wpf
this feature is not yet present in silverlight .so the .solution in this blog is only applicable to wpf

1866611
keyboard	mouse
then you just need a massive power supply a separate keyboard and mouse and a big monitor p

1866612
rollback	commit
i want all the cmd to be distribute over threads but in a single transactional .so if all the threads succeed i ll commit else rollback

1866647
export	csv
.when storing data in the database more often than not you will want to store it in it s raw format un-encoded as you might not always want to display the data in html you might want to export it to csv

1866661
any	set
.when i set email as class of any textfield and i give it a wrong formated email-address it show the following error like this

1866671
radio-button	button
what i need is to read some combo-boxes and a radio-button from the form in the function that s in the module and is called by the macros at the button s push

1866700
linux	bsd
it is currently tested against linux and mac os x windows with limited functionality and bsd portings are on the way

1866706
contains	any
if you make it an extension of - where t is restrict to be derived from your entity base-class - you should be able to use the extension methods on any collections like class contains entity based object

1866709
silverlight	wpf	datagrid	listbox	datagrid	textbox	listbox	textbox
using silverlight wpf databinding engine you can building any fancy layout using datagrid listbox containers and regular controls like textbox labels and apply your own styles skins - example

1866709
contains	any
shared code cannot contains any database-related functions only some plain calculations

1866717
callback	methods
i could do this by chaininging the callback but that seems like poor practice i don t want a silly chaining of 20 callback methods .when i need to load more scripting

1866718
attributes	properties
but control doesn t have an attributes properties

1866727
any	set
also is it possible to have an entity-model with out any properties and just use the the set of predefined unique numbers as key

1866728
function-call	inline
118 by using for example an alternative to the usual function-call mechanism such as â â inline

1866737
wamp	php
i don t want to use any php scripting cause i ll run this things on my home desktop used only for playing music videos and gamepading - no internet-connection nor i don t want to use wamp or something else cause i think is harder and lots of head akes

1866753
contains	elements
e2 null e1.equalss e2 . in other words two lists are defined to be equals if they contains the same elements in the same order

1866754
append	input
i want to take the input value a url extraction a numbers from the url using regex and then refresh the form value with the numbers extractionion and append to another url

1866774
constructor	object
with respect to c++ he apparently uses a broader definition of object that include things like primitive-types that don t even have constructor

1866774
constructor	object
both support creation of user-defined-types that guarantee the invocation of constructor .when object are created

1866774
copy-constructor	constructor
in other words if you write a class with a constructor the compiler is guaranteed to use it at the right time if you write a copy-constructor all copies will be made using your copy-constructor

1866775
onmousedown	onfocus
an active event is considered either onfocus onclientclick onmousedown and .so forth

1866775
click	mouse
basically anything that required a mouse click is an active event

1866783
joomla	kohana
joomla is pretty good platform for developing medium size site but if you want something simple lightweight there are other choices kohana is very lightweight

1866788
filesystems	fat
in the fat filesystems the file id is

1866788
filesystems	fat
a file in the fat filesystems can also

1866804
attributes	properties
note that is used to reference properties and is used to reference the attributes passed to the task

1866841
attributes	properties
checkout the system.web.ui.webcontrols.webcontrol class - it inherited from system.web.ui.control and has an attributes properties

1866851
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
you re still going to need business-logic-layer maybe some service-layer and data-access-layer

1866865
display	width
my users work on windows .so my program output is display on a cmd con.sole .so i cannot control the way it is display colors and terminal size and worse the con.sole is not resizeable at least in width

1866880
sql-server	oracle
if remote-server is sql-server db2 oracle the optimizer will figure it out

1866885
zipfile	archive
i ve inherited a project that at some points creates a zipfile adds an xml file to the zip and then adds a numbers of png files to the same archive

1866887
implements	extends
for example userrecordsclerk might be better explained as extends a generics recordsclerk interface that both userrecordsclerk and companyrecordsclerk implements and then specialise on meaning one can look at the methods in the interface to see what the its subclassing do are generally for

1866899
clisp	sbcl
also if you are learning lisp consider using clisp instead of sbcl

1866903
pixels	line
in a particular scenario i need to shorten a line by a specific numbers of pixels let s say 10 pixels find the points on the line that lies 10 pixels before the endpoints of the line

1866903
pixels	line
imagine a circle with radius r 10 pixels and a line with start points x1 y1 and endpoints x2 y2

1866903
pixels	line
this would give me the new endpoint of the line shortening it by 10 pixels

1866903
pixels	line
i named it lengthenline since i find it more natural to pass a negative-number of pixels if i want the line shortened

1866908
perl	php
again depending on your server this can be php pecl extensions functions simple perl scripting checkin status of the file on server etc

1866923
handler	service
using words like manager service or handler in your class named can be considered too generics but since a lot of programmers use them it also helps understanding what the class is for

1866928
directory	folder
put these in a different folder under the base symfony directory

1866938
value	field
you can use a scripting component in the data flow to copy the value in the recording from the variables to the appropriate field in each row

1866939
subclassing	superclass
the superclass should not know about its subclassing

1866939
subclassing	superclass
if all the subclassinging are going to implements -doauniquebehaviour then it should be implementss in the superclass even empty and each subclassing will overrides it to its needs

1866944
selected	button
i can add something like mymethod this to the onclientclick which is great and sidesteps the problem but if i want a selected all button for example that runs mymethod theitem

1866950
centering	fixed
edit fixed the code aaand fixed the initial explanation thought you wanted the line to go out from the circle s centering to its perimeter p

1866960
alpha	rgba
.when xcode building an application for the device it alters any png resources converting them to bgra as opposed to the usual rgba and premultiplying the alpha channel

1866971
click	mouse
i ve used something similar myself only with the mouse click handling being taken care of within the main layer-hosting view

1866971
click	mouse
the mycustomlayer class would be a custom calayer subclassing which responds to the mousedown methods and does some mouse click handling of its own

1866971
click	mouse
alternatively you could handle the mouse click response entirely within this methods of your layer-hosting view

1866984
python	ruby
it s an automated deployment tool like ruby s capistrano but simpler and ofc ourse for python

1866991

radio-button	selected
given the following code jquery seems to only alert 1 as the value even after the user has selected radio-button 2

1867038
radio-button	selected
shouldn t the trailing jquery alert 2 .when the second radio-button is selected

1867039
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but it simply will not scroll in ie

1867044
constructor	private	constructor	object
in general if you want to stop foo object being dynamically allocated you ll have to have make all the constructor private and provide a function that creates foo object

1867066
revision	svnadmin	svnadmin	dump
you can do an svnadmin dump -r from_rev --incremental to dump all changes from revision from_rev onwards if you omit the --incremental the contents of the from_rev revision will be dumped fully

it was the float left that was breaking safari and google-chrome

1867152
textmate	vim
it is possible to emulate vim modes macros and binding in textmate

1867155
where-clause	sql	conditional	operators
since you cannot join local sequences with linq table the only way to translation the above query into sql woluld be to create where-clause with as many like conditional as there are elements in searchterms list concatenation with and operators

1867156
qaction	qmenu
added some actions and i found a methods qaction qmenu.addmenu self qmenu menu

1867180
remote-desktop	rdp
presently we have to set remote-desktop to shared a local drive with the server then rdp to the server and manually copy the deployment

1867184
json	xml
i would like to issue a local search on google-maps list of restaurants for a given location and i would like to get the restaurants data data back in json xml or other similar format

1867189
constructor	private
you should either create an implicit widening user defined cast operators in your class or create a constructor that takes an ienumerable of concreteresult and uses that to fill the private list field

1867196
annotations	mapping
in short every class that maps to a database-table needs to defined this mapping using either an xml file or annotations

1867200
rendering	redraw
or you could be hitting a rendering bug...do the other field show up if you resize the browser to triggers redraw after the call

1867251
debugging	trace
as a more general debugging suggestion i would say use sql trace .so you can see exactly what s happening

if the user is selected their answers from a grouping of checkbox on the webpage with the question assuming it is a web .app then you ll get back a comma-separated list from there too

1867481
contains	elements	contains	set
since you cannot guarantee that the only one row will be in the p5 table for a given row in p1 you should include a one-to-many a set in p1 that itself contains one elements of p5

1867482
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
thanks all - it seems like in python perl php this would be easy

1867482
value	field
even though it may not be reflection if i use reflection to get the field named seems like there would be an easy dynamic way to get the value based on the named

1867491
average	median
for example you don t deal with its average you deal with it s geometric mean which is the same as its median

1867495
show	next
if you know how to use git and what it does but you re curious how then dig into gitcore-tutorial for start it show what object are stored inside git repository how it stores next revision what is revision and how to do it manually how revision are connect and .so on

1867511
profiling	trace
otherwise you have to fuss with not sql profiling but trace regularly loading resulting data and process it and for my money that just is not an easy thing to do

1867521
google-chrome	firefox
i was having problems with externalinterface and firefox and google-chrome and discovered that the adobe scripting was not writing the flash tag quickly enough .so .when the browser tried to find the addcallback function it was not there at the time

1867539
arrays	loops
like greg said it works asynchronously meaning .when second part display the data loops is execute the request didn t come back yet .so arrays is not filled

1867542
show	next
it show an error but the tick is still display next to the textbox as this only changes on the blur event

1867543
associations	model

if you d like to get the value of a specific field or properties you need to use an instances as well like you already know

1867589
registration	login
i would like to develop an external website using facebook connect instead of an own login and registration process

1867594
contains	any
no u+ffff is not a valid character in any plane .so your string installtime contains undefined garbage

webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms i utilize the same providers and .when the .app is compiled and run the providers are initializer because of the references in the web-config

1867598
any	set
this is an issue since i need to have certain variables set up prior to calling any methods

1867602
perl	c++
this is straightforward to program in c++ and yes perl procedurally without resorting to regexps i m just trying to figure out if there is a regular expression which can do the same job

1867603
youtube	vimeo
i am interested in taking a screenshot of flash movie on sites like youtube and vimeo

1867605
richfaces	icefaces
i ve also looked at richfaces and icefaces demos and there s an awful lot of tables-for-layout there as well

1867607
put	get
.htaccess contains a few basic directives but if i put .some random stuff at the top i don t get internal server errors .so i don t think it even reaches the .htaccess stage

are there any javascript markdown editing toolbar or libs that show the live preview within the textarea and hide the formatting marks ___ etc similar to tinymce s implementation

1867670
richfaces	icefaces
i ve also looked at richfaces and icefaces demos and there s an awful lot of tables-for-layout there as well

1867690

1867710
environment	building
java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_05-b13

1867711
logfile	tail
to figure out the problem find your logfile for postgresql and run tail -f path to postgresql_error.log

1867713
access-control	authentication
if your application s security policy required clients to have appropriate authentication to access the resource the application should force reauthentication or provide a custom access-control mechanism

1867745
toolchain	qmake
i want to setup a custom toolchain with qmake

1867760
testng	junit
both junit and testng provide mechanisms for iterator over a collections of input parameters and running your tests against them

1867760
testng	junit
in junit this is supported via the parameterized annotations while testng uses dataprovider

1867762
postback	ajax
.so that actions specific to a code only triggers an ajax async postback of that piece

1867764
selected	textbox
i would set them to readonly as apparently you re wanting people to be able to read them people may also want to selected text from them for copy-paste and selectedion is disabled as well .when the textbox is disabled

1867770
attributes	properties
you can use the struts2 properties tag in the input value attributes as well or call a methods if you need to do some computation getnextpagenumber from the current struts2 action

1867797
python	php
per.sonally i really don t care if it s php python cgi etc. just .so long as it can run on an apache server

1867798
abstract-class	subclassing
i ended up defining an static string in each subclassing holding the tag of the elements .so i decided to turn the interface into an abstract-class and give it more functionality

1867825
32-bit	64bit
there may be signature checked platform checked 32-bit vs 64bit

1867846
cos	sin
glulookat 0.0f 2.0f 0.0f 0.0f 0.0f 100.0f 0.0f cos cameraangle sin cameraangle

1867853
abstract-class	subclassing
this forces the subclassing to defined a static variables itself and return it to the abstract-class via the abstract gettag methods

1867858
gamma-distribution	probability
the gamma-distribution is frequently a probability model for waiting time

1867868
return-value	arguments
this is because .when you call your function the correct amount of spaces must be allocated on stack to contains these return-value and arguments

1867870
edifact	x12
it s a fairly good tool just for that purpose it supports x12 edifact and tradacoms standards and it s free

1867877
implements	abstract
wouldn t you have actual instances of the subclassing such that you could simply have an abstract gettag methods that each one needs to implements

1867880
put	get	any	set
remeber that if you put a conditional in the where-clause it s going to apply that conditional to the whole set .so any row that doesn t bring back a product will automatically get filtering out because your conditional can t be true

1867891
configuration	environment
that way you can specify different file named for different environment using the was console in resources url urls by creating a resource with the jndi-name url configuration and points it to the correct file file your path to properties

1867944
compact-framework	.net
i have been upgrading an existing .net windows-mobile application to use the 3.5 versioning of the compact-framework and to run on windows-mobile 6.5

1867958
for-loop	arrays
i want to replace the above code with a for-loop that iterates on an arrays of strings

1867958
for-loop	arrays
what would the for-loop syntax be for iterator over the arrays of strings

1867961
decimal	hex
to get the decimal value of a hex numbers or

1867965
constructor	object
you could implements this via passing in the desired color object to the constructor storing a reference to it and delegation the function-call to this object

1867979
where-clause	sql
depending on the database vendor in general the execution of a query against a view combines the sql defined in the view with the where-clause predicates and order by clause sort expression append to the sql that you pass against the view to come up with a combined complete sql query to execute

1867992
wireless-connection	ethernet	ethernet	packets
.when receiving a raw ethernet packets over a wireless-connection where does the ethernet checksum get calculated and where are errors handled

1867997
for-loop	arrays
note arrays_filter will iterate over your arrays and is going to be much faster execution time-wise than using a for-loop as arrays_filter is a wrapper to an underlying c function

1868002
expression-blend	designer
expression-blend 3 which offers a far superior designer

1868005
directory	folder
from what i can tell about your problem i would just specify the user s home-directory as the directory to include and perhaps exlude the caching folder

1868007
worksheet	excel
there is a worksheet with charts to multiple worksheet with chartss sample which might be somewhat useful on our excel report samples page here

1868022
subclassing	superclass
in each methods that superclass checked if the corresponding class is equals or a subclassing of that class

1868029
contains	elements	contains	any
the column does not need to contains any other elements or binding

1868040
subclassing	inherited
this createchildcontrols methods is part of the control inherited hierarchy and is typically overrides by subclassing controls

1868045
contains	elements
right now for each elements in the list you re adding that elements to the result if its not contains in the remainder of the list

1868045
contains	elements
to get the result you apparently want you d add each elements in the list to the result if it s not yet contains in the result

1868054
perl	php
but al.so if you re going to be distributing interpreter scripting to run on a mix of machines i ll often avoid branding new features .so i don t force people to upgrade php perl whatever just to be able to run it

1868070
javascript	dom
every control will have a javascript file associated with it if you implements iscriptcontrol correctly tied to one of that control s dom elements

1868070
javascript	dom
that javascript file will behave like an object and be tied to an individual dom elements

1868084
arrays	loops
using a 1-d rectangular arrays took it back down to around 340ms - .so it s .somewhat significant and currently you ve got two of those per loops iterator

1868106
variables	boolean
users can open or close one boolean variables

1868130
arrays	map
if you don t map the data to object you could shuffle the result arrays from the database

1868147
rollback	commit
i would also use the cftransaction cftry cfcatch tag with commit rollback rather than an anonymous block and separate the queries into their own cfquery block

1868230
primitive	int
it won t work for types int as it is a primitive types

1868265
downgrade	upgrade
and yes iphone users can upgrade and downgrade their os

1868271
controllers	routes
can t be sure without seeing the routes controllers but it looks like some default router abuse

1868279
webserver	upload
one issue i m striking is that i m trying to set the file upload request content-length using the file downloading s content-length however the issue seems to be .when the source webpage is on a webserver for which the httpwebresponse doesn t provide a content-length

1868279
webserver	upload
in particular is there a code sample someone would have that show how to do a chunks http downloading upload to avoid any issues of the source webserver not providing content-length

1868281
revision	updates
the problem is that modules may change the way they store their settings from one revision to another .so whenever you updates to a new versioning of any module you should do .some reverse-engineering to see if your ultimate-one-click-configuration module still works ok - which if you ask me is even more painful than manually configuring all modules for each project

1868313
id3v2	ogg
i ve already got id3v2 taken care of but i can t figure out how ogg files are structured

1868316
implements	sealed
this then brings up a more general question - if a types is not sealed should it really implements these interfaces at all

1868316
implements	sealed
my current thought is to have my generator comparison function only use on member field whose t is sealed and instead to use the virtual equals .object .obj if t is unsealed even if t implements since the field could potentially store subtyping of t and i doubt most implementation of are designed appropriately for inherited

1868333
json	xml
this is going to be used to generator xml json from a java class

1868359
base-class	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	base-class
i defined a base-class nodes that has only a few field nodesid parentid nodestype and several subclassing that inherited from nodes and add their own field

1868375
protected	public
to get all object field including public protected package and private access field simply use class.getdeclaredfield

1868378
hash	md5	salt	md5
typically it is stored as a salt hash of either md5 or sha1

1868381
perl	php
the php language started out as a set of perl scripting

1868381
perl	php
as such php gets most of it s syntax from perl

1868381
perl	php
perl and by extension php has untyped variables

1868387
double-quotes	single-quotes	double-quotes	spaces
wrap properties namedd with double-quotes beats wrap properties namedd with double-quotes or single-quotes and you can leave the quotes off unless the named include spaces or other special characters for simplicity

1868390
environment	building
i would prefer not to use a building scripting because i would like to be able to building and run the solutions through the visual-studio environment

1868411
authentication	login
the server can be broken down into several areas with the sockets starting in a connect area then once connect to a client being move to a authentication area login or register before then moving between various other parts of the server depedning on what the client is doing

1868415
identifier	temporary
it seems like the standards solution is to pass the user identifier along with another temporary key that website a created and website b knows about

1868417
teradata	oracle
it reminds me of working with teradata where you have set tables unique rows only and multiset tables duplicates rows allowed but oracle has no such functionality

1868421
ruby	php
both of these and other mature languages like php and ruby have features from many different paradigms

1868450
revision	svn
our building scripting automatically tag the .source after successful building .so in my case the last svn revision rarely ever points to the trunk .so i get this a lot

1868460
jquery	dojo
you need to modify the dom via dom methods this will be made much easier if you use a toolkit like prototype jquery mootools dojo the closure libs yui etc.

1868485
implements	sealed
i ve been thinking about this question for a bit and after a bit of consideration i agree that implements and should only be done on sealed types

1868486
tokenize	parsing
it appears to just tokenize the streaming string on spaces and provide functions for taking the token and parsing it

1868486
tokenize	parsing
then once you have them in a line you would tokenize them with string s split and then parsing them

1868499
execution	exit
.when the main thread exit all the other threads stop execution and the application quits

1868545
document	editing
if you want to be fast in editing content then there really is only one option use sharepoint 2010 as adding pictures has become as easy as adding pictures in a words document

1868551
uitableview	uiview
i use a uitableview and assign a my uiview derived-class to the tableheaderview properties

1868553
aes	rsa
you could use a combinations of rsa and aes much like pgp works

1868553
aes	rsa
the client makes a random string wich will be used by the aes algorithm encrypts it with the public key and send it to the server this is all with rsa

1868553
sniffing	packets
this will prevent packets sniffing and you won t have to store a passwd in your flash object

1868566
environment	restart
i ve found that you need to restart the local dev environment before

1868568
ubuntu	linux
- os gnu linux - ubuntu 9.10 64bit

i have even tried using the std cout but i get another error that says intellisense namespace std has no member cout .when i have declare using namespace std include iostream + i even tried to use ostream

1868603
ostream	std
all of the .h files have using namespace std and include iostream and ostream

1868606
linux	unix
your best bet is to use a crontab if you are on linux unix mac os x a task scheduling on windows or launchd on newer versioning of mac os x

1868609
basic	vba
that s not to say f# or other languages wouldn t be just fine for scritping imperative spreadsheet operations but vba is also fine for that and just like its basic ancestry is targeted at less experienced programmers

1868621
margins	padding
the padding margins combo has almost no effect

1868621
firefox	safari
this particular client has an office full of ie7 machines .so no firefox or safari etc.

1868639
tunnel	vpn
truly hiding your ip would required that you are leveraging some types of proxy service or tunnel service vpn which is relaying your request on your behalf and acting as an intermediary

1868639
tunnel	vpn
you could write a vb.net 20005 application which simply connect you to a proxy-server or tunnel your internet traffic through a vpn which in turn hide your ip-address

1868651
value	field
i m start with an if-statement that echo photo exists if there s a value in the thumb-url custom field otherwise it does nothing

1868688
callback	methods
jquery provides a step callback for its .animate methods

1868699
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i get the correct count .when using ie firefox however any webkit browser safari google-chrome gives me a count of 0

1868700
vba	vb6
it s actually in vba same generator slight subset of vb6 used as the scripting-language for emc-captiva s inputaccel formware .so switching is not an option

1868705
instances	self
you need to explicit pass self variables which represents an instances of a class

1868707
interface-builder	iboutlet
if you use a uitextfield in your interface you can connect the uitextfield to a member variables in your class by declaring the variables as an iboutlet and connecting it in interface-builder

1868719
64bit	x86
thread 0 crash with x86 thread state 64bit

bluetooth	usb
usb device bluetooth usb hosts controllers 0x05ac apple inc. 0x820f 0x1a110000

1868720
any	set	assign	add
if you have a fixed set of access roles and any numbers of users where a user is assign one and only one access role and any numbers of users can be assign a given access rules this is how i interpreter your question then you would put a column like accessroleid in your users table and add a foreign key constraint into access_roles

1868734
linux	bsd
i m interested in porting this functionality to linux bsd platform

1868746
instances	self

1868753
linux	unix
also if you are using linux or any unix variant look into using valgrind as well

1868761
getter	setter
you can either use the objective-c runtime itself and call either class_copypropertieslist or protocol_copypropertieslist and deal with those or use foundation and call respondstoselector on the object for the kvc getter setter for a given properties for a properties foo you would call something like

1868774
selected	listbox
i want to bulk export from a selected table all columns that match a listbox and from only rows that match listings in a text file

1868792
32-bit	64bit

1868813
contains	elements
this file containss a large numbers of second level elements that contains the information i m interested in

1868813
xsd	xml
if i am wrong is there a way of parsing the xml sections without structuring my reading code to closely match the xsd

1868840
value	field
if server performance is a concern you might consider creating a changed field for each recording and using javascript to set it .when one of the user-editable field value changes

1868841
hide	show
then catch the zoom event sorry don t have the exact named to hand and if the scale goes down to 0.5 or below hide the first view and show the second and vice-versa going the other way of course

1868842

1868849
filtering	grouping
edit modify the view go to the filtering grouping

1868880
xsd	xml
if the sub chunks of xml conform to an xsd then you can certainly turn them into functional object

1868913
defined	declare
you should defined an appropriate interface a protocols in objective-c that declare the needed properties

1868919
contains	elements
if we look at wsdl produced by wcf it contains wsdl types elements with import of all xsd schema

1868937
textbox	button
suppose i want to make a small swf .app basically a couple of button textbox and event handler

1868955
output	mode
i have a view where i put the data but .when i printing it printinging in the correct orientation only on 8x11 paper in other words it printinging oriented correctly on letter size paper with the origin in the upper left corner -- lower left if you are holding the output in landscape mode

1868969
postgresql	mysql
of course i assume that you are doing things sensibly and for example are not migrating a site from an apache mysql server to a nginx postgresql one maybe also adding the need to prefix your db tables in the process

1868994
mstest	nunit
for mstest idk if nunit has something similar it s useful a descriptionattribute for each test methods since they show up on the test results panels on visual-studio

1869014
blacklist	whitelist
my guess is checked your whitelist blacklist in your facebook developer .application .app settings -- your ip might be restrict

1869021

any	set
you can order by any column and you can set it to ascending asc or descending desc

1869087
any	set
your rdbms can t give you any guarantee that result set will be order by q1 q2 q3

1869096
children	nodes	children	tree
a little background as a way to learn multinodes tree in c++ i decided to generator all possible tic-tac-toe boards and store them in a tree such that the branch beginning at a nodes are all boards that can follow from that nodes and the children of a nodes are boards that follow in one move

1869096
children	nodes
now .when i first implements the ai i went back and added two field to each nodes upon generator the # of time x will win the # of time o will win in all children below that nodes

1869101
selected	checkbox
this will add all of the contains controls to the selectedion list and selected them as well indicated with checkbox

1869122
arrays	loops
the second loops uses the value of the character pointed to by the pointers in to index the count arrays

1869128
google-chrome	firefox
witnessed this technique working in google-chrome and firefox

1869132
priority-queue	heap	contains	lookup	contains	elements	contains	set
the priority-queue backing is a heap .sorted list of elementss .so insert a new elements and then doing a contains e test will an o n search because .sorting is based on the queuing not on the data value if you include a hashset to support the set functionality though you can improve your lookup time a lot at the expense of maintaining the dataset references twice remember that java is pass-by-value and all object live on the heap

1869139
contains	set
the contains list box needed to set the horizontal scrollbar to disabled like this

1869146
priority-queue	queue
if it s sufficient to have a queue with a set-like behavior iaw you just don t want to accept duplicates entries then i think an easy solution could be to subclassing priority-queue and overrides the add addall and offer methods like

1869147
arrays	loops
another option would be to initializer a standards class as a variables and loops through your arrays while re-assigning the value

1869150
value	field
however the field in the db that stores the dropdown s value still contains a value of three on some rows

1869151
python	java
i love python and despite what everyone says my python is better because i know java

1869151
python	java
some people complain that starting with java causes one to initially write clunky python but if you already know more or less the easy way to do something in python you will be safe from this.

1869159
duplicates	elements
you could keep a side hashtable of insert elements to avoid duplicates if you really need to enforce that

1869166
global-variables	call
the same thing happens .when you call global-variables since they are members of the global object windows in browser scripting

1869173
order	add
one way to solve this is to add an extra column in your table called for example sortorder that contains int determining in which order the rows should be returned

1869177
xsd	xml
if you have xml tools and speak xsd you might want to design an xml schema for the input and output messages

1869177
xsd	xml
if you have a good vision for what the xml should look like you can just create sample input + output messages then derive or infer the xsd from those messages using something like the xsd.exe tool in the .net sdk

1869182
duplicates	elements
now what about the suggestion of removing the duplicates elements from the list before going forwarding

1869188
simplemodal	jquery
i m trying to use jquery simplemodal confirm to show a yes no confirmation .when a form is submitted

1869205
javascript	dom
to get a dom elements by its id you should do without any javascript framework

1869217
google-chrome	firefox
is it possible to take screenshot of open tab in firefox google-chrome via javascript

1869234
arrays	map
cakephp has a recursive set map class that basically maps an arrays into an object

1869242
nsstring	nsdata
nsstring nsdata nsarray or

1869254
subroutine	scoping
the reason the subroutine doesn t work in your module is simply that the richtextbox variables are not visible in that scoping

1869259
system.data	.net
you will need .net 3.5 obviously and add using system.data

1869297
r5rs	r6rs
the r5rs and the r6rs standard-library for lists

1869302
xsd	xml
i have some xml and an xml schema in a local xsd file

1869302
contains	any
the xml document does not contains any schema information

1869302
xsd	xml
i want to validation the xml document against the xsd schema file in cocoa meaning i d prefer something ns cf libxml based as opposed to an external libs

1869319
contains	set
edit okay per your clarification in comments the variables is always set however it sometimes contains text and sometimes contains an empty string

1869320
keyboard	mouse
there are enough sources of entropy in most systemd timing of keyboard and mouse events network packets etc that the output will be unpredictable

1869324
mouseover	mouseout
obviously i don t want mouseover mouseout queue buildup

1869331
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
does anyone know how can i use my custom subclassing of uinavigationbar if i initializer uinavigationcontroller programmatically without ib

1869345
coalesce	isnull
i think coalesce is sql standards -ish whereas isnull is not

1869360
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it is running fine in firefox google-chrome safari but not surprise

1869414
common-lisp	lisp
years ago a company sold a common-lisp compiler for exactly this purpose compiling lisp to maintainable c

1869440
internet-explorer	firefox
in one of the servers though w2k3 it only works on firefox .when i try it on ie7 i get an error like internet-explorer cannot open file sendfile.aspx on server named

1869450
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should use mouseenter and mouseleave

1869450
mouseover	mouseout
the mouseover and mouseout events fire continuously as the cursor is move inside of an elements

1869455
.net	wcf
i don t know nhibernate but want to remind you that you should be using wcf for new web service development unless you are stuck in the past .net 2.0

1869457
text-editor	editor
tools - options - text-editor - c# - advanced - underline errors in the editor

1869474
environment	building
you ll need to consider whether you want to use emacs as your editor only but continue to maintain your project settings source files and building debugging environment in visual-studio or switching completely to emacs as you editor and use some other tools make to building your project using vs compilers or other compilers completely

1869474
environment	building
the second option - switching to a fully unix-like building environment is more involved and extends far beyond what editor you will be using

1869474
environment	building
unfortunately the next step - to move from the vs building environment to .something cross platform isn t .so simple and i can t see a particularly gradual way to do it

1869474
toolchain	gnu
you ll need to decide what your alternative would be - it could be as simple the classic gnu toolchain - make makedepends gcc gdb and related components

1869509
selected	cell	selection	cell
how do i prevent the selection or editing the next cell if the user hasn t selected any value in the celleditor

1869519
constructor	object
is it implying if you change the details of creating the object you might change the constructor arguments

1869519
constructor	object
the object s constructor you can ask the object

1869523
any	set
in this case we do want it because any use of process option causes wsgi.multiprocess to be set to true and in this case we still want that flag to be true for multithreading process .so that code knows it is part of multiprocess configuration even though that particular daemons process grouping only has one process in it

1869530
git-repo	repo
clone the remote repo into a new temporary git-repo

1869552
exception-handling	try-catch
i get that this is because the exception-handling happens on a separate thread from the main ui-thread but if the exception-handling generator is generator in this separate thread in code that i have a try-catch with why is it ignoring it and bailing on the thread entirely instead and then causing the main thread to panic and abort

1869558
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
should the data-access-layer dal and business-logic-layer bll be exposed through interfaces or through abstract base classes

1869558
abstract	extends	implements	abstract	implements	extends
is one benefit of using abstract base classes that if external party decides to extends customize the functionality of a particular layer using the base abstract-class then lots of methods exposed by that particular layer would already be implementss in a base abstract-class while with interfaces one would need to implements all the public methods exposed by a particular layer

1869570
ftpwebrequest	ftp
if you pass it an http url-for example you will actually create an httpwebrequest instances - an ftp url will create an ftpwebrequest

1869576
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
if is any of the commercial relational engines sql-server oracle db2 mysql then the best performance will come from using.

1869582
required	checked
using iis i ve checked the required secure channel ss and 128bit encryption checkbox for the folder i want to required ssl

1869622
webforms	asp.net
this is a question about asp.net webforms and sessionstate

1869622
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know this is probably a case where asp.net-mvc is better but i need to use webforms

1869622
textbox	button
also on this page is an input textbox where the user will enter some info and then press a save button

1869623
firefox	safari
also it works fine in ie but not firefox or safari

1869630
contains	set
is it possible to setup eclipse .so that .when i am switched between working sets only that working set is automatically built and additionally the problems tasks etc views only show information from project contains in the current working set

1869635
textbox	button
i have 2 textbox and 1 button on my form

1869636
value	field
then save the selection as the field s value

1869655
double	int
in the example given you don t want to clog your int class with how it could become an int from a string or a double .so you create your factory whose .sole responsibility is to create x object from y parameters

1869666
.when	ready
i have the design in html and css ready but i just need to have .something like custom page in the menu .so .when i click on it it takes me to that design not external link though

1869676
webforms	asp.net	value	field
if you are using asp.net webforms and are using the asp textbox to collect the information you can use the requiredfieldvalidator to ensure that both field have a value before the page will postback

1869683
triggers	insert
if you want to create that view url alias for specific nodes combinations you could try to use the insert updates and delete operations of hook_nodesapi to triggers the alias creation

1869693
.when	ready
the ready event triggers .when the document is ready to be worked on manipulated

1869705
margins	padding
this exists even if you place margins and padding at zero

1869748
contains	any
some of the settings in this file might contains settings to be process really early before any of your code had a chance to do anything the ones related to the startup of .net clr

1869760
selected	listbox
as to how to get selecteded items from a listbox to a string and format a sql statement to only selected those rows from the database to export here is one way

1869763
scheme	lisp
i m considering learning a lisp dialect probably scheme since i am constantly hearing how good of a learning language it is inorder to improve my general programming skill

1869771
constructor	object
in fact it has been my belief for quite some time that object like int string etc. don t contemplate overloads for each other because they are struct rather than classes and as a rules struct constructor should not throw exception-handling which would happen if for example you could feed a hello world to a int

1869800
alignment	layout
as you say you have to be careful of alignment and other memory layout issues

1869815
httpwebrequest	webclient
have you looked at a standards tool like httrack or if you want to actually want the html if you re programming for fun look at webclient or httpwebrequest if you want to learn more

1869816
implements	extends
however implements a new or extends an existing viewresolver is a pretty simple solution and would be the way i d go with

1869837
margins	padding
to solve it i simply added zero top padding and zero top margins to the h1 that was in the float thus making it equally fflush at top with the h1 on the left non floated

1869837
margins	padding
perhaps adding some zero padding and margins to your ul or li s will solve yours

1869842
declarative	imperative
i think the best you can gain from studying a functional language is starting to think in a more declarative less imperative way

1869845
installation	environment
for smaller sites on shared-hosting environment i usually place the drupal installation in subfolders within the document-root to allow for staging etc. hiding the subfolder via url-rewriting

1869848
advantage-database-server	sql-server
my client is using advantage-database-server and wants to move to sql-server but obviously wants to move all his clients data as part of the upgrade over to sql-server

1869853
contains	any
if a dataset contains a column that is a timestamp or other binary value its associated datagridview throw an argumentexception .when display any data in that column

1869855
priority-queue	queue
if you want to decrease key simply add the new entry to your priority-queue leaving the old entry still in the queue and updates your arrays with distance

1869856
hide	show
i m not sure i understand your question but if you are trying to selectively show or hide one of the controls in your itemtemplate depending on the data use the onitemdatabound event use findcontrol to get the controls and set the visible properties on each appropriately

1869864
revision	updates
maybe you could store your database-schema revision in suitable table and use that as a criterion for updates process

1869880
put	get
instead of using why don t you get the wsdl as a file and put it in src wsdl or another location in which case you ll have to specify it using the elements

1869901
linked-list	heap
the gc in most of the clrs i believe the .net 4.0 clr has made some changes in this area uses a traditional linked-list allocation for the large object heap and it doesn t compact the heap due to the cost of moving large amounts of memory around

1869923
any	set
not sure if there is any thing or option i have to set in powergui

1869929
default	reset
this made the browsers margins to align each browser has its own default margins that you preemptively should reset before starting your coding since i dont have the rest of your code this could be the issue

1869938
64bit	x86
if it s in c program files x86 xxx as seen on 64bit windows this is a known issue

1869939
tuples	any
if a tuples has any sort of semantics important to your application you should use a proper class instead

1869947
salt	md5
as overslacked said i think the problem has to do with salt but i couldn t find any sha or md5 documentation that the algorithm is using in each platform or any parameter to customize this

1869981
getter	setter
you could do this with this methods as both getter and setter methodss are defined for each attributes

1869987
google-chrome	firefox
the downloading happens in a new windows and what i m seeing in ie7 8 but not google-chrome or firefox is the tab opens and closes but no file dialogue is show

1869991
put	get
you would need to use git ls-files --stage or to get sha-1 identifier of blobs file versioninging you want to put in index or if you want to generator versioning of a file from scratch from working area versioning

1870004
put	get
the first time i load a request it does automatically get put in the caching has it

1870015
perl	php
i had this once years ago .when a colleague from the perl world and totally ignorant about php decided to set short_open_tags to off on a server we shared because short_open_tags messed with some xml experiment he had going

1870020
value	field
i have a plist that is process with a precompile header file and in it there is the variables version_string used a few time in such field as cfbundlegetinfostring ie the value for the key cfbundlegetinfostring is myproduct version_string copyright â 2009 mycorp

1870021
callback	methods
setting a timeout callback methods begingetresponse doesnâ t timeout.

1870025
attributes	properties
p.s using setattributes for src attributes is bad practice .when you want to support ie6 browsers better use direct properties like

1870047
aes	rsa
i don t mind if its symmetric e.g aes or asymmetric e.g rsa - but it must be a recognized algorithm for which i can get a fips-140 approved libs

1870050
business-process	bpm
in simple terms think of jbpm as a workflow framewrok engine - you defined a sequences of events that also called a business-process hence bpm - b usiness p rocess m anagement and jbpm make your data follow that sequences process

1870050
jmstemplate	jms
of course there is all power of spring-remoting jms webservice rmi etc.. which is available in spring-integration via templates jmstemplate webservicetemplate etc.. and adaptor that allow the integration with external systemd with ftp rmi httpinvoker jms web-services etc

1870056
textbox	button
start with your search page which we ll call search.aspx - this has your dropdownlistfor textbox and button

1870056
protected	public
we al.so need to change the search.aspx.designer.vb .so that the dropdownlistfor and textbox are public properties not protected

1870065
slidedown	slideup
find a div slideup all of it s child divs then after all of them are up show one of those child divs via slidedown

1870096
entity	pojo
you do have to be careful to make sure that you arent currently reading from the resultset but if your entity class is a proper pojo or at least properly disconnect from resultset then this should be a fine approach

1870099
windows-xp	windows
i have a primary and a backup windows 2008 server and a bunch of windows-xp clients that map a drive to a shared on the primary server

1870100
protected	public
with structure the inherited is public by default with class it s private by default if you don t specify public private protected

1870116
.net	wcf	getter	setter
the .net setter and getter visibility modifiers are irrelevant .when dealing with wcf messages really

1870116
xsd	xml
if your field has a attributes it will be part of the xml schema of your datacontract - and the client cannot know that it has an internal setter on the server side - it s just part of the xsd datacontract

1870116
.net	wcf
.net and wcf are two very distinct and separate worlds - .when your client call a wcf service it s a soap-based message-passing only - there s no .net based object integration

1870122
web-config	app-config
the app-config and web-config should only be used for readonly value

1870135
digits	zero
digits padded with zero to express

1870137
player	movie
let s assume you have a text file with the text to be show and the annotations time of .when to highlight it kind of a subtitle file for example the standards proposal w3c timed text or the sub - movie subtitle file-format in use by several media player

1870149
environment	building
this seems a tad inconvenient especially because a .profile setting of the .war project will change for each environment which seems like it would force me to duplicates that building tweak each time i attempted to building the ear as well

1870150
void	main
like any other .net project it is the static void main methods in a class defined in your project

1870150
void	main
because of this only one static void main methods is allowed in a project

1870150
return-type	arguments	void	main
note this static main methods must be defined as void return-type and it can either take no arguments or it can be defined to take an arrays of strings to be passed as command-line arguments

1870151
contains	any
once you attempt to use the extern const outside of the compilation unit where it s initializer the cpp file contains initialization or any of the files it include the compiler will barf with pretty much the same error

1870175
spaces	output
this will give better usage of the bits in the bytes you encrypt .so you d waste very little spaces in that transformation but does nothing to improve the encoding on the output side

1870197
revision	svn
fetching the last revision from svn

1870199
getter	setter
defined a properties named c with a setter getter

1870202
build-server	nant
configure a build-server something like cruisecontrol.net is excellent for this and roll your own custom nant scripting if needed or use execute tasks to take care of the deployment

1870204
subtract	modulo
you can easily reverse this as long as you have the block of random data and the index you get the random bits and subtract them from the cypher digits modulo 10

1870204
counterclockwise	ring
adding is count clockwise around the ring and subtract is count counterclockwise

1870204
subtract	add
you can add or subtract any numbers and it will work

1870221
default	reset
if it doesn t get triggers you can reset the timer with another call to set_time_limit right after the query and then use restore_error_handler to swap the default error-handling function back into place

1870226
similarity	distance
consider using keyword match and edit distance based similarity

1870274
derived-class	base-class
one is in the derived-class and one is in the base-class

1870274
derived-class	base-class
i m almost certain that what you want is to keep the common variables in the base-class shape and not redeclare identically named and types member variables in the derived-class

1870301
facebook-page	fbml
my understanding is that tab pages for a facebook-page only supports fbml applications not iframe

1870303
.when	ready
.when you re ready to take the next step pick up a design-patterns book and learn some of the oop design terminology

1870305
invoices	product
invoices product cost - invoices discount - amount paid .so far

1870305
invoices	product
invoices product cost is calculated as

1870313
datalist	listview
but how about datalist performance vs listview

1870313
datalist	listview
and how about datalist + paging vs listview with paging

1870317
arrays	loops
just use this function in a loops to fill up your destination arrays

1870333
authentication	login
grant authentication on server to the certificate derived login

1870334
32-bit	64bit
this way you can run your package in 64bit dtexec and your component in 32-bit process

1870345
subtract	add
using add subtract instead of xor should still produce random output if one of the input are random

1870351
.net	wcf
if you need to expose many different functions or send and receive complex data types and if you are using .net on both ends .net-remoting or wcf is probably best

1870374
put	get
if you can get the user to put the file on a fixed positioning you can access the file c shared file.jpg using a path like tsclient c shared file.jpg

1870383
ftp	scp
there is no ftp scp or anything like that .so i can t generator the excel on the linux device and transfer it locally

1870383
csv	xml
1.as it is now spaces tabs 2.reformat as csv or as 3.convert to xml

1870398
vb.net	vb6
i am converting my company s vb6 program over to vb.net and i have hit another stupid little roadblock

1870410
double-quotes	spaces
csv is more robust than your current format under copy and paste transfer -- spaces and tabs can easily get confused comma and double-quotes aren t

1870425
explode	implode
i could explode the filename on . and save the extension then implode to get the filename again

1870425
temporary	copy
_files file tmp_named - the named of the temporary copy of the file stored on the server

1870428
splitter	panels
if the controls don t behave as you want them if the splitter does not end up where you expect for instances use the cmd on the controls in the order listview splitter and panels

1870438
windows-vista	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-xp	windows-server	windows-vista
according to the .net 4.0 beta 2 downloading page it s supported on windows-server 2003 windows-server 2008 windows-vista and windows-xp

1870447
fadeout	fadein
i m just getting to throw myself into the javascript jquery pool and have found some possible alternative solutions but i wanted to see if there was a way i could acheive fadein fadeout with the existing javascript i am using

1870469
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
i have investigated this with various practical examples including one with a base-class that definedd a destructor with a derived-class that inherited from the base-class and does not defined a destructor

1870469
derived-class	base-class
creating an instances of the derived-class allowing all references to the instances to go out of scoping and then forcing a garbage-collection demonstrates that the destructor defined in the base-class is called .when the instances of the derived-class is finalized

1870469
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
my question is what does destructor are not inherited actually mean since although you can t call a destructor explicit destructor in an inherited chaining are called automatically and base-class destructor are called even if the derived-class does not defined a destructor

1870469
derived-class	base-class
the example above demonstrates that base-class constructor will be called .when an instances of a derived-class is finalized even if the derived-class does not explicit defined a destructor

1870469
virtual-method	destructor
destructor are implements by overrides the virtual-method finalize on system.object

1870474
associations	model
is there anyway to use the vs2008 class model tool to more effectively accommodate all 3 types of associations

1870474
enterprise-architect	visio
updates i went with visio however i think there are some tools out there allowing uml model with round-tripping including enterprise-architect and possible vs2010

1870480
children	nodes
this takes care of both checked and unchecked all children regardless of how many levels down there may be child nodes

1870484
playframework	lift
since your question is not specific to lift i d recommend you the playframework

1870484
scala	java
playframework is totally asp.net-mvc with a fantastic template-engine and allows you to choose freely between java scala

1870520
google-chrome	safari
since google-chrome uses webkit you could also as an alternative test against safari or konqueror instead

1870553
callback	methods
you could also use the delegation to get notification .when your animation ends and remove the image altogether see here for an example of using the animationdidstop finished callback methods

1870563
export	csv
i have a query that i need to export the results of to a csv file and save where the client request dialog box

1870564
contains	set
i tried to set its templates but then it creates a rectangle that contains the inner controls and this rectangle is not responsive for user click and also have the control-style i want this controls to be invisible only its text should be visible

1870611
shibboleth	cas
cas shibboleth ldap.

1870621
directory	folder
the access-denied is likely a vista win7 issue resulting from programs attempting to modify files in registered application directory within the program files or windows top-level folder

1870629
callback	methods
if you want to use a repository-pattern with silverlight i think the best approach is to pass in a callback methods of some sort to every methods which is then called by the repository .when the async call finishes

1870636
glut	glu
it looks like you are compiling a single cpp including the gl headers and linking with gl glu and glut

1870658
itemtemplate	itemscontrol	itemscontrol	tabcontrol
the tabcontrol contains a contenttemplate properties as well as the itemtemplate that it inherited from itemscontrol

1870676
version-control	git
my answer is a different approach to the problem altogether try using a version-control systemd like git to investigate how the directory changed over the years

1870679
pointer-to-pointer	dereference
but your vector contains pointers .so an iterator will act like a pointer-to-pointer .so needs to be dereference twice

1870692
malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
note i cannot use malloc calloc free memcpy or similar functions because i am writing code for a memory-management systemd

1870698
temporary	copy
you can t control where the allocation will allocate memory from but you can make a temporary instances on stack and copy it into where p points with memcpy

1870705
callback	methods
i have implements the callback methods that would catch the response from the api and updates the flickrimage instances with the geolocation data - but it never gets called

1870710
fireworks	photoshop
i have fireworks 8 as well as photoshop cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with fireworks

1870717
web-applications	web-services
advanced businesslink offers a suite of product called strategi which basically allows creating web-applications running natively on iseries consuming and providing web-services and replacing green screens with web user interfaces among other things

1870718
python	ruby
in ruby you d just prefix the identifier with in this case foo baz is there a python equivalent to this

1870720
explode	implode
otherwise you are going to have to parsing the file string which the simplest methods is to use explode manipulate the arrays in this case setting the last elements to otherplace and then use implode to reassemble it

1870750
malloc	free
feel free to replace my malloc with your own malloc

1870767
constructor	object
if you browse the sources of objectinputstream you will find that it allocates the deserialized object without calling any constructor

1870767
constructor	object
what you can do with public api is put together the byte streaming of a deserialized object read it in and there you go with an instances of the object whose constructor was never called

1870770
dictionary	hashmap
the way i am currently working around the issue is by iterator through all the key in the dictionary and performing the equality checked whenever i perform a containskey or get operation - however this pretty much defeats the entire points of a hashmap cheap lookup operations

1870770
dictionary	map
if i am unable to continue using a dictionary instances as the backing for map how would i go about creating the hash for unique object instancess passed in as key .so i can still maintain equality

1870771
derived-class	base-class
i had a duplicates properties in my derived-class same as the base-class defined with a templates

1870784
authentication	login	subclassing	base-class
with user authentication it s clear you re going to have a username and passwd now they go into the base-class but what if you need a tokenid as well re-use your existing login base-class and create a new subclassing from that with the new behavior all your existing code works without change

1870791
rollback	commit
then if no error has occurs commit the transactional else rollback it

1870795
highlight	cell
wondering if there is .some preferences i can set in excel .so that .when i am in a specific cell the entire row is slightly highlight not overly .so but enough to easily tell it out

1870801
python	ruby
ps i am not selling monkey patching here but the fact that ruby s package systemd can be rewritten by the user even to work like python systemd

1870825
business-objects	data-access
i have a business-objects project-server side storing the mapping orm and a corresponding data-access service exposing crud operations on them and others also like getall etc

1870837
selected	cell	highlight	selected	highlight	cell
the code only highlight the active row if a single cell is selected .so that it does not interfere .when multiple cell are selected

1870855
macros	let	macros	vba
is there a tool which will analyse parsing an entire excel workbook and let us see all the macros functions vba code

1870856
content-management	publishing
the future of web publishing is clearly in content-management systemd for everything larger than a small personal site

1870861
arp	tcp
on the other side transferring via wifi required a lot of process power and memory since much more things have to be implements before you can even start transferring data 802.11 cdma ca arp tcp

1870877
perl	php	python	php	python	perl	python	java
you d get far more flexibility using a python scripting a php page a perl scripting a java program or any other environment that can access oracle

1870879
json	xml
i read it somewhere that that 2 use json as output types whereas 1 use xml .doc

1870879
json	xml
isn t that a properties of solr which returns .doc both in json and xml

1870880
click	mouse
the first thing i would like to do is pick up the right mouse click as the document.body.onmousedown is not recognized in opera.

1870881
drupal	django
you will find that if you invest a lot of time in learning something like python django you will be able to create just about any site you can imagine but then you might find that if all your client required is a simple mostly static company info site that something like drupal might be more appropriate

1870906
document-ready	ready
i have tried document-ready.apply triggers ready overrides the document-ready function.

1870917
arguments	default
.when i just want to pass the tag arguments and let the others by default how do i write

1870920
implements	abstract
in lanuages that support classes you can implements each abstract data types in its own class

1870929
put	get
i then put x into the bss algorithm and get sâ which is a reconstruction of the signals vector

1870932
default-value	arguments
instead what you can do is use null for the argumentss you don t wish to specify and then have your function checked to see if an arguments is null and assign it the default-value instead

1870945
haskell	ocaml
the function that takes a list of lists and returns a single list contains the contents of those lists is called concat in many functional languages ocaml f# haskell clojure

1870980
arrays	loops
now the compiler can generator optimal code for moving through the two output arrayss and after inlining and optimization the inner loops can step through the image.imageptr arrays with a stride of 3 instead of recalculating the offset all the time

1871037
value	field
otherwise you will come to grief the first time one of your field value contains an xml markup character

1871045
3des	aes
since you are changing from aes to 3des the key sizes will be different that may be a problem

1871097
wicket	spring
we have been using our reusable user-management module which was written using spring hibernate using doman-model pattern .we have used that module in several project integration with wicket jsp and zk frameworks

1871111
xsd	xml
.so it looks like to me that you ve got an xsd that says expect a catalogue here and then you ve got xml that says here s a x-schema tamsdataschema.xml catalogue and unsurprisingly jaxb gets overly anal and says that ain t cool. there is no way to workaround this that i can see

1871126
python	c++
.so python took c++ namespace and #include and largely extended on it

1871140
windows-vista	windows
on windows-vista or above an entry in the windows system32 drivers etc hosts-file causes mysql_connect connections to localhost to timeout and never connect

1871140
windows-vista	windows	windows-server	windows	windows-server	windows-vista
this issue occurs on windows-vista windows 7 and windows-server 2008

1871158
value	field
this will updates every row in the table setting the field1 value to value plus the value of that row s id field

1871203
delta	diff
the author appears to have thought about the complexities of representing diff for nested elements in a standardized way his dul - delta updates language specifications

1871219
versioning	upgrade
the binary code generator by vc6 stl vector and string is i believe different from the code generator by more recent versioning of vc because of the many stl upgrade

1871221
subtract	time
this gives you a non-changing date to subtract from now to get the time the program has been install

1871247
javascript	dom
first an abstract beginner s question in this broad kind of situation by which i mean that you want your javascript code to run a bunch of operations on the information you retrieve from the webserver would you use the dom as a data structure

1871247
javascript	dom
e.g. find me table rows describing an event with date column 2010-01-01 and event types column private party . or would you keep the same information in a traditional javascript data structure search filtering operate on that using plain javascript code and then updates the dom accordingly to display the results to the user

1871254
value	field
you will have to add a member variables for the value of new field _otherfieldvalue and a public function setmemberfield value

1871257
execution	jobs
i thought that creating and scheduling multiple jobs would actually cause multiple worker threads to be created execution the jobs in parallels unless there was an ischedulingrule conflict

1871276
javascript	dom
one benefit of storing is javascript is that if you have lost of object eg 10 000 and only rendering a small fractions of them the browser will perform a lot better if you re not creating 10 000 numbers of dom elements per object elements

1871280
splitter	panels
you can change that size by shrinking the size of the console on the right hand side their is a horizontal splitter bar between the scripting and console panels just click and drag on it

1871284
value	field
if not an instances it s one of the blank extra rows in the inline and .so it goes through the hidden form field of the inline that store the implicit relation back to the main page and grabs the id value from that

1871293
contains	elements
if all the data for an elements s event is contains in the elements an event operating solely on a table cell for example then storing in the dom makes sense

1871295
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
however if these are not an option then you might bridge web developmet gap with some new stuff like jquery instead of plain javascript and asp.net-mvc in lieu of tradition asp.net webforms programming and try to use some vendor controls like telerik or infragistics to get started hopefully you will find transitions lot smoother but still i have doubts if web programming can keep you involved in long term given your background

1871300
display	height
the row height is baked into the cell .when they are first display

1871301
jqtransform	jquery
yes i would also recommend using jquery a very nice plugins is the jqtransform plugins

1871309
put	get
.so if i understand correctly you want the data encrypted .when you put it into the database and decrypted .when you get it out again

1871319
put	get
everytime someone goes into my website i want to put a dictionary into beanstalk and then every night i want a scripting that will get all the jobs and stick them in the database

1871326
mouseover	mouseout
the first part with mouseover works fine but the mouseout doesn t get a response

1871342
order	add
the rationale is that your code will break if you ever add a field to the table or change their order

1871343
value	field
just use null as your first value the autoincrement field will still work as expected

1871362
outlook-object-model	attachment
if most of the work is spent doing things that don t touch the outlook-object-model you ll probably see a significant improvement spinning off a separate worker thread or thread pool to process the attachment you ve saved

1871363
.doc	xls
couldn t you could export your spreadsheet as a xls and then upload it as a new .doc with a slightly different named specifying the new named in the xml metadata

1871372
contains	elements
i want to checked whether big list list contains all elements of sublist l

1871379
data-members	private
in c++ a non-static member function has direct access to a private static data-members defined in the same class

1871393
data-members	instances
here s a hint recall that a non-static data-members refers to a data-members of a particular instances of your class

1871397
data-members	instances
remember that static data-members or functions are defined and allocated once not per instances and hence can be accessed by non-static functions just as you would access global-variables etc

1871404
web-config	app-config
you have to move merge configuration of the referenced wcf service from app-config of your wcf service libs to the website s web-config

1871412
data-members	instances
again since static data-members does not belong to any particular object it can be accessed by all instances of the class

1871438
any	set
avoid any scrolling or paging -- except to a completely different set of informational screens

1871444
configuration	environment
applications consult environment variables and or user configuration which can be different for different users or different sessions for the one user to determine which timezone to report the time in

1871451
directory	folder
then goto c++ - general - additional include directory fill it up with path you get from opencv installation folder

1871452
quirks-mode	doctype
checked your doctype validation your html sometimes browsers don t see stuff in quirks-mode or .when they encouter malformed html

1871466
required	checked
checked to see if messages are required maybe there is some imbalance in parameters

1871474
put	get
i m trying to put caption on a collections of photos and i m getting the caption to work it appears on the image but i can t get the gravity parameter to work correctly

1871477
bitwise-and	xor
off the top of my head i cannot think of a single language i ve used that had a logical xor operators but all have logical and bitwise-and and or operatorss

1871477
boolean	int	bitwise-xor	xor
the rea.son it came to my attention that most languages lack this is that i needed it i was using ruby .so i wrote a methods to convert an int to a boolean and then use bitwise-xor which on boolean acts like logical xor

1871486
bitwise-xor	xor
as to it being useless because it can t be short-circuiting in many strongly typed languages you can t use the bitwise-xor to compare boolean without casting back and forth in which case even a non-short circuiting logical xor would make sense to have

1871508
constructor	object
the long answer is that although snippet a introduces a new scoping on each anonymous-function invocation since it is not being used in a constructor context it s this variables simply points to the global windows object

1871510
constructor	object
in the snippet b you are using the new-operator and the functions are execute as constructor functions the this keyword refers to a newly created object

1871514
security	owasp
open web application security project owasp - sql-injection examples

1871515
webserver	upload
i d like my .app to upload an image to a webserver

1871524
json	csv
i have a json file that i want to covert to a csv file

1871527
data-members	private
for that matter they have access to private non-static data-members too

1871527
data-members	private
the reason non-static member-functions have direct access to private static data-members is firstly that the code is in a member of the class hence it can access private data-members

1871529
primitive	int
my only theory as to why enums can t be used like that is that enums are not an int types in and of themselves and thus the compiler would have to do multiple implicit-conversion to get to an int primitive from foo

1871531
updating	updates
now i want my application to updates itself by downloading and running the new versioning of install in quiet mode but after updating done it won t launchd again

1871536
for-loop	arrays
is there a way to eliminate the for-loop and somehow do element-by-element calculations between the two arrays

1871546
ellipse	line
after drawing a line rect ellipse i want to click onto a shape and move it with mousemove event

1871568
dictionary	arrays	data-structures	dictionary
javascripton can represent a wide variety of data-structures -- a javascript object is roughly like a python dictionary with string key a javascript arrays roughly like a python list and you can nest them as long as the final leaf elements are numbers or strings

1871570
double	int
considering the basic data types like char int float double etc..in any standards language c++ java etc

1871583
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
for almost anything you re doing this has almost no effect but purely for informational purposes it is usually fastest to work with data types whose size is machine words size 32-bit on x86 and 64bit on amd64

1871592
selected	checkbox
beside each item they can click a checkbox to selected it and then at the bottom is a selected box which says with selecteded items... and things like delete move to project downloading etc

1871592
postdata	request
basically i just want an action which will delegation to a different controllers action as if that were the original request maintaining postdata rendering that view etc

1871600
selected	button
double click on the .xib file now selected the button and click

1871600
selected	button
on tools- identity inspector there it will indicate the class is inherited from uibarbuttonitem below selected the image option for button

1871635
json	xml
how much extra work would it be to go through and generator all of your data a second time in a different format as xml or json

1871635
javascript	dom
.so to answer your question directly as it is phrased should you al.so keep your data in a javascript data structure or just in the dom you did mention this was a simple ajax web .app

1871640
.when	ready
7 .when ready to send to prof i would zip the original libcurl source along with the instructions above and any other you used to get your project to work

1871647
keyboard	mouse
if it is false it will stay open until a mouse or keyboard event occurs outside of the pop-up control which may be the case while alt-tabing

1871648
multiplication	division
in reality some processor do some int operations especially multiplication and division by converting the operands to floating-point doing the operation in floating-point then converting the result back to an int

1871651
difference	factors
however some processor only have 32-bit simd instructions powerpc and gpu hardware has a factors of eight performance difference between float and double

1871656
mouseover	mouseout
if the .infowindowanchor is too low the infowindow itself could steal the mouseover causing a mouseout on the marker

1871688
g++	gcc
- gcc g++ in my school machine

1871695
primitive	boolean
however if you are creating large arrays of a primitive types it is worth knowing that java uses compact representations for arrays of boolean byte and short

1871699
ncurses	x11
it should be possible to install most things like ncurses or even x11 in user spaces in your home-directory if you install them from source

1871700
arrays	map
basically each map is an arrays with each item in the arrays being a square on the grid

1871713
irrlicht	ogre
my favourites are irrlicht and ogre

1871713
irrlicht	ogre
you can find a step by step tutorial that show you how to get started with irrlicht here and with ogre here

1871734
value	field
note in the specific case that you mentioned you just need a field in the user database that holds the value of the primary key in the customer database for which the user has access

1871735
rendering	redraw
browsers are not required to redraw the page once it s been rendering according to the css specifications

1871742
ubuntu	linux
if it has to be in linux and you re a windows mac user you can install ubuntu or some other linux-distro on a virtual-machine and get a full featured environment

1871765
constructor	object
this means that the evenodd constructor will recursively generator anonymous evenodd temporary object up to the templates parameter 10 before any evenodd object construct a printing object

1871839
python	java
i am a python and java developer with about 1.5 years of coding experience and i am looking for a fun but challenging project to engage myself in

1871863
javascript	dom
even though javascript is type-less the value of a dom object is going to default as a string

1871870
javascript	dom
you have to break the link between the dom elements and the javascript function to ensure that both are cleaned up

1871871
xsd	xml
in the past xsd has done a pretty good job of getting a starter schema file generator from a xml file

1871876
python	java
as somebody with reasonably good experience in both python and java why don t you help further bridge the two by investigating which such project fall within your abilities and interests pick one of them and develop a jython ports of it

1871880
python	java
not knowing your interests or skills i can t tell you write such and such application using these java and python technologies.

1871892
value	field
value_types is a simple lookup table to provide named for value field

1871892
value	field
dataset_value_types is used defined which checked have which types of value field this is the many-to-many relationship between check_datasets table and value_types

1871892
value	field
the drawback to this design is that you still have mixed datatypes in the one field value

1871923
exponential-distribution	poisson
the standards for randomized arrival time for performance model is either exponential-distribution or poisson distribution which is just the distribution of multiple exponential-distributions added together

1871963
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql is a much better solution if possible

1871964
autocomplete	autosuggest
does google ajax search api provides api for autocomplete autosuggest feature in ruby-on-rails application

1871966
mobile-browser	opera
i seen lots of phone which has opera mobile-browser .so please try to make compatible with opera too

1871994
business-objects	data-access
base classes for all business-objects busines object collections data-access classes and my custom-attributes and utilities as extension methods generics validation framework

1871994
business-objects	data-access
application.dataaccess returns or takes business-objects as part of any data-access operation

1871994
attributes	properties
each business object is marked with an attributes mapping to target table in database and properties within the business object are marked with attributess mapping to target coloumn in respective data-base table

1872003
windows	ms-dos
.so since roughly 1988 one of my standards alias and batch-file for ms-dos windows is up

1872007
bash	zsh
this function is for bash but something similar could be done for others this may work as-is in ksh and zsh

1872024
.when	ready
.when it s ready user-interface controllers gets a sync notification request data updatess list and refreshes screens ...except screens doesn t updates - until user scrolls the screens

1872024
instances	self
at least self didn t work unrecognized-selector sent to instances at 0x14036f0

1872084
difference	factors
however on older hardware and a lot of embedded systemd the difference in all of these factors can still be really really big

1872094
numeric	digits
how to display a numeric numbers in 3 digits grouping

1872120
put	get
even if they succeed and i can put and get data the data does not show in the datastore view

1872153
subclassing	inherited
the substitution principles is what makes inherited interface implementation powerful not the fact that you can reuse code by subclassing

1872169
required	checked
delete required a checked of all child tables fk columns

1872176
put	get
if we are using php then i can get the url and put it in the header location . url

1872185
constructor	private
singleton often use private constructor

1872192
memset	calloc
as others have already suggested you probably want memset or calloc

1872202
wicket	spring
after adding a restful service using cxf to my spring and wicket project i get the following exception-handling

1872210
hash	md5
a really simple way of doing this is compiling a list of the pc s relevant hardware into a string and then running an md5 hash over it

1872215
any	set	git-branch	git-rebase
is there any way to set up things .so that if i run git-svn git-rebase or git-svn dcommit on a git-branch other than master it will simply do nothing

1872221
calloc	malloc
if you want to allocate a new block of memory and have it be all zero right away then use calloc instead of malloc

1872243
selected	button
i have an button in page once user click that button again if user selected any item eg item1 is selected before click on the button

1872296
factors	primes
i think the program tries to find the biggest primes factors of y

1872296
factors	primes
if y is a primes factors it printing this as well

1872310
factors	primes
the program printing at least one factors of an int y or if it has no factorss other than itself and 1 printing that y is primes

1872310
factors	primes
an even better solution is to start with the square root of y - if y is not primes one of its factors will be less than or equals to its square root.

1872310
factors	primes
.so either a factors is found or it s primes

1872326
order	add
you need to either add them to the view controllers s view in the opposite order add webview then add custom uiview or call

1872329
tuples	sorted
while it is possible to retrieve a sorted list or tuples from a dictionary i wonder if it is possible to make a dictionary store the items in the order they are passed to it in the previous example this would mean having the internal order as and no different

1872332
division	modulo
x y 2 #x the division or modulo of y 2

1872332
division	modulo
while x 1 #you want to checked if this is a division result or a modulo

1872335
put	get
you have a couple of options i suppose the best would be to put the current page as an that way you ll get it in your form submission as a variables and you can redirect back to that page from your scripting by putting a location header in your response or by other means such as a link and a http-refresh meta tag on your confirmation page or whatever you re doing

1872336
constructor	object
even in the case we use statically allocated memory buffering for object creation constructor is called

1872341
contains	elements
an even better solution would be to use clone_ptr for all the elements contains in std vector as well as for std vector itself

1872348
svnadmin	dump
but you can convert the whole history then use svnadmin dump and svnadmin load to discard part of the repository after the conversion

1872348
revision	svn
where r is the svn revision numbers of the first revision you would like to retain

1872354
factors	primes
for any numbers x which is not primes there would be a factors greater than 1 and less than x 2

1872364
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
all it s working ok on internet-explorer and google-chrome but on firefox is something strange

1872401
scrollbar	popup
i first tried adjusting the width of the last column to exactly fill the entire view but then the horizontal scrollbar popup

1872401
margins	padding
calculate last column width as difference between actualwidth and sum of widths of other columns taking into account the margins padding

1872405
schematron	relaxng
in addition you also get support for schematron and relaxng

1872424
google-chrome	firefox
we recommend using google-chrome downloading here or mozilla firefox downloading here

1872425
pseudo-class	anchor
basically you need to use the hover pseudo-class on the anchor tag

1872425
contains	elements	contains	set
.so using css for the off state you set the elements that contains the dropdown to display none and then on the hover you set it to display block

1872431
put	get
i think i am going to have to create the following classes to get my desired result but wanted to put it to the community to see if its the correct way to go an if anybody else has done anything similar

1872451
hash	md5
7 create session userid a hash session variables using md5

1872451
hash	md5
_session hash md5 username.secret

1872474
python	c++
first of all i ve never worked with python before - but i ll tell you how i did this in c++

1872484
nswindow	nsbutton
i have a nswindow contains an nsbutton and an nstableview

1872484
selected	button
i d like the button to be enabled if and only if the table contains at least one item and exactly one item is selected

1872487
contains	elements
it is somewhat less efficient though as it traversal the entire sequences even .when that sequences contains a non-zero elements

1872500
i2c	spi
the exact module is probability also not important as long as it got some types of serial interface i2c spi to interface to the avr and some source code show how to use the module

1872515
solaris	linux
it works on the linux platform but failed on solaris where it complains

1872516
updating	updates
updating the user giving them reward is a one-time insert updates and shouldn t effect performance that much

1872552
versioning	upgrade
these location will convert .when they go to windows 7 perhaps or because the application they use internally is upgrade and needs the newer browser versioning

1872558
attributes	properties
therefore i have created elements as object see below which have public properties as there attributes

1872559
vertex-buffer	vbo
it s an unfortunate fact the the first generator of iphone 3g doesn t have proper support for vertex-buffer object vbo they are exposed by the api but they work in exactly the same way as ordinary software vertex-buffers

1872634
itextsharp	pdfbox	itextsharp	pdfsharp	pdfsharp	pdfbox
i recently downloading pdf libs pdfbox pdfsharp itextsharp and i am trying to figure out can i parsing corrupt pdf files with in asp.net

1872636
credentials	security	sniffing	packets
the only security risk here are passwd being sent in-the-clear without a tls ssl connection to encrypt it allowing for packets sniffing to see the credentials

1872640
order	add
also i want to add date headers that will display messages in the order in which they are received

1872655
debugging	exit
as there are grouping of threads doing different tasks i wish to tracking down the thread that did not exit correctly .so as to debugging the program

1872672
pointers	stack
.so that .when static_cast is done it blindly casts to the wrong types not the same types as the actual object and you get an invalid pointers that is later passed down the call stack and causes undefined behavior crash the program

1872714
boost	stl
extra credit will be given for bearing in mind that boost is out and we re restrict to the stl implementation in visual-c++ 2008

incidentally i have noticed if mustmatch is set to true the value in the field doesn t automatically clear

1872856
sql-server	oracle
i want microsoft sql-server queries corresponding to the following oracle queries

1872860
required	checked
however i think that on many compilers most downcasting especially .when single inherited is involved don t result in a pointers adjustment .so i could imagine that a compiler might have a bug such that it wouldn t make the special checked for null that would be required to avoid converting a zero value null-pointers to .some non-zero value senseless pointers

1872878
hide	show
im using jquery for various things on my site but one thing im not sure how to do is have it show an elements then wait x seconds and hide the elements

1872889
contains	elements
alternatively you could use groovy s object.every closure closure methods and checked if each elements of the sublist is contains in the list

1872929
google-chrome	firefox
everything is ok in google-chrome firefox and ie8

1872933
contains	any

1872949
arrays	map
i m making a game and i have stored the map data in a 2-dimensional arrays of size 34 10

1872949
arrays	map
originally i generator the map using a simple function to fill up the arrays and saved this data to a file using the following code

1872967
display	height	display	width
i have another working page with a fancybox on which is fine but on this page the fancybox iframe seems to display using the incorrect height width and below the form on the page

1872969
constructor	private	constructor	object	instances	private
everyone knows how to implements it you declare the constructor private you keep a single global instances of the object as a static properties and add a public methods to retrieve it

1873031
functional-programming	imperative
learn the difference between statically-typed languages and duct-type languages functional-programming languages imperative programming languages whatever

1873035
python	java
if you re looking into a new desktop-development-language then i d recommend java or python both of which you d ease into with your c# and vb.net experience

1873046
haskell	lisp	haskell	erlang	erlang	lisp
the usual suspects would be ruby erlang haskell lisp

1873048
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
once you past that play with some dynamic-languages like perl ruby python php etc

1873050
queue	fifo
i would consider a synced fifo queue as a seperate class singleton for all your produced object - the producers enqueues the object and the consumers dequeue - thus the actual object do not required any synchronized anymore

1873057
silverlight	wpf
client silverlight 3 wpf

1873076
database-table	mysql
i also have a mysql database-table called warlord

1873082
directory	folder
currently i am in my installing directory say c program file my installer.i have to execute a demo.bat file that is stored at some other location say c program files temp example.bat which i have to go at that location and execute coz my example.bat has some support files that are only stored in temp folder

1873100
configuration	environment
the deployment scripting could write appropriate connection parameters to your configuration file depending on which environment is being deployed to

1873102
lookup	any
i d definitely recommend jgroups which is pretty nice and very actively worked on and supports any types of discovery ip multicast fixed list external lookup service etc over any transport

1873112
application-pool	was
.when i emailed them about this their response was that the os iis would handle this and use other cores as necessary even though the application-pool only has a single worker process

1873127
keyevent	onkeyup
in an activity you should implements onkeyup int keycode keyevent event and checked

1873149
web.py	django
there are a few howto pages for pyjs with django web.py etc.

1873155
scala	java
i m using some java code to do fast prefix lookup using java.util.treeset could i be using scala s treeset instead

1873163
entity-framework	massive
entity-framework in its v.1 only received massive critics

1873183
implements	extends
implements and extends are different

1873197
enumerator	any
are there any issues i may be missing using fast-enumeration with the enumerator below

1873199
stored-procedures	ado.net
if you later see that some areas of the application are to slow you can analyze these parts and in some cases even swap some linq queries with stored-procedures or ado.net

1873199
stored-procedures	ado.net
â in my opinion debugging linq2sql is much easier than both stored-procedures and ado.net

1873215
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
it works just fine in ie8 google-chrome and opera but firefox refuses to show anything

1873220
gstreamer	vlc
it seems if you want to use vlc you need to write or find i do not know if one exists a gstreamer codec as explain on the videolan wiki

1873232
constructor	object
.so your program doesn t work because you explicit defined a constructor and therefore your object violates the non-trivial constructor restrictions

1873233
virtual-functions	member-functions
a union can have member-functions including constructor and destructor but not virtual-functions

1873233
constructor	object	copy-constructor	constructor
an object of a class with a non-trivial constructor a non-trivial copy-constructor a non-trivial destructor or a non-trivial copy assignment-operator cannot be a member of a union nor can an arrays of such object

1873233
constructor	private
moreover pod class must be an aggregate meaning it has no user-declared constructor no private nor protected non-static data no base and no virtual-functions

1873240
instances	destroy
this is because the compiler has no means of telling which constructor or destructor to use .when a union instances is created or destroy

1873243
deployment	install
targeting .net 2.0 would make the application more widely portable in that it would just work on machines which only have .net 2.0 install - but i don t know what the proportions look like for 2.0 vs 3.5 deployment and more importantly they may well not be the same as the proportions for deployment out of your target audience

1873270
scala	java
as i understand it the scala treeset is backed by the java treeset but using the scala variant would allow you to shorten up the code using a sequences comprehension giving you an implementation that looked something like for scala 2.7

1873292
declarative	imperative
attributes are declarative not imperative

1873300
any	set
but .when you set up any kind of social whatzit site the question is not if it will be abused but .when

1873322
account	api
if you are looking an easy way to programmatically manage adwords account and you are using .net platform you should take a look at gembox.ppc adwords api for .net

1873326
accumulate	aggregate
if you want a pure query without side-effects then you ll need to create some sort of accumulate extension methods and use that instead of aggregate

1873327
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m looking for the most reliable way to use both windows and form based auth in asp.net-asp.net-mvc 2 i know how to do it in webforms but because i cannot adjust the permissions in iis on a per file basis in asp.net-mvc

1873334
32-bit	64bit
however i would like a methods for simply recieving how many bytes are actually left before the systemd will start using the virtual-memory especially as the application will be compiled for both 32-bit and 64bit whereas the 2 gb limit doesnt exist

1873336
financial	banking
visual-c++ is the ultimate programming tool which is still widely used in most of the core banking and financial product developed by software companies

1873339

a scripting-language like ruby or perl

1873410
haskell	ocaml
a pure-functionalal language like haskell or ocaml

1873422
32-bit	16-bit
due to storage width 32-bit and 16-bit converting int32 to int16 may imply a loss of information if your int32 is greater than 32767

1873441
mouseover	mouseout
and finally the mouseover and mouseout functions should be set to if you don t want the css to be overwrite

1873464
selected	checkbox
by selected one or all of these checkbox i what to add a new datagrid row

1873471
stderr	stdout
i found 2 1 necessary on my systemd since the output seems to go to stderr rather than stdout

1873476
tablerow	layout
it sounds like as if the webpage layout is table based and the closest tr somehow returned the body s first tablerow wherein the entire content is placed

1873479
any	set
this reduced feature set of top n terms for each document can now form the basis for performing your duplicates selection for example if there are more than x common terms between any document again x calculated through backtesting

1873536
display	height
i need this to checked for the height of all images of the .pic class it already does this and then add a display none to those who have a certain size

1873536
display	width
if an img has under 100px width it should not be display

1873544
.net	wcf
wpf wcf wf are actually .net 3.0 but for clarity it s fair enough to grouping them along with 3.5

1873544
silverlight	wpf
some people recommend learning silverlight before full wpf because it is actually a subset of wpf

1873544
asp.net-mvc	webforms
a key points is that asp.net-mvc is not replacing webforms but an alternative

1873608
python	c++	python	java
we were using it for c++ and python development not java

1873609
design-time	designer
we take into account the users that are not satisfied with the default microsoft designer and ship entity developer - a powerful design-time tool - with our product

1873617
braces	macros
it macros changes the fonts and the braces changes it back

1873624
installation	building
they can be quite convenient because there is a command-line tool called drush that automates the building of installation profiling

1873630
reserved-words	keyword
keyword is a reserved-words which

1873632
internet-explorer	opera	internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
firebug is an extension for firefox but what happens .when you need to test your pages in internet-explorer opera and safari

1873639
buffering	streaming
the important fact here is that testsink.write is only called .when the streaming is ffflush std endl or std fflush or .when the internal buffering of the streaming_buffering instances is full the default buffering size cannot hold 40000 chars .so i initializer it to 50000

1873663
json	xml
is there any way to allow search engines to list json or xml ajax data

1873676
firefox	safari
i append a select-element to a dom-node and fill it dynamically which works good in firefox and safari

1873709
json	xml
i don t think there is a way to directly allow web-crawler to index xml and json

1873709
json	xml
first make all of the json and xml available in html form-for users who don t use javascript

1873709
json	xml
you might do this by serving html xml and json from a single url using content-negotiation or you might have seperate urls

1873774
attributes	properties
put data-members attributes on a field not the properties

1873791
any	set
you might be able to find a converter for a well-constrained set of makefile but a converter for any arbitrary makefile would be tricky

1873795
triggers	insert
in your triggers you can insert the log

1873796
administration	account
i need to run one console application from asp.net application using administration account and with desktop integration enabled

1873796
administration	account
any ideas how to run console under administration account

1873799
authentication	login
first i connect to a database server using simple sql-server authentication with login john

1873812
shell	bash	bash	zsh
this should run in most posix-ish shell i tested with dash 956b4bdâ from git ksh â œ1993-12-28 pâ from mac os x 10.4 bash 2.05b and 4.0.35 zsh 4.3.10-dev-1

1873812
shell	bash	bash	zsh
if you wanted to tie yourself to a particular shell you might be able to use job control and a trap on sigchld instead of double fork and probing with kill -0 ksh and zsh seem capable of this dash and bash seem broken for this

1873838
solaris	linux
haven t tried it on linux yet but one platform i ve worked on is sun s solaris 9 10 operating systemd

1873841
any	set
but in sl3.0 i dont find any size properties in uielement to set the new size

1873842
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
the i after the end of the pattern is a modifiers it means be case-insensitive .when matching this since the default is case-sensitive

1873845
error-logging	logging
if you are using this for error-logging and you program crash before flushing your streaming then you logging is a bit useless isn t it

1873859
contains	any
it will recreate a new class from the xml schema definition but that schema doesn t contains any of the .net specific things like visibility or access-modifiers - it s just a xml schema after all

1873862
credentials	account
if this doesn t work for you then you could try passing in admin account credentials in the processstartinfo properties

1873863
c++	lua
i have c++ java 1.4 and i have also compiled the lua for this environment

1873868
localization	translation
if i wrote a price calculation module that had a product option indicating that discounts should be multiplied together how could the localization process know whether to translation the words as an item to be bought or an arithmetical operation

1873888
administration	account
if the task is on a predictable scheduling just add it to the schedulingd-tasks in windows set the appropriate workentity-relationship account administration or whateventity-relationship and let entity-relationship go

1873893
python	perl
you could hack a prototype in some thing like perl python or other scripting language and show off how easy and fast it can be done

1873901
csv	xml
there will be a response format defined in the uri format xml or format csv

1873914
versioning	migrate
this happens only than i have changes in the core datamodel and need to migrate to a new versioning

1873915
simulator	platform
i made two versioning of my libs to fit different platform as device and simulator

1873916
contextclassloader	urlclassloader
by the time i set the urlclassloader the class hasn t been initializer .so i guess the contextclassloader does not load that class

1873918
dialog	pop-up
you can configure how annoying each of its alert are through the options dialog or directly though the pop-up menu for that alert

1873918
downgrade	upgrade
you can downgrade things like the variables suggestion .so they re less prominent or you can upgrade things like the use extension methods alert .so it show up as an actual error

1873926
primitive	int
the jvm will most likely even optimize the methods call away inlining the compari.son that takes place inside the methods .so this call is not much more expensive than using on two primitive int value

1873936
required	checked
this required that you can checked the results of the operation from a different webserver thread or process which can be quite a bit more difficult to achieve in the server-side code

1873979
checkbox	button
by click on a button you should change all checkbox in the column to true

1873979
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
.when i press the button everything seems ok all checkbox are true but .when i press updates everything is updatess except the row that was selected during btnpublishall_click

1873980
text-editor	editor
prepare the text in your sql editor text-editor or whatever

1874010
.net	wcf
on the server end i have more control and can write a .net 3.5 wcf service if i choose

1874010
.net	wcf
my question is if i put this data-layer behind a wcf service can i access this from a .net 2.0 gui .app on the client

1874010
.net	wcf
i ve not used wcf much other than a few prototype apps on my dev machine connecting to a windows 2003 server which has .net 3.5 sp1 .so i am looking for advice

1874014
authentication	login
barring a better suggestion i would take a look at how they handle access to a restrict page if not authentication then redirect to login if not authentication then redirect to error otherwise display page

1874020
.net	wcf
if the wcf service exposes a basichttpbinding endpoint then .net 2.0 or any other code that uses soap should be able to consume it with no problems

1874030
debian	linux
if it matters this is in gvim on debian gnu linux vim versioning 7.2p284

1874031
lighttpd	apache
i prefer apache 2.2 however lighttpd can also be deployed if it offers a feature for the implementation

1874093
any	set
-they can handle any character in the unicode character set while the byte streaming are limited to iso-latin-1 8bit bytes

1874093
buffering	streaming
-they use buffering techniques internally and are therefore potentially much more efficient than byte streaming

1874114
order	add	lookup	any
now you can lookup the value for each directions in the arrays and add any character you like in any order

1874138
hide	show
this way you should be able to call jquery methods with it val attr show hide serialization

1874146
32-bit	16-bit
the underlying problem though is that you re trying to convert a 32-bit int into a 16-bit int which is.

1874146
32-bit	16-bit
converting from 16-bit to 32-bit is allowed because it s lossless converting from 32-bit to 16-bit is undefined

1874146
32-bit	16-bit
also the fact that this value might fit into a uint16 is coincidental adding two 32-bit int and trying to cram them into a 16-bit int short would frequently cause an overflow and thus i would say this is an inherently dangerous operation

1874160
urlclassloader	classpath
you could try to setup a launchd in the startup of your application that creates an urlclassloader passing it the location on the classpath and your own .class location and start the application from that classloader

1874174
canvas	scale
from a semantic points of view the canvas is potentially an invisible block containers .so anything you draw in the canvas can hint at a non-rectangular view if you scale the containers correctly

1874175
groovy	java
you can use gsps in any java webapp you don t need to be using groovy grails

1874196
average	median

i am creating a web application which required threading and i am trying to figure out which langauge between php and ruby has better threading functionality and better performance

1874198
selected	button
to add a linked file in visual-studio right click the project hit add- existing file then in the selected file dialog hit the little drop down arrow next to the add button and pick add as link

1874199
javascript	dom
non-jquery javascript - if you have parts of your code that still use document.getelementbyid like if you have some legacy javascript or are referencing a third-party libs that s not a jquery plugins for some reason then these will be dom object and need to be wrapped

1874207
contains	set
which contains the possible arbitrary numbers as set flags 0001 1 0100 4 0101 5 1000 8 1001 9 1100 12 1101 13

1874222
hide	show
i have a table which uses the jquery hide and show to manipulate the standards view

1874222
hide	show
i have just realised that i was setting my class of hideme in my xslt which the hide and show functions in my jquery were using

1874222
hide	show
then .when i do the sort it needs to know what the new order is for .when it does the hide show

1874228
binaries	install
i d just install svnserve a standalone subversion server from the binaries at collabnet

1874258
groovy	java
or go with groovy which is basically java with lots of rubyisms.

1874270
selected	button
these will allow the button to have a different text labels color and font-size .when the button is selected

1874270
selected	button
the approach i ve taken is to extends button add two new styless and then overrides the selected setter and then use setstyles on the original color styles to change fonts color to selectedcolor if button is selected or color if button is de-selected

1874270
actionscript	mxml
also i need to be able to get styles updates .when set via mxml actionscript setstyles methods or through css both statically and dynamically

1874279
value	field
the value field is in the format dd mm yyyy and using str_to_date i convert it to yyyy-mm-dd

1874280
webserver	upload
i have a web-based upload page built using flash that post upload to a php scripting running on an apache webserver in amazon-ec2 cloud

1874319
right-to-left	hebrew
in hebrew right-to-left mode would be the typical result for a paragraph your text would be more like this

1874327
contains	elements
this will create a new poi1 at each pass .so that the each elements of the actors arrays will have a corresponding poi1 instances contains its data

1874334
ubuntu	linux
reproducible on ubuntu 9.04 and scientific linux 5.3 20 and 32 bytes respectively

1874340
contains	any
is there any downside at all to just accepting everything that contains an with something in front and behind it

1874342
web-config	app-config
i know of web-config and app-config but how much do people really deviate from this simple naming templates

1874371
highlight	cell
one way to do it is to write your own cell class and implements the appropriate drawing and highlight methods that you ll find in the nscell documentation

1874385
compact-framework	.net
the application is being developed using .net compact-framework 3.5 c#

1874394
click	mouse
i want to capture mouse click on a textbox

1874394
click	mouse
now i only receive a mouse click event .when the user first enters the textbox

1874394
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
after this textbox has keyboard focus i do not receive mouse click event anymore

1874398
groovy	java
i m not aware of any java package that gives you quite that amount of date support joda falls short a bit but comes close but in groovy using timecategory gives you very ruby on rails-like date support

1874407
click	mouse
for example in testing if users can figure out how to get a desired sort order .when the user click on a non-functioning control for sorting the table you can say â œokay doing that will get you this â and you take the mouse and selected a bookmark that show the table in the new sort order

1874420
mousedown	mouseup
bubbling mouseup and mousedown

1874426
widget	button	hide	show
i tried replacing the widget with a widget placeholder and swapping the button and placeholder hide show calling placeholder- resize button- size but the layout manager don t respect the resize and the placeholder is set with its minimum size

1874438
put	get
i get these on separate request but the code-editing here put them all together

1874438
directory	folder
i got the latest versioning of the restful-authentication plugins with git and then deleted the old restful-authentication folder under vender pluginss in my ruby-on-rails .app and copy-paste over that directory from the latest clone from git

1874439
exception-handling	try-catch
save try-catch for exception-handling truly unexpected events

1874447
contains	elements
because in your program you actually try to apply mapcar to a list contains two elements the symbols p1 and the symbols p2

1874452
primitive	int
i generally would use the primitive int but if i had to use int i would stick with equals

1874460
exception-handling	try-catch
usually having try-catch blocks adds essentially no overhead to your code for the normals case but .when the exception-handling is triggers it s quite expensive

1874516
standard-library	boost
my understanding of that answer is that modern c++ doesn t need much use of pointers because most data-structures you d use already come built-in either boost or the standard-library

1874541
istream	std
you ll normally attach an std istream to the buffering .so other code reads from it about the same way as they would user-input from the keyboard or whatever

1874609
nsurlconnection	nsurlcache
the docs we need are in nsurlcache not nsurlconnection they state

1874615
active-directory	adam
you could try adam active-directory application mode which will install and run on xp and vista not sure about 7

1874644
deep-copy	object
if and only if you actually have a pointers and allocate the spaces yourself do you need to write a copy ctor to do a deep-copy allocate spaces in the new object and copy the data pointed to by the pointers

1874654
linux	unix
bit of a late addition however the time uility available on any linux unix may be a lighter weight way of achieving what you want

1874655
widget	button
you could try putting the button to hide inside another widget and try to make the other widget keep its size properly .when the button is hidden

deep-copy	object	copy-constructor	deep-copy
if you wanted a deep-copy a copy would duplicates the arrays s contents and not just the object then you need a copy-constructor

1874688
copy-constructor	deep-copy
this internally works the same as the bar case and the vector can be resize but the vector templates takes care of the deep-copy for you .so you don t need a copy-constructor

continue with the rest of the elements hint use a loops in the arrays and then create a new string with the result

1875365
compression	streaming
i do not know about lzma specifically but from what i know of compression in general it looks like you are writing a compressed bit streaming to a file without any header information that would let a decompression program know how the bit streaming is compressed

1875376
temporary	copy
it is very rare in oracle to even need temporary tables-- it is far more common in other databases where readers can block writer to need to copy data out of tables before working on it

1875379
google-chrome	safari
this does not work in safari google-chrome but since both support access-control it s fine

1875384

postback	ajax
i do know that if you re looking for ajax postback page load hooks try the client-side pagerequestmanager

1875428
base-class	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	base-class
you can t that s the whole points of inherited the subclassing must offer all methods and properties of the base-class

1875437
base-class	inherited
it is my opinion that you should only inherited a base-class if you re implements all of the functionality of that base-class

1875437
base-class	inherited
your class a should be your base-class and your current base-class should inherited from a if that s what you want not the other way around

1875437
attributes	properties
if you re attempting to obsolete the properties and it s declare in the base-class as virtual then you could either use the obsolete attributes on it

1875437
attributes	properties
edit as brian pointed out in the comments the second parameter of the attributes will cause a compiler error if someone references the named properties thus they won t be able to use it even though you ve implements it in derived class.

1875448
python	c++
i have experience of using wxwidgets in both c++ and python and would recommend wxformbuilder as a gui designer

i am trying to compare the value of the checked field with the value of the current radio-button but the checked field value is returning an int rather than the expected string from the radio-button s value attributes

1875473
arrays	loops
you could use something like explode to put the list of stuff into an arrays then loops through that

1875498
selected	textbox
i have a gui where the user selected the index from a combobox and then several textbox need to have their text updates with the value in the list

1875501

use ip-address instead of hostname

1875514
.when	ready
i can think of very horrible ways to get over the problem like have a scripting block at the bottom of the page being rendering loaded into a div which does all things i would do .when ready is fired as you can assume the browser has rendering the page already if the scripting block is hit

1875551
bmp	png
gdi+ will load png and jpg in addition to bmp

1875574
callback	methods
the load methods offers a callback which is execute after the content has been loaded

1875575
arguments	default
you could use a closure over a local variables instead of passing i as a default arguments

1875590
directory	folder
it is giving me an error since it is looking only in the views directory and not in the areas folder

1875605
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
actually only webkit safari google-chrome iphone android has a pretty good support of it and firefox 3.6 supports most of it too

1875679
append	input
.so with each new row that is added i need to append an increment named to each new input that is generator starting at ordertype5 and maxing out at ordertype10

1875690
order	add
if you change the order of the controls .when you add them to the page it won t find the right control to hook up the event to because the id s will be different

1875697
digits	base
is desired. namely instead of working with individual digits implements multiplication in base 100000

1875697
multiplication	addition
adding up the digits of a numbers doesn t mesh well with addition and multiplication with carries

1875702
attributes	properties
while technically the properties won t be hidden one way to strongly discourage its use is to put attributes on it like these

1875707
keyboard	mouse
appropriate and useful alt text for images designing with colors that provide adequate contrast accommodating colorblindness use of table descriptions make the the site navigable by keyboard no mouse correct descriptions on form field etc.

1875709

i have seen several examples of using an authentication attributes on the poco s properties

1875787
radio-button	selected	radio-button	textbox	selected	textbox
i have noticed a common scenario in user-interface development both web and fat client where there is a grouping of radio-buttons and click on a radio-button means you want to selected a certain set of other controls for simplicity s sake let s say they re all textbox

1875787
textbox	button
just to illustrate the asterisk represent radio button and the underscore.js represent textbox

1875787
radio-button	selected	radio-button	textbox	selected	textbox
each radio-button should selected the set of textbox on the same line

1875787
radio	click
whenever the user click a radio

1875787
textbox	button
button all the value in textbox

1875787
radio-button	selected	radio-button	textbox	selected	textbox
whenever the user starts typing into a textbox the radio-button controlling it should be automatically selected which also implies wiping out other textbox value as above

1875801
processor	affinity
you can sometimes achieve this with utilizing processor affinity on linux systemd

1875809
hide	show
place all form controls in one form and use javascript to show hide active tab

is it possible to automatically assign a specified layout templates to a particular controllers and all of the resources nested within it as specified in routes.rb

1875851
directory	folder
inside of this phpstuff directory is a folder i18n

1875851
any	set
the only workaround i can come up with is manually reading the include-path splitting by the separator checked if any of the directory are named gettext and then grab the absolute-path of the first directory found and set it

1875868
expression	brackets
the brackets are used for very basic regular expression

1875886
arrays	loops
what i want to do is get the arrays of elements which have the normals class and loops through them and add event listener

1875920
superclass	inherited
if all classes named their constructor identically __construct in theory a constructor could be inherited from a superclass without any required definition

1875937
double-quotes	single-quotes
with double-quotes variables starting with are replace by their value but this doesn t happen with single-quotes

1875942
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
overrides viewdidappear not viewwillappear

1875960

as you probably know .when inheriting from abstract-class such as the roleprovider class all abstract members of that class must be implements

1875982
markup	xhtml
i have a psd design file for fixed width site which i m converting to accessible cross browser xhtml markup

1875992
boost-mpl	bjam
the . bjam pick the right switches and boost-mpl seems to work well with the sun compiler present

1876001
arrays	loops
or you can use jquery.each to loops through them say if you need to add them to an arrays or something like this

1876009
inlining	inline
leave inline out until you measure the code performance and determine that you could gain some performance by inlining a specific function that the compiler chose to treat as normals

1876012
postdata	request
.when a request contains session information stored in a cookies or in the postdata or encode in a url the sid contains a reference to the specific server instances in which the session was originally established called the primary server and a reference to an additional server where the original session is replicated called the secondary server

1876012
postdata	request
therefore if you store the sid in the postdata the plugins cannot route the request to the correct primary or secondary server resulting in possible loss of session data

1876020
groovy	java
groovy and java are interoperable

1876020
groovy	java
take a look at the documentation for mixed java and groovy applications

1876041
debian	linux
on debian linux it is located on etc mysql my.cnf

1876044
textbox	button
also if you need it you can restyle combo box such that it will look like a textbox remove button and pop-up list

1876054
bullet	physx
you could use an external libs like nvidia physx or bullet which would let you set up callback for .when collision occur

1876055
priority-queue	queue
and of course if you have access to almost any other data structure list arrays priority-queue double ended queue etc. you can easily implements a stack yourself

1876061
groovy	java
groovy compiles down to actual java class files in memory not on disk .when you use a scripting

1876079
subclassing	base-class
the subclassing is not yet construct .when the base-class constructor is called and therefore accessing members on the subclassing gives you a null reference

1876080
python	java
the biggest downside is that clojure is a lisp derivative significantly different from java python and probably any other languages your customer may know

1876084
sql-server	postgresql
another case where these join make sense is in databases that offer geospatial features like sql-server 2008 or postgresql with postgis

1876091
uitableview	uiview
how can i replicate the functionality of the button in uiview with that of the uitableview

1876098
ubuntu	debian
the default locate program on debian ubuntu these days is mlocate

1876122
stderr	stdout
the main problem with this is that the stdout stderr capturing is per-run sudo invocation and not per-task

1876122
contains	any
it contains a single decorator mock_streams which is capable of wrapping a function any function in any python code -- it s not fabric specific as i mentioned and redirecting sys.stdout and or sys.stderr for capture examination

1876146
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
i m giving emacs a try for the first time and i was wondering if anyone has recommended strategy for connecting to databases i regularly work with mysql oracle and sql-server

1876167
value	field
struct field - value lookup are reasonably fast

1876197
getter	setter
getter and setter is far different

1876197
getter	setter
with the somewhat recent ability to have empty getter and setter what is the benefit of using them instead of just declaring a public member variables

1876214
getter	setter
one thing you can do with properties that you can t do with field is limit visibility for either setter or getter

1876218
javascript	dom
.so even scrambling the e-email in .some way in the html .source and then using a javascript function to de-scramble dynamically on page rendering this will be defeated by a robot which al.so does full rendering of the dom

1876227
decompression	on-the-fly
if your webserver and client support the gzip encoding then you can deal with uncompressed files on the server but have them compressed decompression on-the-fly by the webserver web client respectively

1876233
attributes	properties
you can flag properties with attributes that aren t available on members

1876233
attributes	properties
admittedly there isn t anything technically preventing these attributes from being used on members but nonetheless they only work on properties

1876236
dictionary	arrays
in c# you could use a dictionary of string int arrays

1876255
binary-search-tree	nodes
i would like to calculate the summation of the depths of each nodes of a binary-search-tree

1876269
google-chrome	safari
there is no css for only google-chrome afaik but google-chrome and safari

1876281
children	nodes
each nodes knows that the depth of it s children are it s own depth plus one .so .when you get the depth of the left and right children of a nodes you tell them their depth is the current nodes s depth plus 1

1876281
children	nodes
.so if you want the sum of the depth of all the root nodes s children you pass in the root nodes and the root nodes s depth like .so sumdepthofallchildren root 0

1876292
formpanel	gridpanel
upon activation of a tab i want to call a methods which then instanstiates a new formpanel gridpanel and put this content into the tab

subtraction	addition
some problems required oodles of math and some required only addition and subtraction

1876521
dialog	pop-up
this needs to be the exact location within your project i would use the find file dialog that you can pop-up .when editing a src attributes in visual-studio .so that it automatically links to the file

1876524
children	tree
once you have this devide by the numbers of children in the tree to get the average depth

1876528
dictionary	map
you could use a std vector or a map or a dictionary or some other kind of data structure for the entity table of course but our requirements have typically been for constants memory caching coherency and absolute maximal performance since handle_t get gets called thousands of time per frame

1876549
python	ruby
i find this scary and ruby runs slower than python .so i m not actually urging you to switching to ruby

1876551
inlining	inline
also most compilers are very bad at inlining functions from different compilation units -- if you defined foo in file a.c but call it in b.c odds are pretty slim that it will intelligently inline b.c s call to foo

1876555
updating	updates
if your client web application is responsible for updating the db then without anything else in your client code quitting in the middle of an asynchronous operation would mean that the db was not updates

1876564
parallels	sysadmin
some sysadmin support-type people at reputable national computing centering have even suggested that we simply recode our 20 year-old o 10 4 line code to use mpi because of issues we ran into while porting the code to a particular supercomputer in which the router queing environment didn t like launchd multiple parallels executable alongside pvm

1876574
arrays	loops
think about using an arrays combs with n int then loops will tick up the last item in the arrays

1876585
factors	numeric
in the current implementation of melt there is only one assumption that melt makes all measured value must be of the same types numeric factors date

1876605

sql-server 2008 created new login and gave it sql authentication mode

1876660
firefox	safari
unlike asp.net 1.1 the browsercaps in asp.net 2.0 do recognise firefox safari etc .so the general output shouldn t be that difirefoxerent to what you see in ie

1876669
variables	boolean
suppose i have a boolean variables within a pl sql block in an oracle form

1876671
oracle	mysql
those kinds of predictions are hard enough under standards conditional but there s a lot of extra uncertainty of mysql s fate due to the unresolved oracle acquisition

1876676
selected	button
.when you do a text-based search in eclipse using the flashlight button at the top of the screens and selected the right tab there s a replace... button at the bottom of the dialog

1876713
buildpath	libs
then in project properties go to java buildpath libs add libs server runtime selected the server in question

1876742
value	field
.when i try to save a new recording through burrow s genericdao i get an exception-handling that boils down to field xxx does not accept null value where field xxx is a not null field that is not being mapped at all because it is unimportant and is to be left blank

1876742
value	field
it still tries to automatically insert nulls into field missing from the insert field1 field2 ... value

1876759
awk	ksh
as already mentioned this problem is probably best solved using bc awk ksh or another scripting-language

1876761
radians	sin
for example sin 2 has a valid value for 2 degrees and 2 radians

1876762
value	field
for example if i have 10 recording all contains string as part of the field value .something string .something stringlookhere .something string etcetera is there a way to change string to anothervalue for each row via one query .so that the result is .something anothervalue .something anothervaluelookhere .something string etcetera is there a way to change anothervalue

1876763
put	get
some are even incapable of performing operations sometimes even load operations on unsuitably-aligned data - inorder to work on such data it has to be loaded into two registers and then a series of bit shifts and masks need to be performed to get a usable value and then it needs to be put back

1876767
jquery-slider	easyslider
i m trying to create a filterable portfolio using a jquery-slider using easyslider and code i have adapted from various tutorials

1876791
conditional	parentheses
i never know what the precedence is and i always use parentheses in conditional expression

1876810
groovy	java
in last few months i have been making a transitions from java to groovy and i can appreciate many of the benefits it brings less code closures builder mop that in the end makes framework like grails possible ease with mocking .when writing tests etc

1876823
double	int
.so that means char wchar_t explicit-sized int int32 float and double and c-style arrays of them

1876831
extends	super
this doesn t directly answer your question but could you extends screens api here instead of manager and then call super mdelegate in your constructor

1876843
controllers	routes
i recently changed some urls in my ruby-on-rails .app and am curious if i m better off using routes + controllers + redirect_to to forwarding the old urls or just use .htaccess with apache s mod_rewrite

1876856
required	checked
i don t think that this is git specific git will just use the current grouping and umask for checked out files .so if you want your working tree to be a specific grouping an writable by that grouping you should either use newgrp to login to the required grouping or recursively set the grouping and setgid bit on the working tree and ensure that your umask excludes the grouping writable bit 0002

1876875
access-control	authentication
zend-framework provides both asp.net-mvc and authentication access-control

1876876
httpd.conf	.htaccess
if you re really concerned about performance and you manage your own webserver you could building the rewrite rules and whatever else you have in your .htaccess into the httpd.conf file and disable overrides disabling your .htaccess files

1876900
triggers	insert
in the first place insert can have multiple recording and .so a triggers to properly do this would have to account for that making it rather tricky to write

1876900
triggers	insert	value	field
it would have to be an instead of triggers which is also tricky as you wouldn t have one of the required value i assume your id field is required in the initial insert

1876901
.when	ready
.when ever you ar ready to refactor rewrite the whole mess

1876904
glassfish	weblogic
.net cf sun glassfish bea weblogic

pkcs#12	pfx
a pfx file is one way of storing the private-key - it uses the pkcs#12 standards

1876914
handler	service
i resolved this by now making all service handler in the domain layer ixxxservicehandler which gives me this

1876943
contains	any	pointers	stack
they re allocated on stack or directly in the memory spaces of any larger variables that contains them instead of through a pointers and automatically cleaned up by the compiler .when they go out of scoping

1876970
multiplication	polynomials
if you are talking about the multiplication of polynomials the karatsuba algorithm is rather easy to implements and quite fast for that size

1876993
linux	bsd
i haven t dug through the sources of linux bsd darwin whatever os implements sendfile to know why this specific syscall is restrict to writing to sockets specifically streaming sockets

1876993
file-descriptor	pipe
what is limiting sendfile from allowing the destination file-descriptor to be something besides a socket like a disk file or a pipe

1877000
execution	exit
random addition to temporary disable the flag and return to the default of continuing execution regardless of exit codes just use

1877007
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 3.5.5 google-chrome 3.0.195.33 ie8

1877012
code-coverage	build-process
one thing i have found to be helpful is to include code-coverage validation as part of the build-process

1877027
maven-release-plugin	release
the maven-release-plugin properly pushes the release tag to the origin repository as well as the next commit that bumps the versioning to the next snapshot

1877030
derived-class	base-class
it actually means that destructor of a base-class are not members of a derived-class

1877030
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
my counter-question is why do you believe that the facts that 1 you cannot call a destructor directly 2 destructor in an inherited chaining are called automatically upon collections and 3 base-class destructor are called even if the derived-class does not defined a constructor have any bearing whatsoever on the question of whether or not a destructor of a base-class is a member of a derived-class

1877030
derived-class	base-class
regardless of any of that the fact that destructor in a base-class are not members of a derived-class has nothing whatsoever to do with how finalization is implements by the clr garbage collector

1877030
derived-class	base-class
a more germane fact is that a base-class with a public parameterless constructor does have that constructor invoked .when a derived-class which lacks a public parameterless constructor is construct with its default-constructor

1877030
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
the derived-class does not inherited the base-class s public parameterless constructor but it is called nevertheless

1877030
derived-class	base-class
but regardless of the choice of implementation details destructor in a base-class are not members of a derived-class

1877044
triggers	insert
you could use an oracle-style sequences describe here calling it either via a triggers or from your application providing the resulting value to your insert routine

1877044
triggers	insert
triggers this means that all insert

1877058
exception-handling	try-catch
yes you can wrap the whole thing in try-catch and catch every exception-handling that any part of the chaining can throw

1877072
required	checked
also the same precision is required to analyse if a specifications is sufficient to checked a piece of code if it covers all possible cases etc

1877078
radio-button	textbox
within the cell are of each table are asp.net field textbox and radio-button lists

1877078
radio-button	checkbox	radio-button	textbox	checkbox	textbox
the gridview control is writeable and has the following columns checkbox radio-button list textbox textbox textbox and a checkbox list

1877078
radio-button	checkbox
if i click on one of checkbox radio-button list or checkbox list. then press tab the cursor pops out of the grid and sets focus on the first field of the table outside the grid

1877086
optgroup	selected
cake s formhelper input methods will rendering a selected tag with optgroup if the options are correct

1877094
groovy	java
the code i write has to be maintained by people with out much dynamic-programming experience .so i keep it close to normals java code unless there s a good rea.son to use an advanced groovy feature

1877098
32-bit	64bit
.so should i scraper this 64bit os and go back to good-old 32-bit or am i missing .something obvious

1877133
implements	abstract
since it s abstract the class implementser must implements the properties

1877156
implements	abstract
it just creates an abstract properties kind of like an interface methods declaration which has to be implements by any non-abstract inheriting class

1877157
parsing	comma
this is kinda hackish i feel and i m not sure i m totally satisfied with it as the answer but it puts a comma separated list in my hidden-field that i can parsing to service_subtype_ids again on submit

1877160
arrays	loops
as an alternative i can just loops through the datarow arrays and do it that way and set the styles by doing this lstbox.items.add new listitem .attributes.cssstyles.add htmltextwriterstyles.fontweight bold

1877162
rollback	commit
one possibility is to create sp2 with an error-code int output parameter which indicates whether the caller needs to rollback or commit

1877184
row	col
one would be to pass the row and col to the listener and locate your visualobject use uppercase first letter btw based on those parameters

1877191
default-value	default
.when i run the report i do see that one of the options is selected all. but i m wondering - is there a way i can get this selected all option as the default-value .so that by default all cities are selecteded

1877194
exception-handling	try-catch
inside a try-catch statment and see what the exception-handling is

1877217
triggers	insert
alternative approach use a database insert triggers on calendarevent that propagates the entry to customcalendarevent

1877225
object-reference	instances
as of now the tests don t even hit the actionresult methods because of the authentication filtering exception-handling throw is system.nullreferenceexception-handling object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1877230
selected	checkbox
to make your solution directory writable right-click on the solution directory selected properties and uncheck the readonly checkbox in the dialog that opens

1877255
factors	primes
i am trying to write a program to find the largest primes factors of a very large numbers and have tried several methods with varying success

1877255
factors	primes
it divides currentnum repeatedly by the smallest divisible numbers most often 2 or 3 until currentnum itself is primes there is no divisible primess less than the squareroot of currentnum and assumes this is the largest primes factors of the original input

1877261
httpd.conf	.htaccess
if you want the sessions to stay alive for longer set that setting in php-ini httpd.conf or .htaccess

1877262
datagridview	databound	selected	button
here s an example showing a databound datagridview and a couple of button pulling out data for the selected row

1877274
factorization	primes
this will always work because of the unique primes factorization theorem

1877277
groovy	java
is it possible to use the granite ds groovy templates to inspect annotations on a java class and use that to generator the code binding

1877281
stderr	stdout
only replacing find with findvalue gives just the value on stdout but also error messages on stderr

1877287
parentheses	operators	parentheses	braces
okay .so normally you need braces around blocks but not if the block is only one statement long except of course if your statement would be ambiguous in a way that would be ruled by precedence rules not like you want if you omitted the braces -- in this case you could al.so imagine the use of parentheses but that would be inconsistent because it is a block after all -- this is of course dependent on the respective precedence of the involved operators

1877292
rollback	commit
try controlling the commit rollback with try blocks psuedocode

1877321
factors	primes
you are trying to find the primes factors of a numbers

1877328
redmine	trac
you might be interested in tools like viewsvn or the more sophisticated trac or redmine

1877339
specifications	w3c
according to w3c specifications

1877348
put	get
the other alternative i considered was using pagemethods to rendering the control and send the html back to the page to let the javascript put it in the appropriate place then deal with it but it won t let me rendering the control - i get an invalidoperationexception of page cannot be null

1877350
value	field
i have a query in which i am order a league table by a numbers of field to handle the situation that some field in the result may have the same value

1877350
value	field
it contans a total field which is a caching value of votes_up minus votes_down

1877350
value	field
is there any way to optimize this query .so that .when the total field value are all unique that the secondary order clauses are ignore and don t incur .so much overhead

1877353
mochiweb	yaws
the nitrogen project webpage declare equals support for yaws mochiweb and inets but with which of these webserver is it going to perform the best

1877360
enterprise	platform
platform note this needs to be workable on mac os x 10.5+ redhat enterprise linux 5 and possibly .solaris 10 .so a platform-specific .solution is undesirable

1877370
webserver	security
security is a consideration - you could restrict access to the linux webserver purely to the ip-address of the server hosting your asp.net site

1877376
selected	cell
for this reason retrieving information like the currently selected cell in a datagridview is trivial with winforms

1877376
selected	button
also in most cases with winforms you do not need specific button to edit or delete - you can edit directly in the grid and use in inbuilt delete functionality selected the row and press the delete key

1877381
python	java
python does that and is also rather more productive than java since there is a lot less lines-of-code required to explain your algorithms

1877381
python	java
you can leverage python to simplify java programming

1877381
python	java
if you have a java neural-network engine you can still write most of your program in python using the jython versioning which runs on the java viewmodel and allows you to use any java libs and classes in your code

1877386
solaris	linux
it s what we do - we have cruisecontrol.net on a windows box which performs remote building on linux and solaris via sshexec

1877397
spritebatch	xna
you can use your own custom pixels shader and there is a sample on the xna creator s club education site that show you how to use custom pixels shader effects with the spritebatch

1877413
ubuntu	linux
i have a perl scripting on a linux ubuntu 8.10 machine and i need to write data to a sql-server database

1877415
constructor	object
you need to use in the object htmlattributes parameter available in several of its constructor

1877460
libavcodec	ffmpeg
there are fast lossless codecs in ffmpeg s libavcodec if you want to do that instead of write pngs

1877464
32-bit	64bit
if your native c++ code use unsigned 32-bit int 64bit int as the underlying types if enums switching the base of your cli enum to uint32 long or ulong

1877479
puts	gets
note that an arrays of length 11 gets you only 10 a s since arrays.join puts the arguments between the arrays elements.

1877479
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
simon also points out that according to this jsperf it appears that it s faster in safari and google-chrome but not firefox to repeat a character multiple time by simply append using a for-loop although a bit less concise

1877503
groovy	scala
i believe it works fine with scala but i haven t had much luck using it with groovy

1877513
textarea	textbox
if you are talking about the onchange event on an html text or textarea elements it s after the value in a textbox has changed and the focus changes away from that elements

1877522
istream	std
this is probably a better solution std istream read

1877529
prolog	lisp
if you want to learn from the basic and just implements theoretical ai stuff go with a higher level language-- as in functional-programming and proven in ai like lisp or prolog

1877542
fogbugz	svn
i rely on fogbugz and check-in comments in svn

1877547
prolog	lisp
.when i studied ai mostly we worked with lisp and prolog but i ve been most productive in ai with java c# and f# has a lot to offer

1877552
eclipse-plugin	ant
i have an eclipse-plugin for which i create the osgi-bundle jars with ant

1877552
manifest.mf	ant
i would like to sign them with the ant task but that overwrite the manifest.mf contents with the class signature making the osgi bundles unusable

1877569
dfa	nfa
the normalize dfa for the nfa is using different collections of the states of nfa as dfa s states for example state0 - 1 - state1 state2 to remove the non-deterministic part there is no way to avoid the state explosion as dfa has to do that to represent the language

1877570
versioning	upgrade
it will al.so serve as a marker .so you can find the code you need to checked if ever you upgrade to the next versioning of the api

1877589
common-lisp	scheme
there are two big camps common-lisp and scheme

1877589
linux	unix
f# may be cool but i see a whole raft of issues getting it to run on linux or any other unix that s what i meant by windowsy and i don t want to work under windows that s what i meant by personal preferences

1877589
haskell	ocaml	haskell	lisp	ocaml	lisp
i have better reasons to recommend lisp over f# and even ocaml and haskell

1877589
prolog	lisp
the bulk of ai literature is based on programs written in lisp or prolog

1877589
haskell	ocaml	haskell	lisp	ocaml	lisp
in the tiobe index of programming language as seen and used in industry lisp takes 15th place while haskell takes 43rd and f# and ocaml place below 50th

1877602
cursor	row
i ve tried using cursor with a selected statement selected from table_name but this retrieves the entire table and feed it back to be one row at a time

1877605
sqlconnection	sqlclient
unfortunately afaik ef doesn t yet have true asynchronous execution .so you would have to re.sort to the sqlclient layer sqlconnection sqlcommand

1877609
testng	junit
what i do with my testng sorry junit doesn t support this test cases is i can assign a grouping to the test i want to run

1877616
png	gif
example you have a jpg gif png file you just import into your libs

1877662
textbox	button
suppose i want to make a small swf .app basically a couple of button textbox and event handler

1877666
callgrind	valgrind
for performance you can try callgrind a valgrind tool

1877703
json	xml
it would return json in this case or xml if it had the appropriate mime-types listed for example

1877704
any	set
run the test by clearing out the table of any old junk set the flag and execute the procedure

1877714
stdin	pipe
it is a pl sql thing and not something rman can deal with and not like unix pipe to stdin

1877714
stdin	pipe
the shell scripting would call rman and pipe the parameters to it through stdin

1877733
arrays	map	primitive	int
even if you copy from a primitive long arrays autoboxing will automatically create long and int object instances as wrapper for the primitive value .when you use them as map key and value

1877733
data-structures	map
in addition the map need additional object instances for each key-value pair to manage the internal data-structures

1877744
children	nodes
on a 32-bit machine each nodes is at least 24 32 bytes object header key-value two children and flags for balancing

1877775
double	int
recording are not almost like classes in the same way that int are not almost like double

1877824
put	get
get a backup of the live database and put it on our dev environment

1877837
widget	button
i made a button widget in jquery which display an icons

1877847
contains	any
one of the primary reasons for using a structure like a b-tree or any one of several similar structures is that the top level of the tree contains the index tends to stay in memory because most paging algorithms use lru and you only eat a disk access .when you touch a leaf page

1877862
scrollbar	widget
if you can use tix there is the scrolledwindows widget which has a windows frame and one or two scrollbar widget

1877869
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup have to go in pairs or else the key won t be registered but if you hold down control while sending for example keydown p it will activate ie s printing function

1877869
keydown	keyup
for all the letters and digits you can send 0 for keydown and the correct letter for keyup

1877879
reserved-words	keyword
.when naming my classes variables and methods i strive to avoid collision with reserved-words or keyword in my languages mssql vb.net or c# html css jquery and framework .net

1877884
arrays	loops
just use a loops make sure the two arrays are of same length

1877889
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
postgresql implements a special function generate_series to do that while oracle and sql-server can use recursion connect by and recursive cte s accordingly

1877893
cellular-network	gps
the iphone uses a technology called a-gps the a stands for assisted whereby the the cellular-network and wifi networks assist the gps chip in determining your location

1877920
fopen	fread
i ve tried fopen fread file_get_contents libcurl and none of those work

1877926
defined	declare
you have the error global named namedd is not defined because you have declare namedd within def entoles and is only seen within this scoping

1877934
selected	button
i would like to know which item is selected and which button was click

1877935
updating	updates
for those who hit this locking issue due to tortoisesvn- updates i m currently experimenting with a pre-updates hook which deletes the offending file s before updating they will be restored if no updates is needed .so far this seems to work which is weird but i haven t tested it thoroughly enough to say for sure

1877949
icollection	ienumerable
i can t create a system.windows.controls.selecteditemcollection because of its protection level and param won t cast to ilist icollection or ienumerable

1877957
append	input
in plain english this code says if an input elements is click updates the value of div2 with the input variables id and append the selected value from the list to the result

1877957
jquery	.post
if you need an easy elegant way to solve this with ajax use the jquery libs s ajax and .post methods

1877963
ref	out
if i use out or ref on the pdev_list arguments my application crash

1877967
32-bit	16-bit
correction words is 16-bit dwords is 32-bit

1877967
32-bit	16-bit	short	zero
to split this 32-bit int you would have two additional field starting again at the offset of 0 zero then the second field 2 more bytes off because a 16-bit short int is 2 bytes a-peice

1877986
executable	upx
if the actual executable content of the binaries is changing as is done with tools like upx you re going to be out of luck unless you enjoy debugging complex applications in assembly

1877987
core-graphics	quartz-core
for my understanding core-graphics is just a framework package which contains quartz-core and quartz-2d

1877987
core-animation	quartz-core
.when looking at the documentation i see quartz-core is listing up all the core-animation stuff only

1877987
core-animation	quartz-core
.so quartz-core core-animation

1878001
python	c++
how do i do the following python pseudocode in c++

1878008
constructor	object
.so the object declare in a foreach loops is null because it doesn t call any constructor in my employee class

1878017
header-only	boost
like most boost libs string algorithm lexical cast are header-only there s nothing to link in

arrays	loops
i suspect that your problem is that the arrays isn t full and that once your loops runs out of employees it throw a nullreferenceexception

1878031
arrays	loops
.so the variables that you specify in the foreach loops gets it s value from each item in the arrays

1878031
arrays	loops
note that the foreach loops iterates all items in the arrays

1878031
arrays	loops
if you have declare a larger arrays than there are items in the file you should only loops through the items that are populate

1878053
google-chrome	firefox
the search function provided with modern browsers firefox and google-chrome anyway have two big problems they only search visible items on the page and they can t search non-consecutive words

1878053
unique	words
4500 unique words in the document

1878058
postorder	inorder
inorder pre-order and postorder

1878117
any	set
i mean i can set the fonts to fixed width etc. but are their any gadgets designed for it

1878152
children	nodes
what you can do is recurse into the children re-creating the xml elements and text nodes as html ones

1878152
callback	methods	any	set
doing it with dom methods allows you to forget nasty document.write and set the content at any time later in the load process which also means you could make that xml document loading asynchronous with a callback to fill in the board instead of the browser-pausing synchronous loader you ve got at the moment

1878152
google-chrome	safari
in any case document.load as used in your current loadxmldoc is not a standards xml dom methods and won t work on webkit google-chrome safari ...

1878186
ole-automation	com
i wonder why use the turbopower components instead of just using the com ole-automation interfaces for ms office

1878186
ole-automation	com
it s .so easy to do ole-automation com interfaces using variants and not bothering about types libs import or activex controls

1878188
hosts-file	hosts
you have to set up mpich s hosts-file and give it a way to start jobs on other hosts

1878225
ubuntu	linux
the scripting should be able to run on majority of linux flavors eg centos redhat ubuntu

1878230
jqmodal	jquery	modal-dialog	jqmodal
i am using the jqmodal jquery plugins for display content dynamically via ajax in a modal-dialog

1878247
directory	folder
if the directory has no folder add all the files to a list

1878248
filtering	sorting
sorting and filtering and in general integration with a dataset feels best .when there are no delay waiting for a server to redraw the pages and send them over the network

1878263
nhibernate	ado.net
it appears that in my stack-trace nhibernate is attempting to send an invalid numbers of parameters to the ado.net class for the insert operation

1878268
web2py	django
now that i ve gotten relatively familiar with web2py i d like to give django a go

1878270
default-value	default
is there a way i can get this selected all option as the default-value .so that by default all cities are selecteded

1878270
radio-button	selected
then you selected the radio-button under the static value one can t remember not at work to checked atm - you ll have to selected the dataset the sproc is associated with then the column that the value comes from

1878285
value	field
is there an easier way to display the struct field and their corresponding value in richedit control

1878299
for-loop	loops
my problem is that i am using a for-loop and .when loops runs it seems that loops runs to completion .so if there are 10 pieces of data to process all ten runs simultaneously.

1878313
void	main
public void main string.

1878346
system.data	.net
the system.data assembly is referenced in both the project and the versioning denotes .net 2.0

1878385
triggers	insert
triggers can be used to generator the recording versioning numbers .so you don t have to worry about generator the numbers .when insert

1878391
arrays	loops	arrays	map
probably what you ll need to do is to loops through all the annotations on the map removing them then loops through your data arrays adding the annotations back again

1878391
arrays	loops	arrays	map
you could be more clever about it and loops through the data arrays checked if there s already a pin with the same latitude-longitude on the map but that way gets more complicated

1878411
promise	future
where x is now of types future and i can force or defer future and promise arbitrarily

1878412
double	int	primitive	int
if you were to invent a new language do you think primitive datatypes should be capitalize like int float double string to be consistent with standards class naming-conventions

1878428
contains	any
it acts like a central registry for common code or like the vb.net module construct - it should contains code that s not specific to any class otherwise it should have been attached to the relevant class

1878442
solaris	linux
we ve managed to use the tool in a windows linux and solaris environment with absolutely no bugs

1878456
defined	declare
you could however defined an interface and declare extension methods for that interface

1878460
scheme	let
scheme also known as plt scheme will let you step backwards and forwarding in a scheme program

1878478
positioning	slider
this will fix the nav issue from tucking in under the javascript slider â however it will screw up the look of the rest of the top section because they are absolutely positioning the logo and some other images

1878480
command-line	cmd
to create the root user seeing as mysql is local all execute the following from the command-line start run cmd without quotes

1878499
authentication	login
those kinds of restrictions are best applied on the server in the login authentication process

1878510
stdin	pipe
i don t know if it comes as a libs form but the executable essentially operates like one you pipe all your information and data to it on stdin

1878511
execution	restart
gdb does with reverse execution and checkpoint restart

1878523
any	set
however if you set the building action for any file in the project to copy always or copy if newer the project will copy that file to the output folder

1878524
version-control	git
git - version-control

1878536
constructor	object
just before a reference to the newly created object is returned as the result the indicated constructor is process to initializer the new object using the following procedure

1878536
constructor	object
if this constructor is for a class other than object then this constructor will begin with an explicit or implicit invocation of a superclass constructor using super

1878536
value	field
in some early implementation the compiler incorrectly omitted the code to initializer a field if the field initializerr expression was a constants expression whose value was equals to the default initialization value for its type.

1878536
constructor	object
whatever happens in object constructor

1878540
freebsd	linux
i m not sure if either of these is a good example but you could always look at the source code for the linux and freebsd ip stack

1878541
sinatra	ramaze
not something you want to use in a long-running process like a web daemons sinatra ramaze etc.

1878556
hide	show
i know how to hide and show them it is just hide and show

1878572
protected	public
for an out-of-browser application the best solution i have found is to derive a very simple custom class from hyperlinkbutton and implements a public methods that in turn invokes the protected onclientclick methods as show below

1878591
webforms	asp.net
iâ m trying to get a handle on the exact process that occurs .when a user post data back to the server from an asp.net webforms

1878601
active-directory	adam
i might look at ldap active-directory adam user mode active-directory

1878616
background-color	transparency
you need to make a transparency uiview background-color alpha of 0 and then in its drawrect draw your circle using core-graphics call

1878631
any	set
however you should always start a session or set a cookies before generator any output.the error messages you are getting is because you are echoing out a block of html or string before starting a session session_start or setting a cookies setcookies

1878633
any	set
you can use the output buffering functions to delay the scripting output until you have decided whether or not to set any cookies or send any headers.

1878669
data-access	nhibernate
i agree with the other answers that advise using a third-party data-access or or m component like linq-to-sql nhibernate subsonic llblgen pro etc

1878680
.when	ready
.so i d like to generator the images in a thread pool and .when requested return the data if it s ready or wait until the data is ready and then return

1878689
macros	basic
you can use macros and vb scripting with access to help through a lot of the basic

1878694
groovy	java
they re much less useful in groovy than they are in java

1878695
inlining	inline
in general i would say not only is it possible that the compiler reordered things it is probable - ie for the code you have there is probably a reordering once inline and inlining is likely that is better than the order given by the c++ code

1878715
mochiweb	yaws
however with all of that said i believe the yaws and mochiweb are fairly similar in performance

1878730
perl	awk
this syntax in perl was inspired by awk s xxx pattern-matching feature

1878731
.when	ready
you can kick it up a notch by having yet another thread pool respond to the image request by accepting request in individual threads responding .when the image is ready

1878737
innodb	myisam
you need to enable it inorder to be able to convert your tables from myisam to innodb

1878750
input-field	textarea
i wanted to add menu item textarea max length of 140 chars 4-5 rows text input-field

1878750
put	get
btw i have got working class to put and get twitts on twitter and return its as a nsstring and it works

1878768
wlan	lan
you re probably listening on your lan wlan card instead of localhost

1878783
progress-bar	progress
in my c program downloading some files from the internet im using a gtk progress-bar to show the downloading progress

1878791
append	input
just append addpassclear passwd to any input elements that you want this functionality for

1878808
nhibernate	massive
if you have massive amounts of logs you could separate them by functional area this is what nhibernate does using log4net

1878813
constructor	object
i would typically pass the userid to the constructor of the user class and have this constructor create a local access role object

1878820
udp	tcp
a ports tcp udp etc

1878848
data-structures	trie
nobody s actually posted a trie here yet despite the fact that some people have posted sorted treemap data-structures that they have misnamed as tries

1878857
value	field
otherwise you might need to store the original value in hidden field in the view and use those

1878861
activerecord	datamapper
for example you can use a table data gateway row data gateway activerecord or datamapper

1878862
any	set
in fact if you set c m then a and b can be any matrix for which a r 0 and b l 0 and there are an infinite numbers of those

1878866
worksheet	excel
create excel object with workbook worksheet server side...and use memory streaming to write whole document to client side

1878886
contains	any
contains any extraneous characters

1878893
order	add
the winners won t arbitrarily change based on changing order in the file and if you want to change the the winner you have to change the declarations maybe add a #content in front of the .foo declaration .so it will have 111 points

1878896
fancybox	lightbox
if they click on it then bring up the full sized image in a lightbox fancybox

1878900
webforms	asp.net
running the asp.net webforms run the application works fine

1878907
difference	zero
taking into account that the difference between pi and -pi is not 2 pi but zero

1878912
click	mouse	trackpad	mouse
how to detection left or right click on statusbar icons and than make some action depending on which mouse button trackpad was click

1878925
directory	folder
you can shared local folder with the viewmodel which reduces the pain of switching back and forth once the viewmodel has python setup you can just hop in and and run the code direct from the directory on the mac you developed in

1878927
calloc	malloc
in fact as mentioned below you don t need to set the memory allocated to all-zeros .so you can replace calloc by malloc

1878927
calloc	malloc
be sure to whether you call calloc or malloc .

1878927
calloc	malloc
since you overwrite the memory allocated immediately and don t need it to be zero you can replace calloc call by a suitable call to malloc

1878935
google-chrome	firefox
while the jquery tools code seems to work well in google-chrome and firefox it is not working in ie 6 or 7 .

1878946
listitem	listbox
if not it seems like you could just use a listbox where the listitem is just your text + the image in a grid

1878946
listitem	listbox
.when you click the listitem then start a storyboard animation to make another listbox translation to the left

1878952
ms-access	mysql
will the sql queries i run in ms-access also work on mysql without any changes

1878953
publishing	enterprise
i am using sharepiont server 2007 enterprise with windows-server 2008 enterprise and i am using publishing portal templates

1878972
contains	any
your regular expression matches any string contains the following

1878997
google-chrome	firefox
it rendering the same way on firefox google-chrome and ie 8

1878997
margins	padding
i could fix this by changing the margins to padding for the p elements but then i would also have to do this with header elementss list elementss and any other elements i want to use at the start of a div

1878998
websphere	ibm
on a soa project we start to employ ibm websphere messages broker to orchestrate .net-based web-services

1879005
associations	model
but if there is an associations between user and tasks model then i would do what jordan has in his .post

1879007
emacs	vim
learn to use vim or emacs just for common knowledge

1879007
version-control	git
use version-control subversion and git are good choices

1879008
hide	show
.when the textfield receives focus it hide itself show the passwd field and sets the focus to the passwd field

1879038
margins	padding
setting a positive padding and a corresponding negative margins on the div elements seems to fix the issue though i know not why

1879040
contains	elements
if you float the divs they will contains the marginss of child elements and prevent margins collapsing

1879040
margins	padding
the marginss of the div and the p combine to form a single margins even though they are nested because they have adjoining marginss with no padding or border between them

1879061
variables	boolean
in java static and final boolean class variables can be used to do the same job

1879063
tokenize	parsing
all of these answers are wrong and will not work in all cases .so either use python parsing tokenize etc or just use this

1879095
order	add
also you might want to add an order_by to the queryset as you need it to be order by the types

1879113
python	java	web-applications	enterprise
i m trying to figure out whether python can be a suitable java alternative for enterprise web-applications

1879113
python	java
which are the ideal cases where you would prefer to use python instead of java

1879113
python	java
how would a typical python web application databases sessions concurrency perform as compared to a typical java application

1879113
python	java	spring	seam	spring	grails	grails	seam
how do specific python frameworks square up against java based frameworks spring seam grails etc.

1879113
python	java
for businesses switching from the java infrastructure to a python infrastructure

1879118
infinispan	terracotta
if your read write ratio is something like 90 for read and 10 for write then terracotta or infinispan with postgresql is a better fit

1879118
postgresql	mysql
you can use them with postgresql or mysql but you loose join

1879125
subclassing	base-class
i ended up implements idisposable on a base-class for my viewmodel with the dispose bool methods being declare virtual allowing subclassing the chance to clean up as well

1879126
interop	vsto
will based on my experience perform an order of magnitude faster than vsto interop and probably vba too

1879137
csc	vbc
this is a cute hack but with the csc and vbc both supporting the target module and addmodule options you could actually do this without ilmerge just by using a shell scripting or make file

1879139
python	java
an enterprise that already has a terabucks of java investments should add jython to their mix of technologies -- it can be adopted gradually and progressively at first for ancillary functions such as testing one-off data migrations c prototyping of new functionality cases in which using .some existing open .source python libs is obviously very handy and .so on and .so forth -- then as the many java developers in the company learn to use jython .some of the prototype will just be put in production as jython code because there would be no advantage recoding them .some old subsystem needing recoding will be recoded in jython and .so forth

1879163
selected	button
to make sure i m not storing the incorrect de-selected color value i now only store it .when the button is selected and i clear the storage .when the button is de-selected

1879172
ms-access	mysql
transform that is use for crosstab queries in ms-access cannot be used in mysql

1879180
httpwebrequest	webclient
i ve seen webclient and httpwebrequest and all that

1879191
realloc	malloc
malloc or realloc function or if

1879191
realloc	free
call to free or realloc the behavior

1879214
click	mouse
i am trying to have a circle appear on the screens then .when the user click inside the circle enable the ability for them to drag the circle where the mouse goes while it is being pressed

1879220
malloc	free
once you free a pointers that memory is available to be reallocated by another call to malloc

1879220
any	set
if you had set the pointers to null after free any attempt to read write through that pointers later would result in a segfault which is generally preferable to random memory-corruption

1879227
.war	jar
i ve found that what works best for us is to create the zip ear .war jar contents in explode form in the filesystems and then as the final step zip ear .war jar it up to a file

1879241
jquery	dojo
one of the reason of the above is that conventional frameworks like dojo or jquery work slowly or worse doesn t work at all

1879246
swing	awt
that is an old awt trick and should not be used with swing

1879246
click	mouse
then in you mouselistener code you can use the shape.contains ... methods to see if the mouse was click on the circle

1879249
python	java
i haven t used java yet but from what i have seen of it python is a much more expressive language and skilled python coders can get more work done in a day just because the language is that much better

1879263
vcard	mime
i have write permission to the directory i ve already added the mime types for vcard and restart the iis server however it still refuses to take it

1879269
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl	haskell	perl	haskell	python	haskell	lisp
it will be a very high level language like perl python ruby haskell lisp whatever is fashionable today

1879269
python	perl
variables should follow sane scoping rules like c and perl unlike python - flame .war starts here guys

1879269
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
if a language has a string types the language isn t c and the string types supports unicode the language isn t ruby - it s only a joke don t crucify me then the language already provides a way to convert unicode strings to and from lowercase like perl s lc function sometimes and python unicode.lower methods

1879269
interpreter	runtime
calling this function during an interpreter s compile-time rather than its runtime is simple

1879281
csc	vbc
this is a cute hack but with the csc and vbc both supporting the target module and addmodule options you could actually do this without ilmerge just by using a shell scripting or make file

1879291
click	mouse
what you need to do is save the coordinates of the mouse click and then move the circle based on the mouse s movement relative to the last points

1879292
linked-list	hashmap
iterator is faster for collections with no random-access treeset hashmap linked-list

1879296
authentication	login
long story short your users need to authentication .when the url is requested but it .sounds like you are trying to request the site server-side or through .some kind of redirect .so the server is returning the 401 error instead of returning a login prompt

1879340
gridview	listview
regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview

1879361
nested-loops	loops
one of the reasons i ve learned to stick with the for each is that it simplifies nested-loops especially over 2+ dimension loops

1879370
attributes	properties
something like innerhtml will not save properties of the dom only attributes

1879374
widget	button
some of these widget are button like b i etc some are text areas

1879377
any	set
for example if the pointsers is a member of a class and i ve deleted what it pointss to then the contract if you like of the class is that that member will points to .something valid at any time .so it must be set to null for that rea.son

1879377
any	set
a common pattern is to set all the member pointers to null in the constructor and have the destructor call delete on any pointers to data that your design says that class owns

1879377
any	set
clearly in this case you have to set the pointers to null .when you delete something to indicate that you don t own any data before

1879386
display	height	display	width
in the case of a pc display it should simply output normally with a the width x-axis being 1.6 time the height

1879392
margins	padding
maybe a 1px border and 3px of margins padding

1879399
linked-list	arrays
an arrays can be accessed efficiently through an index but a linked-list is best traversal by remembering the last elements accessed otherwise you get a shlemiel the painter

1879399
data-structures	tree
by providing a uniform interface from these and other data-structures you can also do tree traversal you get obvious correctness again

1879411
derived-class	base-class
this allows algorithms in the base-class to be replace in the derived-class even if users don t know about the derived-class

1879420
32-bit	16-bit
the color value you get back is scale up to 32-bit because for instances your picture is 16-bit and the color you are trying to write and read back again will not match exactly

1879430
defined	declare
the main function doesn t need to know the pointers is actually points to an object of class c it only needs to know that the available interface is at least that which is defined in class b which is why you declare it as if you needed functions specific to c you would have to do

1879449
where-clause	sql
in the second case the where predicates needs to be translatable to a sql where-clause since the filtering is done in the database

1879450
order	add	order	join
otherwise composition gets broken - if you add a join or an order etc afterwards it would become very hard indeed to do some of the process in sql and some on the client side mixing the two

1879457
malloc	free
only .when allocation memory dynamically eg with new or malloc in the case of c code do you need to explicit delete or free it

1879506
gnome	kde
in stead of going for kde and gnome desktops i want to design my small desktop environment for the device

1879521
entity-framework	nhibernate
if at all possible use a standards object relational mapper orm such as nhibernate linq-to-sql or the entity-framework

1879523
mochiweb	yaws
the major difference is that mochiweb is faster and nimbler while yaws handles more concurrent connections

1879533
implements	super
super starts the lookup of the following messages in the superclass where the implements methods is defined in

1879540
gridview	datalist
reperter datalist gridview

1879550
malloc	free
short accessing free pointerss can cause data corruption if malloc allocates memory in the same spot unless the free pointers is set to null

1879553
stdin	pipe
though in that case you could use a stubs program which writes its stdin to the named pipe

1879558
any	set
the problem i am facing is that the result set does not recognize any column named

1879561
connection-pooling	pool
the connection-pooling mechanism means that although you may close dispose your use of connections they remain in the pool for efficiency rea.sons for rapid re-use .so that may explain why you see .some oracle sessions still alive

1879590
directory	folder
if you install the plugins in the vendor folder all files in both tasks and .lib tasks directory are automatically loaded into your ruby-on-rails scoping by the following two line

1879606
silverlight	wpf
i couldn t even bind to the column width properties in the silverlight grid because it wasn t a dependency properties the wpf grid is most likely exactly the same

1879624
javascript	dom
move on to the javascript dom

1879630
scala	java
java seems to be a bit popular in ai too and .so you can use all those java libs from scala

1879641
binaries	install
i had install the odp.net on the production machine i deployed my binaries

1879664
32-bit	64bit
another problem i occasionally find that i need to convert a 32-bit int versioning of code to a 64bit one by adding l to all the numbers

1879670
ethernet	packets
so_bindtodevice controls which device a packets is sent out from if router cannot be used for this purpose for example if it s a raw ethernet frame

1879688
glassfish	weblogic
.so we are running a web application that has been tested on tomcat glassfish weblogic and websphere

1879695
getter	setter
setter getter and not to allow public access lest the jdo mechanism

1879695
getter	setter
a setter getter is merely

1879695
getter	setter
enhance my java code and insert extra stuffs into my setter getter

1879741
binary-tree	linked-list
.so a relaxation of rope a linked-list of line rather than a binary-tree is very common in the user-interface controls world but that s not often exposed to the developers and users of those controls

1879770
diffmerge	meld
neither of the visual diff tools meld diffuse diffmerge do what i want they don t work with patches they merely merge whole files

1879773
object-reference	instances
i am getting an error object-reference not set to an instances of an object which basically means that request.querystring doesn t exist

1879840
xsd	xml
.so generally i am looking for a reliable .solution to get the nodes types for any valid xml xsd

1879851
children	nodes
total numbers and identity of nodes that have 0 child 1 child 2 children 3 children

1879872
jquery	.post
.so far i am adding chat messages with jquery .post and this works fine

1879908
contains	any
i dont want all the client logic to be in some parent view as any view should be able to load another view by url subviews include a link to their related javascript file which contains all the logic to format hookup .when loaded

1879908
.when	ready
for example 1 .when the parent view is opened in a frame in ie the sub view readys are never triggers 2 .when opening the same url directly in ie the subviews readys are triggers 3 .when opening the same url in ffx2 the ready every are not triggers 4 finally

1879908
.when	ready
but .when opening a sub view which has subviews of this parent in ffx2 the child ready event are triggers

1879908
.when	ready
the ready event is triggers in ie but not ffx .when loading test2.htm into test1.htm

1879934
arguments	default
pass function as default arguments

1879941
scalability	azure
it will form a foundation for scalability service and as such azure will be part of the landscape

the problem is that i need both my wcf service to consume the list of user defined field .so that .when i load an object from my database those field and their value are loaded but al.so i need my wpf client to know about the field too .so that .when the user creates a new types of object those configurable field are available as input in the form of say a combo box

1881739
constructor	object
one good reason though to write a separate cleanup would be if you want to keep the object alive but not used for awhile maybe in an arrays or pool of object that you pull from occasionally .when you need a new one without wanting the constructor overhead

unfortunately typess as defined in an xml schema xsd or document types definition dtd are not directly tied to xml document they validation

1882157
xsd	xml
think of an xsd as a scripting that validation an xml document rather than a set of types annotations for elements and attributes

1882157
contains	elements
even document types definitions dtd which can be embedded inside xml document more about the structure of the document not the types of the data contains in elements and attributes

1882157
xsd	xml
since this validation optional the standards xml apis do not provide a way to bind the validation rules in an xsd to the actual attributes and elements

1882157

click	mouse
now use the mouse to click and drag the horizontal scrollbar to the right

1882331

1882821
checkbox	button
in your trac.ini then on the timeline page click the ticket updatess checkbox and the updates button

1882828
linkedhashmap	treemap
but if you control map implementation returned by the getmap then you can use linkedhashmap or treemap and get the same order of key value all the time you iterate through them

1882852
linkedhashmap	treemap
if you are looking at a specific class that implements map hashmap linkedhashmap treemap etc then you could see how it implements the keyset function to determine what the behavior would be by checked out the source you d have to really take a close look at the algorithm to see if the properties you are looking for is preserve that is consistent iterator order .when the map has not had any insert removals between iterator

1882886
linux	osx	linux	unix
i m primarily interested in windows at the moment but any insight related to unix linux osx is welcome as well

1883006
.when	ready
that code example is ready made for .when

1883024
put	get
in get mode the parameters are all put on the url as expected

1883041

the caveats here are that it s only an updates - .so you d have to create a value in the varbinary max field first then updates it

1883071
contains	lookup
we have a few huge databases 20gb+ which mostly contains static lookup data

1883074
textbox	button
- on click the + button we need to add another textbox just below the first one

1883074
textbox	button
.when he click the + button i ideally want to use javascript to create more textbox with similar markup as the first

1883092
value	field
to get field value you have to add to that loops to checked each part to see if it has the named of one of your field value and then retrieve the value

1883092
value	field
this is a pain to do in pure asp code .so many people use .some types of file upload component in which case the retrieval of field value will depend on the component

1883092
value	field
but the basic messages is whatever parsing of the form you re doing to retrieve the files you have to do the same thing to retrieve the field value

1883100
double-quotes	single-quotes
have you tried changing all your single-quotes to double-quotes

1883103

64bit	x86
is there a way to ensure the website runs as x86 .when hosted on a 64bit iis machine

1883124
32-bit	64bit
the website runs on a 64bit machine win server 2003 and i have just learned cannot load a 32-bit com object which i believe has been wrapped with a runtime callable wrapper

1883124
32-bit	64bit
because it cannot load this piece a web-config setting is set to avoid the runtime load error by bypassing the load of this 32-bit dll but all of the functionality of com dll is therefore lost .when the site is running on a 64bit machine

1883124
32-bit	64bit
.so in summary i presume the website on the 64bit machine must be running in iis as a 64bit .app and that if i could just get the site to run as 32-bit instead then it could load the com dll and therefore execute that functionality of the .application

1883135
firefox	safari
big fat however using grappelli s own tinymce works in both firefox and safari after adding safari into tinymce_config.js

binary	hex
instead of a random exception-handling and a binary hex memory-address you need to see a calling tree with the value of all parameters and local-variables from stack

1883147
logging	trace
trace logging in delphi applications often starts with me declaring a traceform form with a tmemo on there and the traceform.trace messages string-function starts out as memo1.lines.add messages

1883266
json	xml
you can choose from rendering html xml yaml or json

1883268
background-position	background-image
if the images are background-image s with custom background-position s that may be the issue

1883268
background-position	background-repeat
most png fix solutions don t handle background-position and background-repeat at all and many that do have difficulties with them

1883296
value	field
is it possible to extends the code .so that the initial value for the start_time field is the series default_time

1883333
buffering	streaming
to clarify output streaming are caching .so all the write goes into this memory buffering

1883341
filtering	sorting
and it actually is a viable option for paging sorting and filtering if and only if

1883341
filtering	sorting
for one thing database engines are highly optimized for doing exactly the kind of work that sorting and filtering entail

1883341
filtering	sorting
but even barring thatâ even assuming you could write code that could match the kind of sorting filtering and paging performance of a mature database engineâ itâ s still preferable to do this work in the database for the simple reason that itâ s more efficient to limit the amount of data that is transfer from the database to the application-server

1883348
dictionary	arrays
unlike arrays fast-enumeration on a dictionary returns only key not value

1883350
python	java
in addition python runs under java through jython and .net through ironpython

1883376
32-bit	x86
with the wix install being compiled on a x86 platform windows 7 picked it up as the 32-bit install with 32-bit registry key

1883376
32-bit	64bit
windows 7 64bit handles 32-bit registry entries by doing just what i saw happening

1883380
openfeint	simulator
everything was working fine including the c+++ openfeint stuff until i switched from tesitng on the device to testing in the simulator

1883384
hash	md5
it is very important to put the timestamp into the dummy file because scons uses md5 hash

1883385
type-conversion	int
i m writing a set of numeric type-conversion functions for a database engine and i m concerned about the behavior of converting large integral floating-point value to int types with greater precision

1883385
double	int
.so my questions are are there any well-known existing systemd that perform decimal significant digits rounding in float - int or double - long-long conversions and are there any well-known efficient algorithms for doing .so

1883395
contains	elements	core-animation	quartz-core
the quartz-core framework on the iphone contains the classes and supporting elements for core-animation and also contains items used for core image

1883396
constructor	object
is a constructor a special methods that automatically gets called .when you initializer an object from a class

1883406
constructor	object
using the protected keyword on the constructor only allows initializer of the customer object inside itself like the static factory methods and inside any class that derives from customer

1883413
contains	any
the user-interface s may not contains any state other than the session in case of web user-interface s and possibly transient view baking model

1883437
arrays	loops
a simple foreach loops to go trough the arrays and remove the item you don t want should be enough

1883438
margins	padding
in other words the wrapper uses padding instead of margins

1883446
spring	jsf
simple jsf design connect to managed-bean mix with spring and managed-bean connect to your service-layer ....n

1883449
web-config	app-config
after some investigation if found that because i had split the model into its own seperate project the model was using the connection-string from its own app-config not the web-config of the website

1883455
python	c++	python	java
i have been programming in python for a while now and i d like to learn a more hireable language like java or the c++ c# family

1883459
mongodb	couchdb
i d use a mixture of memcached a nosql-cloud couchdb or mongodb and enterprise grade rdbms systemd core data storage for the data-layer

1883474
xsd	xml
the tables that i m querying were generator from an xsd file the describe the xml i am supposed to be generator

1883486
aggregate	grouping
no using an aggregate means that you are automatically groupinging .so there isn t a single row to get data from even if the grouping happens to contains a single row

1883487
triggers	insert
i have written a triggers which updatess another table s column value .when a recording is insert or updates

1883487
updating	updates
.when i am insert or updating a recording from sql-server management-studio-express in invtvendorinvoices table the invtamtothers coloumn value in the invtmaster table is being updates successfully

1883487
triggers	insert
however .when i insert or updates a recording from an .aspx webpage the triggers doesn t fires

1883487
triggers	insert
the interesting thing is that the recording which tried to insert from the webpage gets insert or updates in the invtvendorinvoices table but the triggers doesn t fire and the invtamtother coloumn in invtmaster table is left unaltered

1883491
populate	row
i suspect that because the textbox is populate within a row of a gridview control and the row was added at runtime .when doing a databind that i may be getting different results than if the textbox were draw on the control at design-time

1883499
web-config	app-config
if your project has both an app-config and a web-config file then you ll want to tie them together .so they shared the connection-string

1883504
activerecord	datamapper	datamapper	poeaa
witness the upcoming ruby-on-rails move to merb in a very real sense a move from one pattern in poeaa activerecord to another datamapper

1883505
ubuntu	linux
i am starting learning opengl and i am not sure how to set it up on ubuntu linux

1883505
keyboard	mouse
i also found the sdl simple directmedia layer libs but it seems to be a libs for all other things beside graphics gui sound keyboard and mouse input ...

1883506
floating	margins
the problem is that the second div can only calculate a margins from a non floating elements

1883506
any	set	floating	margins
you need to add any non floating elements before you attempt to set the margins

1883519
web2py	django
web2py was very much inspired by django and if you know one it is easy to learn the other

1883519
web2py	django
another difference is that django uses an orm web2py uses a dal

1883519
csv	xml
the dal also make it easy to do dynamic meta-programming of model such as create model at runtime based on specifications stored in file such as an xml or csv file

1883522
digits	zero
alternatively you could just zero all digits after the first seven significant ones in the int ideally by rounding after converting to it from a float since the float contains approximately seven significant digits

1883525
base-class	inherited
if you re just looking for basic notifications and your base-class already inherited from something like try changing the parent to

1883533
png	gif
it needs to support jpg gif tif png

1883538
python	java
i don t think you should use a special way to learn java because you know python

1883550
saas	paas
the only way to protect your software is to deploy it in a saas paas

1883572
contains	set
is the control that contains the textbox also an asp.net control that also has runat server set

1883572
datagrid	textbox
you mentioned in another reply that your textbox is in a datagrid

1883575
getter	setter
in addition your sections properties only has a getter - it needs a setter or it will never get set

1883585
python	java
i would take a project you ve implements in python and try converting it to java

1883603
reflection	runtime
i considered using reflection to calculate it at runtime caching it for future call but this seems even uglier

1883605
ubuntu	linux
i used eclipse cdt+ sdl + opengl for developing my .app under ubuntu linux i used this tutorial for setup and then successfully compiled my .app under windows with dev-c++

1883606
private	self
any time you use a private methods from within an object you must leave off the self

1883613
macros	vba
the report writer is to be used by non-programmers or at best very lighting programmers like the ones that make vba macros and such

1883614
associations	model
if i have a model choice belonging to a polymorphism associations suggestion is it possible to create the associated suggestion in a form-for the choice

1883617
primitive	boolean
.when using jax-rpc or apache axis to convert to a java object skeleton the first gets converted into a boolean object where as the latter example gets converted into a boolean primitive

1883617
primitive	boolean
i agree that the second example should become a primitive but why is the first example a boolean

1883626
contains	elements
make a customized url that will contains the information from form elements that i would need in process

1883626
put	get
make this url .when click on or put in an address bar make the appropriate get request

1883626
put	get
but say i want to link to a certain query ex if that url is put in the address bar the get request will be made and it will return json as it should but since the getjson didn t make that request the callback doesn t fire

1883647
selected	textbox
normally if you selected some text in the visual-studio editor and press ctrl + f .when the find and replace modeless dialog appears your selecteded text is automatically show in the find what textbox dropdown

1883655
put	get
i m trying to get the result-of the webpage put into a pdf .so i am trying to get a string representation of the rendering page

1883655
authentication	login
the problem is that the request is not authentication .so all i get is a login screens

1883656
low-level	hardware
but you shouldn t have to do this and indeed with a higher-level language you don t have too because there are less pointers casts and other low-level construct that let you get close to the hardware .when you want to but actually get in the way of automatic optimization

1883664
puts	gets
.when the scripting is run by geektool it never gets past puts file is opened

1883672
bubble-sort	quicksort
in other words if you are using bubble-sort with every compiler-optimization you can think of and i m using quicksort

1883686
for-loop	arrays
provided i tested it on my local machine and they re not actually doing anything just a mere arrays filling operation jquery s each function takes over 10 time as long as javascript native for-loop

1883690
python	c++	python	java
java and c# will be less of a step away from python than would c or c++ because java c# and python all have automatic memory-management

1883693
configuration	logging
the configuration section for logging cannot be found in the configuration source

1883694
contains	any
if as you stated in your comments you have a single index contains every column that s probably not a very useful index in any database-design

1883709
directory	folder
does it have to be in the libs directory or could i place the plugins folder in the same directory where my views and controllers folder are

1883710
credentials	account
can you .post your web-config file specifically the database connections it looks like the login credentials being passed to the database is the machine asp.net account

1883713
instances	destroy
this means wrapping the mutex in a c++ class that claims the mutex .when instancess of the class are created and release it .when it the class instances is destroy

1883726
linux	unix
on unix and linux based systemd php s mail function simply relay the email though sendmail or a compatible mta

1883731
vb.net	vb6
the user account that the vb.net application is running under will need permissions to be able to create the vb6 dll

1883741
value	field
i ve tried using cck field validation to pull out the imce_xxx value from thumbnail_image and likewise with user_address but that doesn t get me anywhere

1883754
web-services	api
but since you do have the domain grouping you can extends your code after you hit the sharepoint web-services api and use the system.directoryservices namespace to resolve your users

1883762
compiler-theory	interpreter
i personally think you can optimize procedural code much better than functional code functional code still execute as procedural code and it is interpreter p i have studied compiler-theory and i honestly can t think of mind-blowing code-transformations i would apply to functional code before i execute it

1883765
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it dosen t use webforms or asp.net-mvc

1883765
httphandler	httpcontext
it uses asp.net-routing to a httphandler and the handler just writes html to the httpcontext

1883779
tcp-ip	tcp
i want to run this proxy service in user mode where i have a tcp connection towards the client using normals windows tcp-ip and a tcp connection the other way through the experimental stack

1883791
decimal	octal
note was edited to fix issue with leading zero being octal rather than decimal

1883792
put	get
however if i put a copy of oracle.dataaccess.dll in my bin folder i get

1883799
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
dynamic-sql has had a bad rep for some time some of it related to sql-injection awareness

1883803
textbox	button
i have a sample view in xaml that has a textbox and a button

1883803
textbox	button
based on the value in the textbox i would like the button to be either enabled or disabled

1883808
required	checked
combined with a redirect and middleware to checked if a session attributes exists and the requested url required it you can create somewhat secure parts of your site that can have nicer urls that reference permanent parts of the site

1883809
value	field
new value by my reckoning can be a different order by new where criterion different field selection etc

1883826
normalize	cosine
if you normalize these two vectors you can get an axis of rotation from their cross product and the cosine of the rotation angle from their dot-product

1883832
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox and google-chrome

1883840
buffering	streaming
the actual formatter class works on streaming .so any buffering and file management stuff is left up to the client

1883841
annotations	mapping
how would this mapping be done with annotations rather than an hbm file

1883843
.net	wcf
this is an asp.net front-end with .net wcf windows service back-end

1883851
affinity	cpu
in that case assuming an x86 cpu you can get the apic numbers of the core using the cpuid instruction then use it as an index in a table of equivalence to the affinity index

1883873
abstract-class	subclassing
in the example below availablespells is a methods of the magicschool abstract-class which has concrete subclassing blackmagic whitemagic etc

1883875
children	nodes
5 goes below 7 but above 3 or 4 .so you replace say the 4 with 5 then look at that nodes s children to see where to put the 4

1883885
solaris	linux
what multithreading c++ libs can be used for writing linux windows solaris and iphone applications

1883886
log4net	nlog
id recommend using a third party solution like log4net or nlog instead of doing it yourself tbh saves reinventing the wheel

1883888
response	timeout
does a timeout of a nsurlrequest only occur if there is no response receiving data or does it triggers if the request doesn t complete in that interval as well

1883922
contains	elements
this works but i would like to use something other than containss since it will match two elements if the contains the given string

1883945
implements	extends
.so after pouring over article after article online that demonstrate various .solutions but as i said only ever reflect a service with one methods operation i am looking for .some guidance for an approach that will be easy to implements maintain and extends .when dealing with real-world service that contains multiple methodss and multiple dependencies

1883949
ruby	php
try php ruby or java

1883958
value	field
the only methods for examining value in the recordset of a report is to have the field bound as the controlsource of a control on the report

1883958
value	field
but it is still the case that to use the value from the underlying recordsource in code there has to be a control with that field as controlsource whether it s hidden or not

1883958
value	field
this means it s possible to distinguish between the display value for a field and the value in the recordset behind the report which are not always in alignment

1883959
backwards-compatibility	deprecated
because named constructor were only retained in php5 for backwards-compatibility with php4 they are more likely to become deprecated in a later release of php than __construct is .so that s .something to keep in mind if you re writing .something that you intend to have longevity

1883964
recording	playing
the field bound to these comboboxes get updates properly as long as this recording we are playing with is the actual recording

1883970
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it s working flawlessly ie7 ie8 firefox until i tried it on google-chrome safari opera where it s a complete disaster

1883970
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
plain and simple and it works in browser windows however to my big surprise it did not work in google-chrome safari opera never got to the success alert

1883972
contains	elements
however i m not sure what you mean by this works but i would like to use something other than containss since it will match two elements if the contains the given string

1883974
hide	show
add the required controls in your view markup then show hide programmatically as necessary

1883985
managed-code	unmanaged
can you tell which unmanaged api failed if your managed-code throw

1883987
contains	set
you can use the filteringing function instead of the contains filtering to apply a custom filtering to your selector result set

1883990
seam	jsf
seam transactional management is enabled by default for all jsf request seam 2.0+

1883996
selected	button
i defined the button selected by default and selected my image for the selected state use dropdownlistfor in inspector windows to choose selected state configuration before selected the image

1884000
constructor	object
al.so if you have to juggle your object heirarchy .so that b extends a different class you need to manually change all the call to parent a or .someone not familiar with the constructor is a methods with the classname construct meaning anyone who learned php in the last 5 years may not know to do that and subtle breaking will occur

1884012
powerpc	arm
the clr is essentially a virtual-machine .so things are compiled to it essentially the same way c code is compiled to x86 or powerpc or arm or whatever

1884030
iprincipal	iidentity
i have created my classes that implements the iidentity and iprincipal interfaces initializer them and then assign the customprincipal object to my context.user in application_authenticaterequest of the global-asax

1884030
iprincipal	iidentity
if i implements the iidentity iprincipal interfaces or inherited genericidentity genericprincipal for my customidentity customprincipal it fails with the original error above

1884034
export	report
i have a report in ms report service that rendering just fine to the screens .when viewing the report through the report service web interface but .when i go to export that to a pdf it errors

1884038
foundation	cocoa
you ll need a good programming foundation including cocoa specific technologies and concepts

1884039
arguments	default
if there are arguments the default gets methods tries to treat the first one as a file and read from that

1884048
pascal	delphi
my suggestion is to checked calling-convention in delphi default calling-convention was pascal but a microsoft compiled dll would be cdecl most probably

1884049
python	c++
prepackaged libs are available on all the platform r python numpy scipy c++ numerical recipes etc

1884056
functional-programming	imperative
i know of imperative and functional-programming but there was little i could find on datatype programming

1884064
object-reference	instances
i m guessing at this loops as the types of variables i does not appear to be declare .so it would be types object by default matching the error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1884073
constructor	private	constructor	object
most of the object constructor are marked private and they have static-methods like loadbyid int to retrieve them from the db

1884124
exception-handling	error-handling
the t-sql error-handling is not similar to c# c++ error-handling there are no means to re-throw the original exception-handling

1884127
constructor	object
if i save some object in a php session variables and then on future page loads i use will it call the constructor

1884132
constructor	object
the constructor is only called once .when the object is created with the new keyword in your case new geoip

1884134
thickbox	jquery
jquery used to have thickbox but it is no longer maintained

1884136
simplemodal	jquery
there s a jquery libs called simplemodal

1884150
silverlight	wpf
i ve been toying with the idea of building a web-based roguelike game using silverlight or maybe just a desktop game using wpf

1884150
keyboard	mouse
as of 1.5.1 everything i ve touch in libtcod works great except for the mouse input stuff and one of the keyboard input modes which i think they recently ditched but everything you need to make a roguelike is in there and that include several line-of-sight path-finding and even dungeon generator algorithms

1884154
32-bit	64bit
i install odp.net 32-bit on my local machine in a separate folder from the 64bit installation

1884154
32-bit	64bit
i want to be able to develop on 64bit and deploy to a 32-bit server without having to change my references every time i want to deploy

1884167
h.264	mp4
a containsers for video encode with h.264 - such as an mkv or mp4 - can absolutely contains audio

1884169
interrupt	delay
one problem that has me a bit stumped at the moment is this if a user task starts an i o operation read or write on one cpu and the device interrupt occurs on another cpu i incur about 80 microseconds of delay before the task resumes execution

1884169
affinity	irq	affinity	cpu	cpu	irq
i can instantly double my performance by setting the process and irq cpu affinity to the same physical cpu but that s not a good long-term solution-- i d rather be able to get good performance no matter where the i os originate

1884169
cpu	irq
and i only have one irq .so i can only steer it to one cpu at a time -- no good if many threads are running on many cpus

1884180
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
font-face is currently supported by safari and firefox and will be supported in google-chrome 4 which is getting close

1884200
any	set
i am trying to set up websvn on a windows-server 2003 machine and not having any luck

1884213
silverlight	wpf
silverlight would probably work but it doesn t have the same hardware-acceleration that wpf provides .so the performance will be lower

1884213
updating	updates
alternatively if you re getting updates issues a grid of canvases only updating the ones as needed might help the retained mode rendering systemd perform a bit better but i doubt with standards screens resolutions you d have any issues with this amount of text in wpf

1884219
value	field
this is incorrect in that the quotes will cause what s inside them to be treated literalsly instead of evaluated as a paramter .so you ll end up with all your field updates to the literals value

1884219
value	field
if the field is numeric you to limit it to numeric value if a date date value if text or memo to text

1884219
value	field
for value longer than that such as memo field you omit the text length declaration

1884263
base-class	inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	base-class
let s say i have a base-class called pet and two subclassing cat and dog that inherited pet

1884263
contains	any
i simply map these to three tables pet cat and dog where the pet table containss the base-class properties and the cat and dog tables contains a foreign key to the pet table and any additional properties specific to a cat or dog

1884269
google-chrome	firefox
the problem happens in all browsers ie7 ie8 google-chrome firefox etc

1884273
processor	cpu
if you finish your i o on a particular cpu then that processor is immediately free to start working on a new thread - if you finish your i o on the same processor as the thread the requested it then the next thread is likely to be the one you finished i o for

1884273
processor	cpu
on the other hand if you finish on a different processor the thread that requested the i o won t get to run immediately - it has to wait until whatever s currently execution finishes its quantum or otherwise relinquishes the cpu

1884280
haskell	c++
this is a research project that ran from 2003 to 2006 that aims to create a new mechanism for writing programs that parameterized over types much further as is possible today with say parametric-polymorphism in haskell or templates in c++

1884287
traffic	packets
a tcpdump or wireshark capture of the wire traffic will show the tcp network packets tagged with both the .source and destination addresses and ports .so that the network traffic has a return path

1884298
32-bit	64bit
one huge caveat is if you re running 64bit windows and the non-.net non-com dll referenced by the wrapper is 32-bit it needs to live in windows syswow64 not windows system32

1884343
lightbox	jquery
jquery lightbox plugins handles images only

1884343
lightbox	thickbox
thickbox plugins lightbox alternative handles images frame inline ajax content

1884344
base-class	inherited
but since you ll have to use the preprocessor anyway it s questionable whether something like a win32socket for example which inherited from a socket base-class is even necessary or useful

1884350
contains	set
in the onclosing methods of your form open a shutting down dialog on a separate thread contains a progress-bar with its styles properties set to marquee

1884376
hide	show
don t hide and show on window.print

1884382
put	get
if you have a varchar2 1000 then at some points you will get data put in there that is longer than you expect eg you may get a string of 10 characters but which has 14 bytes because some characters are multibyte character set values.

1884385
asp.net-mvc	webforms
is jquery more suited to asp.net-mvc than webforms or it doesn t matter

1884391
wamp	php
c wamp bin php php5.3.1 pear phpunit or c wamp bin php php5.3.1 phpunit

1884395
json	csv
it seems that this is not the right way of converting a csv file to json format

1884395
json	csv
i would appreciate a simple way of converting csv to json

1884406
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you re at the cross roads between choosing .net asp.net-mvc and webforms i really really really suggest you take the asp.net-mvc route

1884419
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
while it maybe easier to implements jquery in asp.net-mvc you can still accomplish this with asp.net webforms wait for .net 4 though however you might need to work out a few quirks .when working with asp.net webforms

1884429
.when	ready
.when you are ready to run your time consuming process you call the runasync methods of the backgroundworker

1884431
postback	ajax
alternatively asp.net-mvc doesn t support updatepanel which forces you to do all ajax postback via jquery

1884457
moss	wss
caveat i mainly work with moss haven t worked with wss in a while

1884462
delphi	c++
syntax inspired by c++ viewmodel inspired by java and libs in .net 1.1 were almost a 1-1 correlation with the delphi libs

1884469
where-clause	sql
there may be a slight error in the sql syntax here but you get the idea since you only want the where-clause to apply to one table you apply it to that table in a subquery and then join the result dataset instead of joining the tables first and then filtering.

1884473
functional-programming	imperative-programming
my conclusion clean functional-programming need not be slower than imperative-programming and may sometimes find unexpected avenues of optimization or parallelization

1884476
arguments	default
the second arguments to getattributesvalue is the default returned in case the attributes is not found

1884480
value	field
inorder to avoid problems with the implementation of auto_increment or identity field in any database i never use it .when something outside the database either a person or a systemd has to know about the value

1884484

this isn t terribly random but you can use the same technique multiple time taking the indexes above +1 and using them as the exponent of another generator x2 modulo another primes p2 you ll need n p2 p and .so on

1884582
git-rebase	amend
by replacing the cmd pick with the cmd edit you can tell git-rebase to stop after applying that commit .so that you can edit the files and or the commit messages amend the commit and continue git-rebase

1884693
pdostatement	prepare
two subsequent call to pdo prepare even with the same sql query should return two different pdostatement or handles to avoid collision especially between previous and current binding you may apply to it

1884693
pdostatement	prepare
the cost of creating a pdostatement with prepare is low anyway

1884705

1884730
contains	any
at this points the remains variables doesn t contains any data yet

1884771
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i would base the decision of webforms or asp.net-mvc on the nature of your web application if you are mainly providing content or information like .so i would go the asp.net-mvc route if however your application revolves around multiple forms i would head down the webforms path

1884783
selected	cell
would i iterate through this or just reference the specific cell i want and if .so how do i selected them

1884790
python	ruby
nodes is similar in design to and influenced by systemd like ruby s event machine or python twisted

1884796
order	add
.when order matters simply add a numbers attributes for sorting as you have done

in the click handler for the button i do something iteratively that generator strings which i want to put in the listbox as i get them

1884840
lgpl	gpl
no_gpl disallow use of gpl code license will be lgpl

1884841
temporary	copy
unfortunately you will have to save the existing data to a temporary table drop the old table create the new table with the fk constraint then copy the data back in from the temporary table

1884851
attributes	properties
i noticed that if i change wrapper s value properties s types to int and remove the typesconverter attributes it works

1884863
grouping	sorting	filtering	grouping	filtering	sorting
if you required sorting grouping filtering then consider using a collectionview

1884868
selected	checkbox	keyboard	mouse
the recalculation is mainly bound to the keyup event which clearly won t fire on checkbox and selected unless the user uses the keyboard instead of the mouse to selected the value

1884878
firefox	safari
overflow-x and overflow-y are supported by ie5+ win firefox 1.5+ mozilla 1.8+ and safari 3+

1884905
keyboard	mouse
the rea.son is for fast pace games which aren t graphically intensive to stop the screens lag induced by large changes in frame-rate however vsync isn t suitable as oddly it increases latency between keyboard mouse both are polling at high rates .so not a hardware issue

1884907
contains	any
the code goes on to do more but i noticed that the foreach loops don t contains any brackets.

1884910
shell	bash
with bash shell

1884920
contains	any
if your block statement doesn t contains any just next line will be include

1884929
put	get
the only way i ve found to get around it for my case was to put a time checked in my wrapper and to checked how long it s been since the last time i reconnected before execution the query

1884930
keyboard	mouse
the way an fps game operates is it paint the screens does keyboard mouse etc handling and game logic then it paint the screens again

1884943
default	reset
edit 2 i removed the line i added to the machine.config and reset the distribute transactional timeout setting to it s default

1884954

sets are unordered .so anything you add and then fetch back will come back to you without any intrinsics order

1884956
checkbox	button
the button is a checkbox and toggle between a checked and unchecked state with different images for each state

1884971
licensing	lgpl
the first one is under lgpl licensing the second one is a commercial component suite

1885001
any	set
you didn t give any details about the database back end you will be using but in general the most efficient way to generator this information will be to process the data aggregation and filtering on the database side with the correct sql and pass only the result set to your report generator

1885007
exception-handling	try-catch
your approach seems fine but would be more inclined to wrap the socket code in a using to ensure no resource leak in ischannelopen function and wrap it around the try-catch block also as if the connection failed you ll get a nasty surprise if a socket exception-handling occurred and your code jumps off into the woods never to be seen again

1885010
google-chrome	firefox
i ve used yslow add in for firefox and found it useful does the new new google addin for google-chrome give me anything extra

1885026
any	set
prctl s pr_set_deathsig can only be set for this very process that s calling prctl -- not for any other process including this specific process s children

1885031
instances	self
it sounds like you have a lot - i recently did an audit of a systemd where biztalk was self throttling and the issue was in part due to too many hosts instances

1885055
any	set
i would be mindful to do appropriate error catching in the nsis code and return set error-code to be returned back to wix .so that any registry related failures errors can be communication to the wix install

1885070
value	field
.when a response types advertising does not have any votes my calculated field receives a null value

1885102
lighting	shading
you can t do vertex lighting very efficiently .so you re probably stuck with flat shading

1885120
arrays	loops
as dave said the easiest solution would be to have an arrays of length 26 for english and loops through each character in the string increment the correct arrays elements

1885121
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
being ansi the same syntax is supportsed on oracle sql-server postgresql etc. making the query easier to ports between databases if needed

1885126
contains	any
the problem is if i selected videos my categoryarraylist contains the correct arraylist of strings .so my data is being returned and seemingly added to the categorycombobox as i m not getting any exception-handling its just that my categorycombobox disappears from the gui

1885154
javascript	dom
alternatively you can control the paginator with javascript count the numbers of dom elements then perform the logic

1885184
crossover	mutation
you can do mutation the same way you do crossover except you fill it with random data that is legal rather than swapping with another specimen.

1885195
constructor	object
if the object is an object the constructor string will be something like

1885198
uilabel	uiview
.so right now i have a uiview with a uilabel in it

1885225
value	field
you need to set this hidden field .so .when the user .post the form the value get bind from this hidden field as the td s are not intent to be .posted within a form

1885228
any	set
i have added a handful of properties to the user-controls .so that .when i place the control on a form i can easily set these properties in the designer just like any other control

1885253
attributes	properties
put the browsable attributes on your properties

1885257
document	editing
for example .when you embed a com object into a document then double click that object to open it for editing you can open it one of two ways

1885296
webserver	upload
if you re looking for alternatives one of my favorites is a ten-line http-post file upload handler php .net java etc. + one webserver

1885342
textbox	button
i would suggest that you don t recreate the textbox every time someone click the button

1885370
text-rendering	pango
see also this .post by behdad esfahbod pango vs harfbuzz and this longer and more comprehensive document state of text-rendering

1885387
progress-bar	progress
if you have multuiple elements which have a class of progress-bar the line should make all of them into separate progress bars

1885392
contains	set
i m making a jquery plugins for full browser flash which has a minimum size limit say 800x600 .so if the browser is over 800x600 the contains div is set to 100 width height it s it s below that size it s set to 800x600

1885397
authentication	access-token
.app x received an authentication access-token

1885440
required	checked
the way this game is played is that whenever you call a function which returns a resource you checked the return-value immediately or perhaps after freeing some resource which is no longer required as in your example code and the block corresponding to a successful call must either release the resource or assign it to a return-value or actually return it before the block is exited

1885440
python	c++
yes it s horrible and python or c++ programmers will be physically sick at the sight of it

1885446
callback	methods
your readcompleted callback will be called again while your beginasyncread methods is still execution

1885451
png	gif
note perhaps a better way to do this would be to use a png image that has transparency background rather than my gif image

1885473
virtual-machine	parallels
the first thing that comes to mind is to use vmware-fusion or parallels to run your unmodified .app on a virtual-machine

1885473
virtual-machine	vmware
i ve used vmware to run a .net .app with on a vista virtual-machine on a macbook pro

1885496
groovy	java
because compiled groovy classes are compatible with java classes you should be able to use any java libs for converting json to pojos or pogos

1885499
webforms	asp.net
the best thing you can do to be a great sharepoint developer is to become a top-notch asp.net webforms developer

1885501
order	add
if you need to know what state you re in currently to allow the order processor to determine what to do you might add a string status properties on the order class and on basestate and have each concrete state class return its named

1885511
webforms	asp.net
it s an asp.net webforms .app and .so acts accordingly

1885516
authentication	login
the idea would be to add the external authentication as a login requirement for a role

1885518
revision	updates
one big containers document is not a good idea - you d waste lots of revision for each little updates of any article data

1885548
simplemodal	jquery
i am using tinymce and simplemodal jquery plugins

1885552
push	pull
just need a way to pull push the data .so that the user loses nothing that he she sees on screens

1885558
revision	svn
how can i checked the revision numbers of a particular file which by the way doesn t have the svn keyword properties while being offline

1885591
contains	elements	contains	any
the arrays may contains any value from 1 up and be of any length and the amount of marked elements is variables

1885597
python	java
the drawback of course is you only have python and java as options.

1885608
radio-button	textbox
actually from a usability standpoint i would recommend that you do not wipe out the value in textbox .when the radio-button is unselected

1885608
radio-button	textbox
you may want to disable the textbox .when the associated radio-button is unselected inorder to indicate to your users that the textbox value do not apply

1885608
radio-button	selected	radio-button	textbox	selected	textbox
you probably should also make selected a radio-button automatically place focus in the first associated textbox to save the user an extra mouseclick or tab keypress

1885630
hash	md5
i am trying to store md5 hash

1885637
hash	md5
since your md5 hash will always be the same size you should probably use a char

1885654
hash	md5
if that is the question then as long as you are using a proven hash algorithm such as md5 there is very low risk of a user manipulating the bits of their hash to get another user s id

1885734
javascript	dom
to answer your question of why you see javascript libs accessing the value properties of a textarea dom elements you have to appreciate that html and the dom document object-model that javascript accesses are 2 different animals

1885734
attributes	properties
although dom properties named often map 1 1 to html attributes named they don t always and this is just one example

1885762
scala	java
i would like a form a list of what nagging things of java are history and by what feature of scala has it been replace

1885767
lighttpd	apache
i want to migrate some sites running on apache to lighttpd

1885789
jquery	.post
each time an item is checked jquery send the id to an session.php file using .post and the idea is that session.php pushes that into the session-stored arrays and the opposite for unchecking an item

1885806
scala	java
scala runs on the jviewmodel .so concurrency support at the viewmodel level cannot be better than java

1885812
common-lisp	scheme
the recursive call is in tail positioning .so both scheme and common-lisp will compile this code into a tight loops

1885820
shell	bash
i looked at genhtml and it seems to need a lot of setup and must run in the bash shell environment which doesn t sound good for windows command-line

1885847
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.1.5 gecko 20091102 firefox 3.5.5

1885847
firefox	gecko

having	union
however i prefer having an anonymous union

1885855
blacklist	whitelist
instead of a whitelist approach may i suggest a blacklist approach using stopbadware.org

1885856
lgpl	gpl
you dismiss the gpl but not the lgpl - libsdl is another option if lgpl is acceptable for you

1885861
constructor	object
.when you create a new object the memory is allocated using operators new then the constructor is invoked to initializer the memory

1885863
32-bit	64bit
now my understanding has been that you can t simply link a 64bit executable to a 32-bit shared libs

1885863
32-bit	64bit
.when the 32-bit dll is dynamically loaded and begins process the memory footprint of the 64bit .application will be about 60 mb larger 250mb as 64bit vs 190mb as 32-bit than if the .application is built as a 32-bit .app

1885863
32-bit	64bit
how is it possible that a 64bit binary is linked to a 32-bit shared libs

1885871
shell	bash
please tell me how to export a function in parent shell bash sh or ksh .so that the function will be available to all the child-process launced from the parent process

1885873
google-chrome	firefox
this happens consistently in ie8 standards mode firefox 3.0 and google-chrome .so i m assuming there is .some properties of empty inline-block elements that i don t understand

1885896
operators	keyword
note that the words operators and new in this sequences are just two separate c++ language keyword

1885896
keyword	term
the former sequences is present in the language specifications as a mere combinations of keyword not as an english term

1885897
constructor	object
the new-operators starts by using operators new to allocate memory but then it invokes the constructor for the right types of object .so the result is a real live object created in that memory

1885897
constructor	object	contains	any
if that object contains any other object either embedded or as base classes those constructor as invoked as well

1885917
scriptaculous	jquery
edit it might also be a conflict between jquery and prototype and or scriptaculous

1885948
contains	any
can any one explain me how to building the install .so that unins000.exe will contains these field

1885951
for-loop	loops
the reason it might be more efficient is that having the size function-call inside the for-loop means it would have to go call the function each time it runs the test to see if loops is finished instead of testing against a static value

1885953
solaris	linux
the solaris -pthreads and linux -pthread options do equivalent things

1885971
32-bit	64bit
are you sure that the reference isn t an anycpu assembly or that the 32-bit reference doesn t have a 64bit or anycpu versioning in the gac

a textarea can not contains any other elements only text nodes

1886025
http	ssl
http is http over ssl encrypted connection

1886031
row	col
mainly addcell no longer allows a col row setting

1886041
32-bit	x86
to reference a 32-bit dll you will need to set the target-platform to anycpu or x86 rather than x64 .when building

1886043

windows-vista and windows 7 task dialog

1886069
hashtable	set
a hashtable i think you re referring to what we call an nsdictionary or a set of key-value pairs is a data structure

1886071
sql-server	oracle
sql-server 2005+ and oracle 9i+ support analytic-functions .so you can use row_number or rank

1886071
union-all	union
union-all returns all rows while union would remove duplicates

1886072
windows-vista	windows
can the application that you create benefit from running on top of windows-vista and windows 7

1886090
tuples	any
how do i get a thread to return a tuples or any value of my choice back to the parent in python

1886093
environment	building
i assume that you want to do this inorder to have the connection-string points out a production-environment rather than development or test environment .when nant building the release code

1886098
c++	lua
for example much of the user-interface in world of warcraft is written in the lua extension language even though the core wow program is probably c++

1886113
linux	unix
.when compiling to native on windows or other platform unix linux many compilers generator object-files in a standards shared format

1886133

can i hide from email to recipient and just show some textual named

1886139
subclassing	ivar
-add an ivar to the uiview subclassing bool hasmoved

1886140
stderr	stdout
use exec.run by specifying pipe as the stdout and stderr if you want

1886140
stderr	stdout
it will return cmd which contains an os.file in the stdout and stderr field

1886155
.when	ready
option b usuallyâ with cooperative yieldingâ .when the other thread is not ready to run yield is a no-op

1886197
for-loop	arrays
the for...in statement should be used to iterate over object properties for arrays use a simple for-loop

1886203
value	field
the custom field already exists in the .post but i need to insert the hyperlink contains in the .post content as the value

1886221
google-webmaster-tools	sitemap
you could try upload an xml sitemap through google-webmaster-tools

1886241
linux	unix
it was designed specifically for this task and if you are using unix or linux or mac os x or whatever you have it install

1886246
c++	lua
they started with lightroom and now there technical business strategy is to write the basic routines in c++ assember you need this for fast sse graphics and all the gui is glued together with lua

1886259
required	checked
the for-in loops required the scripting engine to building a list of all the enumerator properties and checked for duplicates in that list before it can start the enumerator

1886259
arrays	loops
the for-in loops break .when you extends arrays object using prototype

1886260
any	set
which means you cannot change set disabled functions using ini_set -- which seems logical if you could change this at runtime anyone could enable any additional function that was disabled bu the administration for security reasons which would obviously not be quite secure.

1886261
webserver	upload
to the health service a hospital medical information systemd is a large application even if it actually involves say a bunch of different webserver databases various custom scripting for integration various third party product specially written client programs for radiology diagnostics different web interfaces for doctors and nurses and sms systemd for paging doctors .when results have been upload etc

1886267
cos	sin
the basic theory is yes you set a timer that move the image on some sort of interval either fixed or based on some sort of mathematical equation eg sin cos etc

1886281
search-engine	web-crawler
the search-engine web-crawler needs them and it also helps people who are not able to use the fancy navigation for some reason

1886282
perl	awk
the code below works you can probably optimize it if you want or use awk perl etc

1886287
value	field
in database in table there is a field to save the value of checked checkbox

1886287
value	field
if that field contains value check1 check2 check3 and if i use following code to bind checkboxlist only check3 gets checked but check1 and check2 is unchecked

1886297
zero	nan
something like will do the job although you will probably get zero in the first few slots instead of nan

1886308
hide	show
or you can use css to hide that content and show it after a certain points

1886315
checkbox	button
for checkbox and radio button use code like this

1886327
margins	padding
give the span top alignment then negative margins equals to your padding and you don t need the non-breaking spaces hack

1886329
contains	set
i have set a background-image on frame which contains jtoolbar

1886329
transparency	frame
i want my jtoolbar to be transparency .so that the image kept on frame should be visible

1886338
nspopupbutton	nsmenu
the menu of an nspopupbutton is an nsmenu

1886338
button	popup
if you want a popup menu without a popup button you ll need to use nspopupbuttoncell to display the menu

1886338
button	popup
of course this is assuming you have a good reason to fake a popup button in an opengl view instead of simply using the standards nspopupbutton

1886339
void	main
i would like the static constructor to be called as soon as possible during runtime preferably before execution of the static void main entry-point

1886345
selected	checkbox	listitem	checkbox	listitem	selected

1886359
javascript	dom
ie has a separate garbage collector for the dom and for javascript

1886359
javascript	dom

1887517
internet-explorer	firefox
it was checked as working in firefox 3 and internet-explorer 6

getter	setter
with other setter and getter methods you can do it better this is just a fast sketch

1887732

during debugging i realized the file actually does exist by the time i get to checked manually for it - after several iterator it occurred to me that the file doesn t show up until .some delay passes by - .so i put in loops below in component b as show below

1887732
put	get
i put a cfile getstatus in component a immediately before it call into component b and that indicates success - it can see the file and get its true size yet the call into component b made immediately after can not see the file until the above indicated delay passes

if you need to hash by the entire value of t i would copy the data into a temporary buffering like steve suggests and then use one of the variable-length hash-function discussed here

1888350

but in the case of a click you can detection the mouse click

1888539
google-earth	google-maps
maps google-maps google-earth with the same kml file

1888553
value	field
they use it in ways he didn t intend by fiddling with the value of field they shouldn t and they create a hack that works but break .when the producer of the original code changes it

1888558
put	get
i know i can go and get the image again from the database or where ever and put it back in the model before passing it to the view but is that the right stratergy or have i missed something

1888563
radio-button	button
the requirements state that the three options above need to be presented in a wizard-like format as three radio-button choices and then a submit button which display the appropriate form and list

1888563
selected	checkbox	contact	submit
if option 3 send to specific then display a searchable sortable list of all contact with checkbox next to their named and on submit selected everyone checked to send

1888576
implements	abstract
as has been mentioned thereâ s no real protocols for abstract collections classes aside from the nsfastenumeration protocols which provides the for id item in collections syntax .when implements but there are conventions to follow

1888577
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
how is perl any better or more powerful than other scripting languages such as python or ruby

1888597
perl	c++
perl is very good in text-parsing .when compared to c++ java

1888598
environment	building
the only other document that i find quite handy is a half-page or .so set of bullet points showing people how to set up the building environment for a development machine

1888602
exception-handling	try-catch
i have a thread in a java web application that causes a out-of-memory java heap spaces exception-handling but the try-catch block does not catch the error

1888602
output	mode
the error is not showing up in any of the logs files and the output is being show in the console in debugging mode in eclipse

1888616
ip-address	proxy
edit you could just be lucky here and be able to rules out the ip-address changing behind proxy and actually use it for this purpose

1888631
value	field
the following classes and mapping almost work but the addresses list return all rows from the cmnaddress table with a matching objectid regardless of the objecttype field s value

1888653
upgrade	migrate
i am developing using sf 1.2.9 using propel orm but i am increasingly being tempted to upgrade to 1.4 least of all i feel it will be less of an effort to migrate a life systemd from 1.4 to 2.0 later on than from 1.2 to 1.4

1888669
textbox	button
in your call findparentrow button shouldn t you be passing textbox instead of button

1888672
c++	lua
since cperson is implementss in c++ what changes are needed to implements eat assuming the cperson class already has a lua state pointers

1888672
c++	lua
edit1 i do not want to know how to bind c++ classes to lua i already have swig to do this for me i want to know how to call lua functions inside lua tables from c++

1888703
user-controls	tabcontrol
another key realization was that inorder to switching the tabcontrol by index i can get a reference to the main user-controls and set the selecteditem to the tabitem itself like this

1888724
ibaction	cocoa
the first part of my question has been ansered in the question send an action cocoa - ibaction

1888780
value	field
i have a table which show two of the field in this each a column with its value individually bound to the the said nsarraycontroller

1888780
selected	button
i have added a button to remove downloading from the queue before they start the button is bound to the nsarraycontroller s remove action which should remove the selected item in the table

1888780
selected	button
my problem is that .when click the remove button the selected item does not get removed from the table it remains there until click another entry in the table

1888780
selected	button
selected the row where the item was causes it to be selected while the mouse button is held down as if it is still there but with no value

1888780
selected	button
it seems to work fine except i still get the invisible item left behind that can be selected and remains selected only .when the mouse button is down

1888786
put	get
what i want to do is to just get the text test 1 2 etc of any click li a and put into the textbox

1888807
silverlight	wpf
also wpf has the silverlight subset which doesn t seem to be losing steam

1888841
unchecked-exception	runtimeexception
unchecked-exception also known as runtimeexception are those that the compiler does not force you to catch

1888850
logfile	tail
if you re doing something as simple as monitor a logfile you want a unix program called tail or its windows equivalent

1888852
inline-code	code-behind
you could write some inline-code within the xaml if you were just concerned with keeping it in a single file but it would still need to be compiled pretty much as if it was written in code-behind

1888853
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
to be honest i just want to try something different than php python or ruby

1888858
put	get
put it all together and you get something like this

1888904
any	set
if .so then you can use principles of linear algebra to set up a 6x6 matrix that represents the systemd of equation and .solve for it using any standards matrix inversion routine.

1888910
dictionary	arrays
i was trying to figure out a way to sort the dictionary via the arrays and then finding a way to display the first ten that pop up.

1888922
radio-button	button	radio-button	selected	selected	button
we have a form with a radio-button grouping where any one of the button may already be selected

1888922
radio-button	selected	radio	click
we want to prevent a user from selected one of the radio-buttons but we want to be able to deselect that radio-button by click on any other radio

1888925
versioning	upgrade
but do not upgrade to 1.4 but to versioning 1.3

1888940
widget	button
i m trying to put a new customized widget .when the user press a button using layout- addwidget mywidget where layout is a qvboxlayout but it s not working

1888947
vbscript	vb6

i have methods of doing this in firefox 3.0 3.5 ie 6 7 8 safari 4.0.3 4.0.4 opera 9.0+

1888954
firefox	safari
ideally i would also like a methods that works in firefox 2 and safari 4.0.3

1888961
radio-button	button
of course i m not using any javascript for it but i just wanted to show that a disabled radio-button r2 in the example can be checked but then .when the user click either of the other two button it becomes unchecked and cannot be checked again

1888963
stderr	stdout
spawn from java an external proc c# c++ etc that connect to sqlsrv using oledb and redirect the stdin stdout and stderr to your java program

1888973
menhir	yacc
the action routines in your yacc or antlr or menhir or whatever... grammar can directly building the abstract syntax tree .so the concrete syntax tree only exists as a conceptual entity representing the parsing structure of your .source text

1888984
cryptography	security
inorder to achieve this level of security the application employs symmetric cryptography with a key derived from a passphrase specified by the user and a salt specific to the device

1888984
private-key	rsa
for example if the private-key was to be an rsa private-key the attacker would try various combinations of the passphrase and test to see if he can use the resulting plaintext as a valid rsa private-key

1888984
private-key	rsa
since the rsa private-key must encode certain information in a certain way if the decryption failed the rsa engine would signals that the key is not valid

1889004
python	ruby
python and ruby also have good facilities for text process

1889004
perl	ruby
ruby in particular took much inspiration from perl much as perl has shamelessly borrowed from many other languages. there s little points in asking which is better

1889011
private-key	rsa
the private-key for rsa is a fixed-length random byte sequences

1889030
wxpython	gtk
gtk doesn t look well on windows wxwidgets wxpython is ok but not .so powerful and tkinter is too ugly basic

1889030
lgpl	gpl
besides qt4 is lgpl .so you can link with it even if your application is not gpl

1889056
compact-framework	.net
i m developing a windows-mobile 5.0 or above with .net compact-framework 2.0 sp2 and c#

1889065
linked-list	arrays	any	set
to be exact i need to produce a data structure that maps any object o to the set of object no more dissimilar to o than d for some dissimilarity value d such that listing the object in the set takes no more time than if they were in an arrays or linked-list and perhaps they actually are

1889066
versioning	upgrade
in my opinion you should upgrade your osg to new versioning and try to building it again until you get no exception-handling

1889089
multiplication	addition
where op is a binary operators multiplication or addition

1889109
oracle	mysql
unlike oracle which supports java-stored-procedures mysql s stored procedure syntax is based on plain ansi-sql standards

1889124
value	field
click on this button should open some form with editable field where we can change current value

1889144
listbox	textbox
i have a listbox textbox above it

1889144
listbox	textbox
i want to the user to be able to search the listbox just by starting to types the letters of the words or part of the words in the textbox

1889149
constructor	object
however there is the difference that the constructing fn is attached to the object using some internal properties yes you can get it with constructor but setting it doesn t have the same effect

1889167
url-encoding	url
for example search for url-encoding without the quotes in google and then look at the url

1889172
textchanged	textbox
in winforms handle the textchanged event of the textbox

1889209
widget	button
the scenario is that i d like to updates a javascript snippet that rendering a widget .when a user click a button

1889209
widget	button
the idea is that a user can enter a numbers of parameters to configure their widget and then click a button to see a preview of it

1889221
entity-framework	nhibernate
i m using linq-to-sql but the same question would apply to entity-framework nhibernate etc

1889233
32-bit	64bit
also although it isn t a good match for the exception-handling messages you ll get an exception-handling complaining about the assembly format if your code is running on the 64bit versioning of the framework and you re trying to load an assembly that contains 32-bit native-code

1889245
export	report	export-to-pdf	export
i m running into an issue .when i export-to-pdf the report rendering properly 2 pages in a crystal report viewer but .when i export it either through the viewer or programatically it turns into a 11 page document .when it should be a 2 page document

1889245
export	report
i m not sure if this is something with the report or if this is something with the export .

1889246
hide	show
under show hide make sure the messages bar is checked turned on

1889267
managed-code	unmanaged
then you can use pinvoke platform invocation service to calling win32 functions and other unmanaged apis from managed-code .net

1889285
deployment	install
the bonus is that you don t need to have msoffice install on your deployment computer which is mandatory imho if you are running this on a server

1889305
any	set
that maps any object o to the set of

1889313
value	field
i need to set the value of a field in an xml file which exists on a remote linux box

1889320
default	reset
i reset my ie settings to factory default and it fixed it

1889330
silverlight	wpf
and indeed for most lob applications i d strongly consider silverlight 4 ahead of wpf and only go with wpf if you really needed something that you knew silverlight couldn t provide such as socket access to a wide range of ports accelerated 3d graphics that sort of thing

1889339
forms-authentication	credentials
once i add required field to create a new forms-authentication rules i get a forms-authentication login wizard where i enter my credentials

1889345
google-chrome	firefox
this is observed both in mozilla firefox and google-chrome

1889347
any	set
i normally develop it in a directory called semantictext and have the environment variables sandbox set to the path of the directory above semantictext - .so that i can reference any file in the project using env sandbox

1889377
twitter	tweets
i can submit tweets to twitter

1889378
cursor	row
as this would need to handle cursor positioning setting a default 80 characters per row 80 columns would be fine but also needs to handle other column sizes

1889382
order	add
all you want to do is add a javascript to prevent her click order now twice

1889397
value	field
after submit i would like to loops through every field that has the named price and get their value one at a time to be checked against something in the database

1889397
value	field
i know how to submit the form i just need to loops through those field and get their value

1889404
button	popup
i m using a jquery-ui-dialog and .when i put the following code on my page i have the dialog open and .when i click the back button on the browser it never popup the messagebox

1889422
installation	upgrade
i m experiencing some weirdness related to an msi installation upgrade perhaps someone out there can help me

1889431
repository	entity
this tier performs a few operations and makes a change to the entity and passes it back to the repository for updating

1889433
selected	cell
what would my selectedor be if it is possible to selected all tables regardless of where it resides on a page and iterate or filtering the tables based on the content of the first cell in the first row

1889434
selected	textbox
.so for example you can change a hidden-field or a selected to a textbox and then enter any value to test the server response and stuff like that

1889454
data-members	constructor
in scala how does one defined a local parameter in the primary constructor of a class that is not a data-members and that for example serves only to initializer a data-members in the base-class

1889454
data-members	constructor
for example in the following code how could i properly defined parameter b in the primary constructor of class b .so that it generator only a temporary local parameter and not a data-members

1889456
selected	cell
this will selected the first td cell of the first row of each table

1889457
macros	vba
this would be mainly used as some kind of scripting-language to replace many process run in spreadsheet and vba macros

1889466
python	c++
i would wrap the c++ libs in python

1889466
python	c++
since the python interpreter can be embedded in a c++ or c# application you can easily create excel api s

1889466
python	c++
from excel to your new language do as little as possible in the c++ api to initiate the python functionality

1889474
javascript	dom
how can i repeatedly manipulate a dom elements using jquery functions rather than vanilla javascript in an efficient way

1889486
macros	let
a simple way to achieve this is to set the optimize macros to in your config.json s top-level let section

1889493
player	movie
as for flash on the iphone .when flash-cs5 comes out and suddenly flash movie can be compiled into iphone applications i really see no reason for apple to hold down the iphone flash player any longer

1889507
versioning	upgrade
inorder to use .net 4.0 assemblies the apppool running your moss site would have to be upgrade to the 4.0 versioning of asp.net

1889509
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the main plugins versioning to 1.2 the dependency to groovy 1.7 and wrapped it all in a pluginsmanagement tag .so that it will nicely leverage the inherited model

1889510
any	set
anyone can set their cursor to any arbitrary garbage and there s no api for asking from the browser

1889552
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
of course any of these tools can be substituted for other tools you like perl python ruby ant etc

1889553
msbuild	nant
since i m working on the windows platform i use msbuild to create my build-scripts which are execute by cruisecontrol.net but you can use nant instead

1889557
constructor	object
it is unusual to initializer a graphics object in a constructor if you re not making use of off-screen contexts

1889562
macros	vba
this vba macros will return a list of functions their signature for c excel interface and the dll xll from which they were loaded

1889564
svg	vml
google-maps uses the vml svg or canvas graphics systemd depending on the browser

1889564
georss	kml
the amount of data will vary depending on whether you choose kml or json or georss but if you end up with 20 bytes per line segment that would take 50 seconds to fetch on a 1 megabit broadband connection

1889573
object-reference	instances
the error was object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1889617
file-descriptor	pipe
poll the file-descriptor of the pipe i do this until i reach eof

1889617
any	set
i dont know why the error flag is being set any ideas

1889634
any	set
you could create a 3-dimensional arrays and set the value of each nodes of the arrays to the object with those value if any

1889654
groovy	java
if your underlying libs uses java you should take a look at doing a dsl in groovy

1889663
response	timeout
timeout is the numbers of milliseconds that a subsequent synchronous request made with the getresponse methods wait for a response and the getrequeststreaming methods wait for a streaming

1889663
response	timeout
the timeout applies to the entire request and response not individually to the getrequeststream and getresponse methods call

1889673
revision	svn
we use major.minor.revision.building where revision is the svn revision and building is the building numbers which is based on the current date in yyddd format where yy is the year and ddd the day numbers .so 18001 would be jan 1st 2018.

1889673
revision	svn
having the svn revision is incredibly useful and has saved us on more than one occasion

1889675
implements	abstract
i was getting the error the types new tokenhandler must implements the inherited abstract methods tokenhandler.token

1889679
any	set
there is a specific set of functions in the imaging classes for preforming crops and any other related manipulations image rotation hue adjustment brightness contrast adjustment filtering noise etc that you might need

1889685
pessimistic-locking	optimistic-locking
but given the problem domain i suspect that in a given time windows it s highly improbable that you would have a collision .so using a pessimistic-locking scheme will be very slow compared to an optimistic-locking scheme

1889689
compact-framework	.net
in using this code on a .net compact-framework 2.0 sp2 winform .app

1889691
revision	updates
the building revision numbers are updates automatically

1889694
target-platform	platform
for this i need to know the target-platform of the dll file or any other details about its platform

1889703
constructor	private
if you use one in non-constructor code in the body of a methods there will be an invisible private field in the generator class that holds that constructor parameter just as if you made it a private variables or private val constructor parameter

1889703
constructor	private
however in the following code because the constructor parameter is referenced in a methods bodyâ which is not part of the constructor bodyâ the constructor parameter must be copy-paste to a private field of the generator class increasing its memory requirement by the 4 bytes required to hold an int

1889705
constructor	private	data-members	private	data-members	constructor
notice that class a has a private data-members a due to the variables a int in its primary constructor

1889705
data-members	constructor
class b however has no data-members but its primary constructor still has a single int parameter

1889713
notepad++	textpad
and .when i write a french character such as ã textpad interpreter the file as a utf 8 file but notepad++ says it s ansi as utf8 or maybe it s an ansi file but is reading it as utf8

1889713
notepad++	textpad
.when i create a file the same way without the french character both textpad and notepad++ read the file as an ansi file even though according to msdn it should be a utf 8 file still

1889713
notepad++	textpad
notepad++ or textpad - notepad++ seems to be more consistant but is still the oppossite to what msdn says it should be

1889732
specifications	w3c
it s just not in the w3c official css specifications

1889734
.when	ready
the developer can then change his reference to this package do his testing and then .when we re ready we can replace the procedure in the production package delete it from dev and the developer changes his reference back to the production package

1889755
contains	set
jtoolbar creates jbuttons to contains the actions you set on it

1889758
strtotime	mktime
i can t tell if i should use strtotime mktime

1889767
ref	out
in the case of your code especially because of the ref parameter you can t have variance on a parameter with ref or out

1889773
selection	highlight
while sshed into vim though i usually use alt + highlight with the mouse for block selection as i usually have line numbers on

1889791
json	xml
the results should come in an easily consumable format xml json and should of course include the words s lexical category

1889825
contains	any
any object in this arrays that is not explicit initializer with a value will contains the default-value for that object types

1889834
contains	any
any object in this arrays that is not explicit initializer with a value will contains the default-value for that object types

1889845
windows	wow64
wow64 will automatically be used if you run an x86 windows program on an x64 windows operating systemd

1889849
32-bit	64bit
are you running a 32-bit or 64bit os

1889858
radio-button	button
i have solved this by enabling the full c++ indexer windows- properties - c++ - indexer and also hit the radio-button use active button configuration

1889885
64bit	x86
visual-studio does not run natively on 64bit operating systemd but instead uses the wow64 environment to run as an x86 application

1889887
any	set
if you additionally make the hamming-distance between any two ids at least 2n then you ll be able to reconstruct the original id in cases where less than n bits have been set

1889888
sql-server	ms-access
not sure if this is available in ms-access it is for sure available in sql-server 05 08 .so you will have to investigate that

1889889
php-parse-error	syntax-error
the error types is php-parse-error syntax-error unexpected t_lnumber expecting t_variable or in .

1889908
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
might be a better way to write this but here what i came up on ben s nscalendar suggestion and working from there to nsdatecomponents

1889917
python	java
that is for python or java

1889951
variables	boolean
probably restrictions.eq is using internally boolean variables because your arguments is boolean and call its tostring methods because database column is of character types

1889953
textbox	button
i have a simple-form with one textbox and a panels with three radio button in it

1889953
radio-button	selected
the user needs to selected a radio-button

1889953
radio-button	selected
is there a simple way to make sure that the user has selected a radio-button

1889957
javascript	dom
this can cause at first sight unexplainable problems in javascript jquery css the elements being completely unreachable in specific selectors like until you discover in the html dom inspector that there should be a base and head in between

1889958
exception-handling	error-handling
a better place to branch based on versioning is error-handling - above i use exception-handling which are not available in php4

1889959
aggregate	grouping
you want to use aggregate and the grouping by clause

1889966
objectdataprovider	design-time
i know that objectdataprovider allows for binding to a types and thus can provide design-time data for visualizing but then there is some juggling to allow for the real runtime data to bind without wasting resources by loading loading both the design-time dummied data and the runtime binding

1889966
design-time	designer
how might i leverage design-time binding of collections and non-trivial data in the visual-studio xaml designer and then swap to runtime binding smoothly

1889983
any	set
that returns true if any non-pollin bits are set

1889997
virtualenv	fabric
suggested reading tools of the modern python hacker virtualenv fabric and pip

1890003
attributes	properties
i want to retrieve the properties groupinging printing the named attributes from that elements and then printing the child properties of said properties grouping below that entry

1890003
attributes	properties
i managed to get the propertiesgroup named to printing but i can t seem to retrieve more than one attributes from the properties elements without doing two linq queries

1890006
global-assembly-cache	gac
you can install assemblies to the gac by adding a global-assembly-cache folder as part of the destination filesystems

1890007
profiling	trace
be sure you capture all associated columns in the trace as well should be the default if you are running a trace using the profiling tool

1890007
profiling	trace
once you run the trace and capture the output find the exception-handling event that fired if you are using profiling the row s it will be in red color then you should be able to simply find the most recent sp stmtstarting or sql stmtstarting event for the same spid that occurred before the exception-handling

1890033
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
now i ve already got full-length screenshot for ie and firefox but what can i do to get a full-length screenshot in opera google-chrome and safari

1890037
groovy	java
in groovy 1.7+ i expect static inner-classes to have the same semantics as they do in java

1890039
derived-class	base-class
your derived-class f hide the base-class f

1890063
derived-class	base-class
why does an overrides function in the derived-class hide other overloads of the base-class

1890063
derived-class	base-class
.when you declare a methods on a derived-class it hide any methods with the same named from the base-class

1890069
move-constructor	std
in c++0x you ll be able to use the vector s move-constructor via std move to achieve the same thing in a more obvious way

1890093
double	int	boolean	double	boolean	int
how would my code change if i wanted to handle not only int my current plan but strings longs double boolean etc etc

1890095
local-variables	function-call
however there is also the memory taken up by stack .when you make a function-call and have local-variables as well

1890115

i ve noticed this is also lacking in jquery which has a unique function for dom selection only and the most common snippet i found checked the entire arrays and a subset of it for each elements not very efficient i think like

1890212
configuration	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the upgrade will destroy the .net 4.0 configuration all programs that use the default versioning of the clr will no longer work correctly

1890219
conditional	operators
on the overloaded operators i would defined my conditional for equality

1890222
value	field
next thing you could do is to go through every properties field in the class and compare those hash value

1890230
gethashcode	equals

i am insert some info into a database-table with php and mysql

1890252
spaces	output
the pigeonhole principles says that if you have a spaces of input and a 1-to-1 function the lossless-compression then the numbers of output has to be the same as the numbers of input

1890256
hoverintent	superfish
in addition to those i may be using several scripting that are not available on a public cdn like superfish and jquery.approach and hoverintent

1890259
click	mouse
to get the latitude and longitude where the mouse is click you could use the following api code

1890274
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
perl is good for text process but that doesn t mean ruby or python suck

1890283
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
yes you can use objectoutputstream objectinputstream for simplicity or you can convert the biginteger to a byte and serialization that value instead of the entire object

1890283
buffering	streaming
also if you use streaming classes that are not already buffering remember to wrap your outputstreaming and inputstreaming in bufferingoutputstreaming and bufferinginputstreaming to improve performance and fflush after you re done writing if you don t fflush the bufferingoutputstreaming the inputstreaming may stall or hang waiting for input

1890283
compression	streaming
if you re worried about bandwidth or file size you can also wrap your streaming in gzipoutputstream gzipinputstream for automatic compression

1890285
python	php
it seems common in biology to want to search a large numbers of sequencess using alignment algorithms such as blast and hmmer .so i wondered if there is any existing php python ruby-on-rails project that allow easy creation of a generics sequences database with a website search form

1890300
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
java sentity-relationshipialization objectoutputstream objectinputstream is a genentity-relationshipal purpose way of entity-relationship sentity-relationshipialising object into octet sequences

1890375
32-bit	64bit
this methods is currently limited to 32-bit but can be extended to at the most 64bit by changing the masks from 32-bit int to 64bit int from to for example

1890437
protected	public
promote base protected methods to public and expose way too much information to all

1890450
any	set
as the angle of hue is set in degrees giving 0 360 720 or any multiple of 360 will result in no change to the image

1890549
administration	account
make iis ask you for a passwd and turn on impersonation then try logging in as an administration or some account with privileges

1890561
hash	md5
here s an example koregan s .post of how to use a messagedigest with md5 to hash a string

1890582
32-bit	64bit
while the apps i write are 64bit capable as is iis7 the built-in asp.net development server aka cassini aka webdev.webserver.exe runs as 32-bit

1890582
32-bit	64bit
32-bit and 64bit applications have separate hklm software registry homes

32-bit	64bit
there are 32-bit and 64bit versioning of the sql-server client network utility

1890602
directory	folder
and if the versioning of mydll are different in the two directory which one ends up in my web s bin folder after a rebuild

1890619
packets	lan
if your client and server on on the same local lan the chances of a lost packets are low

1890619
udp	tcp
udp is messages oriented such that one recvfrom will get you one complete messages whereas with tcp .when you read bytes from the socket you could be reading the tail end of one messages and the first few bytes of the next messages thus the need for delimiters

1890634
32-bit	64bit
i have also found an ugly workaround which is to start a 64bit command-prompt from the 32-bit environment by launchd windir sysnative cmd.exe c x.abc instead of x.abc

1890636
versioning	upgrade
i don t know what versioning of mongrel_service you are running but it would be worth seeing if you can upgrade

the solution to this is to run a windows-xp virtual-machine and windows 7 has a pretty painless process for doing this using xp mode

1890722
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox with firebug and the google-chrome dev tools points out two javascript errors.

1890726

the only one that is complex is the checkbox arrays called photo_select which keeps an arrays of any selected checkbox and their value which i ve set to the photo id for each

1890751
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
each time one of the paginator submit button is click i need to take the submitted checkbox arrays and use arrays_merge to combine it with the saved arrays of previously selected checkbox .so that i keep tracking of all selected photos from all pages

1890767
controllers	routes
i traded a slightly more bloated main home_controller.rb for a cleaner controllers directory and routes file which considering these pages will eventually be eliminated the ones in the subdirectories i thought was a fair compromise

1890769
revision	updates	msbuild-task	nant
then each night the server call a nant scripting that updates the working copy to the latest revision and building the solution using the msbuild-task

1890800
shell	bash
keep in mind that the bash built-in cmd must honor the syntax requirements of the external cmd usually a link to bin test inorder to maintain backward compatibility with the archaic versioning of sh in which test was not internal to the shell

1890800
required	checked
.when bin test is called as it checked its on argv 0 then it required the closing as a parameter

1890809
ftp	scp
i find that it s easier to transfer it through an external file transfer mechanism ftp scp http-post etc... then write your own to chunks it into the db

1890821
contains	set
now set cflags and cxxflags to contains the -m32 switching to force 32-bit mode

1890821
32-bit	64bit
x11 works as expected. you may be able to get a 64bit x11 building running without the carbon dependency but i haven t tried this yet only 32-bit

1890828
file-manager	upload
i can view other files in the upload folder with the file-manager that i ftp in and can also create folder with fck

this goes only for project a i can building and run project b as many time as i like i never get the messages that the installation failed

1890871
png	gif
i have some code that if javascript is available it will remove a gif image and replace it with a png image

1890871
png	gif
the png is display none and the gif is visible

1890882
credentials	account
you can t create a database account without already having the account credentials needed to login to the server and create another account for your application

1890882
credentials	account
besides it is very common for users to have to provide database account credentials during installation setup time even if it is annoying

1890916
scheme	forth
each account client customer should be allowed to store different settings such as a color scheme their subdomain their preferred authentication mechanism and .so forth

1890941
jquery	.post
you can submit .postdata with jquery by using the .post methods

1890952
transparency	frame
.when aero is enabled however the titlebar text is rendering with a totally transparency background and thus is mostly whatever color the dwm is tinting the frame with

1890971
credentials	account
this code would then need to take the credentials the user supplied find the relevant directory entry for that user then read the information about the account reset flags and such

1890988
xsd	xml
then your xml docs are read into those classes which are typed according to how you defined your xsd

1891014

.when the cell isn t selected highlight i cgimagecreatewithmask with a square of the proper color and the mask then drawatpoint it into the image i m building

1891024
selected	cell	highlight	selected	highlight	cell
however .when the cell is selected or highlight i d like to instead use the mask to instead punch through my image appropriately

1891049
contains	sorted
given the following structure can the div which contains the sortable list be sorted

1891049
contains	elements	contains	any
is there any limitation with jquery where it can t sort parent elementss which contains an already sortable list or is it because the parent is a div and not an li elements

1891056
put	get
you can put that kind of code in separate files that get loaded at runtime and can be fiddled with to anyone s heart s content

1891059
textbox	button
i want to simply put a button in between them and about centered with the textbox height

1891059
textbox	button
i would like the left textbox move over .so it line up with the words jump to customer and customer # and then have the right box be the same distance on the right with the next button maybe a just 10px higher but still centered as it is

1891059
textbox	button	put	get
all of those was to attempt to put spaces between the button and the textbox because i couldn t get float nor margins to work

1891074
numerical	matrix
if you want to do numerical process with 3-d matrix you are better of using numpy

1891091
python	java
at the end of the day an .app engine .app is just python code or java code

1891095
templating	jinja2
use jinja2 -- an almost django-like templating systemd

1891104
silverlight	wpf
i m also considering using silverlight for the online portion and a separate wpf project for the desktop

1891105
value	field
i want to create a field that looks like this ....can any one tell me how this could be done which field could i use where in i can selected value by using the trackball wheel or in case of storm i could slide.

1891113
click	mouse
this is a terrible way to go about doing what you are trying to do and i speak from experience i inherited a calendar tool that figures out what day of the month you click on based on your mouse co-ordinates

1891116
arrays	loops
the inner loops starts at pos-1 and scans upwards in memory until .some random conditional is met - it does not checked if it has passed the end of the arrays .so will run merrily on until it crash or the end conditional happens to be met by the undefined contents of the memory it is corrupting

1891122
carbon	cocoa
i d prefer cocoa but will be willing to go carbon if i must

1891126
dictionary	arrays
i have to second what leonardo-santagada suggested with the addition that creating n dimension arrays lists is very unpythonic and you should reconsider how you re keeping your data and seeing if it doesn t belong better in a class or a list of dictionary or dictionary of lists

1891127
webforms	asp.net
i have an asp.net webforms site that is used mainly for managing data

1891127
checkbox	textbox
i want to make a page that can dynamically load up a table of controls for each recording with a labels for the named and either a textbox for a string nubmer or a checkbox for a value that is true or false - i ll assume it s boolean.

1891127
checkbox	textbox	datagrid	textbox
if not - if i wanted to just dynamically load labels and textbox checkbox into a collections to display what would be a good control to use for the collections datagrid repeater etc.

1891146
canvas	scale
i am not using a canvas to lay everything out because i want the button relative positioning to be dynamic and i do not want everything to scale at the same rate like a viewbox does

1891149
asp.net-mvc	webforms
do you use classic webforms controls what would be not recomded in asp.net-mvc terminology

1891149
input-field	checkbox
anyway if the image is only display in the view it is not posted .when the user submit the form because only input-field checkbox textfield hiddens are submited to the server

1891152
decrement	increment
the only difference between the standards insertion-sort algorithm and your code is that you re increment i instead of decrement

1891169
groovy	java
is something like groovy or javafx really a wrapper for something that technically could be written in java

1891179
meta-inf	jar
after a .post to the webtier mailing list i was told that the jar file must have a meta-inf faces-config.xml file that has a root faces-config elements with a versioning of 2.0

1891192
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch blocks should only be used .when you can fix the error are catching inorder to perform cleanup before rethrowing database rollback or in a top level catch to log the exception-handling before crash

1891221
tuples	any
i m writing this because actually we developed a .solution for very similar problem we must be able to operate with our own tuples without boxing - mainly to compare and deserialize them tuples are used by database engine we develop .so performance of any basic operation is really essential in our case

1891224
exception-handling	try-catch
putting a try-catch block at a high level is useful if you wish to log exception-handling

1891236
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
.so why not have an ajax scripting that listens for keyboard activity and mouse movement and lets the server know that the user is still there and active even if they aren t click a submit button or following a link

1891239
revision	svn
for instances on my per.sonnal svn server for a web-project my blog which is not that big the svn repository has a size of 181 mb -- and there are no more than 150 revision or .so i ve stopped using svn for that project

1891239
revision	svn
and yet another project small website only a couple of revision as it s a website i don t maintain anymore and for which i just svn my svn server as a backup mecanism has a repository size of 22m

1891240
checkbox	textbox
if the value looks like a bool using tryparse it rendering a checkbox otherwise it puts the value in a textbox

1891250
virtual-keyboard	focus
if your virtual-keyboard is local to a certain windows depending on the complexity of what you re doing you can take an approach i ve used in the past where you just manually fill in keyboard characters into the textbox that has focus

1891262
getter	setter
uniform access principles - no more getter and setter

1891276
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
if you put these events on keyboard or mouse click how many time are you going to be posting to the server

1891276
click	mouse
in the first case navigating between pages and in the second mouse click

1891280
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
as for the javascript this is something you can do with firebug at least for firefox and similar tools are include or can be found for ie google-chrome and safari

1891292
groovy	java
while i did more in the past i ve only done a little java recently and never javafx or groovy

1891294
silverlight	wpf
well mvvm is really a wpf and silverlight specific design pattern

1891300
internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
window.event.srcelement.options window.event.srcelement.selectedindex .value works in internet-explorer and google-chrome but not in firefox

1891317
groovy	scala
there are also other languages that run on the jvm which are being played with for android development groovy jython scala sorry no link for that one

1891367
contains	elements
to ensure that you don t initially selected too many .quote-body elementss i m first selecteded the .quote-body elementss that are immediate children of the contains elements

1891372
attributes	properties
an idea would be to decorator properties with attributes that tell it not to be show

1891382
markup	xhtml
firebug s representation of your markup might be different from the actual xhtml because it tries to normalize the markup and that s what the xpath queries are generator against rather than the actual underlying xhtml

1891406
environment	building
trying to use binaries can be a real problem if you need to use shared code on different platform building environment or even if you need different building options such as static vs

1891406
libpng	zlib
i typically set project up to building as much from source on-demand as possible even with third-party code such as zlib and libpng

1891408
postgresql	mysql
i have quite long query with q with sqlite3 works very well but with postgresql or mysql i have strange error for postgresql and for mysql truncated incorrect double value

1891410
communication	messages
for example we had a communication libs that had an api for sending a messages a block of data with a messages id over a socket pipe whatever

1891410
subdirectories	symlink
then the top-level directory gets linked with all the subdirectories libs into the executable and a symlink is created again naked after the top-level directory

1891423
variables	boolean
i don t seem to have this problem with other variables types like boolean or string

1891429
python	ruby
i m spending today learning ruby from a python perspective

1891440
cos	sin
the cos and sin gives you the x and y step to keep your object moving along 30 degrees

1891443
attributes	properties
you can use the mask properties of the cell s calayer calayer mask attributes

1891471
python	ruby
i d first strongly recommend that you don t try and directly transfer your python knowledge to ruby - it s better to learn the idioms of ruby and apply them directly rather than try to transfer python directly

1891475
markup	xhtml
if you want proper markup that won t break your page .when they accidentally leave a div open the best first step is to parsing it as xhtml and refuse it with an error if it s not well-formed xml

1891478
firefox	opera
the problem is due to a long movie preload and this happens on firefox and opera browsers .when loading wmp videos

1891478
player	movie
i have solved this problem by forcing the wmp player to play two movie using a playlist mpu file

1891480
constructor	object
i have a class that creates an appdomain in the constructor to be used over the lifetime of the object

1891498
put	get
i d assume you managed to get this application put together and compiled in an ide maybe eclipse

1891523
silverlight	wpf
i am agree with both of you but just like to add another pattern mvp model-view presenter which is best suitable for asp.net and windows form but can t use for wpf and silverlight

1891523
silverlight	wpf
mvvm is specially design for wpf and silverlight applications

1891528
culture	locale
or for your datetime case it s not a valid date-time string for the current culture 12 31 2009 12 34 56 .when you re in a dd mm yyyy locale

1891541
python	c++	python	java
swig is a great tool for generator wrapper in other languages such as java python or c# for existing c++ object

1891549
value	field
what is the named of the field in financial_statement object that holds the value you want

1891571
python	c++
mit for example uses python for some programming 101 courses -- and yet most definitely that doesn t turn students off harder languages such as c or even c++ which is harder yet

1891573
ocaml	sml
this has nothing to do with rec being default in sml but not ocaml

1891583
classnotfoundexception	noclassdeffounderror
in both case search engines like jarfinder.com or docjar.com or jarhoo.com might help you to identify missing jars and to solve your classnotfoundexception or noclassdeffounderror

1891587
firefox	safari
it works for me ie safari firefox by just changing your this.checked to checked

1891594
masstransit	nservicebus
try nservicebus masstransit or rhino service bus

1891594
masstransit	nservicebus
there s actually .some good stuff about the three of them on .so nservicebus rhino service bus masstransit - videos demos learning re.sources

1891609
getter	setter
let s say i have a class called myclass marked as bindable that is composed of field each exposing a getter and setter

1891615
python	java
python exception-handling-handling are a bit like java there is a way to cause the exception-handling to be rethrown without truncation stack

1891634
versioning	upgrade
anyone who used gettext libs for ruby probably noticed that its activerecord integration has been broken with each ruby-on-rails major upgrade because alias versioning has been following the semantics of an old methods

1891636
duplicates	contains
and then you can use contains to find the duplicates

1891647
click	mouse
how can i send mouse click over this service

1891670
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately the result works only in ie and firefox not google-chrome

1891701
sql-server	mysql
relational databases in the vein of sql-server and mysql will support big blobs but aren t optimized for them

1891701
web-applications	webserver
most people equate image server to webserver because they work on web-applications and therefore have a de facto image repository a directory on a local disk

1891701
relative-path	unc
set up a file shared set read create but not modify delete permissions on it for all users of this .app-store the unc path .somewhere in the database .so you don t have to redeploy the .app if you decide to relocate it and have your client .application generator a unique relative-path using .something reliable like a guid

1891727
oracle	mysql
does zend_db provide an abstraction .so i don t need to concern myself with how the backend oracle mysql etc. expects its dates

1891728
ruby	php
does this mean that dynamic scripting like ruby php aren t under this license

1891739
linux	unix
also matz has admitted that on windows ruby runs significantly slower i think he said almost 20 time slower than it does on unix linux

1891775
scala	java
would have made the transitions from java to scala easier not by much but little bit

1891797
python	perl
if not please no python or perl etc

1891804
scala	java
scala has a much neater systemd of type-inference than java does

1891832
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort and mergesort are two examples of this kind of problem which

1891864
malloc	strcat
i made a string with malloc and initializer it...then i did several strcat with it...and then i declare a file pointer...after that and if my string had more than approx

1891867
where-clause	sql
the optimizer will parsing the query and put all the information about the sql statement in the plan_table table which you can then query to checked if it s really a selected operation which tables indexes from which schema are being accessed if the where-clause is something you approve of if there s any bad operations such as cartesian join or full table scans etc

1891895
append	input
on first thread read your input files format a result line and append it to a stringbuilder

1891900
python	ruby
not to exclude ruby or python it s just more of a household named imho

1891919
lan	wan
the first step is to forwarding portss on your router .so that connecting to your router on ports 3689 from the dorm s lan from the router s perspective this is the wan connect to ports 3689 on your laptop from the router s perspective this is the lan

1891944
show	next
the next code show what i want to achieve

constructor	object
one approach would be to pass an arrays of types object to the slot constructor

1 if i have different data formats to rendering in json xml html and iphone and they all use the same url differing by the .format at the end is this considered content duplication

1895536
calloc	malloc
since you re calling malloc from your calloc function i m going to assume it looks something like this

1895536
decrement	increment
you would do this by storing the desired value in a loops which increment the pointers and decrement the count until the count reaches zero

1895536
calloc	malloc
to write a basic calloc in terms of just malloc

json	xml
the reason i am bringing this stuff up is because it seems that many people are switching from xml as a datasource to json which makes more sense as a datasource

1895647
constructor	object
no sense creating a constructor that nobody s ever supposed to call to create an object with no prototype .when you can just defined the object directly

1895647
constructor	object
on the other hand if you want your singleton to be an instances of .some existing class -- that is you want it to have .some other object as its prototype -- then you do need to use a constructor function .so that you can set its prototype properties before calling it

1895652
pixels	line
simply scan the entire pixels line in

1895652
pixels	line
if you have a line of pixels then the sampling is already done

one way to avoid the associations table is to have each of the main tables contains something like a set of cross-referenced entries in the other table - assuming your dbms even supports such a construct

1896530
buffering	streaming
the file api uses bufferinging streaming .so even if you read byte by byte the api internally reads buffering by buffering

1896550

1896686
unsigned	short
void getpeer unsigned short ports std string peer

1896687
arguments	default
the ndarrays.sort routine which sorts in-place can also take keyword arguments or but it appears neither of these is capable of sorting on a recording arrays which incidentally i used as the only way i could see to sort the columns together as opposed to the default which would sort them independently totally messing up your data

1896707
any	set
is there any way to set the bounds of a all listview items in largeicon mode to a specific size

.when declaring a tabglib like you did the uri is used to uniquely identify each taglib in an internal registry of taglib much like a key is used to set get value from a hashmap or hashtable in java

1896812
versioning	upgrade
or and this this imho the preferred solution upgrade your jstl versioning to match the versioning expected by the jsps use jstl 1.1

1896813
exception-handling	try-catch

if your table allows null but never actually contains any null value you might not notice the difference between which is as someone has pointed out redundant and but the difference here will actually be that the latter returns an whereas the former returns

1896860
variables	boolean
in that case you want to make sure you selected .value and not the entire nullable as a nullable boolean cannot be assign to a boolean variables

1896863

1896987
32-bit	64bit
according to getsizeof on my 32-bit ubuntu systemd a tuples has an overhead of 32 bytes and an int takes 12 bytes .so each row in your file takes a 56 bytes + a 4 byte pointers in the list - i presume it will be a lot more for a 64bit systemd

binary-tree	nodes	traversal	parent
if your binary-tree nodess have pointers to their parent nodes then you can traversal directly from the nodes to the successor nodes

1897440
traversal	parent
you will have to determine how to use the parent pointers to do the traversal

1897440
binary-tree	tree	binary-tree	nodes	traversal	parent
if your binary-tree nodess do not have parent pointerss then you will have to do an inorder traversal of the tree starting at the root presumably you have a root nodes pointers and return the next nodes after the given nodes

all of these are simple functions that don t required a lot of room to work and keep in mind the compiler will inline these msot likely removing a function-call

1897505
constructor	object
move the new random to the constructor or a static variables and use the generator object

1897539

1897583
contains	any
and considering that the text itself doesn t contains any

1897586
environment	restart
since i use sudo to restart apache sudo apachectl restart the environment variables evaluates to the proper username on whichever machine i m on

1897595
json	csv
however if you choose not to reap the benefits of all the baked in magic associated with associations then i would recommend yaml or json over csv

1897610

all i did was have the object self inspect its field and call the object constructor of those field within the object itself

1897818
solaris	aix	solaris	linux	solaris	unix	linux	aix	linux	unix	unix	aix
if you really mean unix and not linux i would recommend solaris eclipse does run on solaris and it s much easier to understand than aix

1897818
ubuntu	linux
if you mean linux too i would recommend a distro designed for servers like rhel centos rather than ubuntu or fedora

1897825
webmail	gmail
gmail can be used to link mailto - .so webmail is not an issue if it is well written

1897864
mac-address	subnet
for the recording unless you are parked on the same subnet as the mac-address and have an active connection -- you received an ip-address from the access points -- there is no way to determine a wifi ap s ipv4 address without external factors even with mac-address in hand

1897868
script-tag	iframe
my guess is that you will find part of the file deleted at the end and replace by an iframe or script-tag

1897874

googling indicated that this was due to a versioning mismatch and that i should upgrade to the latest versioning of distribute .so i did .so to 0.6.10

1898066
subclassing	superclass
in terms of the java language .when a subclassing is created the superclass is also construct either implicit or explicit

1898066
subclassing	superclass
.so .when a superclass has a private member this is still part of the subclassing object in terms of memory jvm etc

1898066
instances	private	subclassing	superclass
for instances a methods on the superclass which uses a private member can be called from the subclassing without problem

1898066
subclassing	superclass
.so at .some level you could argue that subclassing do have-a private field of the superclass but i d argue this is at a physical level not a conceptual one and can be disregarded

1898081
stdin	pipe
the pipe send the stdout from find into stdin for cksum

1898095

1898197
shutdown	restart	value	field
if the ...facts of which views are showing and... the value of view field are to be persistent ie survive .app shutdown restart the viewmodel is part of the model -- otherwise it is not

1898197
getter	setter
if the complexity of validation rules is such that merely validation a successful user form fill or incoming messages against a list of field regular expression and numeric ranges and checked any object against a caching or specially fetched copy of relevant reference object and or key is enough to guarantee that updates to business-object will be with integrity and the rules are tested by the application as part of the event handler then the model can just have simple getter and setter

1898197
any	set	getter	setter
the other way the model ends up getting more complex than a bunch of field with possibly simple getter setter is if you start enhancing classes getter setter with an o2r mapper tool or adding extra aspects like call to transactional monitor apis security apis to checked permissions for logging etc account apis methods that prefetch any related data needed for a get or set or whatever upon get or set

1898198
python	php
ie php or python i believe this will help you transitions semi-smoothly

instances	destroy
how do i explicit destroy an ejb instances in code and take it out of circulation

1898448
stdin	eof
they never receive an eof on stdin

1898517
postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
reason being if you changed databases - this statement wouldn t need to be changed to work on oracle postgresql sql-server etc

1898523
mstest	nunit
as far as knowing which assert fails .when there are several in one function you will note that both nunit and mstest give you both a description and a link .when an assert fails that will take you right to the offending line nunit will required an integration tool such as testdriven.net

1898551
configuration	environment
i poked around a bit here and on google at large and didn t see anything that directly addressed this problem--i would think that the console and server would both use the gem_path in the environment configuration

1898552

debugging	trace
note trace can only be viewed on debugging mode in flex

1898789
contains	any
yes unless your selected contains an indexed field preferrably a primary key or clustered index searches will in general be performed linearly since any query optimization cannot be done to determine the data order or layout

1898820
value	field
finally the snippet proposed used and left outer-join which would allow the result to include recordinging with just the data from table x and null value in lieu of the field value normally coming from y in case a given x recording has a cosub value not found in y

1898860
abstract	extends	implements	abstract	implements	extends
i m new to php and was trying to create an abstract-class with a mix of abstract and non-abstract-methods and then extends the class to implements the abstract-methods

1898950
memcached	ncache
apart from memcached and appfabric velocity there are commercial solutions like ncache or oracle coherence

1898953

an idea is to survey your proposed customer base .so see which linux versioning they run and make a short list from their feedback

1898953
opensuse	rpm
with rpm you cater for the latest fedora opensuse rhel sles and derived distros which is a fair chunks of the corporate market

1898967
python	java
yet this text insists that a visitor is the right way to go and in java at that which means it can be done without the flexibility of python

1898971

1899075
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
anyways if anyone could go into details of asp.net webforms minus the asp controls versus asp.net-mvc framework i would be greatly appreciated

1899090
callback	methods
spl_autoloader_register registers a callback methods that will be called .when your code is trying to use a not-known class

1899092
callback	methods
the doctrine example you give is using what is called a callback to register a methods inside of a class

1899092
callback	methods
a callback is simply an arrays contains the classnamed for static-methodss or an instances of that class for non-static-methodss and the methods named

1899099
contains	any
the problem with this of course is its going to selected any of the divs that contains the numbers 1 and not just the one that only containss 1

1899112
python	tcl
you can use expect tcl or pexpect python to do this

1899117
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you re going to find a numbers of difference and reasons to use asp.net-mvc over webforms but it s going to depend on whether those difference are important to you or your project
