5109631
children	parent
i just wrapped my editor template in a div so it can be easily grabbed as a whole from jquery cloned it emptied the values of the inputs and incremented the counter for each element so when posted i get a collection of children entities on my parent without having to explicitly catch them in the method or pull them from the formcollection dictionary

5109631
children	parent
also if the form errors since the parent object has the multiple children they get auto rendered automatically by my form code and nothing is lost because of client side additions

5109657
for-loop	loops
i left the inner loops in place but changed it to a for-loop since that makes all the control happen in one place

5109658
rubygems	bundler

5109912
queue	fifo
or maybe there s some way of expliaining it as a towers of hanoi type game although with fifo queue instead of lifo stacks

5109913
mpmedialibrary	mpmediaquery
the only way for now i found is to check lastmodificationdate of mpmedialibrary - as long as it s changing you won t get results using mpmediaquery - delay your changes to a moment when that property stops changing by any way you like and you should be fine

5109945

and it works in every other html5 compatible browser safari 5 google-chrome 9 firefox but in ie9 rc i get the following errors

5120882
exponent	modulo
the public key is well public which means that you can export it actually in your code you already have the modulo and exponent as array of bytes and there are no gotchas about secret data leakage through a careless implementation since there is no secret key here

5120902
getter	setter
is it not possible to have getter and setter split between interfaces

5120913

5121144
getter	setter
in school they taught us to use getter and setter in java

5121171
getter	setter
quite the opposite getter and setter are one of the cornerstones of oop where such side effects are desired

5121200
getter	setter
getter or setter by themselves are not bad oo design

5121200
getter	setter
what is bad is coding practice which includes a getter and a setter for every single member automatically whether that getter setter is needed or not coupled with making members public which should not be public - because this basically exposes class s implementation to outside world violating the information hiding abstraction

5121203
jsf	wicket	jsf	stripes	wicket	stripes
when you ask a question like that on so without providing details about what your situation is what kind of problems you are having besides new people not knowing it what your future needs are that you are considering alternatives to it etc then people have a tendency to respond with their favorite framework be it spring wicket jsf stripes gwt etc which at this point becomes irrelevant to you

there is a progress event that gets triggered when each file downloads however its payload does not include the file name in any browser that i ve tested with google-chrome safari firefox beta

5121317
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome displays the file name in the console though as far as i know it s inaccessible to js but neither safari nor firefox even go that far

5121317
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i should add that in google-chrome not in safari or firefox you can at least get a count of files to be downloaded allowing you to at least calculate an accurate progress bar

5121335
free	malloc
how do free and malloc work in c

5121366
free	malloc
this is exactly why you should only ever call free on a pointer that was returned by malloc

5121370
free	malloc
this of course mean that you can only free memory that corresponds to a block previously allocated by malloc

5121400
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
every free call must be paired with a malloc realloc call which knows the size request

verilog	vhdl
verilog just like vhdl is meant to describe hardware

5121853
verilog	vhdl
in practice verilog and vhdl do not offer the same features as programming languages even though they look very much alike

5121853
verilog	vhdl
generate loop in verilog vhdl describes multiple parallel instances of a same hardware building block say a and logic gate

5121853
verilog	vhdl
typically a beginner in verilog vhdl will be tempted to translate a given function algorithm from a c c++ type of pseudocode directly to verilog vhdl surprisingly it might sometimes work but it always lead to dramatically poor design

5121853
verilog	vhdl
one must really be aware of these differences in order to become a good verilog vhdl programmer

you could use raw apc memcached or you could use an abstraction layer such as cache_lite or zend_cache .

5122145

the recommended practice if you have addresses that you know should geocode to a specific location is to build a cache and use local client-side geocoding

5123495
geocoding	geocode
when your application receives a geocode request for a known address the response would come from your cache rather than google s geocoding servers

multiplying	multiplication
now matrix multiplication generally isn t commutative so when adding a transformation by multiplying your matrix you need to specify whether you re left-multiplying or right-multiplying

5123824
width	height
you can calculate the width then hide the scroll bar with overflow hidden then add a div on the left with same height as the box you want to scroll and same width as the user s scrollbar then write a script that scrolls the right box to the same position as the one on the left thus imitating built in system scrollbars

5123855

5124094
int	chars
and the chars type can be promoted to int

5124104
int	chars
you can use a value of type chars every where a value of type int is allowed and apart from string concatenation and where there are two methods of both types it works the same as the int obtained by casting

5124363
versioning	upgrade
i m under the impression that the upgrade is not simply linking to a new versioning of the django files but that we also need to manage the migration of our database since we rely on some built-in django apps django.contrib.auth django.contrib.sites etc.

minimum	max
and don t avoid this by just limiting the value to the max minimum of the type in question

5126224
switching	screens

post	get
what you need to do in this case is to tell fancyupload to append the cookie data to the request with the option appendcookiedata set to true and then reconstruct the session in the server based on that cookie data goes as part of the get or post request not as headers so most frameworks won t automatically handle this way of authentication

5126721

5127685
width	height
immediately after that at offset 8 there are the width and height values both 4 bytes wide i m not sure of the byte ordering

5127685
width	height
at offset 18 there is an int32 value specifying width and at offset 22 the height both will use little endian byte ordering

5127685
width	height
armed with this info you should be able to write a little bit of code to read the first 26 bytes of a file stream and from that determine the file type along with the width and the height

5127704

from my reading of the standard cout is an lvalue of type std ostream and ofstream tmp.txt is an rvalue of type std ofstream

5127938
std	ostream
neither has any cv-qualifiers and std ostream is a base class of std ofstream so the conditional operator is valid an the result is an rvalue and has type std ostream

5127938
std	ostream
the overload that you are using is a member of std ostream so there is no need to bind a temporary to a non-const reference the member can be called on a non-const rvalue

5127961
cpython	ironpython
i don t know if the current version of ironpython has an equivalent mechanism cpython only fixed it when pep 366 was included in version 2.6

5127976
disk	ram
mmap is a system call for mapping disk blocks into ram almost as if you were adding swap

5127976

you can t map the uncompressed data into ram with mmap as it is not on the disk

5128001
do.call	lapply
however for larger datasets and for situations where you don t necessarily need to return a full dataframe i would consider the following do.call + lapply solution

5128022
children	parent
on the show view of an existing parent i would like to have a form to create children

5128162
jython	pypy
use a python implementation with a more multicore friendly garbage collection mechanism such as jython ironpython or pypy

5128163
coalesce	nullif
however you can overwrite the value of a column in the output which is where you would typically use a case nullif or coalesce expression

5128174
post	get
is your form using method get instead of method post

5128176
textview	imageview
why will this code not draw a circle where the user touches in an imageview and output the coordinates to a textview

5128183
inherited	subclassing
you could try to create a subclassing of listviewitem but since that class inherited directly from system.object and is not an actual windows form control you might be borrowing trouble as you would need to replicate all the functionality of the inherited chain of an actual control

5128185
width	height
after i log out the width height of the bitmap it tells me an other value then the bitmap realy is

5128193

it is shown properly in google-chrome opera ie and safari but not in firefox it falls back to arial

5128214
memcached	apc
you could use apc s cache instead of memcached

5128224
google-chrome	firefox
full code just replace your parsexml function and test it on google-chrome or firefox with firebug

5128260
mdpi	hdpi
you can t specify whether it is in mdpi hdpi or whatever it will choose the version that match your running system

5128260
mdpi	hdpi
suppose you are using a hdpi device but no mdpi resource is defined what it will do is take your mdpi resource and during decode it will make it into hdpi it enlarge your mdpi bitmap to about 1.5x larger

gentoo	linux
i am running gentoo linux amd64 64bit testing with gcc 4.5.3 glibc 2.13 and glib 2.26.1

5128351
for-loop	arrays
ideally the check would be contained within a for-loop without creating any other arrays

5128355
ienumerable	ienumerator
then i would remove the ienumerable and ienumerator from the viewmodeltables class unless you have a specific reason why they are on the class definition

5128376
int	chars
edit the reason i say that this isn t particularly pretty is that my array is actually referenced by chars values not int

5128381
inherited	properties
you could inherited from the current ones and then specify further properties such as db connection string to use when getting the resources from your custom provider

5128382

submit	submission
in my add_page.php page i am submission a form and saving a message in submit action in the session and then re-directing to index.php page using header location ...

5128560
outputstream	inputstream
you can use the url and urlconnection classes to obtain inputstream and outputstream to files located on an ftp server

5128585
int	chars
the reason that is that the string is apparently downcast to an int in a string int comparison and string_index is parsed until a chars is encountered that is not a digit thereby evaluating to the empty string which equals 0

5128614
google-chrome	safari
in ie8 google-chrome and safari the favicon shows up fine

5128630
cpu	processors
also when a device generates an interrupt to the cpu whether it is the kernel or the processors which is responsible for the execution of the interrupt routines

width	height
at a first look i just notice a big contentsize width and a small height .

5128684
hash	hmac
in cryptography hmac hash-based message authentication code is a specific construction for calculating a message authentication code mac involving a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key

5128684
hash	hmac	hash	md5	hmac	md5
any cryptographic hash function such as md5 or sha-1 may be used in the calculation of an hmac

5128684
hash	hmac
the cryptographic strength of the hmac depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function the size of its hash output length in bits and on the size and quality of the cryptographic key

5128684
hash	hmac	hash	md5	hmac	md5
the size of the output of hmac is the same as that of the underlying hash function 128 or 160 bits in the case of md5 or sha-1 respectively although it can be truncated if desired

i would like to take the photo and crop resize it to 200 width by 150 height even if it means doing it destructively

5128720
pseudo-class	visited
for the best browser support includes ancient but not quite forgotten browsers use the link and visited pseudo-class instead of the attribute selector combining both will match the same as

5128722
qimage	qwidget
the paint device could be implemented by the qwidget qimage qpixmap qglpixelbuffer qpicture and qprinter subclasses

5128734
width	height
add width and height attributes to the images

5128734
width	height
all of this happens before the image is loaded and since there are no width or height attributes the dimensions come out way off

5128760
mockito	jmock
this will allow you to use mock implementations of those interfaces in your unit tests jmock mockito etc

5128777
width	height
all you really have to implement in a manager is the sublayout method which is where you call layoutchild f width height on all your fields and then setpositionchild to exactly place them

5128786
width	height
we have some measures for the grid like grid height grid width and tile height width

5128786
isometric	draw
we do not have the isometric positions for the rectangle but rather have the normal draw coordinates for the grid where the top left hand corner is 0 0 and south is y+ right is x+

5128786
width	height
if we had the top left height width of the rectangle in question - how could we calculate an array of iso-cells that crossed by the bottom edge of the rectangle

5128904
webclient	webrequest
imo unless you are doing something particularly subtle it is often a good idea to use webclient which is a wrapper around webrequest etc that greatly simplifies the api - for example you can just call the uploaddata method or downloadstring etc

5128988
postgresql	mysql
relstorage supports postgresql oracle and mysql backends

5129059
outputstream	inputstream
if you connect the serial port-s rxdata with the txdatapin and the rts with the cts pin then the integration test can check that every thing send into outputstream should be received by the inputstream

5129063

5129247
strftime	strtotime
use strftime or date not strtotime

5129268
crossover	mutation
it is probably worth some consideration as to what representation you want these programs in because if you plan to perform crossover mutation on them then a string representation is probably not ideal

children	parent
i have been reading about storing nested data and the examples i have come across so far demonstrate on how one can create and manage an hierarchy of nodes in a database table when using the nested set model.i am wondering if a table parent can have children tables nodes .by table i mean the ordinary mysql table with data of course

5129699
implements	extends
i find it a little bit odd that t has to extends executable rather than implements it in the source code but then t could end up being an interface itself so i guess it makes sense.

5129718
post	get
use requestparam - it will work with both get and post requests

5129735
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
if you are in a navigationcontroller then you have to use pushviewcontroller animated to drill down and popviewcontroller animated to go back

put	get
step 1 put in in your code and see if you get a time out

5129947
floating-point	integer
that s because you re doing integer division instead of floating-point division

5129953
min	max
if you take a look at the reference documentation you ll see that the min max annotations both have an impact on the hibernate metadata while decimalmin decimalmax don t

5129953
min	max
also max min accept a long value while decimalmax decimalmin accept the string representation of a bigdecimal which makes these the only possible choice if you re dealing with big numbers that exceed long.max_value or are under long.min_value

5130201
octal	decimal
01602 - this 0 at the beginning means you are using octal rather than decimal numbers

5131091
manipulators	iomanip
take a look at the setfill and setw manipulators in iomanip

5131096
portrait	landscape
this works fine for portrait orientation but when in landscape the text view grows to accommodate the additional horizontal space which is desired but the above code makes the height larger than the content

subtract	add
so just add 128 subtract key_c and do modulo 127 again to keep in range

5131304
cpu	processors
this approach is problematic for multiprocessor operating systems when one cpu is idling in a process thread that another cpu wants to dispatch to and is why the idea of a special process thread that was always ready to run one per processors in the system so that the cpu could idle in its own private thread context became the norm

5131375
post	get
the best way to go about is to do a on you query and get the count like it s demonstrated in this post beforehand

5134358
serializable	deserialization
on the other hand if there s very little logic other than calling into your serializable deserialization code then it s often acceptable to skip the unit tests and run integration tests that test the full cycle create a bobject in memory persist it via calling saveobject read it back out using getobject ensure that it is equal equivalent to the one you persisted in the first place

5134735
folder	directory
the adt creates a bin folder which contains all of the class files for all matching source file and directory in your project you could using the jar command create a jar archive containing these class files and directory and presumable your library but of course the class files platform level would only be targeted for current level of the project build- you would need a different jar file for each platform level

5134762
implements	extends
now you only have your new parsers implements the new messageobjectparser interface which should extends the old parser

5134779
unsigned	short
the range of a unsigned short is 0 - 65535

5134789
unsigned	short
the range of a unsigned short is 0-65535 so 70000 doesn t fit into it 2 bytes use a datatype with 4 bytes instead unsigned int should work you can check the size with sizeof

5134797
unsigned	short
...although just u unsigned int rather than unsigned short would probably work as well because the short will get promoted to int when it gets pushed on the stack for printf

5134797

i realize that the linked answer applies to linux unix hosts but i just tested your code on a windows 7 machine and verified that it also sends tcp packets to the echo port 7 rather than an icmp echo request

your java program not being able to send and receive icmp packets to test for the reachability of the remote windows host will attempt to initiate a tcp connection to the remote windows host by sending a syn synchronize packet to port 7

it doesn t really make sense not least in terms of network overhead to have one-connection-per-query tcp ip on the back end when there s only udp ip on the front end

5136925

moreover a properly written forwarding proxy dns server has to cope with large udp ip packets truncated responses truncated and otherwise malformed queries tcp ip connection timeouts and resets loop detection and dns udp ip retry

5137071
for-loop	arrays
both of those could probably be overcome by changing things around so that your keyword appears first on the line but now you have keyword somestuff where the name of the arrays is somestuff and you re firmly within the pattern that most of the other modules have carved out -- only if you re generating a for-loop you ll probably be leaving the block as a genuine block instead of getting it to be parsed as a sub definition instead

3.9.1 4 unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

5139860
integer	unsigned
this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

5139873
stdout	stderr
the buffering characteristics of stdout and stderr vary depending upon if they are connected to a terminal pipes files etc

5139873

width	height
have you thought about creating a div that s absolutely positioned -10000px left and top height width 1px and then throwing all of the images in there with html

5140500
int	chars
chars is not an allowed type for bit fields they must be of type int

5140686
stdout	stderr
then you can append a redirection to you command so that stderr is redirected to stdout and retrieved in the fd

5140686
stdout	stderr
if you really need your stdout and stderr separated then you need to implement an advanced popen that will also redirect stderr by yourself

i thought of changing the stdout and stderr streams of console by calling console.setout and seterror before calling the tool s main function

5141887
ant	maven
or you could consider creating an ant script for maven

the specialty is i am overriding the setter getter of width height and also scalex scaley of my component because i want to do some special stuff there but of course i still call super.width .

5143092
width	height
but at runtime now i had to find that neither my overridden width or height setters nor my overridden scalex scaley setters are ever called

5143701
int	double
you need to call __m128 _mm_cvtpd_ps __m128d a cvtdp2ps twice to get two single precision float vectors each containing two of your original double precision values then merge these two float vectors into a single vector using __m128 _mm_shuffle_ps __m128 a __m128 b unsigned int imm8 shufps

bmp	pbm
besides bmp other file formats that store literal bitmaps include interleaved bitmap ilbm portable bitmap pbm x bitmap xbm and wireless application protocol bitmap wbmp

from what i can see in the infos you gave i d reckon that on your system some old header is included which defines max and min as macros

5155793
min	max
you ll need to identify the header or source file which defines max min and try to figure out if there is a way to configure the source code to build without that header

5155793
min	max
duplicated definitions usually mean that the code needs cleanup anyway so you could start by removing the macros and replacing max min with std max std min

5156194
width	height
width and height parameters might query string parameters

5156229
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
it would be much easier to use a control like the repeater gridview or listview instead which is built to display a dynamic number of comments

5156233
width	height
div s should update height and width automatically unless otherwise told to

5156252
inherited	properties
but don t get confused with them you will rarely need to use primitive wrappers because even if primitive values are not objects you can still access their inherited properties for example on a string you can access all members of string.prototype

accessor	properties
that s because the properties accessor the dot in this case temporarily converts the primitive value to an object for being able to resolve the indexof properties up in the prototype chain

5160796
width	height
the width and height attributes are used to stop the page from loading and growing in a disjointed manner

5160796
width	height
adding an id to every image just to specify its width and height would be ludicrous and just almost as messy as adding the two width height attributes anyway

5160796
width	height
the catch is firefox not using the width and height attributes to reserve the images space however im surprised they haven t updated it actually

5160824

post	get	post	put	put	get
so in a nutshell i have a route that matches on certain http verbs like get and post but on other http verbs like put and delete it should return a specific error

5160860
post	get
the thing is i have a ton of routes like get and post where i have an httpmethodconstraint and where i would have to create a route like the badfoo route just to catch a correct match on the route string but not on the method which blows up my routing unnecessarily

5160860
post	get
how could i setup routing with only the get post and notfound routes while still differentiating between a http 404 not found invalid url and http 405 method not allowed valid url wrong http method

5160876

can the browser redirection send a payload in a http post get to the redirected url

5160999
post	get
just make sure you dont confuse your get and your post you seem to be passing user password data which should be on the _post object of php or you might even consider using _request

5161007

just to add to the answers you already have this isn t a matter of polymorphism it s a problem of type specialization

5161022

5161049
accessor	properties
then i would recommend making myaddviewcontroller a properties on mainviewcontroller and write a custom accessor

5161101
lisp	prolog
the correspondence can be very close as between fortran and assembly or more distant prolog or lisp and assembly but as long as it s possible to produce a vast number of behaviors through a coherent input language it s a compiler

5161105
put	get
i want to use projection to get all of the entities for an agent at once to put in a hierarchichal treeview

i was thinking of creating an interface that extends from recordable and errorable and having upload__module implements that but i don t know what to call it

min	max
write a template function vectormaxmin that will accept a vector and a number indicating the size of the vector and will return the max and the min values of the vector .

5161616
min	max
create a class vector to avoid the size passing value and control the insertions and can get from this the max and min values.

5161616
min	max
when i read the problem i thought in a tuple to return max min values is it correct

5161687
getattr	setattr
as an alternative to update you could override getattr and setattr for your class instead

5161894
width	height
i am able to manually set the width and height of the frame to force the view to resize but this breaks the dynamic nature of the view

5161894

for example if i manually set the width the height doesn t adjust as the content doesn t re-layout

assuming your have setup your project with a scm maven will ignore the .svn directory and as long as your eclipse properties files aren t within your src folder you won t get those either

the thing i want to get to work is the values be shown after i switch to another radio set for example if i click on the first radio set which is model it correctly give me subtract or add values but when i click on size radio set the set values from the model radio set disappears is there any way i could make them stay there regardless what ever set i click next

5162078
devise	cancan
i successfully made login system with devise and cancan and i have 3 types of users

5162084
mouseover	mouseout
in my case i have a third party library not jquery centric that creates mouseover mouseout events on an element using addeventlistener attachevent

5162084
mouseover	mouseout
my solution thus far has been to simply unbind the mouseover mouseout

5162084
mouseover	mouseout
however every now and again an error can occur think validation error that results in the page not refreshing and i need to re-attach the mouseover mouseout event listeners

5162084
mouseover	mouseout
it s probably worth mentioning that because the mouseover mouseout event listeners are created and attached within a third party library i cannot simply assign the event to a variable and bind unbind it in that manner which afik is the best way to do this

5162110

5162390
inherited	properties
use .hasownproperty to skip inherited properties

5162392
inherited	properties
the reason why you want to use for and not for..in here is because for..in uses inherited properties of the iterated object so to avoid that you can use hasownproperty but in this case where you re only iterating over a numeric indice i think it s better to use a simple for-loop over using for..in and hasownproperty

5162440
put	get
i would say you need to put in about 80 hours of practice to master the basics so give yourself a month of self-learning to get to that point

5162482

5162623
hide	show
just show hide an absolutely positioned div on load

5162649

5162670
int	chars

tabcontrol	tabitem
how do i hook up my icommand to the tabitem or tabcontrol using just the xaml

5162858
integer	unsigned
as pointed out by james mcnellis it is not undefined to assign an unsigned int int_max to an integer - rather this is implementation defined

5162858
integer	unsigned
as such the context here is now specifically on my preference is to ensure this integer resets to zero when the unsigned int exceeds int_max

5162860
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
a for-loop will loops through a collection of data such as an arrays

the problem i see with the hashset intersect and other set theory answers is that you do contains duplicates and a set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements

5162911
getdate	datepart
the easiest workaround is creating a function call it gethour that returns datepart hh getdate

5162952
jstl	taglib
you need to declare the jstl core taglib in top of your jsp to get them to run

5162971
post	get
yes create a linkbutton have it post back to the server then get the information you need which may need to be loaded from the db and do a response.redirect instead

5162974
integer	unsigned
if all the shared values for int and unsigned int correspond and you want other unsigned values such as int_max + 1 to each have distinct values then you can only map them onto the negative integer values

5163006
post	get
no only get post are valid values for the method attribute

5163030
post	get
html up to version 4 only defines the use of post and get for forms

get post put and delete there are others are a part of the http standard but you are limited to get and post in html forms at this time

5163081
inherited	subclassing
edit one possibility that occurs to me is to go ahead and use regular django model inherited set the base goal class to abstract as required and create the sub-models and then instead of trying to query for goal entities creating a model for each user with a listfield that contains references to the various subclassing entities and retrieving the listfield

debian	linux
in debian linux file is located at etc mysql my.cnf

5163188
rar	zip
what i d do is try the using rar zip 7zip lzma with very small dictionary sizes otherwise they ll just use up too much space for preprocessed information and see how big the raw compressed file they produce is will probably have to use their libraries in order to make them strip headers to conserve space

5163198
pull	push
the good way uses only push pull and merge

5163256
google-chrome	firefox
thanks to everyone reminding me to debug in either firefox or google-chrome and adjusting the quotation marks

5163293
ubuntu	linux
if not i would suggest recommend setting up a virtual machine such as virtualbox running linux ubuntu is my preference

5163293
disk	ram
lower ram usage cleaner disk and you can turn on off the ror instance as needed by starting up shutting down the vm

5163294
google-chrome	firefox
however this seems to problematic in at least google-chrome and firefox that is when using inspect element in google-chrome the and the text markup are reported to be like

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari firefox google-chrome all produce slightly different unexpected interpretations

5163331
folder	directory
under linux each process has a directory under proc folder where you can read out all sorts of information about the process

5163332
inherited	properties
i thought it might inherited from system.array or somehting similair considering you can call methods and access properties on an array

5163374
getter	setter
however i don t really like the idea of having read_attribute methods inside my getter setter

5163379
google-chrome	firefox
this works as expected for google-chrome firefox and ie 8 but not in ie 7

basically synthesize automatically generates the getter and setter based on the property declaration

5163843
ftp	smb
as previously mentioned there is no way you can track directories via ftp or smb

5163886
integer	unsigned
i am not fully sure about the exact type but based on the name it looks like an unsigned 32 bit integer

5163908
getter	setter
synthesize creates getter and setter for your property.if you do not synthesize the property then you can use property. it gives crash

5163908
getter	setter
without synthesize you cant use the setter and getter

5164003
uitableview	reloaddata
my suggestion would be to present a uitableview in a popover with the search bar at the top then simply drive the table view s data source using the search term and call reloaddata on the table view every time the user types into the box

5164034
java.util.date	simpledateformat
use a simpledateformat instance to parse the date you get from the file to a java.util.date object then you can use another simpledateformat to convert to the xsd date format

5164035
pull	push
further the listening url can be used to push and pull from as well using hg

5164035

5164340
getter	setter
as same way how can i write setter and getter method for a map like this

5164354
put	get
you can have your desktop application call a method in you asp.net application and get back the value and then put it in that required textbox

5164366
getter	setter
you can write a getter or setter for a field that s a std map just as you would any other field - just have the getter return a std map and have the setter accept a std map

5164366
getter	setter
of course if you have a field that s a std map that you re trying to use getter and setter on that might suggest that there s a better way to structure the program

5164405
queue	fifo
you get simple read write and fifo queue at lowest development cost

5164416

width	height
each of your controls expose a similar width and height property that you can use to set their sizes relative to the size of their container form

5164616
width	height
you might have a treeview that takes up 100 of the form s height but only 50 of its width

5164616
width	height
a listview that takes up 50 of the form s height and 50 of its width

5164616

5164793
width	height
removing the minibuffer-lines parameter will give you a full screen width window that s the wrong height and removing the fullscreen parameter means nothing resizes correctly

5164793

5165070
superclass	subclassing
i was under the impression that even though you may set a superclass variable to reference one of it s subclassing the type information of the subclassing should be retained and therefore also included in the serialised representation of that object

5165098
width	margin
by giving c a left margin it will appear to the right of a and b as there s available space for it there and because you are not assigning it any width it will occupy the remaining space

you can develop php python module opera firefox google-chrome plugin miranda plugin some windows service

5165178
post	get
i believe that the ideal is that the representation that you post to create a resource is the same as the representation that is returned when you get that same resource

5165178
post	get
for example if you have a property of a user such as their reputation then clearly that would be returned on get but not required on creation for post

5165178
post	get
maybe there s private information that is only returned on get when requested by the owner and that is information that you have to supply on post when creating but when another user requests the resource they don t get that information

5165610
getter	setter
you need to add setter and getter

if you put all your bits of js into one page - without calling them as functions- then yes they will get executed everytime you include them

5166162
int	chars
if you begin with an array of unsigned chars rather than an int then any direct-copying from the array needs the array to have been populated with the same endianness as on your platform

5166169
google-chrome	firefox
the extension apis for browsers with add-on functionality google-chrome firefox etc. are all very different and much of the browser-chrome-privileged code must be rewritten for the different browsers

5166254
hash	salt
hash data with a random salt in theory is safe to download

5166254
hash	md5
at one time md5 was the right way to hash and now you find a collision in under 1 hour

5167392
rtsp	rtmp
and yes it supports streaming through http rtmp rtsp mms

5167421

but when i try accessing the post method after a successful get method everything works fine

5167607
post	get
is it necessary that i should use get method call subsequent to a post method call

5167632
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
public methods otoh are called from the outside world so you may have no control over the concrete arguments passed thus it is better to do explicit argument checks and handle invalid arguments appropriately by throwing a suitable runtime exception such as illegalargumentexception or for null references let the jvm throw a nullpointerexception

5167633
rss	feed
i ve setup a rss feed link on a self-hosted wordpress website clicking the rss link in safari shows the feed - because safari has a built in rss reader

5167633
rss	feed
unfortunately clicking the same rss link in chrome displays the raw xml feed

5167633
rss	feed
click the rss feed top tight of the page in a rss enabled browser safari and it uses the built in rss reader to display the rss feed

5167633
rss	feed
click the same rss feed link in chrome chrome has no built in rss reader it displays the rss feed using what looks like a custom page

5167696
content-disposition	content-type
setting the content-disposition header should help if not working try also to set the content-type as application unknown

5167785
rss	feed
i think you could use jquery to check browser s version and then redirect to the normal rss feed or redirect to a page using a feed reader plugin like zrssfeed

5167842
post	get
i m only adding to edorian s post but i ve used static get methods in the past where there is a caching engine in place and for example i might have a given person object in memcache and would rather retrieve it from the cache than going off to the database

5167914
put	get
put them in an object that you get when you load the library

5167937
photoshop	paint.net
i am pretty sure this can be done because softwares like photoshop paint.net handle this very nicely

5167941

i have a java class that extends jpanel and implements mouselistener and trying to duplicate some basic functionality of jbutton but with some loaded images to make things more pretty

5167946
comparator	comparable
as for the comparator if you re not using generics you also need to validate both argument for the same base type at least comparable since you re using that interface

5167966
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
perhaps you should consider using a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller or some other means of navigating the app with multiple uitableviews in order to present information to the user

5168004

hide	show
using spring-security you can not only show hide parts of a jsp with somewhat called rol but also allow disallow access based on a specified url

5168124
folder	directory
in the simplest case this should do it inside your working copy from the parent folder of your new directory

5168136
inherited	properties
aside from this the designer.cs also gets update w inherited properties such as text numericupdown.value displaymember valuemember etc w c again are already defined in the parent class

5168173
hash	md5
i would use a simple md5 hash

5168192
apache	nginx
it uses the inbound host header and any virtual hosting configuration set up with rewrite rules in apache or nginx to calculate the correct absolute url when rendering the page

5168204
int	double
thus these concerns are independent of data type float int double etc.

5168220

then on pageload you get the usertype pull the data from the table find the div where you want to put the data and then add the controls like

5168242

after the show method is called the visible property returns a value of true until the hide method is called

5168288
shadowing	named
then you will both get a shadowing warning and at the same time a protection - only the correct option full named will be used

5168288
shadowing	named
avoiding shadowing otoh is a general necessity so the case of options is no more special in this respect than for function named etc

5168315
children	parent
i know that in entity framework i can add children to parent if i have navigation properties between them

5168315
children	parent
is it possible to insert all children and parent in one transaction here

5168315
children	parent
because if it is possible-i do not have to create all that lists of children to add after parent insert

5168323
mouseover	mouseenter
if you simply clear the timeout using cleartimeout when you mouseenter or mouseover the menu then that will solve your problem

5168323
mouseout	mouseleave
then all you have to do is reset the timeout when the next mouseout or mouseleave happens

5168364
super	abstract
well for an abstract super class you have to group everything common to both

5168384
ubuntu	linux

i just installed the latest version of ruby 1.9 - hpricot mechanize and scrubyt installed without any issues

5168417
accessor	properties
although â œatomicâ means that access to the properties is thread-safe simply making all the properties in your class atomic does not mean that your class or more generally your object graph is â œthread safeâ â thread safety cannot be expressed at the level of individual accessor methods

5168422
button	checkbox
ultimately if you can afford the real-estate i would use radio button instead or checkbox and only allow them to select 2 checkbox at the most

5168444
min	max	width	height
i have a button which max and min height x width are 1024x1360 and 72x95 pixels

5168444
width	height
the problem is the updation of height and width at lower levels i.e upto 210x280 gives out a smooth operation which is not the case with greater sizes

5168452
width	height
if you specify only a width the height will be set proportionally and thus prevent stretching of your images

5168460
width	height
they are stretched because you specified both width and height attributes for the tag

5168460
width	height
if the actual image is of different dimensions one can see how the browser has no options but to distort the image to make it fit the specified height and width

5168460
width	height
just don t specify either height or width or both and the images are going to be ok

5168481
disk	ram
compilation speed on a core i7 920 9 gb ram single 7.2 krpm disk

5168496
getter	setter
i want to know from you seniours that what is best way to handle getter and setter and database in iphone programming

5168516
accessor	properties	getter	setter
properties are atomic by default so that synthesized accessor provide robust access to properties in a multi-threaded environmentâ that is the value returned from the getter or set via the setter is always fully retrieved or set regardless of what other threads are executing concurrently

5168516
accessor	properties
if you do not specify nonatomic then in a reference counted environment a synthesized get accessor for an object properties uses a lock and retains and autoreleases the returned valueâ the implementation will be similar to the following

5168516
accessor	properties
if you specify nonatomic then a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly

5168517
width	height
you should set the height only on the img and add the width 200px

5168534
stdout	stderr
or you can close stdout and stderr for the command being executed under unix

5168541
post	get
doing a get before a post is not necessary

5168541
post	get
if this is the case then is it possible for that data that the get sets to be the data that when unset makes the post fail on the server

5168541
post	get
update another possibility is that your get code is initializing something on the server side that your post call is missing

5168573
post	get
i want to do that so i get my xml code with the sub sub element like presented in my first post

5168618

5168850
sudo	passwd
the easiest solution would be to give the user that java program logs in as the ability to run that sudo command without entering the passwd

5168883
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
although you declare request to have nsmutableurlrequest type you create an instance of nsurlrequest class which does not responds to -sethttpmethod selector

getter	setter
i don t want to memorize 100 different statements and which one to use depending on whether my method has a return value or not whether my property has both getter and setter or just one of them whether it s a full moon or not etc.

5168895
hex	binary
actually computers do all their work in binary so unless you want to go to a great deal of pointless effort to force it to do the arithmetic on the raw hex digits you ll want to parse the numbers add them and render the result back out again as hex

5168957
rtp	sip
i am able to successfully send the rtp packets to my sip server and on the other hand i am getting rtp packets from which i need to parse the header and payload

5169013
rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	rtsp	rtcp
this c++ library is available under lgpl and implements the rtsp rtp rtcp protocols and payload formats for many different media types

5169013
rtp	rtsp
should you choose to use standardized protocols you might want to read up on rtp and rtsp

5169034
getter	setter
using getter and setter gives you some flexibility built into the coupling of your objects

5169038
getter	setter
imo the most compelling reason for setter getter is isolating change

5169038
getter	setter
if you don t already have a setter then all client code needs to be updated to use getter setter which could be a nightmare

5169044
jboss	weblogic
can i use a jsf 2.0 implemntation on a j2ee 1.4 server jboss 4.0.5 5.0 weblogic 9 websphere 6.1

xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
jqxhr is a superset of the browser s native xmlhttprequest object

5169052

i understand that all methods and properties of the original xhr are inherited but that doesn t seem to be the case

5169075
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i was able to get it work fine on firefox google-chrome and safari but it s not working on ie

5169107

environment variables are only inherited from parent to their children and can t easily be set the other way around

5169108
folder	directory
just stick ci inside a folder inside your wordpress directory

5169111
amr	aac
if i have an original audio frame in android how to encode it using amr aac or any other encoder

5169119
getter	setter
i agree in part with the other answers regarding the use of getter and setter methods to allow for future changes but there is still a fundamental problem you are exposing the internal data of your object for other objects to modify

5169119
getter	setter
here s an interesting article on why getter and setter methods are evil it s written with java in mind but the same applies to c++

5169133
post	get
the question is pretty broad as it doesn t specify how the map gets initialized if you post a question describing how you propose to do the initialization you will likely get a more directly helpful answer

5169145
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval have a hidden feature you can specify parameters after the timeout

5169145
mouseleave	mouseenter
it s important to do it this way since the first one is the mouseenter handler and the second is the mouseleave handler

5169203
tax	shipping
include all tax and shipping charges

5169210
getter	setter
getter and setter are indeed a good practice in most cases

5169238
cpython	pypy
there is also psyco the forerunner of pypy which can provide performance boosts to many python scripts without changing out the whole interpreter and cpython which lets you write high-performance c libraries for python using something very much like python syntax

5169259
cpython	pypy
i could see python gaining v8 speed in the future if a jit a la pypy gets implemented for cpython but that does not seem likely for the coming years the focus right now is python 3 adoption not a jit

5169277
avr	microcontroller
the avr is a modified harvard architecture 8-bit risc single chip microcontroller which was developed by atmel in 1996

5169277
avr	microcontroller
the avr was one of the first microcontroller families to use on-chip flash memory for program storage as opposed to one-time programmable rom eprom or eeprom used by other microcontroller at the time

5169278
avr	microcontroller
avr refers to two families of either 8- or 32-bit risc microcontroller

5169307
keydown	keyup
the second method is to keep the spark textinput control but to use a very short timer in your keyup or keydown event to let the text property be fully filled with the barcode scan data -- i don t know exactly why this works but it does

5169346
youtube	vimeo
it is also widely used by streaming internet sources such as videos from vimeo youtube and the itunes store web software such as the adobe flash player and microsoft silverlight broadcast services for dvb and sbtvd direct-broadcast satellite television services cable television services and real-time video conferencing

5169383
width	height
edit after charles comment i m wrong about this and the problem probably comes from the display inline-block not well understood hence the width height not applied because the anchor is treated like inline

5169517
width	margin
how can i set an image to have a width based on the main view it is located on and to let it have a margin of for example 50 pixels on both sides

5169517
width	height
and if it s overruled how can i give the image a fixed height and a flexible width

5169543
width	height
i want them displayed in a grid just like facebook does every picture with the same width and height

5169544
bridj	jnaerator
jnaerator does exactly that it reads c c++ objectivec headers and outputs java bindings that rely on bridj c c++ jna c only or rococoa objectivec uses jna

5169552
getter	setter
so instead of having to write the getter and setter you just have to write a property and the compiler does the rest

5169552
getter	setter
you still have the option of writing the getter and setter but you don t have to write all of the boiler plate code for what should just be 1 line

5169573
post	get
you can use a default form action to get post back the values and therefore also use the normal jquery methods without additional

5169606
bridj	jnaerator
bridj was designed on purpose for that and it s supported by jnaerator which will parse your c c++ headers and spit out the java bindings for you

5169643
google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
last point the day that google-chrome gets a fully-featured firebug is the day firefox basically dies for developers because firefox had 3 years to make firefox s layout engine gecko as fast as webkit and they didn t

5169643
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is simply a better browser until firefox upgrades their javascript engine

5169647
children	parent
tries to repaint its children and the children tries to repaint its parent - then i assume we re talking about a loop

5169647
width	height
i don t think that was the solution itself but instead of using width and height from the graphics instance i tried using widht and height from the jpanel itself

5169647
width	height
i m not quite sure why things go wrong when i use width and height from the graphics instance

5169647
width	height
i thought the width and height from the graphics instance was already prepared with regard to dimensions from the jpanel component

5169658
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have created a custom combocheck which extends the spark dropdownlistfor that is a dropdownlistfor of checkbox

5169668
bridj	jnaerator
you should give a look at bridj and jnaerator

5169669
free	malloc
you should check if malloc succedded and make sure you free also make sure on copy_link that none of the args is null

5169694
maven	pom.xml
lots of jars out there in the maven repositories have their dependencies not correctly defined in their pom.xml file

5169695
integer	unsigned
as i is an unsigned integer 0 - 255 i will equal 0 after 8 iterations due to binary round off

5169696

using sed i want to search a string and replace that with other in maven pom.xml

5169846
sudo	passwd
assuming there is a sess.getstdin you should be able to pipe in a passwd to the sudo command

5169861
put	get
first you should put your ... .val lines inside the submit function or else they will get the value of the select boxes when the page loads

5169887
integer	unsigned
1000 0000 0000 1100 signed int value -12 and a large unsigned integer

5169887
integer	unsigned
unsigned int x -12 takes -12 as an integer and stores it into x

5169900
folder	directory
there actually is a difference between a directory and a folder and both terms are used correctly here

5169900
folder	directory
like windows explorer the folderbrowserdialog which as benny almost mentioned calls shbrowseforfolder presents an abstract view of folder 1 not a direct view of the drives and directory of the file system

5169900
folder	directory
although the shbrowseforfolder function can return any namespace folder the folderbrowserdialog uses the bif_returnonlyfsdirs flag to restrict returns to only folder that represent file system directory

5169900
folder	directory
nonetheless though it does browse by folder even if it will only retrieve the path to a directory

5169900
folder	directory
2 most modern file browsers borrow the metaphor of folder representing directory graphically with folder icons but the abstract concept of folder as presented here is a windows concept that isn t universally present across platforms

5169913
post	put
it will help you interpret post methods with parameter _method with value delete as put

5170037
integer	unsigned
the compiler generates code to move this signed integer into your unsigned integer x which is also a 32 bit entity

5170037
integer	unsigned
if you wanted to assign a value to x and were not sure whether the value on the right side of the equals was positive you could have written and forced the compiler to generate code to take the absolute value of a signed integer before moving it to the unsigned integer

5170046
jbehave	easyb
my team have used jbehave with success - we moved to it after using easyb and found the plain text scenario files easier to deal with

5170072
integer	unsigned
in case of unsigned integer the left most bit is use to store extra values

5170145
inherited	properties
the implementation is in fact inherited as you can verify with a simple main function exercising uiplayingcard s touchable properties

5170179
oncreate	ondestroy
if i open the database in oncreate and close it in ondestroy should it be always opened

5170236
put	get
if you p4 add a file before it exists and then try and submit the changelist before you actually put a local file in place you will get this error

5170243
getter	setter
having a high number of getter and setter can be a warning sign that the object is really a struct and it may be better to expose the fields directly

5170243
getter	setter
fields could have multiple setter or getter as required allowing name translation between different domains

5170243
getter	setter
additional getter and setter used the domain specific codes for those fields

5170243
getter	setter
as other have noted getter and setter are indicative of the presence of a field

5170243
getter	setter
making the getter and setter public implies there is a reason for the public to be able to modify or read the value of that field

5170247
accelerometer	gyroscope
because core motion is able to track a deviceâ s attitude using both the gyroscope and the accelerometer it can differentiate between gravity and user acceleration

5170253
mouse	keyboard
robot class is just a handle of the mouse and keyboard among others and doesn t have special privileges over another java application the same way it doesn t have any privileges over a non java application

5170280
addclass	removeclass
the removeclass works when i click the other link but addclass does not fire for the other link nor when i click the first link again it should

5170280
addclass	removeclass
the removeclass works fine too it s just the addclass that isn t firing

5170324
width	height
at the moment i only see the menu at the top the tab area been squashed when i do not specify a height width

5170353
setinterval	settimeout
here s a random guess look for settimeout or setinterval in your 2 000 lines of javascript

5170364
apache	nginx
i m using nginx but i m open to answers that apply to apache too

5170390
memcached	apc
apc is the best solution if you are using a single server otherwise i would go with memcached

5170390
innodb	myisam
myisam is also considered a good read performer however my benchmarks show me that innodb indexes are faster

5170397

5170518
put	get
to put it another way what should you put in the routes.rb file in order to distinguish between different request types get delete etc to the same url

5170529
pull	push
and you want to send c you could use bundle or just push pull

5170529
pull	push
in brief bundle is for when you want to do push pull but don t have a good network path and export is for when you want to send the logical contents of a changeset rather than that specific exact changeset

5170541
width	height
i have my own class called button which has a texture 2d and a vector2 position contruscted by button texture2d img float width float height

5170541
width	height
my idea is to set the position of the image to a scalable of the window width and height so i m attempting to set the position of the img to a number between 0-1 and then multiply by the window width and height to keep everything scaled properly

5170546
postgresql	mysql
i m trying to port some old mysql queries to postgresql but i m having trouble with this one

5170554
serializable	deserialization
the deserialization process for binary serializable will attempt to load the object s type from the original dll

5170554
serializable	deserialization
the serializable and deserialization process need to both operate pre or post merge

5170631
getter	setter
combined with property auto-creates your setter and getter but i m not sure exactly what happens when you assign a value like

5170633
mvp	presenter
note one other recent pattern of interest lately not in that chart is presenter first mvp which was envisioned to be more accommodating of tdd

5170638
getter	setter
i declared all getter and setter

5170640
maven	m2e
i sometimes noticed this behaviour when using m2e to package my project whereas running maven from the command line worked well

5170687
post	get
are there any big advantages if i just decide to use post instead of the get method

5170687
post	get
i know i can use redirects etc to accomplish this with the get method but i just want to know why post is considered bad practice in search forms

5170739
getter	setter
please use the getter and setter methods instead

5170746
put	get
you could also put the links in include and get rid of lib_include but i like keeping these things separate

5170748
post	get
to answer the question it is good practice for several reasons to do non-transforming queries with get everything that just creates a view and changing requests like posting a comment or a new product with post

5170748
post	get
some others can be found when you google for rest + get + post

5170791
qmainwindow	qdialog
you also haven t created any qt display window i recommend you to check the examples that come with qt to check the basic structure of the application and start with a qmainwindow or a qdialog

5170855
post	get
how can i post data and get results back in my activity

5170880
operands	scalar
in scalar context it evaluates both operands and returns the right hand one

5170901
mp3	m3u

5171063
uinavigationbar	uisegmentedcontrol
uisegmentedcontrol embedded in a uinavigationbar item

5171080
width	height
the height and width animate but not the background

5171087
exponent	modulo
as you can see you can apply the modulo in the sub result of the exponent to always work with smaller number and thus make it easier to calculate c d n even when c and d are high value

5171088
firefox	safari
i ve a computer with windows server 2003 without adobe flash player in which firefox v3.6 and safari coundn t play a video and the user wasn t warned about the missing plug in

on install we use custom actions to first backup the database then run the right upgrade scripts based on versioning of current database and if needed restore the database to the backup as a rollback action of the upgrade

5171132
next	except
next i m attempting to get each tr so i can reach each #2 td inside each tr except the first tr has a th inside it so i want to avoid this

5171133
width	height
for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be. property values are treated as a number of pixels unless otherwise specified

5171139
folder	directory
directory is a classical term used since the early times of file systems while folder is a sort of friendly name which may sound more familiar to windows users

5171139
folder	directory
the main difference is that a folder is a logical concept that does not necessarily map to a physical directory

5171160
wordpress	joomla
so basically sort of what you d see in joomla wordpress concrete5 templates

5171183
listview	gridview
is there a way to display gridview as gallery view instead of plain listview

5171191
g++	gcc
you must clone the some complier settings i recommend to copy a default gnu gcc compiler then you can change new settings set on the tab toolchain executables -- replace the gcc and g++ by mpicc and mpicxx

5171218
onchange	onblur
the onchange or onblur events seem the most appropriate but you could also write a custom validate function that would nag the user if values weren t in the list

5171236
pop-up	dialog
i have a dialog box with an input i have to automatically pop-up the soft keyboard current code

5171236

5171285
innodb	myisam
i did a test on a table with innodb and myisam which use php to simulate 2 set of update as follow

5171285
innodb	myisam
normally each update take 0.001x sec with myisam and 0.03x sec with innodb so not surprise for set 1 use 1000 more times then set 2 however during testing set 1 i open set 2 at another browser windows what i expect is the result will return within the total time of set 1 but it seems it wait for set 1 finish rather then insert into the queue during set 1 running

5171306
integer	unsigned
when the compiler implicitly converts -12 to an unsigned integer the underlying binary representation remains unaltered

5171306
integer	unsigned
the sign bit of the two s complement integer becomes the most significant bit of the unsigned integer

5171306
integer	unsigned
thus when printf treats the unsigned integer as a signed integer with d it will see -12

5171322

5171386
width	height
a set of images with x y width and height all known

5171389
pexpect	subprocess
if you really need to interact with the output line by line then it is probably better to use pexpect rather than the subprocess module

5171413
put	get
i thought request.method is supposed to return a symbol like get put etc

5171434
ostream	istream
research these keywords ifstream ofstream hex modifier dec modifier istream read ostream write

5171532
clang	llvm
for example i can use clang llvm to illustrate both point of view at once

5171533
serializable	deserialization
if the type being serializable isn t the exact type contained .net has to track what the type really is to allow proper deserialization

5171539
google-chrome	firefox
when viewed in firefox google-chrome and ie8 9 the example works as expected

5171606
integer	fractions
that is to say that any fractions values will be truncated and the exact integer value will be left

5171689
post	get
i don t support any http methods except get and post

5171689
post	get
how do i change the options response to show only get and post methods as allowed

5171725
bash	zsh
not sure about zsh but i know in bash you have to export the variables editor or svn_editor

5171729
cpu	hyperthreading
anyway event-driven design is more efficient with no threads and a process per cpu or virtual cpu if there s hyperthreading

5171793
gridview	detailsview
i think the problem might be that the detailsview does not have any controls when the page initially loads since it doesn t get them until i select a row in my main gridview

5171798
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also it only works in http5 google-chrome 8 supports it and probably firefox 4 and safari 5 as well

5171800
textview	imageview
create a custom view that contains and imageview and a textview

5171817
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome 9 and firefox 3.6 but in ie8 it shows the message insert your error message here if the pdf cannot be displayed.

5171885
min	max
iterators can have several forms but here they both have the form and since they lack a 4th term they take on each value between min and max in integer steps

5171896
qt-creator	kdevelop
i am moving from qt-creator to kdevelop and i am trying to figure out how this feature works so far i can create the resulting binary the moc files and object files to the extra directory using the variables destdir objects_dir and moc_dir but i cannot create the makefile in this diretory

5171954
post	get
in comparison a regular post form is essentially the same as a get except the form data is passed within the body of the post request rather than as query parameters

5171985
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in google-chrome firefox and ie

5171986
inherited	properties
besides the fact that .current properties exists on both the interface and the ienumerator interface which inherited what s the point of implementing it

5171988
cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
on a system with more than one processors or processors cores you can normally assuming you do have a smp-enabled system cpu affinity doesn t prevent it expect those two processes to use both processors but you do not strictly have a guarantee

5171998
translation	localization
i m not sure if this is feasible for your particular situation but why not let the ui interface layer or application layer handle the translation via a common localization pattern

5172012
bash	tcsh	bash	zsh	zsh	tcsh
bash tcsh ksh and zsh are installed by default

5172110
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable t or search ienumerable vs iqueryable to get references

5172134
put	get
so as you can see the guid i get back doesn t match what i put in

5172157
int	chars
even if i start with an empty project and add just one file to it with only an include for iostream and an int main function that prints a chars with cout basically the most basic program if i try to get intellisense to show anything say by typing cout

5172159
accessor	properties
nontomic basically if you say nonatomic and you generate the accessor using synthesize then if multiple threads try to change read the properties at once badness can happen

5172159
accessor	properties
readwrite properties will have both the accessor and the setter

5172190
int	chars

i would suggest reading up on linq particularly iqueryable vs ienumerable

5182499
ienumerable	iqueryable
the ienumerable side of linq which works on in-memory objects that are already in the heap will almost certainly perform better than the iqueryable side which exists to be translated into a native query language like sql

5182499
ienumerable	iqueryable
however the heavy lifting of pulling records out of a data store and creating in-memory object representations has to be done at some time and iqueryable linq will almost certainly be faster than instantiating all records as in-memory objects then using ienumerable linq linq 2 objects to filter to get your actual data

5182501

5183590

5183839
getter	setter
the second is bindable event eventname followed by either a var property declaration a function method declaration or one half of a getter setter declaration

5183839
getter	setter
this is that when you are applying it to a getter setter pair defined for the same variable name you need only apply it to one or the other it will apply to both

5183917
getter	setter
this is because attributes associations are actually methods getter setter and not local variables

5196705
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i read that if you use stringbyappendingstring on an nsstring you end up with leaks because the pointer associated with the initial nsstring moves around pointing to the new string created by the append whereas with nsmutablestring your pointer always points to that mutable string

5196705
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so my question is what is implicitly happening when i call stringbyappendingstring on something that is a string but not explicitly an nsstring or an nsmutablestring

nsmutablestring	nsstring
if you pull an object out which is actually an nsstring but try to use it as a nsmutablestring your app will fall over with selector not found or similar

5196862
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so in that case you do need to make a new nsmutablestring from the nsstring

5196862
nsmutablestring	nsstring
interesting note apple chose to make nsmutablestring a subclass of nsstring

5196883

5197477
rss	feed
however there s a big gotcha to be aware of - if you use advanced forums the rss feed for the forum categories will stop working

5197477
rss	feed
my guess is because forums uses taxonomy vocab terms for the forum categories and it seems the rss feed uses the items taxonomy term array to generate the feed

5197477
rss	feed
now my site successfully 404s any request for taxonomy term and rss feed still work

the purpose of including salt is to modify the function used to hash each user s password so that each stored password hash will have to be attacked individually

5197921
hash	salt
there is some benefit to also using a site-wide salt on top of the per-user salt this will prevent possible collisions with password hash stored at other sites and prevent the use of general-purpose rainbow tables although even 32 bits of salt is enough to make rainbow tables an impractical attack

i have a custom string class that malloc realloc free s internally

5197968
geocoding	geocode
i think you are going about it the wrong way there is no reason to block what you have to do is have that method return void and in the class that is handling the geocoding define a protocol that has a method say - void didreceiveplacemark id placemark placemark can be nil or some placemark and it is called when the geocode returns

webclient	httpwebrequest
as an aside i believe in general it s better to use httpwebrequest rather than webclient - see the explanation here of webclient using the ui thread silverlight background thread using webclient - for your particular code i don t think this will be a problem

5198347
mouseover	mouseout
the mouseover and mouseout events bubble meaning that they will also fire for all of the element s children

5199521
put	get
loopingthread.run should be put in sleep mode outside a synchronized _data section so an another thread would have a chance to get the lock

5199584
min	max
this may not correctly capture the requirements for each element and attribute check that the min max occurs required optional proprerties etc.

5199600
min	max
this might come across as a silly question but i am curious to know if given a maximization algorithm and asked to get the dual minimization version it is just a matter of converting all max s into min s and doing other basic adjustments

5199618
hide	show
i recently used jquery columnmanager to allow user to easily show hide table columns and it worked very well

5199626
min	max
numerical algorithms that need gradients will probably do more than max and min and other complexities can come up

5199692
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but of course in ie the text is really blurred and looks terrible

5199700

it s removed from g++ and should be replaced with max or min for

5199707
post	get
i changed these empty post requests to get requests

5199707
post	get
i m assuming it s more efficient to use a get instead of an empty post

5199707
post	get
so is it more efficient to use a get instead of a post with no data sent

5199723
accessor	properties
consider putting this in a try-catch block since you chain properties accessor

5199737
post	get
get is supposed not to change the requested resource whereas post might do

5199763
post	get
other than the fact that get has one character less than post i doubt there is any performance difference

5199763
post	get
get should be used when you need to retrieve something from the server while post should be used when you need to send something to the server send as in give not as in sending a parameter

5199767
post	get
the issue of data parameters doesn t really come into play as both get and post requests can accept parameters

5199767
post	get
get on the query string and post via post data

5199767
post	get
outside of theoretical concerns there are real reasons to use get or post

5199767
post	get
for instance get requests can be cached by web servers proxy servers and clients whereas post requests are never cached afaik

5199772

5199854
int	chars	int	boolean
so at least on 64-bit jvms with a 64 bit pointer namespace it should be possible to not have any objects of int chars byte short boolean float and small long at all apart from these created by explicit new ... only special bit patterns which could be manipulated by the normal operators quite efficiently

5199884
onresume	onpause
then step 3 shows exactly how to make it robust in terms of lifecycle events like onpause and onresume

5199924
draggable	droppable
draggable item is dropped into a droppable area this works

5199935
put	get	width	height
it seems like the natural behavior for gone views would be to treat them as if they had width and height of 0 but instead it removes them as anchors and any other views that are laid out relative to the gone views get put in unpredictables places

5199938
floating-point	integer
in this case the .0 is to ensure that the division is floating-point not integer division

5199978

5200113
int	double
to calculate with with bigdeciamls this class provides special methods that are used instead of the standard operators that you from int double and so on.

5200120
int	double
as another example - you can create primitives like double and int like this

5200130
int	double
in the case of pod variables such as int double and pointer types there is no difference between the initializer list syntax and regular assignments in the body

5200157
folder	directory
i placed the extension in a separate .as file within a folder in the library directory but when i make the include call from my document class it tries to execute the include relative to the .fla file s location rather than the library s source path

5200238
prepare	execute
if the only purpose is to secure the query isn t it better to clean the query using something like mysqli_real_escape_string instead of writing so many lines of code for each query like prepare bind_param execute close etc.

5200240
post	get
get post and delete all go through authentication fine but update fails

5200254

avr-libc a libc for avr microcontroller automates the above approaches by automatically creating target directories for dozens of microcontroller with variations in memory size peripheral availability etc and building all of the variations in a single pass

5200426
width	height
for some reason that i can t understand printing out uneval src_data would return instead whereas in it there should be three members data width and height

5200430

folder	directory
so i put the api-key in another folder in home with chmod 711 on the directory as opposed to 755 on the cgi-bin directory

5200650
feedback	review
side question i know i m not working as clean efficiently professionally as possible in this example but if i wanted to improve with feedback and opinions about the best method for this type of example like a code review or something is it ok to ask a question on stackoverflow

5200663
children	parent
obviously i have made an error and somehow told the program that i want these to be treated as parent instead of children but i cannot find my error

5200664

5201127
google-chrome	firefox
you ll notice that in firefox or google-chrome s error console the code line number and file name showed is the line file that throws the error exception and not the errorhandler exception wich you really want in order to make debugging easy

5201148
accessor	properties
however since es5 introduced accessor properties there is an exception to what i ve said above

5201148
accessor	properties
accessor properties allow us to define functions which are invoked whenever the properties is either retrieved or set

5201148
accessor	properties
this is true with one exception if string.prototype contains a accessor properties prop with a defined getter then that getter will be invoked

5201148
accessor	properties
however i don t think that adding accessor properties to the built-in prototypes would be a good practice

5201151

getter	setter
should a subclass override your getter setter it could change the way the display method functions

you should use the keydown event to keep track of the keys pressed and you should use the keyup event to keep track of when the keys are released

5203676

5203775
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
for addition and subtraction standard model preferable but for multiplication and division polar form preferable

5203782

dev tty is the usual way but it s also possible on most unix-like operating systems to read from cerr stderr because the system usually opens the tty once as stdin and dup s it onto stdout and stderr

5203795
for-loop	arrays
if you do so your for-loop which could be replaced by foreach won t work since you re just checking the length and iterate through the arrays with the wrong keys

5203892
int	boolean
int are no boolean values and as such should not offer logical operators

5203892
int	boolean
and the distinction of bitwise vs logical operators on int s only exists in c due to c s inability to distinguish boolean and int

5203916
post	get
i get a routing error when the form post that s generated on the get page which starts like this

5203924

int	chars
if you operate on ascii chars then you could test if the int value of the chars is between 65 and 90

5203998
ord	chr
you need to use the ord and chr functions

5204003
getter	setter
is it bad practice if i make those two classes friends so they can directly access and manipulate member variables of each other without using any getter setter functions

5204026
put	get
i have some settings that can vary from widget instance to widget instance so i put the id of the appwidget that was clicked into the intent where the service can get at it when servicing my request

both getter and setter and friend classes reduce encapsulation and increase coupling

automatically casting int to boolean using the rules of c c++ allow for a accidentally assigning instead of comparing two values

5204147

to check whether it is actually above or below in the sense of being directly above or below ie not off to the side somewhere then do a point in polygons by projecting the whole thing into 2d along the normal and then a distance along normal test

5204204
goto	break
as for switch blocks they are mostly shortcuts to the branching control flow and usually behave exactly the same once compiled however this is not necessarily true when not using break or some language support goto a different case etc. but this is out of scope

5204226
width	height
so at the moment they all fill in the box and depending on screen size occupy a grid of variable height and width

5204226

as you can see it is currently set so that the containing box is basically fixed to the window width with a 1 margin

5204231

5204231
entity-relationship	diagram
most of the e-r diagram you ll see in so are really relational diagram masquerading as entity-relationship diagram

5204231
entity-relationship	diagram
in a true entity-relationship diagram foreign keys are not present many-to-many relationships can be diagrammed as a single line and such things as gen-spec patterns look much the same way as they do in class diagram

5204231
entity-relationship	diagram
if fact an entity-relationship diagram can be viewed as the projection of an object world onto the world of data only

5204231
entity-relationship	diagram
if you ll learn entity-relationship modeling as a distinct activity from relational modeling resulting in a different model you ll find it fairly easy to transform class diagram into entity-relationship diagram

5204231
entity-relationship	diagram
from there transforming entity-relationship diagram into relational diagram is almost mechanical

5204231
entity-relationship	entities
the primary key of each table becomes obvious in terms of the key attributes of entities in the entity-relationship model

5204283
plone	django-cms
cms s like drupal django-cms plone etc

5204669
postgresql	mysql
sqlalchemyda s major advantage over other database adapters is that you can plug in numerous db-api providers psycopg2 to get access to postgresql oracle mysql and many others

5204674

when the user submit a form i send them along as a request and obviously have to do this mysql_real_escape_string call again just in case someone tries to hack my site with a faked form submission

i then looked at having just a container class with no real functionality attached beyond getter and setter

5204715

5204891
portrait	landscape
in portrait they are at the middle of the view but in landscape i want them in the right side of the view

5204892
unsigned	short
you ll need to treat an array of unsigned char differently from an array of short etc

unsigned	short
c99 provides for modifier hh for signed char or unsigned char before the format specifiers d i o u x or x and the modifier h for short or unsigned short

5204892
qsort	bsearch
it might be that you modify the interface to include that information - by analogy with functions such as bsearch and qsort or fread and fwrite

5205202
width	height
when i step through the code there are 10 elements in the array and all of the textviews are there so i would expect to see the 400px linearlayout filled with 10 relative layouts one after another each with 50px height and fill_parent width reading test - but all i see is one as if only one got added or they are all positioned on top of one another

5205214

you could count the users once and then create stored procedures that subtract from the user count when members are removed and add to the number when members are added

5205554

ideally i would like the results to be in the form of ienumerable item item where the key is a parent and the group items are all children

5205795
int	chars
but when i use int 21-2 to output it i just get a funny chars

5205819
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
items can be fully styled in firefox but not safari google-chrome

5205835
getter	setter
this part overrides my entities with public setter and getter

5205838
google-chrome	safari
since both safari and google-chrome run on webkit the browser.safari actually selects google-chrome as well..i definitely do not consider this an optimal solution

5205869
width	height
what matters in textsize is to set the row width for the width attribute and an height value which is large enough to host the text

5205915
udp	tcp
so my question is that suppose i give the type parameter as sock_stream which is reliable and add the protocol number for udp would it give me a reliable udp which is same as tcp but without flow control and congestion control

5205926
textarea	textbox
i just can t get this input textbox textarea and the button to be aligned like that and to be honest the tutor isn t doing a great job to clearing stuff out

5205943
udp	tcp
for an ipv4 or ipv6 protocol stack sock_stream is going to get you tcp and the type sock_dgram is going to give you udp

5206007
textinput	textfield
i d like to add a textinput that automatically grabs this information for the user and displays it in the textfield

5206009
persistent	transient
transient persistent errors inserting the object graph in one session

5206019
stdout	stderr
the reason is that the first two commands produce output to stdout but not stderr whereas the latter will produce output on stderr since you are not giving valid parameters to tar but not on stdout

5206019
stdout	stderr
using to redirect the standard output and to redirect the error output to different files you can see that tar produces messages on stderr and the other two on stdout file sizes for the other files are zero there was no output

5206047
client-side	server-side
that server-side script could fetch the specified page and parse out the title then return it to the client-side javascript

5206051
int	boolean
i have been thinking about this and using a little bit and i found it to be more helpful that just return a boolean an int or to go all the way to the over creating a class to return state and some values associated to that state and i really find practical to return a simple enum my code seems more readable and i don t have all the burden of the exception because as i read one exception should be exceptional

5206065
serializable	deserialization
if you can define structure of json messages you can use wcf and its build in serializable deserialization of json messages to .net types

5206080
post	get
i thought i d post here to see if i can get confirmation

5206083
children	parent
edit as you pointed out in the comments below the children should be tied to the parent by the end of the contstructor

5206119
pascal	delphi
delphi descends from pascal which is a rather primitive language when viewed from the 21 st century

5206119
pascal	delphi

i need to append a character to what to get from scan.next put that into add_data 0

5206184
int	chars
this is a small piece of code found in macchanger string is a chars pointer that points a mac address what i don t know is that why must i convert it to a unsigned long int and why must i 3 then and it with 0xff

5206191
disk	ram
in addition many of these structures can be written to file that is i have also designed my own binary file formats simply by copying from the heap in ram to the disk byte-by-byte

5206199
hide	show
it won t fade but it will show the new background-image and hide the spinner which you can probably still put in a span and fade out in the load callback here

5206232
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i d run this code in the viewdidload or viewwillappear methods of the view s controller

5206252
post	get
are you calling via an http get or post url or form

5206260
width	height
if it is not an image then you would need to make two divides on the overlay divide the first one in the html code use position absolute to place it on top with the same width and height -- then the image content divide that follows will be layered under your absolute positioned divide

5206267
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you should make the errorobject implement inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged if you want the ui to be updated when the collection updates or make the errorobjects property to be of type implements inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged

5206286
nsmenu	nsstatusbar
essentially i have an nsstatusbar item with an nsmenu attached as the menu

5206286
nsmenu	nsstatusbar	nsmenuitem	nsstatusbar
as i say in ib i have connected the nsmenu to statusmenu in the application delegate thus the menu all shows up under the nsstatusbar and i have connected an nsmenuitem within the nsmenu to the nsobject with the application delegate class and hooked it up to call showpreferencepanel but nothing happens when i run it

5206299
superclass	subclassing
importing of the the superclass definition via cimport as opposed to import in the subclassing module

5206349
public	protected
you can use either of these and can make use of access-specifiers public protected private to make your interfaces public or internal private

5206355
actionscript	mxml
also note that the mxml tags are all written in actionscript so if you want to understand them under the hood you ll also need to know actionscript

5206359
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

5206363
sorting	filtering
i am trying to implement a kohana sorting filtering for a virtual store meaning that whenever i want to sort some products after price etc i must only select the sorting criteria from a list

5206378
sorting	filtering
now you can return the strongly-typed list of objects out of your business layer and your ui layer can use linq or whatever to do sorting filtering paging

5206414
octal	decimal
the easiest workaround would be to simply write the numbers in decimal format 07001 in octal is the same as 3585 in decimal i think

5206441
pthreads	fork
i m not sure about what pthreads says but i wouldn t rely on semaphores doing the right thing after a fork

public things are accessible to everybody protected only to descendant -- and then for themselves and not for other descendants -- private for the class and its friend

5206530
width	height
note that on some opengl versions width and height must be powers of two

5206538
margin	height
the w3c box model means that the content height of each .feed isn t affected so an equally thick negative margin is all you need to counter the thickness of the added top border

5206566
pascal	delphi
i am a delphi expert so i don t quite know how restrictive plain pascal is

5206796
subnet	packets
the concept of subnet is just a way of describing a piece of network in which all the hosts can deliver packets to each other by one hop over some transport or another

5206796
igmp	bgp
in more complex cases routing boxes intercommunicate via protocols like egp or bgp or igmp to learn the network topology

5206796
subnet	packets
if you use the windows route command you will see the default route that the system uses to send packets that need to leave the local subnet

5206796
udp	tcp
tcp is no different than udp except that you can t get there by multicast or broadcast you need to know the exact address of your correspondent

5206803
subtract	add
use datetime.date for dates and datetime.timedelta to add or subtract some number of days

5206811
width	height
my page has flexible dimensions set to 100 width and 100 height so the typical on-load scroll function isn t working

5206816
for-loop	loops
also because i m using a while loops not a for-loop i can t get in trouble with possible implementation details of the for-loop

5206839
put	get
if you only use tuple via its advertised interface then you will get your objects out in the same order you put them in

5206867
mouse	keyboard
synergy is a program that enables you to use the same mouse and keyboard in two computers

5206880
int	double
in just about all the results i see they use double as the return for such a function even when explicitly using floor to convert it to an int

5206880
int	double
so what problem is there with using either long or int instead of double

5206903
opencv	emgucv
surftracker seems to use the flann fast library for approximate nearest neighbors library that comes with opencv so has emgucv bindings too while it

5206916
postgresql	mysql
if yes wouldn t this be better off in a relational database such as postgresql or mysql

5206932

you could create a model and use a mapper like automapper or emitmapper or valueinjecter to map between your objects and validate against the mapped model

5206934
google-chrome	firefox
in the first line of the success handler and also check your dev tools in google-chrome firefox under xhr requests

5206945
button	checkbox
well for now the best i can do seems to be to build my own checkbox using a button by keeping a boolean for the state that gets inverted in the onclicklistener and calling setbackgroundresource to swap between the checked and unchecked drawables

5206973
hide	show
when we reaced ten we hide the counter and show the link

5207030
post	get
like the previous post i m hoping to get something like

5207054
getter	setter
i guess one solution is to have a getter and setter methods for both id and name and test those instead

5207063
xslt	schematron
the schematron files are xml and can be compiled into xslt

5207068
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

5207121
mp4	webm
when i use mediaelement.js and list first the mp4 file and then webm then it doesn t play anything in chrome 11.0.686.3 dev

5207121
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine in safari firefox opera

5207121
mp4	webm
it works fine in chrome if i list mp4 first and webm second but don t call mediaelementplayer using native html5 video

5207131
cos	sin
this approximate distance is good enough for find the nearest pizza shop applications and has the advantage that it can be used in bare-bones environments like sqlite which don t support sin cos tan and their inverses out of the box

5207253
nsstring	nsdata
if the contents of the dictionary are only primitive types like nsnumber nsstring nsarray nsdata nsdictionary you can use the nspropertylistserialization class to turn it into a binary property list which will be about the most compact byte representation of its contents that you can get

5207266
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome but i notice in firefox that it is causing a flickering effect while the images get re-added

5207281
post	get
this token is required to post get data back to the server

5207296
getter	setter
using getter and setter which is a bit more advanced but should allow for it to act more like a struct

5207333
min	max
i do a query where i run a couple max min functions then do a query within the foreach doing another select to build a master array of data formatted the way i want it and all the sql etc works fine and dandy

5207427
width	height
the position of the rectangle is the upper left corner or in a regular plot the lower left corner and what you called the radius is actually the width and height of that bounding box

5207430
ready	each
i do have one sieve function ready which stores biggest prime factor for each number for speeding up the factoring without saving complete factorings of every number.

5207459
ienumerable	ienumerator
is it better to implement ienumerable and ienumerator yourself or should you inherit from the where t is the object type in it s singular form

5207472
ienumerable	ilist
the basic difference between ienumerable and ilist is the ability to add and sort to an ilist

5207483
int	double
double cover more ground then any other variable in the int type

i ve put the following lines in .git hooks prepare-commit-msg to get a commented out diff

5207546
gridview	repeater
the checkboxes are nested in a 2nd level gridview behind a repeater

5207590
cpu	processors
if you want to actually generate peak load on a cpu you typically want a modest-size so that the working set fits entirely in cache trivially parallelizable task that someone has hand-optimized to use the vector unit on a processors

5207590
multiplying	add
the exact function that should be used to generate a true maximum load varies quite a bit with the exact details of the processor micro-architecture different machines have different load store bandwidth in proportion to the number and width of multiplying and add functional units but numerical software libraries and signal processing libraries are great things to start with

5207636
post	get
right now when they do a get the form displays but when they do a post i want to route it do a different action is this possible

5207652
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
for generic java applications i would recommend amazon-web-services if the costs associated with beanstalk and rds are not too high

5207683
getter	setter
ive had difficulties with datacontracts and defining custom getter and setter

5207728
int	boolean
by default i mean int boolean columns which are used 90 of the time to filter table results

5207735
int	double
all the results in json seem to be strings even though in the mysql table properties are big int int and double

5207739
firefox	safari
this works fine in safari so i assume webkit in general but in firefox its removed or ignored or something.

5207830
min	max
whether it s a max heap or min heap depends on the comparison function you pass to it seqnum 789

5207830
skip-lists	queue
for example i ve seen a skip-lists based priority queue that outperforms a heap-based priority queue

5207833

i m writing a method that takes three 2d int arrays representing r g and b values of an image a width and height and a boolean denoting if the specified image is color or black and white

5207855
mp3	wav
i would recommend using bass and mp3 instead of wav

5207855
mp3	wav
to include wav mp3 files in your pe be it exe dll use resources

5207865
sequence	permutation
think of all the permutation you would have with whole sequence

5207875
width	height
it seems like the size is only re-calculated once text width height or available space changes

5207911
mouse	keyboard
i need to override the autocomplete focus event with a custom action and do something based on whether the user was selecting from the list using the keyboard and not the mouse

5207911
keydown	mouseenter	keydown	keyup	keyup	mouseenter
to do that i m checking the originalevent.type in the event object which is supposed to contain the type of action performed keydown keyup mouseenter etc

5207914
nginx	lighttpd
use nginx lighttpd

5207929
gridview	repeater
never used a repeater but with some simple jquery and html i think you can get the same effect without the bloatedness of the gridview controls

5207935
nhibernate	automapper
okay so i have an issue at the moment which is either down to automapper my nhibernate query or domain dto design

5207935
nhibernate	automapper
can i get automapper to ignore the parent instance in the child preferrably even i think if i could get nhibernate to fetch the list but keep a proxy on the parent property

5207946
rubygems	rvm
i ve been using rvm to handle all the installation of ruby and rubygems but i can t seem to isolate the issue

5207993
boost	stl
create your library naming it with the compiler and stl versions included in the library name exactly like boost libraries do

rss	feed
i m trying to use a cck date field i created as the date for an rss feed

5208179
post	get
i would like my iphone app to get and post data via a websockets web service

5208203
width	height
then scale accordingly using scalebitmap by multiplying the scaler by the image height and width and also use the same scaler for positioning example image x lets say is at 50 scale it using the same thing x scaler 50

5208229
intersect	contains
each plane then contains a set of lines that intersect in points all of those are the edge points of your polyhedron you ll have to connect in a convex way

5208230
spaces	delimiter
i have a log file with spaces delimiter numbers

5208321
implements	extends
and i believe some portlet apis also use a non- httpservlet class they just implements servlet and don t extends httpservlet

5208321
post	get	post	put	put	get
as to the http methods next to http get and post there are also head put options etc

5208321
post	get
but when it comes to homegrown servlets then it are indeed get and post which gets the lone attention

5208335
int	double
1 if as the name indicates this converts an ipv4 value s ina string to an unsigned int the return type os not double as you say - it would be ctypes.c_uint32

5208335
int	double
2 your example value is not a valit ipv4 address and cannot be converted to a 32 bit int neither does it makes sense as a double - a 64 bit floating point number - it is simply invalid

5208450
post	get
however when i dont add it i can get the other post data but of course no file upload

5208454
superclass	subclassing
i mean that the superclass rely on subclassing methods

5208455
range	minimum	range	min	range	max	min	max	minimum	max
if we assume that you know the maximum and minimum values of all numbers in the array or can at least limit them to some maximum range say max - min + 1 then create an auxiliary array of that size initialized to all zeros say auxarray

5208467
getter	setter
add access modifiers setter getter and constructors if necessary

5208497
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
superclass is inherited by subclassing

5208497
superclass	subclassing
when u call method from subclassing u can put to call superclass method s

5208578
int	chars
by using a chars pointer you point to the first byte and change it to 0x00 which changes the int to 256 256 1 + 0

5208587
width	height
why have they not used coordinates according to image width and height

5208602
tabs	tabpanel
i have a rich tabpanel with about 5 tabs

5208603
int	chars
so basically the problem is not that you have data loss is that the chars pointer points only to the first byte of the int and so it changes only that the other bytes are not changed and that s why those weird value if you are on an intel processor the first byte is the least significant that s why you change the smallest part of the number

5208604
int	chars
so in your case the int pointer refers to a block 4 bytes in size while a chars is only one byte long

5208604
int	chars
when you set the chars to 0 it only changes the first byte of the int value but because of how numbers are stored in memory on modern machines effectively in reverse order from how you would write it you are overwritting the least significant byte which was 4 you are left w 256 as the value

5208609
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
allocate a uitabbarcontroller a uinavigationcontroller and 2 uiviewcontroller

5208609
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
now you have a uiviewcontroller and a uinavigationcontroller with a uiviewcontroller inside it

5208629
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
however in the performance perspective implementing a view container such as uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller would be most effective

5208673
integer	unsigned
u treats the integer as unsigned whereas d treats the integer as signed

5208675
put	get
this is an edit multiple situation so i created two new controller actions select which handles the get request and the view and assign which handles the put request from the checkboxes in the select view

5208801
hide	show
i think that jquery will return an object with following methods and property which we use on them like hide and show

5208856
inherited	subclassing
it usually does not involve hiding all methods since those are the public or in some cases inherited contract between the class and the client classes and or subclassing of that class

5208871
ssl	https
- ssl tls support in case of ftps and https

5208872
textarea	textbox
similarly i wanted that the applet should appear when the user clicks on textbox textarea element and after some operations the result in the applet textbox should go into the html text element

5208926
getter	setter
say i have a property whose setter is protected by a lock but without any lock around the getter

5208932
udp	tcp
given your gps coordinates are periodically updated you could consider using udp instead of tcp

5208990
rspec	machinist
i m using rails 3 machinist 2 cucumber and rspec all together and have two blueprints.rb files

5209035
actionscript	haxe
this is a separate language that compiles into other languages so you can code in haxe and have it compile into actionscript javascript php and a few more

5209049
floor	sqrt
using fromintegral is necessary because the incoming type is int but the functions floor and sqrt operate on types realfrac and floating respectively

5209120
post	get
if i post this i get 3 results for context

5209120
post	get
but when i post it i only get results for the first and not for the ajax-loaded ones

5209192
post	get
here s what i get link to image sorry i don t have enough reputation to post images

5209207
selecteditem	selectedindex
since selecteditem and selectedindex are currently under the private set rule indeed you cannot modify them through the application

5209228
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that for some reason location.reload effectively is not a writable property in firefox and google-chrome

5209228
opera	safari
alternatively you can limit your testing to ie safari and opera in which .reload is writable

5209229
graphics2d	bufferedimage
you can achieve this using graphics2d and bufferedimage

5209264
switching	screens
any attempt to switching back to it when it is running causes crash or black frozen screens

5209312
width	height
that said for pixel perfect operations you often have to often the texture coordinates by a fraction the image s pixel width say 0.5f float image- width and height in order to make sure opengl or d3d samples from the correct place

5209317
daemons	systemd
the biggest problem with storing the pid in the file is that a low-numbered pid used by a systemd start up daemons can get reused on a subsequent reboot by a different daemons

5209349
awt	swing	swt	swing
after that the details vary depending on the window toolkit awt swt swing etc. you re going to use

5209349
awt	swing	swt	swing
there s not much difference between swing and awt you create a frame add the canvas to the frame and add an eventlistener for opengl events reshape draw etc. as i recall swt changes things a bit more but it s been long enough that i don t remember the details

5209350
peer	p2p
the program i m writing aims to create a p2p network of jocaml runtimes which all make private computations and store their results locally relying on data stored in other peer of the network

5209350
peer	p2p
p2p network of peer on the internet so 1-1 connection between any two nodes

2 an app that determines whether chars string x is an identifier or int or whatever

5209476
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and safari and firefox showed it in one form or another

5209476
firefox	safari
safari showed it as blue firefox showed it as a dotted outline.

nhibernate	automapper
make sure that your source object along with its collections is eagerly loaded from the database before passing it to the mapping layer or you cannot blame automapper for being slow because when it tries to map one of the collections of your source object it hits the database because nhibernate didn t fetch this collection

5209498
hide	show
the order should be show loader open box hide loader then finally scroll to content

5209498
hide	show
instead it seems like this is what s actually happening when i test it show loader hide loader scroll to content then open box

5209511
hash	md5
use md5 hash of column data for unique keys

5209511
hash	md5
then either have your php script calculate the md5 hash of the text fields or have mysql do it as in the following

5209586
composite	memento
i d suggest to use a composite memento serializable into xml

5209608
listview	gridview
if you can get away with it gridview and listview can be much easier to work with using adapters such as arrayadapter and cursoradapter

5209632
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

5209651
mouseup	mousedown
what i would like is for textbox.leave to be triggered by mouseup not mousedown

5209655
hash	salt
using sha-512 is a good idea to get a cryptographically strong hash but your choice of a salt does not add much extra security

5209655
hash	salt
if the salt is known then the attacker can just precompute a table of hash values with the salt hardcoded in

5209655
hash	salt
if i wanted to attack your system i could iterate across a bunch of known strings deterministically compute the salt for each string then compute the sha-512 hash of the salt string and store it in a table

5209655
hash	salt
if you want a better security system instead consider using a salt that s randomly-generated and then stored alongside the resulting hash

5209688
int	chars
this function takes three arguments a pointer to a string chars a pointer to an int holding the size of that string and a file pointer and returns the length of the line read

5209688
realloc	malloc
getline dynamically allocates space for the string using malloc realloc and thus you do not need to know the length of the line and there are no buffer overruns

5209718
hash	salt
additionally use a random and unique salt for each hash operation and store it together with the hash to be able to reproduce the hash for comparison

5209740
ienumerable	iqueryable
but if you really want to do it in lambda expressions and linq then your problem with the above code is that .select ... returns an ienumerable iqueryable which creates a new query but doesn t execute your lambda expressions

5209740
ienumerable	iqueryable
you could force the lambda to evaluate by calling an extension method that forces an enumeration of the data the ienumerable iqueryable represents

5209760
int	boolean
o1 o2 can be primitive types long int boolean strings or arrays

5209850
width	height
i believe that has the display inline by default so width and height do not affect it

5209866
post	get
you get one single global feed that combines all the comments from all the post into one giant feed

5209870
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
if you prefer line-oriented reading instead you could wrap the fileinputstream in an inputstreamreader which you can then pass to a bufferedreader

5209884
next	except
it is like the next command except that when until encounters a jump it automatically continues execution until the program counter is greater than the address of the jump

5209915
ssl	https
i ve been using perl s mechanize library but for some reason with https the timeout parameter i m using crypt ssleay for ssl

5209936
cpu	processors
the two have slight differences in semantics but it may be enough to know that a sched_rr task will eventually relinquish the processors to another task of the same priority due to time slices while a sched_fifo task will only relinquish the cpu to another task of the same priority due to blocking i o or an explicit call to sched_yield 2

5209937
qstring	qdebug
inline qdebug operator const qstring t stream- ts t

5209954
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to fadein an fadeout items in the array to a div

5209954
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to make this work in a fadein fadeout manner

5209965
disk	ram
you create a complete snapshot of the computer s ram cpu registers and i o registers by simply copying it all to hard disk without any modifications or re-orderings

5210035
fadein	fadeout
the code you re using won t work for various reasons - having zero delay between calling fadeout and fadein means you won t get the 3 second delay you re looking for between fading in and out and that calling both functions lead to some strange effects with the jquery effects queue

5210049
pull	push
i think you just forgot to push your changes on one side and then do a pull on the other side

5210146
children	parent
the whole point of the inherited scale is that when you place some items in a parent mc and you start to scale the parent all the children follow suit

5210153
versioning	upgrade
however for the visitors who for some reason don t want to upgrade their silverlight versioning they are seeing this annoying message on every single page load

5210161
firefox	safari
when i use border-radius to create rounded borders in css3 it just works fine on safari firefox and so on

5210188
getter	setter
in my implementation i have getter and setter like below

5210188
getter	setter
i want to use properties and synthesize the getter and setter but have a few questions

5210188
getter	setter
readwrite so both getter and setter are present

5210243
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it is common though not always required to use copy semantics for nsstring properties to avoid issues with nsmutablestring objects being changed behind your back

5210258
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the releasedate property setter can t be synthesized as you re transforming a nsstring into a nsdate to store it that also avoids common issues with nsstring properties for which you d better use copy to avoid problems with nsmutablestring

5210290
memcpy	memset
when moving setting small blocks of memory i prefer using intrinsics based on rep movsb and rep stosb rather than calling memcpy memset which are usually both optimized for larger blocks and not especially limited in size

5210318
apache	nginx
btw2 i added the python tag because i currently use python django apache and nginx linux and some lame developers use windows

5210384
versioning	upgrade
i am using catalyst for an application and am getting ready to upgrade the production versioning to the next major release

5210408
division	multiplication
so no multiplication or division

5210463
getter	setter
by the way should my entities only contain public getter setter to their attribute and only that

5210479
firefox	safari
i ve kept the pngs as small as possible and optimised as possible but when testing it in any browser safari firefox ies it takes at least 2 seconds to render

5210491
filtering	grouping
alternatively you can use the not filtering to remove the current input selector from the grouping

5210494
lisp	scheme	ocaml	scheme	erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml	erlang	scheme

i wanted to take advantage of included dotcover in teamcity 6

5210509
versioning	upgrade
i read about this being a bug and upgrade to a newer versioning of glassfish to solve the bug

5210515
anjuta	gedit
you can also use a full grown ide to edit your sources such as sharpdevelop or anjuta but i find gedit and a terminal to be my preferable dev tools for c

5210515
vim	gedit
one reason being that i actually have to do everything myself mostly so i know what s going on the same can be achieved with vim instead of gedit

5210519
uiview	subviews
as example you could have your own class uiview which uses a subviews

5210563
int	chars
how can i convert to a string of the int in the second component gives the number of repetitions of the chars in the first component

5210596
minimum	max
the problem is that if the region is not a rectangle the function will still returns true as it looks at the max and minimum coordinates to create the square

5210672
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
in my java swing application i have noticed that when i click on a disabled jmenuitem in a jpopupmenu it hides the menu but i i do not want to hide it as if nothing is clicked

5210682
explode	implode
i was gonna go with an explode implode but this is better and shorter

5210690
put	get
you put implementations into the directory and they get auto-discovered

5210693
put	get
is there a way where i could inflate a layout and get the child of the xml implementation and put it on one view

5210718
cos	sin
these values will be passed to sin cos tan functions and will return the proper values to be used in glut camera

5210718
cos	sin
is there way i could use sin cos as i do in the yawn code to achieve the same rotation

5210722
actionscript	mxml
it has the same actionscript language but uses a tag based syntax called mxml similar to silverlight

5210737
int	double
float is a type like int or double

5210785
filtering	grouping
there are reasons for separate tables such as not having to include categories or filtering and logically separating entries that should not be grouping blog comments vs news comments

5210802
cos	sin
then sin a is defined as the amount of rightwards and cos a and the amount of forwards to reach the point at angle a on the unit circle

5210802
cos	sin
tan sin cos so as we approach n pi 2 90â it diverges to + - infinity

5210810
post	get
you can also add an order by latest desc to the end of the query if you wish to get an ordered list of the latest post across all user ids

5210834
children	parent
edit alternatively you could build a view linking parent to all its children and use that view as a basis for tying items

5210846
post	put
therefore it was using the put method to post my form

5210867
implements	extends
i usually suffix the name of classes of what they extends or implements

5210873
min	max
also nice is to print out result that have the same max or min value different characters on different kart or bike that add up to the same value

5210951
queue	fifo
make sure you use a fifo queue

5210971
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

5210973

switching to airplane mode

5211100
nsstring	nsdata
this method recursively validates that all the contained objects are property list objects instances of nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary before writing out the file and returns no if all the objects are not property list objects since the resultant file would not be a valid property list

5211101
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox but blows up on google-chrome

5211116
getter	setter
what i m trying to figure out is if i should have a getter and setter method for each field in the database or should i just pull in the entire row and just grab the particular column i need inside of php

5211120
printwriter	bufferedwriter
but can t i just use a bufferedwriter instead of a printwriter

5211148
min	max
the user is only specifying colors for each level not the value which determines min and max

5211148
min	max
57 would result in a color hue in between positive min and positive max

5211160
google-chrome	firefox
i simply want to reuse my code from my google-chrome extension by hosting a webapp online and including it in the extension both google-chrome and firefox by using a popup window

5211162
integer	unsigned
doubtless this seems like a strange request given the availability of tostring and convert.tostring but i need to convert an unsigned integer uint32 to its string representation but i need to store the answer into a

5211183
google-chrome	safari
try to verify that the problem with the horizontal scrollbar exist in google-chrome or safari web browsers

5211183
width	height
setting the grid height explicitly like height 120px instead of height auto can also follows to vertical scroll bar which will take the grid width

5211203
printwriter	bufferedwriter
the printwriter could also delegate its operations to a bufferedwriter if desired

5211216
printwriter	bufferedwriter
if you need the buffer you can wrap the bufferedwriter in a printwriter

5211222
postorder	inorder
printing can be done pre-order or inorder as here or postorder

5211243
uitableview	uisearchbar
the alternative would be to write your own uisearchbar and uitableview combination similar to how uisearchdisplaycontroller works then you ll get better control

5211272
versioning	upgrade
so in case anyone else is struggling with a similar issue - upgrade to the latest versioning that should resolve it

5211276
post	get
how do i get the data to post inside the textarea

5211292

hash	salt
there are some good php specific tips in the existing how to hash and salt passwords question

5211439
post	get
i m trying to get this post value of this variable but i can t access it

5211445
hash	salt
you might want to consider storing a salt hash of the password instead of encryptint the entire xml file

5211468
filtering	grouping
additional to the answer posted if you are filtering for a single query you should - for performance reasons - add the poll_answers to the grouping sub query since you only want to count the votes for a single poll not the entire table

5211469
min	max
the min and max functions provide a key argument for exactly this purpose

5211469
min	max
if you do want to apply this to much larger data sets you could find the driver and vehicle with the min and max for each stat and then for each stat combine the max driver with the max vehicle and the min driver with the min vehicle

5211512
folder	directory
in an attempt to find out what was going on with my documents directory i enabled file sharing and instead of seeing the file i copied i get an inbox folder and upon copying that folder to the desktop i see that my files are in there

how can i cast qdialog to qwidget or is there any other workaround other than doing the whole design over again

5211601
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
also i would like that any of the installation packages could remove upgrade a previous versioning of any of the other packages

5211623
post	get
the java program would use http s get post processing to send receive messages to the cics cobol program

5211635
qdialog	qwidget
for that the simplest path is to change your class to inherit from qwidget directly rather than qdialog

5211635
qdialog	qwidget
also qdialog inherits from qwidget

5211635
qdialog	qwidget
no type-casting necessary to use a qdialog when a qwidget is expected

5211648
put	get
with a wildcard and the word extends it means that you can get b out of the object but you cannot put anything in the object in a type safe way

as ajsoaks says in case if there is 302 error you should repeat the request but this time using get method instead of previous post

5211671
firefox	safari
the new url you can see in the browser or if you want it is very useful also in the future checking it with firebug firefox plugin or safari web inspector

5211675
udp	tcp
if c can talk to a at all it must use 1.2.3.4 and r must be configured to relay packets addressed to 1.2.3.4 to a in typical configurations r will only do this on certain tcp or udp ports if at all

the first takes the output of w uses grep to only select the line with load and then cuts everything except for the 11th chunk of data delimiter is a spaces which is the first load number with a comma

5211761
post	get	draggable	droppable
the callback would need to a identify the id of the draggable item b the target list based on which droppable tab it was droppped on and c send both to a php script via get post which would do the database interaction moving the item from one database table to another

5211763
put	get
you may get better results from the compiler if you put in expected function signatures everywhere so that the type checker can tell you where it went wrong

5211763
int	chars
specifically your expression 1 x or n x fail to be of the type chars int so they don t match the type inside the list you re feeding it

5211776
onresume	onpause
enable it by calling enablemylocation onresume and disablemylocation onpause

5211784
cos	sin
it should support + - special functions cos sin and constants pi e and parenthesis

5211794
post	get
as to why they are using a get rather than a post that is odd behavior

5211814
put	get
and i can t figure out what to put instead of the question marks in order to get the value of the element into the value

5211831
submit	submission
in any case when you submit the form from firefox you should see that the url of the form submission appears in the firefox address bar

most of jruby s documented success stories involve the ability to access java from ruby. also it is possible to run jruby on systems that may be difficult or impossible to get mri to run on

5212344
jruby	mri
there are some differences between mri and other c-based rubies and jruby you should be aware of

int	chars
sadly from its origins of the c programming language chars pointers to chars are not treated as just a pointer to a type like int pointer to int or float pointer to a float but many library functions treat these as nul-character terminated strings

5221800
hide	show
you can show hide anything in your theme implementation

5221864
filtering	grouping
5 you may or may not care about grouping delay which is a measure of the distortion caused by different frequencies taking different times to pass through the filtering

5221906
sorting	grouping
i changed the sorting property within the milestones grouping to completiondate and it seems to be working fine now

5221907
inherited	properties
therefore the inherited list-style properties do not apply to the span element unless it has display list-item set

i am not entirely sure why this is the case but from what i found while trying to debugging this there are some things that are gotten from the user s profiling

5221971
public	protected
and like already said var is an old syntax you should now give a visibility to your variable with public protected or private like in c++ or java

5221971
public	protected
in your case you want to use public or protected

5221971
getter	setter
usually getter and setter are defined at the same level ie the same class and there s no point in instantiating a test object in a variable from core

5221991
ubuntu	debian
you can find out more about patchutils here and it s packaged in debian ubuntu as patchutils

5222056
integer	unsigned
i understand that this is an unsigned integer so my question is how to convert this value to a range of -1 to 1

5222099
filtering	grouping
you need to specify the parameters of your filtering sample rate cut-off frequency width of transition band pass-band ripple minimum stop-band rejection whether phase and grouping delay are an issue etc

5222193
width	height
with ax and ay the coordinates of a and bx by the coordinates of b and assuming the centre of the rectangle with width w and height h is at 0 0 the following should work

5222195
postgresql	mysql
preferably the solution would be sqlite3 postgresql and mysql compatible

5222209
getter	setter
i recently read about the fact that there is a possibility of defining getter setter in javascript

5222209
getter	setter
the problem then is how to implement getter setter

5222209
getter	setter	implements	extends
so how do i implements getter setter in the constructor so as to be able to both use getter setter and extends the prototype

5222216
vorbis	webm
webm files - vp8 video codec and vorbis audio codecs

5222222
folder	directory
i browse to the php directory and then the ext folder where it copied the dll files to

5222224
width	height
after it rotates set its width and height to be the width and height of the page

5222224
width	height
if you change say the image s height and width to be 100 then you only need to change the size of the div and the image should scale with it

5222319
getter	setter
you can set setter getter for properties of objects though

5222326
setcontentview	findviewbyid
in order for findviewbyid to work you must have previously called setcontentview

5222342
versioning	upgrade
did you upgrade a project to visual studio 2010 from a previous versioning

5222342

i use a rule of thumb that manmade artificial values such as money are best represented in decimal formats bigdecimal whereas natural values such as height and width are more appropriate as float double

5222397
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in os x across firefox safari google-chrome and opera the padding is lost yet an extra 0.4px is added to the line height and height see ff-pc-style.png

5222416
multiplying	add
then you need to define the computational environment integer or float alu add and multiplying cycles

5222437
int	chars
the next few chars it is likely to meet will be the int itself and depending on the endian-ness the zero byte will be either the first or second

5222446
oncreate	setcontentview
when you are extending activity there should be a method oncreate in which you need to setcontentview r.id.textview1

5222447
cumsum	tapply
you can create a data.frame and assign the elements to groups using diff ifelse and cumsum then aggregate using tapply

5222470
for-loop	arrays
currently i have the oncreate call an asynctask that has a for-loop which iterates through an arrays of paths for the files one at a time which then calls the next asynctask inside the for-loop which downloads the file from that path and then in the onpostexecute assigns the file to the ui view

5222493
draggable	droppable
yes look at the j queryui framework - specifically the draggable droppable selectable and sortable plugins

i was wondering if there is some easy way in tfs to get a specific project and put it into a destination folder of your choosing and put a label on it or version number

5222611
folder	directory
i created bin directory in my project folder and placed there libvorbis_static.lib and libvorbisfile_static.lib

5222611
folder	directory
also i created in the bin directory libvorbis folder and an include folder in it and placed there vorbis with codec.h vorbisfile.h vorbisenc.h and ogg with os_types.h and ogg.h folder

5222611
folder	directory
i added libvorbis_static.lib to additional dependencies of my project and the bin folder to additional library directory

5222634
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
so the question is how can i author this installation package such that when a new versioning is installed only the targeted instance is upgrade and other instances are left alone

5222710
sudo	passwd
use sudo -k for testing to clear your sudo timestamp so the next time the script is run it will require the passwd again

5222711
width	height
i need to scale down an image that has a height or width greater than a predefined pixel value

5222711
width	height
i wrote some code that takes a look at the original image checks to see if either the width the height or the height and width are greater than the max width max height settings

5222711
width	height
for example if the image is 900h x 300w and the max height is 700h i will need to resize the height to 700 and the width to

5222723
put	get
what i d like to do is put a conditional so that this doesn t get rendered if i m on the home page

5222736
super	self
it just init s returns self and all i do in setselected is call super

5222771
unsigned	short
furthermore ..why i must use template here i read the template tutorial and it is used to optimize code and reduce code repeation but here the n must be always unsigned short

5222771
int	double
when i look this exmaple i understand that i use template because my datatype can be anything i want and i can use it for int double or any kind of numbers

5222810
button	checkbox
otherwise when the button is triggered the gridview will be rebound meaning all checkbox are reset

5222842
width	height
the first step in your algorithm should be to calculate the aspect ratio by dividing width by height

5222842
width	height
width 300 height 200

5222922
jruby	rubinius
rubinius especially the current development trunk which adds ruby 1.9 compatibility and removes the global interpreter lock and jruby would both be fine choices

5222922
jruby	rubinius
as an added bonus rubinius comes with a built-in actors library for concurrency and jruby gives you access to clojure s concurrency libraries or the akka actors library

5222922
jruby	rubinius
this shows you that ruby code at least when it is carefully written can be just as fast as c especially since databases tend to be long-running and thus rubinius s or jruby s and in the latter case specifically also the jvm s dynamic optimizers which c compilers typically do not have can really get to work

5222925
opera	google-chrome
you would do well to start using console.log instead of alert as you can use firebug or the built-in console in opera or google-chrome

5222936
int	double
in your case it s a good idea to use templates because it enables you to have vectors of int floats double or whatever you like

5222954
implements	extends
i want to extends this to implements favorites and recents so that when the user hits the button i present a uitabbarcontroller that has the abpeoplepickernavigationcontroller on one tab and then two other tabs with the favorites and recents which i m guessing will be uitableviewcontrollers

5238475
width	margin
i have tried styling as a block and doing margin 0 auto with a fixed with but thats a problem i need it to stretch along 100 of the width because the fields ip city region country name and country code will be filled in via geoloc services automatically so having a fixed width of say 500px is not big enough therefore it needs to be the whole width i want it centred because if there is someone viewing my webpage that there info doesnt use the whole width it would look better centered

free	malloc
since the mgrib is allocating the memory using malloc we need to free the memory using free function

5238549

if that doesn t help try finding any other shutdown hooks and attaching btrace profiler to them

5239387

in the future you ll probably get better results if you post a clear question with a code sample that actually compiles and demonstrates the problem you re actually having

graphics2d	bufferedimage
i have thought of getting a bufferedimage with robot class and then using pixelgrabber to zoom in but wondered if i can directly work with graphics2d without using image objects

5239646
post	get
if you are already doing that and you can still get multiple form post then the problem is a delay between the clicking of the button and the button being disabled and you must be submitting the form multiple times during this delay

5239651
fullcalendar	jqplot
for example a google map in one a jquery fullcalendar in another a jqplot in another etc

5239768
post	get
on your ipn page you can log all get post and cookie variables pretty easy

5239802
mouseup	mousedown
i can keep current selected index only one item can be selected in a variable in selectedindexchanged and reset it in mousedown but between mousedown and mouseup last item is selected - and it doesn t look good

5239872
for-loop	arrays
if you have only a handful of items in the original arrays say less than 16 then you can also count from 0 to 2 n -1 in a for-loop

5239880
filtering	grouping
my code fails at the regex step because although i just want to filtering out everything except a single regex grouping when i get the results it s always returning the grouping that i want -and- the grouping before it even though i in no way requested the first backtrace grouping

5239907
google-chrome	firefox
if you disable javascript on your browser you will see that both firefox and google-chrome work fine

5239919
post	get
you could use post here as well but get will be clearer as a beginner and refreshing won t invoke the browser s submit form again dialogue

5239919
post	get
if using post you should really follow post redirect get that wikipedia url is terrible

5239932

however if i change it to do some actual work in the background then i get a very long delay between onpause being called to start the rotation and onresume being called later in the new orientation

5240184
base-class	subclassing
since as you say the subclassing has all the properties of the base class it is-a base-class object then a cast from the subclassing to the base class will always succeed but never the reverse

5240184
base-class	subclassing
it has be created first either directly or by instantiating a subclassing of custommembershipuser not a base-class

5240195
folder	directory
since cvsexportcommit looks for the cvs folder in the directory it fails

5240267
int	double
how come the difference between two pointers to double becomes an int

5240277
width	height
it s possible to have fields that expand in height and width but you are giving the users free form boxes and may make your processing of the expenses more difficult

5240345
hide	show
yes you can show or hide any canvas programmatically using the show_view and hide_view procedures

5240352
hide	show
the easiest thing to do is apply the same showstock onmouseout onmouseover to the stock1 div as well so that it show itself while moused over but hide itself when not moused over except when you mouse over an area within the a tag that show it

i plan on having dozens of images on a single page and don t want to add the width and height attribute to every single image tag

5240532
width	height
i am using the masonry plugin and it requires a width and height attribute for images

5240551
width	height
assuming that you want the height width attributes to be set to the img s actual height width rather than scaled modified in some manner

5240553
width	height
you could use the jquery height and .width methods as these return the computed width and height

5240553
width	height
you should always include the width and height attributes in your img tags however as some browsers will not render these images correctly without them

5240555
tcheckbox	tpanel
note - regarding read-only it appears that delphi s tcheckbox doesn t even have a read-only option this has been faked by placing it on a tpanel and disabling that.

5240629
division	multiplication
typical examples of microcoded instructions are division and multiplication and this is the case for both cisc and risc

5240629
division	multiplication
an additional insight as to their relative complexity is their respective throughput on k10 a multiplication every other clock cycle can be sustained 2.5 - 5 2 - in operation simultaneously but only sustain one division every 77th clock cycle same as division latency

5240647

membase	couchbase
membase and couchone merged into couchbase where i work fwiw but i don t work on membase

therefore it seems reasonable that the future of membase will have couchdb features map-reduce query replication backup off-site http rest interface etc

5241455
put	get
when i put itemlist_1.price tamount as totalitemcost i get an error saying tamount is an invalid column

5241466
post	get
lastly navigating to asmx endpoint in browser will invoke soap end-point and you will always get xml request-response this is because asp.net script handler will do json serialization only if request is post request and content-type is json

5241476
jar	manifest.mf
double clicking on jar would invoke javaw java - window mode to run the main class defined in manifest.mf within the jar and therefore system.out would not be available to see

if you were to post the edited contents of the script you might get some answers about how you could port it to a windows cscript or batch file

5241823
accessor	properties
it s good to understand what s happening in this code but if you use properties with synthesized accessor you won t have to write it very often

5241837
strcpy	strtok
but beyond that and possibly why you re getting stack smashing errors is because strtok will return a pointer to whatever token it finds and if that s bigger than the array you ve allocated for the destination for strcpy it will happily overflow it

5241837
strcpy	strdup
i would consider using strdup instead of strcpy

5241898
pull	push
every developer that uses git now could push his changes to this central repository and the other developer doing the review could pull those into his repo

5242255
width	height
i tried to use height and width property but i can give only static values

5242287
getter	setter
including getter and setter would be a bad idea

5242321
nfa	dfa
also the most primitive way of transforming a nfa to a dfa is with subset construction also called powerset construction where you simply create a state in the dfa for every combination of states in the nfa

5242326
getter	setter
you should not include getter and setter in your diagram until they do something special null checking and so on

5242403
innodb	myisam
i assume you are asking regarding innodb since myisam does not support transactions

5242466
int	double
if you re performing arithmetic using several values you might want to force all of them to the desired type just for clarity - it would be unfortunate for one operation to be performed using int arithmetic and another using double arithmetic when you d expected both to be in double

5242789
onchange	onsubmit
on the form s onsubmit event or onchange for the inputs if you don t want a submit button you can save the settings using the titanium.database or titanium.app.properties - i think the latter would be more appropriate in this case

5242817
bonjour	avahi
assuming linuxpc3 address is 192.168.2.103 following your naming convention and assuming a standard class c network mask of 255.255.255.0 then only those boxes with addresses between 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.2.254 will receive the corresponding dns a update record by which i mean the other avahi bonjour daemons running in these boxes

int	boolean	tinyint	boolean
line four shows type casting with int is a way to insure that both php true and false are stored to mysql tinyint boolean fields

5242934
int	boolean
retrieving the resultant int from mysql into php variables works since int are implicitly cast when assigned to php boolean variables

i have a php form with text box radiobutton and checkboxes.i have connected it to the databse the values are getting stored into the database except the checkbox values.i want to enter all the checkbox values into the database.i want an backend such that it links to two tables.the text box and the radio button values are to be stored in the first table and the id s of the selected checkbox values in the other table

5243937
rpm	yum
get all rpm needed and after install it with yum

5243955
post	get
u can store only that value in database which is checked but you can not store all value of check box with same name attribute because by checking that checkbox that value is proceed to next page via post get

5243976
udp	tcp
on the mark i guess this is because udp protocol is not a connected protocol so you are not bound to a specific remote address like with tcp

5243999
folder	directory
but there are also 2 hidden directory in this folder _t and _w

5243999

5244670
free	malloc
similarly c++ terminology may be adopted constructor destructor possibly new and delete though these names may become misnomers if the c code is ported to c++ but continues to use free malloc

5244743
groupbox	panel
replace typeofcontainer with type of panel within your groupbox stackpanel etc.

second ruby can accept numerals in source code written in different bases such decimal binary hex etc. but it only has one internal representation and you cannot output a numeral in binary

vb.net	vb6
in vb6 you could copy the text into a label and make it expand to fit then measure its width but this won t work in vb.net

5245848
submit	submission
considering the option with a ext.form.formpanel in each item of the cardlayout you could prevent submission each of those forms and in the last one attach a listener to the submit button that loops over the items in your cardlayout panel and gets all form values by calling the getfieldvalues method of basicform on each

if you re using synthesize the generated accessor will handle memory management as specified in your properties line the example you gave uses retain so a retain will be performed on setting a new value to self.propertyname

5251673
accessor	properties
best practices in this case are generally to use properties and synthesize to handle your variables then use the self.propertyname accessor to reduce the memory management burden on yourself

5251673

the guide also recommends you avoid implementing custom accessor using properties without synthesize

as suggested above the filenamefilter is a post file name filter so i am not sure if it would be any help although you are probably creating smaller lists of file lists as each listfiles method would get the complete list

5252746

5252990
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
without the salt you can build a rainbow table once that can be used repeatedly since the password password will always yield the same hash md5 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 sha1 5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8 and is thus easy to identify in a password database

5253082
children	parent
second once a parent s z-index is set unless the child is set to position absolute and the parent is not set to position relative all children are considered to start one level above the parent in regards to stacking order

5253082
children	parent
and since the children in your home block start their own stacking context one level higher than the parent your home li can never be above the items inside it

5253082
children	parent
however if each child of home was set to position absolute and the home li was set to position static the default you could in some edge cases use z-index -1 on those children and make them appear to be behind the parent

i appreciate it s not the latest php 5.2.8 but would value any views on this including whether it s a known bug fixed in a later versioning upgrading php is not a happy task with lots of sites some of which still use unfortunate quirks that all need to be re-tested with each upgrade - if it is a known fixed bug then obviously i ll get it all upgrade asap beyond that it ll probably be easier to outsource the crypt externally since i only use it in one common place for my site

5260191
factories	presenter
and then resolving the presenter factories

5260191
factories	presenter
the dependency on the view factories inside the presenter factories is resolved as expected

5260191
factories	presenter
now i have a million classes that looks like goodpresenterfactory above and i therefore wanted a small base class to handle some trivial common stuff like the dependency on the view factories in the presenter factories

5260191
factories	presenter
then the presenter factories will change and something in that change will make ninject fail resolving

post	get
of course as a general rule it s highly recommended to wrap your ajax calls in a unified method that concatenates the csrf token to the request be it get or post although post is safer and much more correct from architectural perspective so when you make ajax calls you focus on the business input values only and don t need to worry about csrf

touchesmoved	touchescancelled
the problem is that the scrolling of the uiscrollview triggers touchescancelled thus ending the touchesmoved calls that the game relies on to know which elements to manipulate

5261543
touchesmoved	touchescancelled
even if my finger movement doesn t visually trigger the view to scroll moving my finger more than 10 pixels in distance triggers the touchescancelled method thus ending future touchesmoved calls until i lift my finger and start a new touch event

5261543
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchescancelled	touchesended
i am confident that it s the scrolling event that is triggering the touchescancelled method because if i set on the view moving the finger on the screen continues to trigger touchesmoved as it should no matter how far i move my finger on the screen touchesended gets called as expected when i lift my finger after i m done sifting through the elements and each element in the path of my touch swipe is indeed manipulated as desired

5261543
touchescancelled	initwithframe
i have tried setting in the initwithframe method of the view but touchescancelled is still being triggered oddly enough

unsigned	short
the difference between the two arises when you have for example an unsigned short being added to an unsigned char

5264357
int	chars
value preserving rules say that you promote both values to int if it can represent all values of the original type the common case of 8-bit chars 16-bit short and 32-bit int

5264357
unsigned	short
on the other hand if int and short are both 16 bits so int cannot represent all values of unsigned short then you promote the unsigned short to unsigned int note that it s still considered a promotion even though it only happens when it s really not a promotion -- the two types are the same size

5264367
getter	setter
you should use getter and setter methods for that

5264373

superclass	subclassing
you can call base implementation using the base keyword inside the class but if you are trying to call it from the other class i am pretty sure you are violating a liskov substitution principle in your code as any subclassing shoudl provide such an implementation to virutal methods to be completely substitutable for superclass

5265669
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to run a bash script in linux ubuntu but also fedora but it the find command won t work

ecobertura	eclemma
the eclemma plugin is nicer and more mature then ecobertura

5265937
uiview	calayer

floating-point	fixed-point
the two floating-point values would be encoded as fixed-point values

5266842

5267121
for-loop	arrays
the whole reason for the introduction of the enhanced for-loop was that it eliminates the drudgery and error-proneness of iterators and index variables when iterating over collections and arrays 1

5267121
for-loop	loops
yes i understand that iterables can be re-used to create multiple iterators but that all happens outside of the for-loop inside loops there is only ever a forward progression one item at a time over the items returned by the iterator

5267145
setinterval	clearinterval
more about setinterval and clearinterval functions here

5267149
put	get
personally i d go with the option of using server controls instead of straight up html you d get alot more flexibility and then passing through the settings would be pretty straightforward put something like this in your controls backend code

5267183
put	get
this is wrong but what do i need to put in there in order to get the same result

5267217
ienumerable	icollection
to render the object as a mesh or to apply a transform to the object then consider using a verb adjective rather than noun naming irenderable itransformable - this is a common pattern in .net ienumerable verb adjective rather than icollection noun for example

put	get
until you get so familiar with this stuff that these mistakes stop happening you might want to make a habit of checking the parentheses any time you run across a mysterious error have you missed a at the start of an expression or put an extra before the arguments of a function or forgotten the extra level of parens round a cond clause or etc

hide	show
is it possible to show and hide blocks of content in the trac wiki similar to the cloak macro of confluential

5267661
hide	show
instead of changing the src of a single image i would keep all of the images hidden initially and toggle the visibility css attribute of images you want to show hide

5267661
hide	show
that way you can pre-fetch all of the images that you ll need during load time and simply show hide elements as the handlers for your onkeydown events

5267665
put	get
create the even handler for that event and simply just put response.redirect member memberpage.aspx and your users should get redirected to the right page

5267674

i am tring to get the width height values of an element in dom tree html page and i am using below method

5267790
width	height
as a result is there any way to get width and height values of a node element by using getnameditem method or any other you can advise

5267790
width	height
note i need to get real width and height not css or inline because maybe width is 60 in css but it is rendered as 100px.

5267902
hash	md5
there exists a successful attack on the md5 algorithm which lets you find a different message that produces the same hash with relatively little work as compared to brute force

5267902
hash	md5
that attack used to have no real bearing when md5 was used to hash passwords or such

5267902
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
in the mean time new attacks have been found so both md5 and sha-1 can be hash collided at scary speeds and cracking entire databases of properly salt and single-hashed user passwords with these elderly hash is not only entirely feasible but has already been demonstrated

5267902
hash	md5
md5 will quite safely detect a bit error or accidential modification but a malware trying to bypass your personal filewall could rather trivially circumvent your entire security by finding a collision for the infected binary so the hash matches the original

5267912
post	get
is there any way i can get in the first image the post-thumbnail and link from the first post from the first blog and same thing from the second blog for the other image

division	modulo
this will allow you to pack or unpack the elements in o n excepting the complexity of actually generating the factorials and the division and modulo of arbitrary length integers which will be somewhat substantial

5268095
int	chars
meanwhile chars can be more than a chars -- you can also treat it as an int type

5268100
vpn	lan
personally if it was my own business or my professional job to write software i would host my own subversion server and it would be private lan only and i would use a vpn to access it from home

5268122
post	get
note that by default prototype s method to send params is post but you can always change that by declaring method get in the same ajax.updater call like so

5268131
free	malloc
it s the allocator the little piece of code that implements malloc free etc. that knows how long it is

5268215

free	malloc
however free doesn t care about nul terminators instead it keeps track of the length from the original malloc call separately

5268322
free	malloc	free	strdup	strdup	malloc
for pystring_asstring and strdup etc. this is not an option because there is no portable way to get the size of a region of memory -- malloc and free do not expose this functionality

iboutlet and ibaction are not data-types

5268456

5268476
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the easiest way is probably uinavigationcontroller with a uiviewcontroller for each question

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you can simulate this structure with a uinavigationcontroller and 3 uiviewcontroller

5268477
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
it is usually much more expedient to use a control like a gridview or a template control like a datalist or repeater to set up a template to display your results in your desired html format

5268479
gridview	repeater
and i d be much more likely to use an asp repeater rather than a gridview in the first place

portrait	landscape
hours ago i post a question on organizing portrait and landscape mode in iphone and now i think i know how to do it using willrotatetointerfaceorientation duration

5268595
portrait	landscape
the map view does not support rotate but for the setting view i made separate view for portrait and landscape and they swap accordingly when rotated

5268595
portrait	landscape
this view controller does nothing but swap views when rotate and shows appropriate view between portrait and landscape

5268666
mouseleave	mouseenter
the idea is to enlarge the div element on mouseenter and shrink it back to normal on mouseleave

5268700
mouseleave	mouseenter
your understanding of hover mouseenter mouseleave is correct they should only fire once upon entering leaving

5268723
put	get
and remember that polymorphic collections like repos make you lose compile time type information of elements if you put a there you only get back and have to deal with it

what was the reason for using two separate viewcontroller for landscape portrait

5268791
writetofile	nsdata
the simplest way to save it is probably to use nsdata s writetofile options error method

5268799

5269128
hide	show
the code below show how to disable all fields you can change this to disable specific fields and also how to show hide based on field input

5269169
submit	submission
you could also keep it all on one page have the form submit to itself and include the code to process it through a require or include if the form has been submitted display the form if it hasn t been submitted or if there were errors with the submission and and display the results of the submission otherwise thus not even exposing the fact that there is an external php file

width	height
when you bind to it the width height may be zero

5269377

folder	directory
i had my info.plist file in my resources directory so i moved it to the root project folder and renamed it to appname-info.plist and tweaked some stuff in there.

5269458
typedef	struct
secondly there s no reason to always say struct vrfile instead of just vrfile â that s only needed in plain c code not c++ and only when there isn t a proper typedef which there usually is

you can have two separate controls of textbox and textarea in the same div or table and then show the textarea on click of textbox

5269604
accessor	properties
however if fontmanager is a singleton and you make fontref a properties or create an accessor for it then it would be possible to access the value within your c class

5269614
textarea	textbox
you can t change a textbox to a textarea because they are two different types of elements

5269728
unix	bsd
i would be surprised if a modern system even had a text-vs-binary distinction certainly unix linux and bsd systems don t and i suspect that the implementation-defined weasel-words were put in for some now-decommissioned fossil

5269735
inherited	properties
if instead your problem is to avoid reading the database to walk up the tree loading the parents to find inherited properties you ll need to do some sort of caching for the parent values

5269742
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to develop a plugin extension for a browser firefox or ie or google-chrome

super	extends
these two groups both extends from one super class that takes care of the synchronization part

5269766
multiplying	subtract
similarly if you skip the five first elements your loop takes o n-5 time but that too is the same as o n because adding or subtract a constant is even weaker than multiplying by a constant

5269917
post	get
i just spent half an hour playing with the syntax and one of my projects in irb and the closest i could get was something along the lines of post postshelper.helper_method which works in irb if i include postshelper first

5269927
inherited	properties
it iterates all the array s properties names including the names of inherited prototype functions any properties added to it any other non-element properties added to it etc. and not in order at all

super	self
super s initializer is free to return not just nil but also a pointer to an object other than self

5270068

when you do numdoc numofdock since the variables are typed int it will do an int division and then cast the result to a double for the math.log call which will then yield an approximate result for your case

on some settings compressors like upx may hide these resources so you won t be able to see them unless you decompress the executable

5278342
wordpress	oscommerce
the majority of the sites that end up in the state you are referring to only last as long as their domain registrations especially since most wordpress or oscommerce deployments are usually set up as the root domain and service the entirety of the web presence. so generally speaking if the domain itself is in a state of neglect and abandonment the natural expiration process will decommission it and it will no longer be accessible in general

5278342
wordpress	oscommerce
in most cases this would defeat the purpose of leaving the software for cms there at all since none of the records would updatable any longer items in the case of oscommerce posts in the case of wordpress. but this would be highly dependent on the environment required by the particular cms and wordpress for one is pretty particular about read write permissions to work at all

width	height
this data can be compressed to 4 numbers per quad by storing only the offset of the bottom left vertex and encoding the width and height of the axis-aligned box assuming half floats this will be 8 bytes of constant buffer per character -- a typical 256 character font could fit completely into 2kib of l1 cache

int	boolean	int	double
typeformat.format double d int digits boolean scientific boolean showzero appendable a

5293391

5293411
textile	bbcode

5293742
setinterval	settimeout
yes i realize that the setinterval thing can backfire and cause uneven update timing if the called script takes a while to return and that using settimeout instead and re-triggering it on ajax completion is better practice but i believe that the called script is simple enough that this shouldn t be too much of a problem here.

5293780
apache	nginx
other similar software packages include nginx apache s mod_proxy apache traffic server and varnish

5294073
listview	gridview
my backup plan is to just use a surfacelistbox control instead of the listview but i already have working listview gridview code that i d prefer to modify to get the nice touch panning provided by surfacescrollviewer if possible

5294073

after struggling with the listview gridview combination i eventually gave up and implemented this as a data-bound surfacelistbox that includes a horizontal stackpanel as the surfacelistboxitem

5295988
x86	64bit
if you are running your 32-bit process under a 64bit operating system then the maximum user mode address space limit is increased to the 4 gb even though your application is compiled as a 32-bit process - this might be useful if for example you are restricted to targetting the x86 architecture due to some references still being 32-bit only

5296097
wordpress	joomla
wordpress is pretty good about this to but in my experience systems like drupal and joomla are not as designer-friendly because they require you to split up your design into lots of different pieces that are then stitched together by the system which often forces you to add markup that you don t really want to be there from a design point of view

stdout	stderr
the simplest workaround is to not write to stdout â note that it s the default destination of the puts command so you have to be careful â and to take care not to write to stderr either as that s probably under the same restrictions which means that you ve got to be careful how you trap errors especially while testing your script
