this works fine because i can find the analogclock since it s in the layout xml file of the configuration screen which i set in the oncreate through setcontentview

11905949
min	max
i think your best bet is to simply take the event type as a normal integral type use an enumeration to define the built-in types and provide user-defined min and max values between which the user creates their own integer values with a separate enumerator

11905957
width	height
resizable height and width

11905957
hide	show
show hide columns

11905972
int	boolean	int	double
if you dont know about php and single double quotes it will cause the contents to be treated as a string value rather than int of boolean true false

11905989
int	boolean
specific key casts are mentioned in the documentation in particular for your case that boolean are cast to int ie

11905994
int	double
they both return double and the both take 2 int

11905995
qcompleter	qabstractitemview
the issue here is that the completer actually contains a pop-up which is actually a separate qabstractitemview widget refer to the qcompleter popup documentation

to keep your java side collection ordered you don t need to keep calling the sort method but just use a ordered collection like treeset or treemap or any collection that implements sortedset or sortedmap to store your data

11906257
comparator	comparable
you still need to implement comparable or comparator as adelboutros said

11906266
pull	push
here viewcontroller talks to one or more services to pull push the data from to the database using daos

11906277
hide	show
however i wanted the dialog to display quickly especially when hovering so i wanted to simply show and hide it

11906294
post	get
i know you can get the post from a user but it arrives paginated and counting through the pages would be nonsense

11906404
width	height
you re restricting both the width and the height so basically it s wrapping but you can t see the wrapped part

11906404

you can remove the height so you see the wraps or increase the width so it doesn t wrap

11906449
gif	png
if you have php 5.3 and the finfo pecl extension you can use it to get the mime type of the file and have a whitelist of types you will allow png jpg gif i would imagine

11906497
overwrite	preserve
if chrome can t write to it s config directory or if that directory is getting overwrite your settings will not be preserve --- otherwise a kiosk like you describe should work with the settings you specify

11906498
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in google-chrome and firefox

11906518
accessor	properties
if you access the properties through the dependencyproperty interface it completely bypasses the properties s get set accessor

11906518
accessor	properties
in this instance if i manually assign obviously the set accessor for the myvalue properties won t be called

11906527
comparator	comparable
then inside your list you would obviously use the sorts and comparable comparator techniques

11906538
put	get
i put the condition in the select clause rather than the where clause so you can easily get the 50th percentile 17th or whatever values you want

11906544
multiplying	add
the max is 10 so we have to remove 2 - 744 2 12 px well we add them because after that we multiplying for -1

11906544

but we removed 744 2 12px so we have to add it here too well its subtraction because after that we multiplying for -1

goto	break
in my opinion there is absolutely nothing wrong with using a modern goto to break out of an inner loop

11907083
multiplying	division
beware of the integer division if both numerator and demoninator are integer types not an issue in your case but we make sure numerator is decimal by multiplying by decimal literal which insures we have decimal type value.

11907101
post	get
this post deals with the fact that you can t reliably detect mime types without iis but it should get you on your way.

11907116
post	get
his implementation is a little different than yours but by playing with the border-radius you should be able to get the effect closer to what you have in your image though i doubt you ll be able to get the shadow working if you prove me wrong post your code here

nunit	mstest
this sounds similar to a known issue that i m currently writing a blog post about for the f# team blog probably to appear in the next few weeks regarding mstest rather than nunit

it works perfectly in google-chrome but the firebug console in firefox gives the following error

11907263

this would require each machine to run the service some security consideration to be built in and a way of requesting most likely a small windows app cmd line routine that send a udp or tcp request which the service listens for and after validation etc returns the list probably using encyrption or secure sockets

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
well the elegant way would be to add your universal uiviewcontroller to the uinavigationcontroller

11907444
int	chars
when you type 42 or whatever as the first int you actually type three chars 4 2 and then the newline chars that comes from pressing enter

11907444
int	chars
your first scanf reads an int which means that it only reads the 4 and the 2 leaving the newline chars in the input buffer

i think that would break the scenario for keyboard mouse users no

11907465

google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome don t allow copying contents to clipboard not through js there are various flash options but i would suggest staying away unless you absolutely must

11907666
width	height
what s odd is that usually this doesn t happen - so far i ve only encountered this error when the original image has height greater than width and it has been filtered by another app called camera+...the exact same photo before filtering causes no problems and a filtered landscape photo also seems to be fine

11907671
integer	radix
the integer class provides a version of parseint that allows you to specify the radix and similarly the tostring method also allows you to specify the radix

11907692
many-to-many	one-to-many
it s hard to say definitively without a concrete example of what your doing but generally if you find yourself repeating a field then it s a clear sign for a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship instead

11907900
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does send this header and firefox too

11907966
getter	setter
the setpasswordhash and getpasswordhash methods are regular magento magic getter setter so they don t need to be defined anywhere

here s a picture of the chrome elements panel which shows that the min width height 10px is being applied instead of the natural resolution

11908069
width	height
the elements panel shows the computed size at 10x10px yet all of the styles properly match my css above with no indication why it would be using the min width height instead of the proper image width height

11908073
jython	pypy
pypy jython ironpython etcetera may have their own thoughts about how best to do this

11908097
width	height
instead of having an image for each health increment and instead of loading all those images into memory either one at a time or as a lookup list you can just create a bufferedimage instance of the right dimensions width height and draw directly onto its graphics object using the java2d apis

11908106
dictionary	map
however the name of the class of the function is stored as a key in an internal hash map called dictionary in python

free	malloc
also use malloc and free and do not use new and delete

11908360
maven	pom.xml
use maven if you are familliar with it or have time to learn the basics it wouldn t take more than 1 day to understand and learn how to add dependencies in pom.xml via eclipse ide and do mvn clean package or mvn clean install etc. that should take care of build and deployment

next	except
next i implemented hook_preprocess_page in my module in the same fashion as pwd except that i modified the _get parameter and updated the template file reference

11908462
jquery	jqtransform
i got an easy solution you must configure the size attribute of the text input just before the jqtransform usage declaration the quote from protektor is right is 20 of size attribute given by jquery it s detecting the default size of a text input and multiplied by 10

a widening conversion of an int or a long value to float or of a long value to double may result in loss of precision - that is the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value

11908508
floating-point	integer
in this case the resulting floating-point value will be a correctly rounded version of the integer value using ieee 754 round-to-nearest mode

11908536
width	height
i have an image that has it s width greater than the height and it is still outputting using the second if statement in the jquery

11908544
factors	matrix
the reason i believe it should be a matrix is because this way it reads the month as a factors and its levels are the row names instead of moths month of year

11910277
button	checkbox
for this to work though each radio button checkbox needs a value which is then what s matched against values in the array of selected values

11910309

addfailuresanstraceback does what the original version of addfailure does -- copying over two lines of code -- except adds a line that replaces the traceback with none the assignment to err_sans_tb which is used instead of err in the next line

11910356

another option would be to try to create your own custom navigation bar -- possibly by putting a custom view in the center of the navigation bar and stretching it to cover the width height of the bar

11911421
post	get
the request that caused the error was a get and you are trying to get the value of the title parameter from the post dict

post	get
for me it look like your are trying to retrieve data from a post request but the query is in reality a get request

11911427
int	chars
the only way it could fail to be a no-op is if the range of chars is larger than the range of int for example if chars and int are both 32-bit but chars is unsigned.

11911432
post	get
firstly this is a get query so the post dict will be empty

11911435
folder	directory
for example using the genericoptionsparser parameters you can specify files and folder to include which are then available in the working directory

11911439
post	put
what mime type should i use in post and put requests in a restful api to ensure compliance with all server implementations of http

11911443
int	chars
yes you are missing something fundamental the compiler does not read the chars from the memory as if the memory represented an int

11911443
int	chars
instead it reads a chars as a chars and then sign-extends the value to fit in an int so chars -1 becomes int -1 as well

width	height
if you have the option of giving a fixed width to the table cells and a fixed height to the header you can used the position fixed option

11911743
getter	setter
if you were to implement your own enum analog in python i think namedtuple would be the closest thing seeing as your java enum has getter but no setter - namedtuple s are likewise immutable

11911744
google-chrome	safari
the first step is to open the site in safari google-chrome s web inspector and get a feel for where in the tree the data you want is

and constrain the number of children per parent via a trigger or in the application

11913493
children	parent
the trigger on parent is needed to prevent insertion of a parent without any children

11913493
children	parent
if you only require each parent to have a maximum of 9 children not exactly 9 children as implemented in the above trigger you can remove the deferrable initially deferred change the to and chop out the delete handler in the child trigger

11913493
children	parent
btw if i were working with jpa in java or some other reasonably clever orm i d just constrain the size of the collection of children on the parent

11913578
getter	setter
i have never seen an explicit property defined in a protocol obviously you could define the setter and getter so is defining a property inside a protocol an advisable pattern

11913591
getter	setter
you can have properties in a protocol provided every class that conforms to your protocol have a corresponding synthesize for that property or provide a getter and setter

11913594

onresume	onpause
in other words put your save restore code for non view objects in onpause and onresume instead of onsaveinstancestate bundle and onrestoreinstancestate bundle

11914719

also if you have admin privileges or know who does you can change the exactable privilege to all users cd usr bin or wherever gdb is sudo -s type passwd chmod x+a gdb and you re good to go

11916119
ant	maven
unfortunately moving an existing project from ant maven whatever to one of these might not be straightforward

11916165
spaces	delimiter
note that the character spaces is being treated as a delimiter

11916168
datamapper	activerecord
as far as i know this isn t possible with activerecord but if you don t mind changing orm you could look into datamapper instead

11916233
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
moreover you can use a mix of sessions between ie firefox safari and google-chrome

11916251
rspec	minitest
with this option you ll probably want to use minitest or rspec i had trouble getting spork to work on windows with testunit

11916253

edit here is what it looks like in ie firefox and google-chrome

11916302
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
it works perfectly when i use datagridcomboboxcolumn but i d like to use datagridtemplatecolumn to add some more features in future

11916308
division	multiplication
now i would think that i am not the first one who has this kind of problem and there would be already a library for that that already has multiplication division implemented - but it seems that it isn t

11916367
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the footer looks further down in mozzilla firefox 14.0.1 while in safari and google-chrome looks fine

11916401
getter	setter
basically in guessedletters class i just set constructors setter getter and in action listener i put in method which sets them

11916434
getter	setter
i m using setter and getter here

11916473
put	get
so if you put this code into a route you can get access to the request for your username and password

11916557
toolbar	tabs
since i only have two tabs that are links on the toolbar i was thinking of using an if else statement in jquery to determine which page the user is on and therefore which tab to highlight but i am not too sure how to do that

11916569
post	get
i m still confused which it is you want to do send variables in a query string in the url get or post the data with the headers post and make it not visible in the url

11916593
min	max
first having the min max avg for a simple array

11916593
min	max
note since you can t use java libraries for your assignment is easy to do your own versions of the min max functions read the math javadoc

11916593
min	max
using an array is a little bit ugly to read so is better if you create a class to hold the min max avg

11916593
min	max
additional notes if you are studying computer science you ll learn in the future that the loop to calculate max min avg has a complexity of o n

11916593
min	max
if the values array is fully loaded in memory doing the max min avg in three different functions thus reading the array 3 times is still an algorithm of o n order with a bigger constant

11916593
min	max
with the power of today s computers the constant is so small that most of the time you ll not get any gain from calculating min max avg in the same loop

11916599
jobs	cron	pull	push
i m very confused about gae s concepts of tasks task queues both push and pull cron jobs and how each of these relate to frontend vs

11916616
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
everything works perfect in firefox opera google-chrome but not in the internet explorer 9 where the sub-level is not showing when going over the menu item

11916636
put	get
now instead of null put at the end put the char that you should get at the end

11916653
versioning	upgrade
if get_count returns 100 you will need to upgrade your phpcassa to latest versioning

11916695
printf	atoi
i still don t get why when i used a bunch of printf it would die at the line i specified and not before the call to atoi

11916701
listview	gridview
what i finally had to go with to work and move on with the project was a listview with a gridview inside

maven	m2e
install m2e - maven integration for eclipse

11916710
jar	war
it s pretty nice to be able to drop a jar into your web app war deploy it and have it automatically run perf tests on your app

11916710
jar	war
something similar to say visualvm but that deploys as a jar and that can be packaged inside a war

11916715
profiling	instrumentation
you can run the leaks instrumentation in instruments.app hit profiling rather than run in xcode

11916735
unix	bsd
the unix bsd linux crontab system contains a simple but ugly way of specifying this sort of thing

11916740
pull	push
that d be push rather than pull though not sure if that ll work for your case or not

11916753
clang	llvm
apple clang version 4.0 tags apple clang-421.10.60 based on llvm 3.1svn

11916766
ssl	https
a this url also works without ssl so you will not have a deal with check the right certificate etc and for now you can just try to do this work with url applicationcode 1 returnurl https 3a 2f 2fwww.salondata.com 2fv2 2fwa 2floginpostback http instead of https

rolify	cancan	devise	cancan	devise	rolify

google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox - but in google-chrome the polygons and polylines do not get animated correctly

11916846
filtering	grouping
it s a bunch of code built upon wcf but it let you query your datasource with dynamic linq filtering ordering paging and grouping client side

11916904
spaces	delimiter
so when you call scanner.next it pulls the next token and thisite hasaspace is 2 separate tokens because a spaces is a default delimiter

11917004
post	get
i m trying to get content from post via ajax in wordpress

11917027

put	get
why did but it didn t sing. get put in double quotes when the other three items were in single quotes

11917051
mouse	keyboard
the project does require some amount of graphical work and quite a bit of mouse based interactivity as well as some keyboard shortcuts but quite frankly i don t want to dig my hands into ogl for something this small

11917072
portrait	landscape
there are only two issues i do not want to happen when i rotate the screen from portrait to landscape or the other way

11917077
children	parent
each item in the list is a parent with some number of children

11917082
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i would suggest using a gridbaglayout instead of boxlayout

11917095
istream	getline
istream getline expects a pointer so there is no need to dereference it as you did

11917097
pipe	freopen
to present the output in an existing console window one can just omit the calls to allocconsole and freopen and redirect standard output of rundll32 to a pipe

11917098
button	checkbox
so you can drop pictures even button checkbox and even combo boxes

11917103
debian	linux
i should mention that i m using gcc 4.7.1 on debian linux

11917162
viewdidload	dealloc
in basewebviewcontroller i am calling super viewdidload and super dealloc in their respective methods

11917162
viewdidload	dealloc
my question is that since both basewebviewcontroller and secondarywebviewcontroller are subclassing the baseviewcontroller i m not sure what to do regarding calling super viewdidload and super dealloc in secondarywebviewcontroller

11917162
viewdidload	dealloc
in secondarywebviewcontroller i had been calling those super viewdidload and super dealloc but i noticed it caused some problems especially with random crashes when calling super dealloc

11917162
viewdidload	dealloc
secondarywebviewcontroller s viewdidload and dealloc calls the superclass s viewdidload and dealloc causing strange behaviour

11917162
viewdidload	dealloc
currently if i comment out super viewdidload and super dealloc in secondarywebviewcontroller so that baseviewcontroller is never dealloced then everything runs fine

11917216
screens	tablet
or should i just change the css for span7 for tablet screens sizes to match that of span10

11917229
put	get
there are a lot of scm systems that do not guarantee that what you get out of it again is the same thing you put in

11917237
queue	fifo
a queue typically represents a fifo fifo buffer

11917272
post	get
i want users to be able to get my individual blog post as results when they use a search engine like google to search relevant words in the tags or title of the post

11917277
put	get
but wherever i put it i get an error and random things stop working

11917279
postgresql	mysql
in my experience redis is an awesome addition to your stack and can help process data at blazing fast speeds compared to mysql postgresql or any other rdbms

11917290
google-chrome	firefox
it works great on google-chrome but not at all on firefox any ideas

11917310
wordpress	joomla
at wordpress joomla drupal.

11917314
for-loop	arrays
if you want to iterate the arrays use a for-loop or one of the iteration methods from jquery or the native api

11917321
free	malloc
about memory allocation you should use stack instead heap avoiding malloc free in this case

11917328
cvs	svn
it would poll your svn git or whatever cvs you use for changes and then build it on the configuration you provide

11917375
button	checkbox
to get the usual autocomplete behavior go to your project -- build settings -- user header search paths and add example to the list double click on the setting click the + button write example and make sure to turn on the checkbox to the left

11917399
prepare	execute	versioning	upgrade
my fourth vote for versioning 2 is because the repbg function is prepare to have it s execute method function upgrade so you can only take out the preload value from the class valuelist

11917417
subtract	add
with the solution below you can just add subtract values from your symbol list and the table will change automatically

11917437
screens	tablet
i will answer it myself i removed the javascript code and replaced it with this simple change to the bootstrap css to change the width of span7 to the same width as span10 for tablet screens sizes

11917491
vsto	add-in
do any of you have advice on methods for deploying an office vsto add-in especially excel that makes it easy to update and deploy the document as well as the add-in

11917491
vsto	add-in
i have a document level add-in for excel 2010 that i created using vsto

11917491
vsto	add-in
i have actually done this in some situations but not in cases where the document itself included a vsto add-in

11917491
vsto	add-in
make a wrapper project that includes the workbook vsto add-in

11917504
implements	extends
java lets a class extends just one other class but a class can implements any number of interfaces

11917508
children	parent
meaning all the children of g_one all the children of those children and the children of those and so on all the way until the terminal level where that row s name does not exist as a parent name for any other entry

11917508
children	parent
-no children are shared among parent

11917577
post	get
is there any way to get the file name from the iframe i post to

11917584
oncreate	ondestroy
basically i am trying to find a way to distinguish between an orientation change witch calls ondestroy and oncreate and the oncreate and ondestroy when the app is first launched

11917584
switching	screens
if its possible i d rather not but the configchanges orientation line in my manifest and handle the switching myself because i ve heard that can cause problems when dealing with different screens sizes and densities etc

11917585
serializable	deserialization
you can control the serializable and deserialization process using a number of methods specified in msdn

11917612
children	parent
in a tree whose number of children is variable you wouldn t be able to say that it is complete any parent could have the number of children that you want

11917661
min	max	minimum	max
according to the xpages extension library book you can use the min and max properties of xe djnumberconstraints to control minimum and maximum values allowed

11917687
realloc	malloc
the default clause should probably be using realloc rather than malloc and the cast in the default is seriously problematic

11917687
realloc	malloc
given that p is now initialized to 0 a null pointer you could do without the malloc and simply use realloc unconditionally

11917700
width	height
so if my billboards have width and height in metres and their distance from the camera is known as well as the focal length of the camera i can calculate their size on the sensor

11917721
getter	setter
i wonder how to hide a real property field not make it private or public but force to use setter and getter and provide him with simple setter and getter

11917779
matplotlib	scipy
i m using dendrogram from scipy to plot hierarchical clustering using matplotlib as follows

11917785
post	get
how can i modify this action so that for get request it would give out form and for the post request it would process user input data as if it were a separate action

11917785
post	get
update1 i want a single action that serves get and post requests

11917798
for-loop	loops
loops could be created by goto or it could be a for-loop

11917806
post	get
on other post i found people were saying if the number of recursive calls are too much you might still get a sof exception.

11917809
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should use mouseenter and mouseleave because it doesn t trigger every time you change elements within the wrapper div

11917809
slideup	slidedown
if your div is height 0 after slideup you may have to slidedown 0 then hide before fadeto

11917925
for-loop	loops
so when you use geocoding inside the for-loop loops is already finished when you receive the results i will always be 1 and point to the last item of people

11917930
getter	setter
this basically forces the property to be accessed through getter setter methods

11917930
getter	setter
personally it feels like over engineering and prefer to just use pimpl to hide my private details and just provide the getter setter explicitly

11917935
google-chrome	firefox
i have troubles with simple javascript code which works in firefox and not in google-chrome

11917946
put	get
i want to get the free space available on each partition to determine where best to put files

11918018
google-chrome	firefox
you can download it from itunes and from its settings you can choose any browser to simulate as ie ie8 google-chrome firefox

11918035
postgresql	mysql
the reason for thinking in a change mysql postgresql is because i ve been talking to some people that recommended that i shouldn t use mysql because in their own words it is confusing and outdated

11918082
portrait	landscape
the view controller loads a list of videos youtube mobile page but now when you select a video to play the file plays in the ios movieplayer in landscape which is a good thing but behind the parent view controller which remains in portrait

11918091
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome i get a 405 method not allowed

11918144

i looked at the emma4it plugin but the only documentation i could find was this blog post from sonatype and couldn t get it to work

i haven t tried using it with testng but i got it working with junit by adding the following plugin declaration to a pom

11918189
width	height
i m trying to loop through a specified number of cells defined by width and height but i m running into problems here

11918215
width	height
if i provide a fixed width and height or min width and min height for the .flipper elements it works fine but if i don t the flipper doesn t appear

11918230
folder	dir
i did a dir of the folder from command line and the order matches - but neither is alphabetical

11918230
folder	dir
here s what i get when i type dir from the command line not including full folder names

11918238
udp	tcp
unfortunately i need to support 3g and i have heard about lot of users complaining that an application using some custom application protocol on top of tcp or udp is not working

11918279
google-chrome	safari
webkit has a proprietary background-clip text style but it only works on google-chrome and safari

11918290
width	height
i have a div with width 100 and i need the height of the same div to adjust according to how many pixels wide the page is

11918290
width	height
the reason is because an image is stretched across full width of the div and if i set a solid height different resolutions will render it differently and the image looks stretched out

11918308
postgresql	mysql
generally if you re new to both i d say mysql is very easy to start working with while postgresql can have quite a steep leraning curve

11918308
innodb	myisam
my advice would be - don t bother just do what article says except maybe creating tables in innodb format rather than myisam

11918323
width	height
obviously change the width and height combinations to whatever you need and you can also use max-width or width as required

11918333
width	height
i had a similar problem and i solved it by adding style to html body - min width and height elements

11918335
folder	directory
if that works but file is missing at viewdidload then the only possible is you or the system is deleting all files in the documents directory i have heard if your app uses icloud the rules for this folder change

11918340
coldfusion	railo
i m new to railo moving away from coldfusion 8 where my site used to used to use cfx_imagecr3

11918390
int	chars
your conversion failed because you ve entered as a first chars the - sign that cannot be converted to int

11918406
width	height
i was not specifying the height width and margins properly

11918426
hide	show
i typically factor out the hide show logic

11918437
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
there is a big difference moving from windows to linux - you are typically moving from a case-insensitive platform to a case-sensitive platform

11918442
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii	cakephp	yii
i d use a mvc framework to speed up the development cakephp yii codeigniter etc.

11918487
folder	directory
my helloworld.py and app.yaml is in a folder on my desktop and not in the google app engine directory

11918503
srp	principles
if you see your class carrying too much responsibilities then maybe it s time to design another classes to help maybe you re breaking the srp principles

11918513
whenever	capistrano
i wrote a capistrano task to link the files whenever i do a deployment

11918548
portrait	landscape
but of course layout will change from portrait to landscape as well

11918603
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
for audio it only contains the audiotoolbox and the avfoundation

11918622
linestyle	gnuplot
linecolor 0 isn t defined i don t know why gnuplot uses two different conventions here -- i suppose because in theory the colors corresponding to any particular linestyle are terminal dependent so it doesn t really matter too much anyway...

11918666
getter	setter
update it looks like the tag_tokens method is broken for you in both the getter and setter

11918672
stdout	stderr
then your only chance and it is a slim one at best is to inject a thread into the process and while all its other threads are suspended alter the global stdout and stderr

11918728
width	height
just know the basics bitmap width and height for example 256x256 the circles radius and to make things easy make the circle centered at 128 128

11918730
mouseup	mousedown
the mousedown command fires but the mouseup command does not

11918739
jar	war
using war file setwar webapplicationcontext on web-inf is not an option since package is jar

11918745
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseleave
preferably i could make it so as soon as you mouseup from dragging the items on the left side outside of its div container they would disappear but i d setting for after they revert back to their original location the li item will disappear but the mouseenter mouseleave events aren t working right for me

11918751
width	height
this should work fine except take out the width height and border from the javascript they re not changing so why have it there and risk some browsers freaking out on them

11918771
google-chrome	safari
when testing in google-chrome internet explorer and safari everything goes fine

11918800
mouse	trackpad
or you could use the mouse if you re on a laptop where the trackpad is nearby + in gvim

11918891
width	height
this is the shorthand which will create two variables x and y which are width and height respectively

11918956
min	max
this way you can reuse the dps wherever you want and json parser should deserialize it properly to the iteminformation with proper values for dps min and max

11918990
mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
you may want to attach to the mouseout event and set a status on the mousedown so that if you mouse out of the div while mousedown is active it treats the mouseout as a mouseup

11918990
mouseup	mousedown
edit add prevent default to your mousedown event and the subsequent mouseup should fire appropriately in ie9

11919006
post	get
that s the beauty of http based web services soap or rest any client that can get or post an appropriate http request can use it

11919011
width	height
how can i use the current width height which are both specified in percentage 100 as the minimum width height

11919011
width	height
trying to set min width height of all divs to be the current width height which are both 100 by css using javascript or using only css if possible

11919024
int	double
in the file i was reading it went int double int int for each line for about 40 000 lines

11919030
public	protected
it sounds like player is a character so that inheritance should be public not protected

11919074
pdcurses	ncurses
if you need them to work under windows you ll have to use pdcurses as a replacement for ncurses or pywin32 rather than termios

11919077
portrait	landscape
i can start it up in either portrait or landscape mode and everything works as it aught to

11919077
portrait	landscape
the master popup button is visible in portrait mode but hidden in landscape mode

11919077
portrait	landscape
what i don t get is why everything behaves flawlessly when i start in landscape but all of these errors arise in portrait

11919098
short	base
datauri will now contain the data uri for the image which will contain along with a short prefix the base 64 encoding of the image

11919102
width	height
as far as i understand if you dont specify the width and height of a div by default it will always take it from its enclosing div

11919102
width	height
this will apply width and height both as 100 to all 3 divs in wrapper1 wrapper2 wrapper3

11919108
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the problem is that one set of widths works for firefox while another works for safari google-chrome and neither works for opera

11919116
post	get
if you don t understand get and post variables i reccomend reading at least the php manual s page on the array or a more general overview of get and post variables

11919138
int	chars
and querying chars 1 might be faster than an int

11919156
onfocus	onblur
i ve tried using onblur and onfocus handlers but they only fire during a change and not when the initial page is loaded

11919165
getlasterror	deviceiocontrol
i am able to get a handle but once i use deviceiocontrol it fails getlasterror says error is an incorrect function

11919169
cdr	cons
as rainer s answer implicitly indicates the problem you re running into is that the cdr of a cons cell might point to a list or it might point to some other kind of object

11919170
jquery	touchswipe
alternatively if you don t want to modify their source you can bind the following handler to the click event of touchswipe i m using jquery but you get the idea

11919212
width	height
setting the width and height on the images or their containing div via css not using the html height attribute should fix this problem for you

11919274
post	get
all those apis that say they are restful where they say do a get on this url with these parameters and post on this url with a document that looks like this are not practicing rest

11919274
post	get
what is important to note is that now we are hinting to the user through the method attribute on the form that they should do a post rather than a get

11919274
post	get
if it was because you have heard some of the benefits of rest and how to gain those benefits implicitly by making your api restful the unfortunate truth is that there s more to rest than urls and whether you get or post to them

11919274
post	get
perhaps you need to do a post rather than a get because the uri which have a theoretical infinite amount of storage but plenty of technical limitations would get too long

11919285
for-loop	loops
i can find the length using the for-loop procedure where you keep on checking each element but i wanted to just use the while loops and find the null terminating string

11919304
int	chars
is a valid way to check chars int pointer etc

11919319
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you may use stripos for case-insensitive and strpos for case-sensitive search

11919321
google-chrome	firefox
i should mention there are no problems in firefox or google-chrome

11919375
folder	directory
trying to only find those that are contents newfolder this.zip so there is at least one sub folder of the contents directory

11919395
freebsd	linux
i download jlink soft for linux from www.segger.com install it under freebsd 9.0 with linux compat

11919400
min	max
i set the min heap is 64mb and max heap 2gb

11919408
width	height
how can i read actual width height of the recording profile i specify

if you still want to use the gridview then make it fill all the width height by using fill_parent and not wrap_content like you did for the layout_width height and in the oncreate method use a handler to post a runnable in which you retrieve the gridview s layoutparams and use those to set up the adapter

uiview	subviews
simplest solution i ve found that works consistently is to make your content view a tiny uiview subclass - bearing in mind your content view itself is required by uiscrollview to never change if you enable zooming - apple has some bugs up to at least ios 6 that kick in when you change the content view of an existing scrollview so it s a good idea to keep it trivial and put your custom views inside it as subviews

to prevent alarmmanager from creating notifications while your app is running simply use alarmmanager.cancel pendingintent intent in onresume and recreate your alarms in onpause

superclass	subclassing
does this guarantee that an array of instances of subclassing extends superclass will sort in the same way using arrays.sort arrayofsubinstances

11928656
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
or in other words will subclassing by default inherited the compareto method of its superclass so that one can blindly use arrays.sort knowing they will be sorted as superclass would be

11928668

11928712
equals	compareto
the basic contract of compareto and same goes for equals method are

11928712
superclass	subclassing
ideally i d write a compareto in subclassing as well it may or may not use superclass s compareto

11928712
equals	compareto
implementing compareto or equals in your subclass you will be breaking either symmetry or transitivity

11928712
equals	compareto
it suggests that there is no way to extend a class and override the equals method which has same contract as compareto to it something differently

11928717
folder	directory
created virtual directory for this folder

11928718
superclass	subclassing
yes the behavior would be same as you are not overriding the compareto method but then make sure your subclassing does not alter any attributes in a way that can break break the code in compareto method implements in superclass

11928730
free	malloc
i think implementing my own array using malloc free to make sure targets are not retained would be one solution but all this hassle smells like there is already a solution implemented somewhere

11928749

11928886
folder	directory
tried to make a directory inside the folder svn with name folder_example with the following command

11928916
superclass	subclassing
since your superclass will presumably not know what its subclassing are doing if a subclassing overrides compareto in such a way that it gives an answer different than its superclass it breaks the contract

11928951
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in google-chrome and firefox so what s the theory of the indexof and lastindexof treat undefined differently

11928964
children	parent

11929004
filesystems	fat
filenames in a fat filesystems must also begin with a letter or number and they can t contain spaces

11929004
filesystems	fat
vfat is an extension of the fat filesystems and was introduced with windows 95

11929004
filesystems	fat
this may not sound like a big deal until you consider that the fat filesystems only works in single cluster increments

11929351
hide	show
you can bind on hide and show event of accordion-body to set status for the collapse item

11929369
disk	ram
then use lo_import to read the data from a temporary file that s on disk so you don t have to fit the whole thing in ram at once

11929406
textview	imageview
the answer ended up being to give the textview a weight of 0 and the imageview a weight of 1

11929406
textview	imageview
that way textview showed up perfectly but only took as much space as it needed and the imageview took up the rest of the space

11934845
width	height
the background s width and height are both match_parent

11934866
int	boolean
they have a convention for is...for instance iseven could be a method for an int class to test a boolean

11934923
width	height
there is no method to find out the width and height of the image without loading it so you will have to dynamically load it and to do so you can use

11934969
getter	setter
if all you re doing in your getter and setter is setting a property that is not used elsewhere and there s no other processing then you gain nothing by using a getter and setter so you re better off with your original approach

11934969
getter	setter
finally another major disadvantage of getter and setter is that they are specified in ecmascript 5 and as such are only available in relatively recent browsers

11934992
rss	feed
i want to read out a specific attribute with simple xml from an rss feed

11934996

11934997
ubuntu	centos
i m trying to install yum or apt-get into my system ubuntu centos

11935019
getter	setter
the convention is easy you need to return a boolean can skip the getter and the corresponding setter will take a boolean parameter as well

11935019
getter	setter
would return a boolean but you d still need a getter and setter which deal with different types

11935019
getter	setter
and since that part of the javabeans convention normally only is about getter and setter has.

11935019
accessor	properties
example if a person has a car properties you d expect to have a getcar accessor

11935019
accessor	properties
hascar wouldn t be an accessor since the derived properties hascar would need an accessor named gethascar or ishascar

11935019
accessor	properties
if has was an accessor prefix the properties would have the conflicting name car

express	node.js
i m working with node.js express mongodb and got stuck on this data passing between frontend and backend

11935062
spaces	delimiter
i don t think using spaces as a delimiter is a good option in this case since your fields will almost certainly contain spaces

11935062
spaces	delimiter
as such i believe the spaces as the delimiter is probably what is creating the extra fields not the semi-colon

11935077
spweb	spsite
in your example you are directing the creation of an spsite object with new spsite but you are asking spsite to create an spweb object for you with site.openweb

11935091
ubuntu	linux
i created a amazon ec2 instance with ubuntu linux 64-bit 12.04 lts now when i ssh into it i get the following

for each row in cellforrowatindexpath filtering the enrollments for that grouping and draw the cell

11935172
floating-point	fractions
if you have an ieee-754 floating-point number in a float then the job of converting to or from your 8-bit format is one of rounding the significand the fractions when going to the narrower format and of adjusting the exponent bias plus handling special cases denormals overflow nans

11935172
floating-point	fractions
as an aside note that the proper term for the fractions portion of a floating-point number is â œfractionâ or â œsignificandâ the term used in the ieee-754 standard

you could also store a reference to the old div that is being show so that you could just hide that one and show the other rather then iterating over an entire list of divs

11935554
hide	show
in reality you only need to show one div and hide one div

11935664
int	double
let s compare the result in squeak smalltalk in double precision float converted to exact arithmetic fractions with arbitrary int length at numerator and denominator

11935704

in case you have click event bind in checkbox or radio button

normally jsf is already provided as part of the java ee api by a decent java ee application server such as glassfish jboss websphere weblogic etc

11936087
primefaces	trinidad	primefaces	richfaces	richfaces	trinidad
jsf component libraries like trinidad primefaces richfaces etc are not part of the java ee api and thus surely need to be supplied by the web application project itself

11937466
folder	directory
for backup i have tried rename it sometimes fails createdirectory then copyfiles then delete them time consuming lots of files and directory and have preferred to use move folder where every function is replaced with its un-version like .movefolder_locate_movefile - un.movefolder_locate_movefile

geocoding	geocode
if you have a database the most desirable option is to geocode the addresses as you enter them in the database then use the coordinates from the database to place the markers rather than geocoding them on the fly

11943574

this using wininet is vb6 but should also work in vba excel

11943594
profiling	debugging
i don t know why but for some reason the profiling schema under xcode had release config instead of debugging

11943637

11943786
int	double
you should have written 150.0 208 and 190.0 209 to instruct the compiler to divide them as double s not int

11943812
xdebug	xhprof
as opposed to xhprof profiling with xdebug produces output as the script runs which means even if the script hangs or times out you will be able to dissect the trace generated up to that point

11943817
for-loop	loops
try using a regular for-loop instead or a while loops

11943861
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
thirdly you might want to consider a conventions based mvvm framework such as caliburn.micro which will allow you to use actions instead of wpf commanding which means considerably less boilerplate code binding up verbs on your viewmodel with events on your view as well as other advantages

11943873

powerpc	i386
most sources seem to suggest cmake_system_processor but that s a bad solution because that will always return i386 on os x for example no matter whether you re compiling for i386 x86_64 powerpc or ppc64

11944084
put	get
as per my understanding that if you re trying to get an inside container move outside of its outside container you need to put relative and absolute positioning like this

11944091

packets	multicast
hi guys i have a multicast socket that is receiving packets and is working fine

11944506
getter	setter
you could use getter and setter

hide	show
the reason why hide and show dont work is because those ase jquery functions if you re using mootools and would like to use hide and show you need to write functions like so

11944562
for-loop	loops
you could also replace that while loops with a for-loop since you re just incrementing an index

the simple summary of tskuzzy s answer is use a floating-point buffer to store the pre-bloom image and either convolve into a second floationg-point buffer whence you saturate the pixels back into integer format or saturate on the fly to convert each output pixel back to integer before storing it directly in an integer output buffer

11954188
floating-point	fixed-point
the airy convolution must be done with headroom in either fixed-point or floating-point and these days the former isn t usually worth the hassle with fast fpus so common so that brighter spots in the image will bleed correspondingly more over their neighbouring areas

11954195

note if you do this it s up to you to make sure you use the same values for your get and post forms

11954195
post	get
later when you call has_changed or changed_data on the post form for any field with show_hidden_initial as true django will automatically get the initial values from the hidden input elements in the post data superseding any initial values from initial form or field arguments

i have implemented a generic handler keepalive.ashx in webformapp.com and tried to call from mvcapp.com to keep session alive on webformapp.com but i guess because of cross domain access restriction directly calling webformapp.com keepalive.ashx from mvcapp.com through a simple http get post request isn t hitting the handler

the reason is when in the for-loop you check for -5 it passes the test then you remove it shrinking the arrays and shifting its remaining elements so that the 0 will now be in the place of the -5

11955785

i know the both problems can be solved using suffix-array and suffix-tree with high efficiency but i wonder if there is a method using factor oracle to solve it

11956604
suffix-array	suffix-tree
i am interested in this because the factor oracle is easy to construct with 30 lines of c++ suffix-array needs about 60 and suffix-tree needs 150 and it runs faster than suffix-array and suffix-tree

in the code below i get the pre-dispatched and index action log messages but do not get the post action and as you can expect it also does not redirect me to the homepage when it is complete

11957271
width	margin
the thing about html elements though it that you can t always depend on width alone since there are some things that add to the actual space the elements take up such as margin and border

11957271
width	margin
you can either remove the border padding and margin or tweak the width of the two elements

11957290
uploadify	plupload
it appears to me that your best bet would be to use an uploader such uploadify or plupload that resolve this issue using html5 flash or hacks based on how you set them up

11957315
width	margin
the width property does not take the margin padding or border into consideration

11957315
width	margin
to get around this you either want to set the margin padding and border to 0px reduce the percentage width a tiny amount to compensate or the most complex option wrap the inputs in an invisible div and set the width of that instead

11957318
hash	salt
you store the hash value and the salt if it is per user

11957318
hash	salt
when the user authenticates you take the password they give you prepend the salt and hash that

equals	gethashcode
note if one uses this pattern one should override gethashcode and equals for the deeply-immutable type but not the mutable one

11957330
client-side	server-side
personally i would just write a php script or set up mod_proxy to fetch the file on the server-side to avoid the client-side cross-domain issue altogether

11957377

i doubt it is in two lines should be in one at least in ubuntu so my guess in freebsd same

11957445
put	get
before i put down the query i have so far i just want to say that i can get this information easily through multiple queries so if this is the best practice then disregard improving the query but i was aiming to minimize the number of queries needed to get all needed information

11957446
min	max
each series is shown with a vertical line ranging from the min to the max with a tick mark at the average

11957450
g++	gcc
this avoid a copy from named struct to indexed array and vice-versa and replace it with a generic solution and is thus easier to maintain i have very few places to change when i augment the state vector .it also work well with various compiler i tested several versions of gcc g++ and msvc

11957493

11957512
width	height
where backingwidth and backingheight are the width and height of the black box respectively

11957515
int	chars
but for the sake of explaining some regex your problem is that d+. d+ matches one or more digits followed by any chars followed by one or more digits. if you gave it an int greater than 99 it would work since you re matching

this way it is working for both google-chrome and firefox at my computer

11957648

11957648
websphere	ibm
we ran into a problem with ibm s websphere application server where we had to set the rule for classloaders to parent last at least if my memory doesn t fail me here so that it would use the classpath from the jvm instance first and then use the classloader for websphere because we loaded a log4j.jar that was older than the one ibm started including in a newer version of websphere

11957648
jar	manifest.mf
another option would be to expand the jar update the manifest.mf file to include absolute references to the properties then re-jar the files into a custom version

portrait	landscape
i have an app with several normal activities which can run on either landscape or portrait

11957772
portrait	landscape
on some device such as samsung galaxy tab 7 and galaxy s3 a rotation animation is shown when going from a normal portrait activity to camera landscape activity and back

11957772
portrait	landscape
this is confusing for user because landscape activity simulates being on portrait

11957772
portrait	landscape
onconfigurationchanged is called only when rotating same activity activity a on portrait - activity a on landscape

11957772
portrait	landscape
but it s not called when going from activity a on portrait - activity b on landscape

11957772
portrait	landscape
removed normal transitions portrait- portrait and landscape- landscape but it didn t removed rotation animation portrait- landscape and vice versa

11957772
portrait	landscape
this happens when changing from camera activity locked to landscape to other activity while holding phone on portrait

11957802

11957881
for-loop	arrays

hide	show
in the window s onscroll get the current scroll position as well as the div s position from the top of the page and show hide your element accordingly

11958276
onclick	onkeydown
i would take the onclick and onkeydown out of your html elements.

11958276
keydown	keyup
i used keypress here instead of keydown because keydown will focus the link and then keyup will fire the click event

11958287
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid works only after you have done a setcontentview

11958287
oncreate	findviewbyid
move all the findviewbyid that you have done in field instantiation to oncreate

11958303
preventdefault	keyup
the preventdefault is because the link would trigger when the keyup happens

you can t convert a string directly into an int you need to take one chars at a time and subtract the value of the chars a then add 1

11965403
for-loop	loops
if you need that functionality either use a different type of loops for-loop or maybe do-while-loop or test for number of elements first

11965408
getter	setter
the getter is never hit after the value is modified in the setter

11965449
mouseover	mouseout
in this case if i drag mouse into the area of mouseover it stop auto refresh until i drag mouseout out the area of mouseover

11965453
post	get
but the dbgprint message that you may not be seeing is because post vista the debug messages logged with dbgprint get filtered and not shown in the output

11965469
ant	maven
i have an existing ant and we planned to use new maven to call it

11965469
ant	maven
i have not compared class pathes set by it and those available to maven but my test showed they dont match and ant won t run with some pathes passed to it from maven

11965501
put	get
is there a way to get to the original headers of the request would this be a feature request for cloud foundry or am i lost here as soon as i m put behind a load-balancer on cloud services in general

11965530
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
the adk doesn t want to allow me to add an onclicklistener to the listview and instead insists that adding an onitemclicklistener is the way to go - but obviously this won t work for an empty list

11965539
google-chrome	firefox
the solution was to debug with firefox extensions google-chrome

11965540
tabcontrol	tabitem
i guess i should elaborate a bit on the real case i m working on i have a tabcontrol where the content of each tabitem is developed elsewhere but typically complex

11965594
hash	md5
once you have created your own unique key you will need to get its md5 hash and obtain a maps api key for it like you did for the debug certificate

11965634
mouseover	mouseout
but if you only want to occur the auti refresh only on mouseover and again want to stop the auto refresh on mouseout then you can do as follows

11965698
cos	exp
generally one can get such a function by using combinations of built-in functions like + cos or exp that are vectorized as well

11965734
m2e	pom.xml
because the native library location is cleared presumably by m2e re-configuring the project according to the pom.xml

11965757
width	height
adding to the other answers the most important thing to get this to work is to set the layout width or height to 0px

11965778
getter	setter
if it was up to me i would avoid those magic getter setter either way and just add your own getter setter methods to the class

11965786
crypt	hash
you can use crypt or hash instead

11965796
pull	push
if there are two macs is there a simple way that a mac can be set up as a git server so that both xcode and push and pull from this server

11965875
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
in your java code you can then add an onclicklistener to your emptylist object which returns false if the listview has an item count greater than 0 allowing the click to pass down the view heirarchy and be picked up by your onitemclicklistener

11965929
getter	setter
what i understood from above definition is that creating variables mark them private and generate getter-setter for those variables and use object to access those getter and setter

11965929
hide	show
abstraction is the process of abstraction in java is used to hide certain details and only show the essential features of the object

11965954
min	max
this strictly follows your requirements not to use sort min max but also uses python best practice by not re-inventing the wheel

11965959
fancybox	caroufredsel
i m trying to get caroufredsel and fancybox to work together like they do here

11965959
fancybox	caroufredsel
fancybox works if i remove all caroufredsel code

11966111
google-chrome	firefox
this is not happening in firefox 10 google-chrome or ie for example

11966131
hide	show
after that i can in java code hide show some buttons in tray by id or select some of them with another color .

11966138
width	height
i ve experienced that when you don t limit your height or width of your layout padding tends to give better results sometimes

11966162
width	height
then when found the page width and height via some dynamic computation from database i will override it by using

11966172
oncreate	setcontentview
the workaround of calling settitle in oncreate before setcontentview should do the trick though

11966192
for-loop	loops
another difference regards breaking out of loops with break or return in the for-loop

11966222
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller segued to from a uitableviewcontroller which is itself embedded in a uinavigationcontroller

11966248
stdout	stderr
in process a i have the following code fragment after process.waitfor where outt and errt are the threads to read process b s stdout and stderr respectively

11966248
stdout	stderr
anyway in the run method of the outt errt threads i have the following where the pipe variable is a writer instance i am capturing stdout stderr of the sub-process to

11966248
stdout	stderr
the in variable is the stdout or stderr stream obtained from process

11966251
httpconnection	downloading
just use httpconnection class and stream classes to upload downloading files to and from the server

11966284
crypt	hash
will this function be safe for password and email hash crypt

11966284
hash	salt	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
it s a pbkdf2 password hash function with a random salt generator

11966301
implements	extends
or am i not extends implements in the right way

11966329
folder	directory
that is when i install tortoisesvn manually myself i do not see the file and cannot find the directory httpd under the installation folder of svn

11966334
slider	galleriffic
everything works fine if the galleriffic slider show is in an iframe inside of the div facybox uses but it breaks if i try and initialize the galleriffic inside of the page that contains the div that facybox uses

11966345
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome everything works fine but in ie when the form is submitted the httpget action is being fired rather than the httppost

11966404
children	parent
how my xml node structure works is i have multiple children elements of parent that also occur multiple times

11966404
children	parent
i am able to get to the children elements but only the first one of each parent

11966404
children	parent
when i echo count i m able to get a total count of the children elements for each reoccurring parent but i can t seem to work with that data

11966437
superclass	subclassing
another option is subclassing nsarraycontroller and over-riding the superclass methods like add to write your code for opening your slide sheet maybe before calling the superclass method

11966445
listview	gridview
i want to create a datatemplate in code behind for my treeview with a listview which has a gridview which columns count depends on my data

11966486
pop-up	dialog
when the select object dialog pop-up search textblock and add it

11966493
public	protected
it can however access public and protected members of b and a

11966514
put	get
but when i put the swf in iframe i get an error like

11966538
super	abstract
to avoid instanceof i m not sure what would be best but you could chain an extra method specific to an entity class which then calls the super abstract class if necessary

11966559
daemons	systemd
on a freebsd systemd in the top output below the mysql daemons is in state sbwait

11966570
post	get
i wasn t using kendo.aspnetmvc.js which made kendo ui use get instead of post

11966671
accessor	properties
to my surprise the set accessor gets invoked every time i select an object of type vessel in the linq code with value as null of the properties

11966682
post	get
then in the click event handler you get the data you want and post to the service manually

11966682
post	get
you have to build the post request manually and get the response from the remote service

11966683
getter	setter
if it should be available from other classes you should implement getter and setter

11966712
integer	unsigned
let transform be a function that takes an m-bit unsigned integer x and an index i as arguments

11966722
debian	linux
i am running node.js on my linux debian server and am having problems running a .sh script trying to install rpm

11966735
x86	64bit
in c c++ code local variables are allocated on the stack and the space used there is different between 32bit and 64bit mode due to the point below and due to the different rules for passing arguments 32bit x86 usually on the stack 64bit x86 in part in registers

11966735
int	double
currently two main branches of 64bit environments exist il32p64 what win64 uses - int and long are int32_t only uintptr_t is uint64_t talking in terms of the sized int from and lp64 what un x uses - int is int32_t long is int64_t and uintptr_t is uint64_t but there s the subdivisions of different alignment rules as well - some environments assume long float or double align at their respective sizes while others assume they align at multiples of four bytes

11966735
int	chars
the examples just given are only about language primitives chars int long etc. but of course affect all sorts of platform-dependent runtime library data types whether size_t off_t time_t handle essentially any nontrivial struct union class .

11966759
for-loop	loops
then make a for-loop to loops through the numbers 0 to 100 and test each number with that function

11966763
getter	setter
we always say that data will be encapsulated if we simply define variables private and define getter setter to access those variables

11966763
getter	setter
my question is if we can access the variables data though via getter and setter how come data is hidden or safe

11966783
width	height
you may set height and width of the element before you call galleria.run #galleria

11966789
getter	setter
my question is if we can access the variables data though via getter and setter how come data is hidden or safe

11966789
getter	setter
you can encapsulate the logic under getter setter for example

11966821
getter	setter
the data is safe because you can do additional logic in your getter setter and its not possible to change the values of your variable

11966841
getter	setter
the only way to do it would be with encapsulation or simpler put give getter and setter to that field thus you always know and can check react to fields updates for example

11966887
getter	setter
the way i understand your question is although we declare variables as private as those variables can be accessed using getter and setter the are not private

11966887
getter	setter
well when using getter and setter you can restrict access to the private variables

11966914
uilabel	uitextview
inside of these 3 different views i have a bunch of stuff uilabel uitextview etc

11967033
mouseleave	mouseenter
all you have to do is define on mouseenter and mouseleave for each maindiv

11967043
post	get
the reason why the viewstate per default is serialized and sent to the client is i guess that it s the easiest way to get it back when the client performs a post back

11967075
width	height
i need to get each image with its corresponding width and height properties if they exist

11967089
getter	setter
i have solved this by adding into basearticle and using getter setter to effectively hide this property in my basearticle entity and lifecycle callbacks to handle nullable

11967100
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
with jquery i alerted the div height in firefox google-chrome and opera the div height has 164px but on ie 7 it has 172

11967106
webkit	gecko
it works fine in webkit and gecko but not opera

11967118
implements	extends
how can i declare an arraylist of objects that extends gameobject and implements activable

11967149
google-chrome	firefox
should make ie google-chrome and firefox react more consistantly

11967152
textview	imageview
you can try using textview rather than imageview or imagebutton and then assign background for the text view as the image you want and set the text you want for textview and make it wrap_content for layout_width

11967166
wordpress	joomla
drupal and joomla are a lot harder to grasp then wordpress from my understanding

11967182
getter	setter
in general encapsulation of fields by getter and setter leaves more flexibility for changes

11967182
getter	setter
data is neither hidden nor safe by using getter and setter

11967191
email-ext	jenkins
i want to edit email body in pre-send script in email-ext jenkins plugin

11967192
post	get
when i view my facebook fanpage app by web browser i can get the signed_request parameter in my post method

11967388
freeglut	glew
i have also installed the packages like freeglut mesa-utils glew and so on

11967447
inherited	properties
the opacity is then inherited by the child and cannot be overridden with it s own properties

11967472
int	chars
agetxt.gettext returns a string object containing the chars typed by the user and you try to put it in a int var which can only contain int

11967472
put	get
just put it in a string object then parse it to get the integer value by doing integer.parseint mystringobject

11967514
min	max
see how min max handles nan -

11967518
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am having this issue only in ie 9 otherwise i have no problem in other browser such as firefox safari google-chrome etc

11967553
awt	swing
please bear in mind that in awt and swing components there are many methods paint paintborder paintchildren paintcomponent repaint and others that are called via call-back whenever the gui engine finds suitable

11967560
icq	xmpp
also you can use so called transports to use xmpp to transparently send reviece messages from other protocols like icq msn aol etc which may be what you need if you really need icq

11967605
folder	directory
i need to keep a certain svn folder inside a mounted boxcryptor directory that is located inside a dropbox folder

11967605
folder	directory
i only want to keep the working directory there without the .svn folder

11967619
awt	swing
the article painting in awt and swing additional paint properties opacity suggests why the opaque property allows swing s paint system to detect whether a repaint request on a particular component will require the additional repainting of underlying ancestors or not. because you extend jcomponent the opaque property is false by default and optimization is not possible

11967640
gitolite	gitosis
note gitolite can also be linked with an httpd server see why do you need gitosis or gitolite

11967692
int	chars
so the condition is true for any minus sign followed by any int or chars

11967730
versioning	upgrade
i have happily used various versioning of xcode for a while and recently upgrade to xcode 4.4.1 and ml

11967741
width	height
you may want to play around with the width height to better meet your requirements though

11967741
width	height
another idea would be to create some kind of paint manager or paintable interface that given a graphics content could paint it self obviously you d like to know some more info like width height

11967746
google-chrome	firefox
the graphs work perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

11967837
google-chrome	firefox
this has allowed me to completely move from firefox firebug to google-chrome

i am using the highcharts js library and in particular the highstock timeseries chart like this one

11967979
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie 8 firefox and google-chrome

11967982
for-loop	loops
i am trying to paginate the results using limit keyword for 30 records in select statement after check the number of pages i have used 2 loops for-loop for header and while loops for result rows and limiting using limit

11967994
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
edit if you are asking this because you want to output a time in readable form don t use nsdatecomponents -- use nsdateformatter

11968033
post	get
when i send a post request to a server if the response is 200 i get the json body

11968043
many-to-many	one-to-many
i m afraid i can t help you with the many-to-many relationship as i m trying to solve the same problem at the moment but as far as one-to-many for existing instances goes you can add a foreign key as an optional parameter in the hasmany hasone and belongsto functions it defaults to classname _id

11968048
punctuation	words
similar situation but trying to match a words after a punctuation

11968130
backgrounding	multitasking
the app can also be put into backgrounding using the multitasking switcher or the multitasking gestures on ipad

the progress bar will show annotating... and the left hand side of the file where the annotations should show up says computing... these will be stuck until i do hide annotations or i manually cancel the task

11968140
user-controls	tabcontrol
im writing a wpf application where usercontrols are added to a tabcontrol at runtime - creating a tab for each user-controls

11968140
width	height
the problem then is...these controls can have different width and height which means the tabcontrol must adjust its own width and height accordingly

11968151
vim	emacs
in vim or emacs it can be done by repeat input feature

11968165
range	minimum
ideally i would like to be able to set a minimum height and a maximum height and then have the slick grid auto-size itself within that range based on the number of rows

11968167
min	max	width	height
like islands schould be rounded but variate in shape and scale min max width height

11968170
postgresql	mysql
providers like mysql postgresql etc

11968189
post	get
you will not get an answer to such question in one stackoverflow post

11968219
dictionary	map
you could try a more functional approach by turning number_of_lists into a sequence of keys using range and select out of the dictionary with map

11968281
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have an ajax call that is working fine on google-chrome firefox and safari but always fail on ie success but no data

11968281
post	get
charset utf-8 ie does get the response but the problem is that _post array is empty since sending post should be contenttype application x-www-form-urlencoded

11968285
scons	qmake
usually it would be done by build system make qmake cmake waf scons ant etc

11968337
fflush	gets
you should use and no comma at the end if you want to output something to the response otherwise you are only executing server side code that never gets fflush to the response

11968343
google-chrome	firefox
all of this seems to work without a hitch in google-chrome so just for firefox i added

11968357
getter	setter
using setter and getter which is your case here is a way to hide the structure so it s fine

11968388
getter	setter
instead of synthesize-ing the data array of the table view provide a custom getter and setter that calls the table view automagically

11968401
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for me it s a problem on safari and google-chrome the webkit browsers but not on ie7 8 9 nor on firefox which all work fine

11968417
implements	extends
due to the way the filter is implements extends the default handleerrorattributes we can remove then handleerrorattribute from the global filters

11968475
xrange	enumerate
beside enumerate you can also try range use xrange if you re on python 2.x

11968480

inherited	properties
the content must be some inherited class from the uiview and it has a frame.size.width and frame.size.height properties

11968624
maven	pom.xml
i guess it works fine in eclipse because servlet api is included in the classpath in project properties especially if you use dynamic web project but for maven build you need to declare it in pom.xml

11968631
rss	feed
i have some rss feed in xml which i am receiving in my android app

11968640
folder	directory
i should point out that for other directory other than hafs mkdirs normally creates the folder

innodb	myisam
i want to create a myisam like behavior for an innodb mysql table

11968977
peer	p2p
i m developing a java based p2p application where the peer are communicating with each using a library called ice4j and it s custom socket called psuedotcpsocket

11968993
icmp	tcp
the only problem i can think of is that the ping command uses the icmp protocol as default while net ping uses tcp

11969005
multiplying	add
note that you may have to add a scale factor to multiplying with in order to make the physics realistic to your screen - like how many pixels equals five meter or something like that

11969006
yaws	inets
the logic behind api calls could be implemented in erlang and served directly from a web server inets or yaws or it can be implemented using a web framework like nitrogen or chicago boss

11969030
button	checkbox
this form has different section headings pizza pasta salad...etc different radio button like options meat pizza cheese pizza...etc and some condition options for example you might only see options for pizza toppings if you have selected the pizza checkbox

11969030
button	checkbox
my app will be similar to that with a form with many checkbox radio button drop downs...etc

11969033
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and debian that d be apt for example

11969034
for-loop	arrays
now the for-loop is done and you got your user inputs conveniently in the 0-indexed list elements which you access like a tuple arrays

11969119
google-chrome	firefox
i found that i needed inline-block for firefox and google-chrome i didn t need this for ie

11969153
hash	md5
session authentication cookie by generating an md5 hash of the session

11969175
folder	directory
the setup that i can t change or workaround for various reasons is that i have a project containing a main js file within a child directory which in turn should be able to just require module with module being a file inside of another directory off in another specific directory within the project folder

11969206
inherited	subclassing
that is mainwindow is a subclassing of or inherited window

11969231

if your pseudotcpsocket extends java.net.socket and doesn t break its api you should be able to upgrade it to an sslsocket using sslsocketfactory.createsocket socket s string host int port boolean autoclose

11969257
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this is accepted in ie firefox opera safari

11969275
dlsym	dlopen
i can achieve this with dlopen dlsym calls but i have to manually load each symbol and add wrappers for them like this

11969296
hide	show
i think the best practice is not to hide them but to grey them out or show in another visual way that a certain action exists but cannot be performed

11969349
width	height
the last two parameters of createbitmap specifies the width and height

11969352
put	get
it has a read method that copies chunks of data all at once and functions like get and put for single bytes

11969376
hide	show
what i want is to show the hidden using hide -method anchor if the mouse enters the dl or perhaps the td

11969422
folder	directory
one option is to have your local albums directory mapped to a different folder accessible to the web server like sylon says

11969437
multiplying	transpose
you get vectordir by multiplying the column vector by either m or its transpose

11969437
multiplying	transpose
you get vectorup by multiplying the column vector by either m or its transpose

11969448
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
anchors are by definition inline elements and do not accept width height margin etc until they are defined as block level or inline-block elements

11969489
hide	show
i added an absolutely positioned loading gif of my own to the page show it just before calling fancybox and i can capture the iframe loaded event with jquery to hide the spinner like so

11969489
hide	show
i ve also noticed while playing in the fancybox v2.0.6 source that it looks like fancybox uses the load event to show hide the loading animation if autosize is used with an iframe though i haven t tested the theory

11969491
tabcontrol	tabitem
when you add a new control to the tabcontrol is it a tabcontrol or a tabitem

11969491

11975464

multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
i m thinking that an m by n matrix only needs m + n units and not the full m n units because unless the units are distributed in a sensible way into rows and columns then the only sensible operation remaining is to add subtract the fully general matrix with another of the exact same shape or multiplying it by a scalar

width	height
in the right td cell there is an iframe with a width of 100 and a height of 100

11976356
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this is where the problem is it fills the full width but refuses to be any taller or shorter than the default 150px this is consistent across ie firefox and opera but not google-chrome google-chrome properly stretches the iframe vertically 100

11976364

however this breaks the 4 6 8 ratio recommended by the android developer guide to be maintained between the mdpi hdpi xhdpi

post	get
the left sub tree can be found in both list but is easier i think to get from post order cause its in the front

11976700
post	get
i have a good understanding how to get the information needed form pre and post order list to build in order so i think i solved the logic part but need help turning my thought into java code can any one help

11976708

doesn t matter what i put in the return the system still get the key input

11976763
min	max
where min and max are passed in date values

11976798
getter	setter
readwrite property with non-default getter and setter

11976798
getter	setter
or to put it another way if you re using encapsulation well and filling up those setter and getter you cannot use this

11976813
post	get
to get it back out and pass it along to another page you can handle the click and post the data to another page

11976820
put	get
i can put a return call after the response.redirect to prevent further processing in that function but the btnsubmit_click function will still get run

11976871
for-loop	arrays
for some reason the for-loop doesn t execute when an id from the listof_id arrays is entered

11976891
width	height
i have the thumbnail image scaled to 100 width and height auto so they all fit nicely in their parent container scaled to thumbnail size

11976902
post	put
the mime type may be already a standard for the server which means that you donâ t even have to put it anywhere in your code because it assumes that you will be sending a json string and it will receive it once you do post

11976902
post	get
for example the access_token is located in the url string as a get and json string is located in a post

11976907
width	height
i ve also noticed that the properties for width and height which are shown in the documenation examples don t work

11976912
put	get
it may work better if you put the states on the img but i can t get rid of the outline

11976913
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie 8 9 are doing fine

11976957
free	malloc
given that most operating systems have built-in memory allocation functions that return at a granularity higher than 1 byte the implementation of malloc probably uses the first bit of the allocation size to track whether the allocation has been free or not

11976984
accessor	properties
it seems that you either have memory management issues or misunderstand objective-c s properties accessor syntax.o operationent keeps becoming an nsstring which doesn t respond to that particular properties getter message hence the crash

11977022
maven	m2e
in eclipse use a new version that has the m2e integration installed and import the project as a maven project

folder	directory
everywhere i look i am being told to add a raw folder in the res directory working in eclipse

11977141
rss	feed
when the script empties the wordpress database rss feed stop working

11977249
free	malloc
for dynamic allocation you can only free or delete memory that was allocated with malloc or new

11977250
super	implements
make sure to call super method for every method since kkappdelegate implements basic behavior and relies on receiving some of the uiapplicationdelegate methods

11977280
int	chars
what i don t understand is how and why enter last name was executed twice why the chars getname function was executed before int main and how the two functions interact with each other

11977297
int	boolean
while the assignment part would compile the type of the expression in your first example would be int which isn t implicitly convertible to the relevant boolean type in either language leading to a compile-time error

11977306
redmine	gitorious
basicly i symlinked the apps gitorious repositories directory from the bitnamy gitorious-stack to apps redmine repositories

11977530
int	chars
the problem is that the pointers are of type chars int and short

11977551
portrait	landscape
but the real problem is there for example i want in the phone version in portrait mode to display only one image in a row and in landscape mode two images like the youtube app

11977551
portrait	landscape
and to be deduced from this in the tablet version like two images in portrait and 4 in landscape

11977554
for-loop	arrays
you re getting that error because you re splicing your arrays while in a for-loop

11977565
folder	directory
then grab the spool file from the windows printspool directory which location that is you can find out by looking at the right-click properties... dialog of the printers and faxes folder

11977575
for-loop	loops
this code is not looping it will perform the first loops then it get caught in the last section with grougquery query and doesn t loops through the whole for-loop so when it gets to a exception line it throws an exception

11977609
move	drag
drag on the photo should move it around drag on the gallery should change photos

move	drag
if you re not clean in your drag from left to right you re not able to scroll the photo move a bit shows the adjacent photo and bounces back

11977615
post	get
a slightly less obvious example is that exemplified by uimenucontroller â a pop-up view that post a user-input event that may need to traverse several view controllers to get to the one that should act on it

11977615
children	parent
quite often you re going to have one parent view controller with the logic to do a bunch of things and children that want to pass messages up to whomever knows how to handle them without hard coding the hierarchy

11977653
portrait	landscape
so you could create portrait landscape variations of your layout as well as small medium large xlarge variations for different screen sizes

width	height
this works fine but i d like to be able to work without the constraint of having to guess the height and width of the iframe for the content that it holds

11977886
int	chars
the overhead of adding an extra column is really large because selecting about 50 int has the same effect of selecting a single 1300 chars field

11977916
portrait	landscape
but if the phone is on landscape or portrait mode or even on different screen sizes this can lead to errors

11977937
width	height
minimizes it so that it does not fit the whole screen at least in width - height is perfect

11977971

post	get
if i don t serialize my data before post using jquery i get an error invalid json primitive at the server end on the line

11978103
ant	maven
so from programming side it is a little clumsy that we cannot build the whole project on maven under eclipse by one click but have to let sts eclipse to build the project first and then run ant script to enhance the entities then refresh the project then refresh the server deployment

11978103
maven	pom.xml
so the question becomes is there any way or tools we can integrate everything build compile with enhancement together possibly on maven by only designing pom.xml

11978107
folder	directory
in your views folder you would have a directory called general and a file called _simple_message.html.erb

11978122
put	get
after that put the mouse over and you ll get the trace to the place that modifies the node

11978128
for-loop	loops
so now you could loops through result with a for-loop like this

11978134
versioning	upgrade
i realise this annoying thing too since latest m2e-android plugin upgrade versioning 0.4.2 it happens in both new project creation and existing project import if you don t use src test java

11978134
folder	directory
it looks like m2e-android or perhaps m2e now always trying to add src test java as a source folder regardless of whether it is actually existed in your project directory in the .classpath file

11978134
folder	directory
there are several ways to fix it the easiest is manually create src test java directory in the file system then refresh your project by press f5 and run maven - update project right click project choose maven - update project... this should fix the missing required source folder src test java error

the idea is that this class will create an array of sprite children compute and assign x y width and height properties to them and then addchild them in rows how many rows and children being specified in the arguments

11979249
width	height
my problem is - the act of adding the children seems to be throwing out the height and width values of the invzone instance

11979249
width	height
height is not the only value affected - the containing width can be blown out with different variables

11979308
children	parent
now root knows all it s children via the children attribute and the children know their parent via the parent attribute

11979308
children	parent
of course you could make things a little more interesting by giving node objects a children attribute as well -- then node s can parent more node s

11979308
children	parent
if you want to avoid that you could use weakref.ref s to store the references to the children parent but i ll defer that to another question if necessary

division	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
mathematical operations such as addition subtraction negation multiplication division and the mathematical functions defined later in this clause should always be understood as computing exact mathematical results on mathematical real numbers which do not include infinities and do not include a negative zero that is distinguished from positive zero

11998365
post	get
it s my understanding that the methods only support http post so perhaps visual studio is performing a get and the service is rejecting it

11998384
int	double
i have a list where i put multiple double int etc

11998384
subtract	add
and with this implementation we would need a method for each arithmetic operation add subtract etc.

11998384
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add	int	double
edit - enhance question if we think on the java.lang.number from a abstraction perspective we would think that any number can be part of arithmetic operations but yet again it doesn t seem to exist a simple way to add subtract multiplying etc x to a list of number independently of their type int double short...

11998398

post	get
i found a post by brad wilson outlining how to make a batch handler using a message hanlder but i wasn t able to get this working

11998564

11999012

provided you re developing for a version of android with the usb host api which it sounds like you are you ought to be able to write some code to temporarily grab the keyboard s interface from the kernel send the appropriate data to set caps lock and then release the interface so that the hid driver will pick it up

11999019
gridview	rowdatabound
this is usually done in the rowcreated method of the gridview or at least i do it this way as fas as i know on the rowdatabound you only have the data for the row but it doesn t exist on the page yet to find a control in a row use

11999063
for-loop	arrays
if you strip all these out and just call lapack in your for-loop since you already know the dimensions of your matrix and maybe know that it s real not complex things run much faster note that i ve made my arrays larger

11999120
profiling	benchmarking
first caveat - make sure you have done appropriate profiling or benchmarking before embarking on any optimisation work

11999123
width	height
you can explicitly set width height to image if you know the dimensions for advance

11999123
width	height
this is because jquery load event occurs before all images downloaded and for does not have any width height set to it browser does not know its height so it assumes 0px

11999148
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie9 and earlier fails

11999207
pop-up	dialog
another dialog should pop-up select target tab select launch on all compatible devics avd s

of course setting the height of a canvas element in css is not the same as setting the height and width as html attributes of each canvas tag

11999435
superclass	subclassing
you must provide a default constructor in your subclassing when in it you need to define a default constructor that will not call a non default constructor in the superclass

11999435
superclass	subclassing
in the example above the subclassing construtor will call super the default constructor of the subclassing so you must provide a defualt construtor in the superclass or write your subclassing this way

11999482
gridview	onclientclick	gridview	rowdatabound	rowdatabound	onclientclick
you could use gridview s rowcreated or rowdatabound events or even on the buttons onclientclick event if that button is on the same row of the gridview just get the sender etc based on your logic

11999500

11999531
punctuation	words
tokenise the address into individual words thus ignoring weird punctuation etc. and re-join the string

11999559
width	height
the main parameters needs to be at least flexible in height preferably flexible in width too but not required

11999635
for-loop	loops
the only 1 line after the if statement is consider in the for-loop when loops end the world print

11999663
factors	mean
by good way i mean speed mostly but of course elegance and good architecture are factors too

11999725
stdout	stderr
its standard io stdin stdout stderr operations will be

11999750
post	put
simply put the post s argument is that types have meaning and there is not room in the meaning of int for something like numcapabilities which is execution-context-dependent

11999762
width	height
the problem is that the page title is set to an image of width x height

11999855
junit	testng
simpler approach could have been been junit and testng supporting assert counter which can print not just the number of tests but also asserts used in the test methods

11999859
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie and firefox and should work in google-chrome

11999864
x86	64bit

width	height
if i do not use thumb.php and mention the width and height attribute directly in the image tag the quality is good but while using thumb.php the image looks a little blur

12000050
getter	setter
the compiler finds the getter and setter methods assigned to someproperty and turns your code into

12000050
getter	setter
its getter returned a constant value and its setter didn t store its value anywhere

12000050
getter	setter
it s pretty much the same as a public field named someproperty except that you could add logic to that getter and setter at a later date without making consumers of your class recompile

12000050
getter	setter
however much like the way automatic properties are only a shortcut for writing the backing field and getter and setter by hand you can explicitly declare your delegate and add and remove methods as well

12000051

12000277
profiling	debugging
you can simulate a profiling by debugging your code and breaking and see where the program is

12000284
integer	unsigned
the thing is that if in an expression there are signed and unsigned operands as per the c standard the signed operand will be promoted to unsigned integer

12000284
integer	unsigned
what happens then is if you subtract 2 from 0 that results in -2 but since it s treated as an unsigned integer when comparing the values it s overflowing and ends up being some large number

12000322
children	parent
yes you can create an anonymous shared mapping in a parent process fork and have the child process inherit the mapping sharing the memory with the parent and any other children

12000349
portrait	landscape
you can create two xml layouts here one for landscape and other for portrait

12000404

12000694
gridview	radiobuttonlist
i ve tried using the radiobuttonlist to let the user choose if he she wants to export either the current page of the gridview or the whole gridview to an excel sheet but only the current page one s working where as for exporting the whole gridview to an excel sheet it only shows the header rows

if i put a single swear word on the first line of staging.rb or production.rb i get the same error

12001107
coalesce	isnull
so i wonder if sql s coalesce or isnull would do the same job faster

12001120
width	height
you could of course just use the width and height tags of the image to make them appear smaller - but this really is not the way to go

12001150
keydown	keyup
i would use keyup since it is fired after the textbox s value has been updated in contrast to keydown that is fired before the textbox s value is updated and also directly after the key is up in contrast to the .change event which only fires when the input loses focus

12001194
subtraction	addition

select 2 rows one with minimum second with maximum avg profit when grouping by range

12001792
post	get
what you can instead do is send an http get or post request to the jsp and use it to update the variable

12007422
integer	radix
as an alternative you can think of this as an integer â œ1â then 23 bits with no inserted radix point making a 24-bit binary numeral but the exponent is adjusted by an extra 23 so subtract 150 instead of 127

12007422
rational-numbers	floating-point
an important property of floating-point numbers is that they cannot represent all real numbers even in a finite range of course or even all rational-numbers

what confuses concerns me is simply why crypt given password admin generates a different hash even using a static salt

12007443
crypt	salt

pop-up	dialog
you could also make the form a dialog pop-up

12007631
min	max
i tried to fix it using the max and min of graph scale but so far i am unsuccessful

but sometimes we do not have the option to do this because we need to copy between 2 completely separate accounts which requires a get and then a put

12008561
put	get
the response stream returned from the get is not seekable so it cannot be passed to the put request and have it stream seamlessly from one to the other

12009156

the first is a get the second is a post - did u use dev tools in browser and check the net tab for server 500 errors

12017798
post	get
you are using two different requests to two different urls and comparing them as if the same the first is get to json resume.json and the second is post to json download.php

12017851
width	height
even height 2048 and width 4096 also supported

12018037
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works on firefox safari and google-chrome perfectly but doesn t work on ie6 ie7

12018047

super and extends pretty much exactly capture the meaning

12018062
post	get
i am trying to get a data sorted from 2 tables post and postmeta

12018107
width	height
you could always check the window size either height or width whatever floats your boat and add something to the image filenames to load high res images like having img4.jpg as a normal image and img4_big.jpg as a high res image etc

12018144
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i had the same problem today and it turned out that in apache configuration in httpd.conf the allowoverride was set to none and therefore the .htaccess could not be read

12018146
google-chrome	firefox
the only way i could achieve this is by using a auto-reload addon on firefox or google-chrome

12018147
children	parent
the layour_gravity is used to place the children relative within its parent bounds the relativelayout doesn t have this attribute

12018147
children	parent
which tells them to position aligning the top of the children with the top of the parent relativelayout

12018187
post	get
how to get the values of each and post it to a php file

12018210
int	chars
the fact that the small int that fit in a chars are often interpreted as codepoints in a particular chars encoding space is secondary

12018212
children	parent
i have a problem that whenever i load a parent entity user in my case and put it to cache all it s children in an owned relationship are cached as well

12018212
persistent	transient
i came across transient modifier and was happy for a while until i realized that not only it stops certain fields from getting cached it also prevents those fields from getting persistent

12018342
onkeyup	onkeydown
this is the onkeyup handler or onkeydown depending on your intended ux - probably the former

12018351
background-image	background-size
if you don t want to do it with an img tag then you can use a background-image on a pseudo-element and set the background-size to 100 100 like in this demo

12018376
x86	64bit
in addition could you try running your program under the 32bit debugger instead of the 64bit one and use the 32bit sosex plugin of course...and compile as x86 ...and seeing if you get the same result or not

12018392
google-chrome	firefox
check it in google-chrome and firefox so i can exclude a browser bug

12018400
pop-up	dialog
the complexity here is that i don t want a small default android dialog but more of a pop-up fragment with some detailed layout and functionality

12018426
post	put
all is going well so far but i can t find a way to post put patch a datetime field to now as in sql to use server s current time instead of the client one

12018447

google-chrome	safari
my problem is on webkit browsers safari 5.1.4 and google-chrome 21 where my asolutely positioned text works some of the time

12018535
width	height
i have gotten the sps in nalu avc decoder configuration record and trying to parse the video width height from it

12018549

ie doesn t support anything but the ico format and your favicon is a png

12018558
mouseover	mouseout
try to use hover to implement mouseover and mouseout like

12018652
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my app currently has a uinavigationcontroller and i d like to push a uitabbarcontroller at some point when a button is clicked

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
what i did was create a uiviewcontroller and its nib file dragged a uitabbarcontroller

12018652
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
how can i tell the uiviewcontroller to load a uitabbarcontroller instead of its own view

12018653
many-to-many	one-to-many
there s a one-to-many relationship between store and product and a many-to-many between product and category

12018656
public	protected
i did a experiment where i extended a java.lang package class and couldn t access the package methods or field methods or fields with no public or protected

12018665
daemons	systemd
if the asynctask is marked as a daemons thread when all the external references to the object are deleted the systemd should stop the thread

12018713
width	margin
but we are forcing it to move in the left side by giving a margin of -24 which is the width of image

12018713
width	margin
and now if we want to align the image to left then we can reduce the left margin to the width of the text box to make it look like in left

12018715
jvisualvm	jprofiler
there are lots of ways to get a heap dump starting with simple tools like jmap to more fancy stuff like jvisualvm or even commerical tools as jprofiler

12018758
hide	show
as for your second question the simplest thing to do to get a momentary showing window to print some data to screen is to use a texbox or a textareal or anything else that allows to show text... and play with the setvisible true setvisible false to show hide the widget

12018760
treemap	treeset
treeset and treemap are both based on redblack

12018760
treemap	treeset
redblack is not documented very well but if you look at the source of treeset and treemap it s pretty easy to figure out how to use it though it doesn t fill all most

12018799
mongohq	mongolab
i currently want to test out heroku mongoid mongolab mongohq

12018799

contents of each page into the dom as you navigate and the dom ready

12018939
subtract	add
in short assume the full area is in the rectangle subtract off the four segments in the external half planes then add any the areas in the four external quadrants discarding trivial cases along the way

12018960
inherited	properties
however if an object doesn t have a hasownproperty method it s probably just as suitable to use the in operator as the object likely doesn t have an inherited scheme and all properties are on the object that s just an assumption though the in operator is a common and seemingly successful way of testing for dom object support for properties

12018965
leaflet	proj
i m using leaflet for a proj and i d like to bind events on my markers with jquery on

12018974
dictionary	map
instead of hash map it is possible to use some binary search tree or any dictionary data structure

12018974
skip-lists	trie
other alternative to using trie in this data structure is indexable skip-lists

12018980
getter	setter
also notice how item is private and that there is now a getter and setter method to access it

12018980
getter	setter
my post grew so long that i lost track of why i wanted to introduce getter and setter

12018980
getter	setter
now the item field has effectively been overridden since all access to it is done through the getter and setter and those have been overridden to point at the new field

12019015
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome 21 firefox 14 internet explorer 9

12019042

hi i am trying to create a new post type and while registering the taxonomyes i noticed that i get a tag panel instead of the category panel.here is my code

12019137
clang	llvm
the reason google suggests using -all_load is that they are using categories in their code and objective-c libraries with categories are not properly loaded by the llvm linker well that was the case in 4.3 xcode not sure about 4.4 with the newer clang

12019139
width	height
this allows you inside your css - to detect layout trigger javascript events when layout changes and position your css elements based on width height of the screen

12019156
width	height
for html tables specify the width and height using html attributes rather than css styles

12019156
width	height
modern versions of outlook ignore width and height styles

12019165
put	get
i ask because the datastore docs say the get and subsequent possible put operations are wrapped in a transaction to ensure atomicity

12019173
int	double
thus a convolution between two sets of base 1000000 migits that are 10000 migits in length 60000 decimal digits will overflow the point where a double cannot represent an int exactly

12019187
put	get
ok so i have a website and i m making a python script to insert data into the website via sending it to a php script as a get request but whenever i put a script with not alphabetic or numeric characters e.x.

i m guessing extends or implements the xmpp class is what i need to do

12019337
getter	setter
ebean does not require any public constructors getter setter

12019358
xts	performanceanalytics
also rollapply.xts is now registered in the xts package instead of performanceanalytics so you will get the same results regardless of whether or not performanceanalytics is loaded

12019368
firefox	safari
the itms link will also work from desktop safari but won t work from ie or firefox etc

12019385
width	height
for html tables specify the width and height using html attributes rather than css styles

12019385
width	height
modern versions of outlook ignore width and height styles

the clients and the server do not necessarily sit in the same lan intranet but the client can access the servers from the extranet

12019397

also if possible i would like to use cas shibboleth and other open-source components where possible

12019407
curb	libcurl
curb probably curl-ruby or something provides ruby-language bindings for the libcurl 3 a

12019459
multiplying	subtract
multiplying by two and subtract one does that

12019536
accessor	properties
properties accessor are actually methods equivalent to those

12019552
postgresql	mysql
this would be much easier in a database that supported analytic windows functions and the with statement which is just about every database apart from mysql oracle postgresql db2 sql server for example

12019555
int	chars
implement your own irq1 int 9 isr to receive keyboard input and manually store the scan codes and chars in the bios data area and update the states of the alt control and shift keys in the bios data area

12019567
inherited	properties
by default child scopes prototypically inherited from the parent scope see scope so you already have access to the parent controller s scope properties in the child

12019582
width	height
the canvas element has two attributes to control the size of the coordinate space width and height

12019582
width	height
the width attribute defaults to 300 and the height attribute defaults to 150

12019647
hide	show
if you only want to just show hide jquery s wonderful .slidetoggle method might be of help

12019661
jobs	cron
i need to add a couple cron jobs that will use my django models

12019667
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
a slightly more sophisticated approach with add subtract multiplying divide

12019725
google-chrome	firefox
i spent a good amount of time making a website look good working with google-chrome and firefox however as is often the case when i look at it in internet explorer it looks worse than it did at the start

12019730
children	parent
these two trees become the children of the parent node

12019733
skip-lists	tree
there are other balanced tree such as b+ tree and other data structures not tree such as skip-lists

12019771
ibatis	mybatis
is there any configuration changes or mybatis supports ibatis configuration as deprecated commands

12019808
nswindow	nsstatusitem
i wanted it a little custom to decided to use nswindow and attach it to the nsstatusitem

12019808
hide	show
window show and hide pretty well but only if i click on statusitem

12019829
int	chars
you can use atoi function to convert chars to int

12019830
cpu	processors
it achieved full cpu utilization but several exceptions were thrown because a hypothesis the processors was running through each string too fast and sometimes the same processors object would be applied to different strings simultaneously

12019830
cpu	processors
i m even more sure of my hypothesis that the processors are working too fast because if i provide longer input say whole text documents instead of 10 word headlines i get full cpu utilization without any exceptions thrown

12019854
bazaar	git
use git-bzr-ng a bidirectional bridge between git and bazaar

12019874
jtable	jtextpane
surfing in the web i found the way for using a jtextpane into a cell from jtable only this way i can show the text centered however when i added a jscrollpane for showing a scrollbar when the text is longer than the cell height the scrollbar is shown into a cell but it doesn t move only is shown but doesn t move

12019887
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in firefox google-chrome opera and safari

12019897
post	get
the linked post is very old and is discussing firefox v2 so there s a fair chance that it is no longer relevant but if you get a chance to try the suggested workaround perhaps you could let us know if it works or not

12019904
for-loop	loops
the example of a for-loop that you give is not the usual way of using for loops in python because the for-loop is not a numerical construct as it is in most languages but a way of applying a loops body to each element yielded by iteration of the collection given

12019908
explode	implode
i d also add that if you re looking to get an output of value1 value5 you shouldn t use explode but rather it s duel implode

12019916
hide	show
currently jquery is being used to hide show these snippets

12019932
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on google-chrome firefox but it doesnt work in ie

12019933
post	get
wich i use in the load more code so its reloaded after post get added

12019933
post	get
creating functions so they can be used later on is no problem now here is the real problem i have a bunch of inline javascript for jplayer and flexslider for example wich i m not able to reload after post get added because i cannot create a functions wich i can use later on as i did for prettyphoto and postlike because the code for jplayer and flexslider are in a different file

12019959
google-chrome	safari
just now i came to know that â xmlhttprequest doesnâ t work while submitting a form useful for progress tracking â in google-chrome safari due to webkit bug 23933

12019959
google-chrome	firefox
this working fine in firefox but not in google-chrome what i should do i want to show some in formation and status during multiple file upload

12019965
put	get
if it s the second reason then if you re using a dynamic language of some sort php ruby etc. put them in separate file and include them or get a text editor that supports code folding so you can get them out of your way when you re writing your code

12019966
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
and then make te lenght of loops variable by using a for-loop with the lenght of the arrays containing all numbers lines in my example as endvalue

12019969
width	height
each images element also has a width and height property that returns the size of the photo as an integer in px

12019975
strcpy	strncpy
the strcpy and strncpy functions return s1

12020052
subtract	add
if you want to add subtract the value have

12020057
int	chars
3 the unsigned modifier prevents the compiler to propagate the chars 8 bits sign to the int other bytes usually 32 bits ie the 24 most significant bits since an int is returned

12020057
int	chars
thus any chars where code would be 127 for unsigned chars or negative for signed chars is returned as is eg unsigned chars 200 is returned as int 200

12020058
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i have integrated shadowbox plugin into my drupal web and it works with opera google-chrome and ie9 but it doesn t work with firefox 14

12020071
getter	setter
add setter and getter for username and password in your registrationbean class

12020093
int	chars
1.before the arrival of java 7 it was because we could use the int and chars for switch case and as they were primitive so it had to be

12020126
int	chars
a switch works with the byte short chars and int primitive data

12020126
int	chars
primitive types chars byte short and int

12020172
min	max
also not shure about this but aren t your min and max constraints inverted

12020181
free	malloc
but i lost access to functions like malloc free strcat strstr etc.

12020190
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicsview	qwidget	qgraphicsitem	qwidget
when i create classes which implement qwidget qgraphicsview qgraphicsitem etc.

12020212
content-length	content-type
the response header with response headers like content-type content-length last-modified cookie etc

12020233
implements	extends
but mine is extends sherlockactivity so i m a bit confused as to how i can implements the two lines entry

12020234
opera	firefox
your code works fine for me tested in opera and firefox

12020238
folder	directory
how can i achieve this launching different sites to different directory folder

12020239
memcpy	strcpy
you can store 5 characters in there without a null but you have to remember you need to do a memcpy otherchararray foo 5 and not use strcpy

12020252
content-length	content-type
include a content-length and content-type property and then some html content for the browser to display

12020327
folder	directory
in this directory there s a fully working example-dih folder which just works

12020359
octal	decimal
type so a decimal octal or hexadecimal literal with a u suffix has

12020388
folder	directory
i have created the uiwebview but want to know the best way of capturing the files when they are linked to in the webview and then download them to a specified folder in the documents directory

12020413
min	max
this is a simple script that will produce the output you wanted though it does more than your requirements state as it also checks min max for columns 2 and 3

12020413
min	max
i am using list util to get the min max values which is purely convenience

12020420
stderr	fflush
is unbuffered or immediately fflush i o going to stderr

12020424
width	height
it should have coordinates width height etc

12020482
express	locomotivejs
with mvc frameworks like locomotivejs now available for nodejs express i m just wondering how it would be possible to implement ssl on part of an app

12020493
getter	setter
the easiest and ide-independent way to do it is to encapsulate your variable behind a setter getter pair and add a statement to your code watching for setting the value null

12020497
put	get
i considered using file open put get but msdn recommends against this since it is much more inefficient than serialization

12020536
allocator	stl
first you have to remember that the stl is completely built on os routines the c standard library and dynamic allocator

12020545
put	get
however i want to put a where clause into this as well but i get the error unknown key where

12020584
getter	setter
create a getter and setter so other classes can set themselves as delegates

12020593
alertdialog	progressdialog
what i m doing for this is show the progressdialog then try to connect with the server if it throws exception then i show alertdialog with error message

12020593
alertdialog	progressdialog
but its not working the code throwing exception when i call alertdialog immediately after progressdialog

12020593
alertdialog	progressdialog
i also dismiss the progressdialog then start alertdialog but doesn t work

12020598
profiling	debugging
demonsterdebugger great for debugging and cpu profiling

12020601
integer	unsigned
even with the 2-bit element encoding can easily fit that in a single unsigned 32 bit integer 0x6b6bae

12020647
hide	show
you can use the status to hide the article from readers or show them the last approved state

12020649
doc	rtf
when the user fills them in you then sanatize them and pass them to the report via these extensions and you can output excel pdf word doc rtf etc

12020653
serializable	deserialization
in those cases second property is not included in serializable but is recovered during deserialization

12020672
pull	push
what i mean by the git pull origin master is that the most solution ppl mention is to do a pull before push for example

12020680
google-chrome	firefox
tested with google-chrome and firefox

12020699
width	height
the header responds to width changes and it takes up about 500 px of height and its supposed to fit into certain areas of the background in my case an illustrated scroll but when i resize the window and the header contracts the sprites move eventually getting out of the scroll placement

12020731
min	max
when you say you want the id for the state you are going to have to make a choice about which id would would want max min etc

12020750
fadein	fadeout
your fadeoutnav is calling stop true which if done while fadeout or fadein are working will leave the style s they have applied to the element

12020751
google-chrome	safari
this only appears to happen in google-chrome and safari and in mobile safari as well

12020753
int	double
but of course this doesn t really work because numeric isn t the supertype of things like int and double it s a typeclass

12020765
put	get
interestingly things get even worse when you put null on the right hand side of a not in predicate

12020773
put	get
about the lock if i put the lock away i get dozens and hundreds of connection is closed or connection is already open errors because the open function just get s a connection from .net s connection pool

12020773
next	except
except that it s on the assignment of the connection object that it hangs next line is marked green

12020800
prepare	execute
but still there is almost zero chance that the attacker will execute malicious query via sql-injection as doctrine2 uses pdo prepare statement with parametarized query

12020801
google-chrome	safari
this only appears to happen in google-chrome and safari and in mobile safari as well

12020804
width	height
i need to calculate the width and the height of a uibezierpath

12020817
isotope	masonry
notice that this is not the same as masonry or isotope which allow lower images to cross over the edges of higher images

12020837
implements	extends
2 implements runnable is the suggested way because if you extends thread you can t extends anything else java doesn t support multiple inheritance

12020850
put	get
take that and put it outside of your while loop so it doesn t get recreated every cycle

12020867
versioning	upgrade
second addendum i have just upgrade to aptanastudio versioning is 3.2.1

12020890
shadowing	named
you have a script named base64.py which is shadowing the stdlib module

12020892
portrait	landscape
ok so i want to have 3 view and all of them landscape but i want 2 of the to be in only landscape and i want only 1 of them to be in portrait

12020905
range	minimum
they will contain respectively the minimum and the maximum value of each score range

versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade php to versioning 5.4 using this guide

12021013
jobs	cron
i was wondering if a web application for asp.net supports a scheduling feature similar to cron jobs on a unix-like platform

12021025
typedef	struct
in c struct header and the typedef header live in two different name spaces

12021051
try-catch	exception-handling
but you have to remember to add the try-catch block because the newinstance method will only know if the referenced class has a default constructor when it tries ti instantiate it at runtime and if it doesn t have there will be an exception-handling

matplotlib	scipy	scipy	scikit-learn
i installed the scipy superpack and can use all the packages -- including scikit-learn and matplotlib -- in the python interpreter and through ipython

12021122
clang	llvm
clang was still young and buggy when apple began the transition away from gcc s compiler and toolchain so llvm was built as a back-end to gcc to facilitate its eventual replacement

12021122
clang	llvm
eventually llvm and especially clang were mature enough to replace gcc outright which provided an amazing speed boost to compiling and a bump in the quality of the machine code output though many argue that gcc still produces better quality code at the expense of speed

12021167
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and not google-chrome

12021171
zoo	xts
i am familiar with the zoo function rollapply which allows you to do rolling computations on zoo or xts objects and you can specify the rolling increment via the by parameter

12021216
pypdf	reportlab
the usual references are reportlab or pypdf

12021248
google-chrome	firefox
just encountered this problem streaking up my screen on google-chrome but not on firefox or ie

12021283
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that setting the background to the tr works well on firefox and opera but on google-chrome the gradient is applied to each cell

12021288
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
now i wanted to use the same setup for my jpasswordfield since i thought that jpasswordfield inherits from jtextfield i could do the following but that has been a big disaster

12021294
stdout	stderr
the problem may be that the process may write to stderr or stdout and you are not reading from it and it blocks

12021313
rbenv	homebrew
what i did was uninstall rbenv via homebrew and reinstall it

12021314

12021350
width	height
is there a way to get the actual width and height of the view as it is displayed during the orientation change animation

12021353
int	chars
you don t want that you want a conversion from chars to int

12021358
int	chars
the way you are using reinterpret_cast you are trying to read a chars as an int and they are not the same size

12021359
zoo	xts
i temporarily coerce to zoo for the rollapplyr to make sure the rollapply.zoo method is being used as opposed to the unexported rollapply.xts method then coerce back to xts

12021362
width	height
i am looking into getting and setting the bounds or just the width of some window just the width as some window seem to have to have a specific aspect ratio so i think setting it to a specific width and height may not work if the aspect ratio isn t correct

12021372
put	get
onloadfinished seems to get called sometimes with a dead cursor - if you put a test for isclosed on the cursor you get passed you ll find it s closed in one in some large number attempts

12021411
int	chars
type like a float to int or unsigned chars to int

12021411
int	chars
cout tries to print an unsigned chars as an ascii chars code so converting to int via is the right thing to do

12021414
opera	google-chrome
the transition when mouse over works well in google-chrome and opera

12021427
keydown	keyup
the beep occurs at keydown not at keyup

12021429
hex	binary
c in hex is 12 in decimal is 1100 in binary

12021462
versioning	upgrade
eclipse generally has major problems when you upgrade java or adt versioning in my case anyway and the best solution for me has been to wipe everything out and start over

12021506
hex	binary
thus you can convert this to its binary representation by simply writing the bit-value for each hex digit

12021506
hex	binary
since we know each byte is always exactly 8-bits each hex digit converts to its own 4-bit binary representation

12021506
int	chars
a bitvector is usually a simple data type int chars etc.

12021550
bash	zsh
unfortunately arrays and associative arrays are not covered by posix.1-2008 and as you have found there are some annoying subtle differences between bash and zsh

12021550
bash	zsh
- notice that i use a few different tricks to do introspection in zsh and bash

12021561
hide	show
show hide formatting symbols

12021608
portrait	landscape
i have an xib with two ipad views one portrait one landscape

12021618
multiplying	multiplication
mathematically left shifting is the same as multiplying a number by a power of 2 but as the operation is done only by shifting it is much faster than doing multiplication

12021681
background-image	background-size
now just use the background-image and background-size properties to color the appropriate part of the row

12021686
twig	smarty
you can look around in the sparks directory there s multiple sparks that integrates numerous template engines like smarty or twig that could be tweaked to create something like this

12021700

your php page should return data based on the parameteres passed via either a get or post request

12021724
equals	gethashcode
implement equals and gethashcode

12021734
versioning	upgrade
an earlier than versioning clause in conflicts prevents dpkg from upgrading or installing the package which declares such a conflict until the upgrade or removal of the conflicted-with package has been completed which is a strong restriction

12021760
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in google-chrome and safari and is broken in firefox 14 and maybe earlier

12021774
google-chrome	firefox
all of this works fine in google-chrome but in firefox and ie they ignore the padding at the bottom for some reason

12021774
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason when i used the padding with the form it reads it correctly in firefox and ie and google-chrome

12021794
width	height
this page generates a css that outputs what height width and device-height width + orientation the browser using as parameters

12021794
width	height
the orientation was correct the width height and device-width height were the same for both orientations

12021809
allocator	stl
first you have to remember that the stl is completely built on os routines the c standard library and dynamic allocator

12021824
ggplot2	lattice
according to mr grid is much more user friendly way of creating grid grapics so i think it is worth learning and things such as lattice and ggplot2 are built on top of grid

12021825
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller is loading and showing different subclasses of uiviewcontroller

12021866
google-chrome	safari
i see it in google-chrome and safari i haven t tested other browsers yet

12021872
stdout	stderr
as michael pointed out the first problem is that you re using two different streams stdout and stderr and that one is buffered while the other is unbuffered

12021872
stdout	stderr
then to make it atomic call flockfile f at the beginning of your function and funlockfile f before you return where f is replaced by whichever of stdout or stderr you choose to use

12021876
user-controls	tabcontrol
i m trying to bind a value from a dictionary set as an itemsource of a tabcontrol to a dependencyproperty of a user-controls which is held within my tabcontrol.contenttemplate

12021886
flask	pyramid
i ve looked at pyramid and flask but their documentation talks mostly about translations and not number formatting

12021887
std	ostream
however i want to output to a file using ofstream rather than the std ostream and when i pass an ofstream instance as kind of expected i am getting an error

12021894
oncreate	findviewbyid
why don t you just save pointers to the controls in oncreate using findviewbyid and then compare to said pointers in oncheckedchange

12021904
std	ostream
std ofstream inherits from and can thus be used in place of std ostream

12021925
hide	show
i needed it to have different buttons for show hide and to hide if another div is asked to be show also i needed to place my a tags away from my div tags as well as add and remove the class active

12021936
width	height
however you may be able to scroll it explicitly by fixing the width height of the iframe and setting overflow auto on the containing div

12021953
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve found this problem in google-chrome 21 firefox 14 ie 7-9 safari 5 on pc

12021982
webkit	blink
first note that webkit blink based browsers set a max preflight cache of 10 minutes

12021982
put	preflight
next note that it is impossible to avoid a preflight on put delete requests

12021982
post	get
on get post avoid custom headers if at all possible since these still trigger preflights

12021999
flask	pyramid	flask	django
django is an all-in-one package while pyramid and flask give you more flexibility

12022031
width	height
i have a somewhat-temporary solution manually call -setsize on each image representation dividing the pixel height and width by the screen s scale factor

12022032
post	get
if you really want two pages you can send a post or get parameter to tell the page to show all links or only first ones

12022056
for-loop	loops
try using for-loop instead of while loops where the range will be from 0 to length -1

12022058
width	height
also for some reason it fills up the entire display even if i use static width height

12022104
google-chrome	safari
i then played with the font sizing and settled on 4.15em which showed no white edges in safari or google-chrome for mac

12022105
post	get
as you can see basically this block just tries to get post data and if it can t it redirects back to the edit page with an error message

12022108
post	get
if i try to post a cookie with curl i get a http_code 500

12022121
subtract	add
if you start at zero and add 1 for every clockwise path and subtract 1 for every counterclockwise path the filled areas are all of the areas that have a non-zero number

12022172
versioning	upgrade
but as gregg mentioned i would not do it grails is tested with a specific versioning of spring and you make get some unexpected results and behavior if you upgrade spring

12022204
jobs	cron
my webserver is running cpanel and has a cron job module in it providing a gui to add remove edit cron jobs

12022204
jobs	cron
problem i need to create a large number of cron jobs more than 100

12022204
jobs	cron
the current problem with cpanel s cron gui is that there will be no organization in the cron jobs

12022204
jobs	cron
if i have 5 related cron jobs added seperately admist 100 other unrelated cron jobs it will get harder to find these cron jobs in the long list of cron jobs

12022204
jobs	cron
or is there an alternative gui with better features like folders or the ability to move cron jobs up and down the list

12022204
jobs	cron
or should i just have 1 cron job which calls a php file that does the various wget in php using curl with a table and stores the jobs in a mysql database essentially creating my own version of cron that runs off a single cronjob which triggers every minute

12022205
hide	show
i want to hide the top actionbar that i have as an overlay on touch and then show it again on another touch

12022210
lisp	smalltalk
smalltalk and lisp are well known for this kind of thing

12022221

here s what happens client-side and server-side

12022242
cvs	svn
i have previous git and svn experience but no cvs experience

12022243
post	get
one of the values in the post array that i get from paypal is something that i am passing through to keep track of the transaction number

12022243

google-chrome	firefox
as a follow up to this question how do i prevent internet explorer from loading multiple style sheets since i want firefox and google-chrome to load one and ie to load the other

12022283
margin	height
i m thinking now that the 39 might have come from the 15px margin of the old fb-button + its 24px height

12022283
margin	height
i think i can get around it by simply setting the height to be 39px and not having a margin

12022301
int	double
as in the previous example it might require two type conversions on the scalar say you multiply by 5 it will then convert 5 into a double which will then be converted back to int to match the signature of

12022301
int	double
again this is not the generic t of the class template but the current instantiating type int double ...

12022318
folder	directory
i have created a webservice directory in my mvc web application s root folder and created a webservice named myservice.asmx

12022374
addeventlistener	onload
i tried using the onload and addeventlistener function but to no avail.

12022379
addition	multiplication
no -- a bit-field will frequently be considerably slower than a bare unadorned int because if you do something addition or multiplication that might overflow the designated size the compiler will typically insert a bitwise and instruction to ensure that the result fits in the specified size

12022379
multiplying	multiplication	put	get
e.g. if you multiplying two 10-bit numbers and put the result in a 10-bit field the multiplication may produce up to a 20-bit number so the compiler will normally produce the 20-bit result the use a bitwise and to get the 10 least significant bits for the result

12022381
hide	show
check if its consumed else toggle or whatever to show hide action bar

12022384

12022423
put	get
i put a breakpoint at the beginning of tableview cellforrowatindexpath and it never get there

12022435
getter	setter
when declaring a module that extends dojo stateful the pattern for getter and setter is to defined _xxxgetter and _xxxsetter which will be manifested as .get xxx and .set xxx

12022456
textview	imageview
one way to do something like that would be to use a lot of imageview for the icons and the on off switch and then create textview with custom fonts for the textual stuff depending on what you d like to use and position all of these elements using a relativelayout as is described here

12022483
entities	entitymanager
this will save you quite a bit of coding to fetch child entities while the servlet filter handles opening and closing your entitymanager

12022492
appkit	nsapplication

setcontentview	findviewbyid
you are calling findviewbyid before you have called setcontentview which will not work well

12022602
int	double
a type class is a collection of types rather than a single type int and double and rational are all types belonging to the type class num

12022608
multiplying	add
the luhn algorithm starts from the right end then multiplying every other digit with 2 and add the result

12022625
google-chrome	firefox
they maintain their own cookie-store so those cookies don t end up in the browser - the same way that cookies from one browser firefox don t show up in another one google-chrome

12022632
width	height
sorry 100 only apply to width does not apply to height you can try a jquery approach instead

12022632
margin	height
with this unless you have a padding margin on the side bar the height should be okay

12022636
mdpi	hdpi
did you forget to delete the default app icon in the ldpi mdpi and hdpi folder

12022646
textview	imageview
is there any way to link an imageview s contentdescription with its labelling textview in xml

12022659
rsa	dsa
how can i know whether the key type for the remote host certificate is dsa or rsa

12022659
rsa	dsa
i always get sun rsa public key and never dsa

12022659
rsa	dsa
i know that rsa is much widely used than dsa but i suppose to see at least 1 dsa key in my set

12022668
mouse	keyboard
i am assuming that players will either have a controller or a keyboard and mouse touch might work as well but tweaking is needed

12022714
int	chars
i do not understand what adding an int number to a unicode chars does

12022730
post	get
when i print the array within post list page post-list.php i do get the returned terms so i can confirm that it works

12022768
google-chrome	safari
when i test this on firfox things are pretty fine but safari and google-chrome almost die to perform the same operation

12022768
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
- how can i make google-chrome and safari happy like firefox and let them do things fast

12022768
google-chrome	safari
the queue can contain any number of items but for google-chrome safari it is not more than 20

12022786
min	max
the slider is created to have the min and max values set from 0 - to the duration of the video so that the slider can only ever have a value that can correctly pick a time frame in the video in question

12022789
int	boolean
change the way that you removed the tapped item by adding this to protected boolean ontap int index

12022799
gif	png
when i upload an image to fb it has image png type or image gif

12022809
int	boolean
you can use the array_walk or array_walk_recursive function in php to cast the boolean to int before encoding the json

12022885
int	chars
when adding a chars and an int the chars gets converted to the int value that represents the chars code

12022885
int	chars
the int is then converted to a chars and then to a string

12022934
hide	show
that way you can hide show rotate animate accelerate etc so much easier

12022934
awt	swing
and it will all be tons faster than with swing awt

12022943
imagemagick	minimagick
you have to install imagemagick rmagick or minimagick

12022958
int	chars
i use int in the example as you can t use a chars as backing type for an enum.

12022963
fpdf	fpdi
from the website fpdf has to be version 1.6 or below to work with fpdi

12022969
client-side	server-side
server-side database driver and or a client-side cache that implements

12022980
tcpdf	fpdi
as of version 1.2.1 fpdi can be used with tcpdf - a derivate of fpdf.

12022984
textview	imageview
however if you are setting the textview s contents programmatically you will need to do the same for the imageview s content description

12022986
uilabel	uibutton
use the hidden property of uiview uitextfield uilabel and uibutton are all subclasses of uiview

12022994
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
but i m also not sure that i am doing this in the right place since i ve seen approaches that involve viewdidappear viewwillappear willanimaterotationtointerfaceorientation etc

12022997
textview	imageview
or create your own listview that has imageview and textview in each row

12023012
uilabel	uitextview
go to the .h file for the view controller and make an iboutlet with the data type appropriate for your control uitextview uilabel etc.

12023042
min	max
you can make the array start and end with any min max values and you can create as many in-between values as you need to achieve the desired accuracy

12023076
rss	feed
it then accesses an rss feed to render the annotations which i have created in a static xml file and placed in the same directory as the .swf

12023076
rss	feed
the rss feed contains coordinates title description and an icon to be used as the map marker

12023079
int	chars
you ran into trouble because you assigned a chars to a position in an and thus used the int representation of the chars

12023079
int	chars	int	double
because of this calls to did not fail which it always should as the double of any digit never can have more than two digits and half of them have only one because double the int representation of the digit chars s all have three digits

12023082
folder	directory
another longer way might be to get an url to the tmp directory by first getting the document directory and stripping the last path component and then adding the tmp folder

12023084
terminate	timeout
somehow thread.abort does not work will try to figure out how the interop threading stuff works rather than creating a managed thread you can create a native thread using createthread and terminate it after a timeout

12023159
inherited	properties
you can always add another element inside the container to contain your multi-select and have it inherited the properties of the parent container

12023172
screens	tablet
then if i run my app on a device 320x480 phone the advert banner appears on the top but if i run my app on a android tablet 1280x800 the advert banner appears centered horizontally and vertically - at the center of screens

12023225
bash	tcsh
you need to set ulimit -c unlimited in bash same effect different command in tcsh

12023229
post	get
does it expect get or post or either

12023249
width	height
from what i understand i should be casting out rays by my camera s width height and maybe increase the amount of rays depending how far the camera sees

12023273
typhoeus	httparty
typhoeus and httparty are two good ones among others

12023347
int	chars
this is well-formed but reinterprets the unsigned chars as an int object which isn t guaranteed to work possible issues range from invalid alignment of the storage to incompatible sizes - 1 byte vs 4 bytes

12023382
google-chrome	firefox
cors works perfectly in my application right now for google-chrome firefox

12023382
post	get
has anyone managed to get ie to make cors requests that have post data in them

12023395
width	height
i am setting the width and height properties of the canvas so i can t see why it would perform differently in the visualbrush versus if i simply added it into a grid or some other layout container

12023406
super	extends
wrt your question on extends the class the super statement must appear as the very first statement in the constructor

12023426
public	protected	ssl	https
what i want to achieve is to have a set of public views controllers bound to my http endpoint and a set of ssl protected controllers bound to my https endpoint

12023441
jboss	weblogic
basically you create a keystore generate sign store the keys and based on the alias the container jboss tomcat weblogic or websphere will load the appropriate keys during initialization

12023444
getter	setter
i can t really advise the best way to solve this but i think you will need to start by making the foo fields private and providing getter and or setter for them

12023448
multiplying	add
create separate methods for the operations i.e add int x int y multiplying int x int y etc..

12023455
git-rebase	amend
i ll assume separate branches the point of doing a git-rebase is that you are reordering the commits on one branch to be appended to the end of the other branch if a conflict now occurs then you need to amend the commit as if it had been coded after the other commit if that means a function doesn t see the light of day then so be it

12023479
google-chrome	firefox
have a look at my dummy site google-chrome or firefox only

12023507
scrypt	pbkdf2
if you want to secure average quality passwords not in the top 1000 most common passwords or single words from few most commonly spoken languages then password key stretching is your best bet scrypt bcrypt or the standard pbkdf2 are good choices

12023866
children	parent
do children have pointers to their parent

12023866
children	parent
in fact you stated that children have pointers to their parent but that is not true for any immutable tree

post	get
the issue here is that you are attempting to access post ed variables in a method that will only handle get requests

12023885

if you need to access a variable from either request.args get or request.form post and you don t need it to be set use the get method to get the value if it is there or none if it is not set

12024469
int	double
also you may want to cast it to double or float to make it a floating point division to prevent truncation of the fractions part because right now is an int division

12024833
int	chars
an int constant expression shall have int type and shall only have operands that are int constants enumeration constants chars constants sizeof expressions whose results are int constants and floating constants that are the immediate operands of casts

12024849
int	chars
type chars is an integral type not much different from int in this context so a const chars object initialized by 0 is also a null-pointer constant in c++ but not in c

12024867
int	chars
it s taking advantage of the const you put in there and seeing that its value is actually an int 0 chars is an int type

12024867
int	double
if you put double in there as with many other non int types

tax	shipping
the current free flex2 shipping module has a bug that causes an incorrect tax calculation on the shipping amount

12024870
tax	shipping
my home country canada requires a different tax rate to be applied within the domestic market depending on which province i am shipping to

12024870
tax	shipping
the first function call extracts the shipping total the result of the tax calculation performed at the beginning of the checkout process from the array d

12024870
tax	shipping
the current implementation of all shipping modules is to return a static tax rate

12024870
tax	shipping
unfortunately prior to my requirements for flex2 variable tax rates there was only one tax rate per domestic international zone allowed - and this was set manually during configuration of the shipping module

12024870
tax	shipping
it was ok in the past to simply extract the tax rate after the fact from the static configuration files of the shipping module

getter	setter
i initially thought that interfaces would be fine eg readonlyobject with getter and writeonlyobject with setter and object implementing both of them but the problem is that writeonlyobject interface would be easily reachable by any class that uses readonlyobject

beside that i m not convinced that writing interfaces with only getter or setter is a good practice

many-to-many	one-to-many
if you remove one of the collections ef assumes by convention that your relationship is a one-to-many relationship which doesn t have an intermediate table but only a foreign key in one of the tables in contrast to the model with two collections where ef creates a many-to-many relationship that has an intermediate table

12026295

however you can override this convention using fluent api and tell ef explicitly that the remaining collection belongs to a many-to-many relationship instead of a one-to-many

12027667
superclass	subclassing
however a neater way to have the potential for multiple subclassing to set the variable value and it be used by the superclass is to have the child classes set the value you want and then have the superclass reference that variable possibly using a getter that the subclassing has set the value of

width	height
more often you will use one of these constants to set the width or height

in general specifying a layout width and height using absolute units such as pixels is not recommended

the point of a salt is just to add extra hard to guess data to the value you want to hash

12028474
hash	salt
one common solution is to just prepend append the salt to the text you re going to hash

12028474
salt	md5
for example if your hidden value was password and your salt was a random number between 0 and 255 the thing actually stored in your database might be md5 123password 123

so it doesn t really make sense for the salt operation to be irreversible as it s already hash which is kind of irreversible

mdpi	hdpi
depending on your image -- specifically whether it still looks good scaled down automatically -- you could just provide hdpi and xhdpi versions and android will automatically scale them at run-time for ldpi and mdpi respectively

mdpi	hdpi
now you need to put them in the respective folders of ldpi mdpi hdpi and xhdpi in res drawable of your project

google-chrome	firefox
edit i ve re-installed the entire software stack windows 8 office 2010 visual studio 2012 windows update google-chrome firefox

getter	setter
but if your title setter is just a proxy to content_for why not make a helper for the getter as well

12029741
msg	eml
i haven t seen any objective c libraries for either but mimetic is a free c++ library that can do the job for eml files and presumably mime-compliant msg files

12029753
children	parent
the two basic ideas are updating the data in the parent when a child value changes or summarizing from the children at query time

12029753
children	parent
you have to read all the other children in order to set the value in the parent

12029753
children	parent
in all probability the children and the parent will each fit on one data page

12029843
int	chars
the newly created objects currently have two attributes an int and a string representing a single word roughly averaging 10 chars

12029844

if you want to modify the inner object itself you ll need to write methods in the interface with getter and setter this also more or less breaks the spirit of the pattern but might work for your case

if you are just using pptx you might find it easier to use docx4j since with apache-poi you ll probably also need to get xml beans working on android

12030581
rss	feed
what you could consider doing to avoid importing previously imported feed is created a field in you db for example id_unique add any constant variable from each feed to this field for example the date time from the rss feed then you could either validates_uniqueness_of id_unique in your model or add a method to find_or_create by id_unique

awt	swing
swing is built on top of awt with a different philosophy for creating and drawing ui components

12040287
awt	swing
however swing still uses the awt event queue paradigm including listeners - it does not replace them with listeners native to swing because there s no reason to

12040287
awt	swing
using both swing and awt for your applications is common practice what you were warned against is using both swing and awt ui components

memcached	apc
i want to enable memcached php apc mysql caching and http caching

12040366
awt	swing
swing shares quite a few classes with awt and uses some of the same implementation - note that javax.swing.jcomponent the base swing component class actually inherits from java.awt.component the base awt container class

12040366
awt	swing
it s actually not that much of a problem to mix swing and awt if you are careful

12040366
awt	swing
you risk getting a very different look and feel if you mix awt and swing ui components

12040366
awt	swing
swing components are lightweight rendered by java while awt components are heavyweight implemented as components in the host platform - this means you will have problems if you put awt components inside swing components the other way round is fine

i ve written a web app that uses features that make it incompatible with ie and require minimum versions of firefox and google-chrome

12040421
google-chrome	firefox
i m worried though that changes to the way google-chrome or firefox declares it s user-agent might break my regex

12040421
google-chrome	firefox
also since i m explicitly requiring firefox or google-chrome i m probably excluding some browsers that might otherwise be able to use the site

12040465

fadein	fadeout
the animation i want to do are fadein and fadeout depending of the situation

12040624
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that for some reason the browsers tested on google-chrome and firefox think that i don t really mean it when the browser-window is not wide enough the outer columns are cropped and width-setting ignored therefore the real content is sliding under my divs and become completely unaccessable

12040636
google-chrome	firefox
i need something that can work in both google-chrome or any other webkit browser and firefox

12040690
width	margin
you just need to define a width for the main div so the margin can center it

12040690
width	height
you also need to put a div right before the main div closes to clear the months so the main div has a distinct height width

12040733

google-chrome	firefox
notice how the floating images don t update with the page position in google-chrome like they do in firefox

12040835

12041083
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that ie and firefox position the image differently than google-chrome does

12041092
post	get
the only possible security consideration for post over get is that information won t be leaked in the http referrer to sites that are linked to from the page

12041105
postgresql	mysql
if they do you will be able to store those strings into a real database postgresql mysql or even sqlite3 so you don t have to have an independent server

if you need to handle stderr you ll want to pipe it to stdout i believe

12041292

illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	illegalstateexception	runtimeexception	illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception

12041496
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i suggest you to include the user control inside an updatepanel and add your scriptmanager inside the updatepanel load event

d3.js	raphael
the code uses raphael rather than d3.js but the results will be the same

12041560
width	margin
now the problem is i want the content width to be fluid but the margin and padding to be of fixed width as below

12041607
filtering	grouping
then a filtering first followed by grouping on the result would need to be split up into two calls

12041634
width	height
i cant quite seem to get it working but what i want to do is to be able to have something attached to my mouse then when i mousedown unbind the click but then rebind it to moves the width and height instead of the top and left

mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
mousemove mousedown to unbind and then rebind mousemove the on mouseup unbind mousemove again

inherited	subclassing
if you were modeling gen-spec in an oopl such as java you would use the subclassing inherited facility to take care of the details for you

12041890
inherited	subclassing
unfortunately the relational data model does not have subclassing inherited built in and the sql database systems donâ t offer any such facility to my knowledge

12041890
superclass	subclassing
note that in this diagram cricketer is both a subclassing and a superclass

12041899
verilog	hdl
as you learn verilog try not to rationalize the hdl you write as code because it is a different style of thinking

12041925
put	get
so in order to get back a tiledsprite or animatedsprite from a spritesheet you have to know how much columns and rows it can be hardcoded somewhere it had before being put into the spritesheet since texturepacker won t give you that kind of information

12041928
getter	setter
you can wrap a getter and a setter in an object of an anonymous class implementing a simple interface

12041947

it does not mean that you have to have square images just that an image must not have its width or height exceed 2048 again 4096 on newer devices

in my example i don t wish to expose max directly to the user meaning i don t want the user to change it using .mywidget option max value or but at the same time i want to expose min

12042009
mvvm	delegatecommand
i think you will find that a lot me included of people that write wpf applications using the mvvm pattern will use some variation of the delegatecommand and as evidence i would offer that most of the mvvm frameworks offer an implementation of such

12042011
width	height
css3 does add vw and vh units that let you specify lengths relative to the viewport width and height respectively

in firefox google-chrome or ie9 if the user tries to click the register button on an empty form the error messages show up fine

12042099

my personal choice though is if its internal functionality models or controllers alike that aren t ajax ready i tend to use the underscore method with a couple comments under or above each function to give me an idea

12042104
post	get
usually corresponding to get and post

12042156
google-chrome	firefox
the code above works in both firefox and google-chrome while the shorthand does not

when i add the meta_key parameter to sort the results i get every post with a meta_key equal to startdate

12042157
post	get
how do i get the query to sort by startdate without pulling all of the post that have a meta_key equal to startdate

12042159
folder	directory
the closest question i could find was this one which seems to have some problems with this recursion method as i don t have folder count upfront and the behavior would be very odd for a single directory of many files

12042163
int	double
that is create a class with simple types that can be serialized string int double etc. and fill it with the information you need

width	height
based on the windows height width

12042266
width	height
but the essence of what you may want to do is get the width height of the window body

12042266
width	height
and then use that couples with the width height found to make adjustments so it doesnt run off screen at any given point less thats what you want

12042268
post	get
although this is not a good solution in this case there must be a way to get it working without scrolling i will post it as a workaround

12042277
hide	show
that is it will show and hide it s own tabs but for some reason when clicking the second tab it changes the status of all the tabs

12042306
highcharts	highstock
easy upgrades this wrapper will be the only code that will require modification in case of any breaking changes in highcharts api after upgrades or even if one decides to move to a differnt charting library altogether even from highcharts to highstock can be exhaustive if your application uses charts extensively

12042319
width	height
the inverse of the width or height in pixels is the offset from the current texture coordinate that you ll need to use here

12042319
width	height
i pass in the texelwidth and texelheight uniforms which are 1 width and 1 height of the image respectively

12042319
width	height
this does require you to track the input image width and height but it should work on all opengl es devices not just those with the derivative extensions

however it is recommended to merge the two pages together hide loading bar and show main page as you will have less problems.

12042492
portrait	landscape
solution i put the same code except for exchanging the instances of portrait and landscape into willanimaterotationtointerfaceorientation and that fixed the tiling issue

12042523
versioning	upgrade
when i did it gave an error saying that the installer required an upgrade versioning of windows to run

12042532

not all browsers support this but firefox will let you drag an image out of the browser to another browser or your computer while google-chrome does not allow you to drag an image out of the browser

12042532
google-chrome	firefox
this page has a so called dropzone open it in google-chrome and open an image in firefox and you can drag the image straight from firefox to google-chrome however it does not seem to work the other way around

i m new to using a git vcs but i was able to setup egit with my github repo and successfully make commits and such to the repo

repo	egit
a fellow friend who also is new to using git github is having issues using that same repo in egit when he is added as a contributor

12042558

12042680

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome solves this issue by providing unique requestids but i have not been able to find a similar functionality on firefox

gridview	rowdatabound
whenever i enter to this page or i use a search engine i refresh the gridview with a datasource and of course the rowdatabound is triggered.

12042740

google-chrome	firefox
the codes work in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

12042763

inside this is 6 fixed height scrollviews almost full width

12042789

i wish to expand to use the new horizontal space and reduce the vertical with the 6 interior scrollviews retaining their height however also taking advantage of the increased width

12042811
for-loop	loops
but the for-loop and while loops doesn t work

12042839
stdout	stderr
if you re on mac os or linux you can use standard redirection and a simple shell call if you want to capture the stdout and stderr to a variable in your script

12042839
stdout	stderr
simply redirects stderr in the command output to stdout which is captured when the program runs

12042839
stdout	stderr
if you want to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file for later use

12042857
for-loop	loops
i m trying to implement a javascript for-loop in which a php variable is counting phpvar++ each loops

12042873

12042873
stdout	stderr
is there a way to swap the stdout and stderr back to the terminal instantly

12042898

12042995
int	chars
they are both int but they have a chars between them

12042995
int	chars
i cannot use getline with its delimiter because it assigns data to a chars array which i do not believe i can convert to an int without another library

12042995
int	chars
i cannot use a while loop with get and peek because again i do not think i will be able to convert a chars array into an int

12042996
post	get
what you can do to get the count of post for all users is

12043004
for-loop	loops
however when i go to put the arraylist in a for-loop to loops through the values the page will not load how the serer is set up

i am trying to run a separate thread for calling a function because it uses a call to execl and thus will stop my program i am on windows and cannot use fork

12043079
width	height
well you could make a class that gets the width and height of the console maps every possible coordinate then keeps track of every color change and the coordinate at which the color was changed

12043104
ubuntu	linux

hash	salt
making sure the salt is unique is easy - you could just hash together the username and the time when the password was last changed

it s more common and more secure to only store a hash of the password and salt

12043109
rss	feed

this is not however a way to clone push or pull git repo as i explain in missing repos in gitweb

12043390
accessor	properties
i m using a combination of reflection and expression trees and want to pass back certain properties accessor from a class to a calling method

12043425
int	chars
internally however strings are represented as lists of int representing the code points for each of the chars in the implementations internal encoding

12043447
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout only fires once you want to use a setinterval

12043486
gridview	rowdatabound
you need to set your colors on the event of onprerender and not on rowdatabound so set the event on gridview

12043550
pyramid	cherrypy
cherrypy or pyramid or some micro framework seems better

12043557

a simple algorithm to solve this problem would be by using indexof and charat and looping through one of the string s instances of -

12043587

12043830
width	height
basically i have all of my site s content centered within a div that is a specified width and an intended height of 100 regardless of the actual length of the content

12043844
getter	setter
this odd approach to add the property name as the key and into the restrictions is related to the fact that restrictions have no getter and setter for property names

12043854
move	drag
in this example of extjs 4.1 actually the left elements patients are cloned from the view to the right grid hospitals i want to remove the patients of the left view when i drag and drop to the right grid and add the capacity to move the items from the right grid to the left view

12043867
interbase	firebird
this would be a handy generic udf for mysql and bring it something that it has consistently lacked in comparison to firebird interbase which they call events not to be confused with mysql timed events

12043867
interbase	firebird
the timed event feature of mysql on the other hand is something that firebird interbase lacked the last time i looked at them

12043899
stdout	stderr

therefore you may use explode function to convert string into array of substr

12043978

12043991
chunked	transfer-encoding

12044002
joystick	zaber
instead of separate scripts to pause and resume use a zaber joystick and program the buttons to send the pause and resume commands

12044002
joystick	zaber
if you have a zaber joystick it can be more convenient to tap a couple of joystick buttons than it is to run the pause and resume scripts in zaber console

12044004
google-chrome	firefox
w3c recommendation is that you put nothing before the doctype in any browser even those that tolerate chars before it such as google-chrome and firefox

12044014

12044132
put	get
this resource can be accessed by either get or put requests

12044154
getter	setter
what i don t like about the getter and setter methods of the two string member variables is that locking on singletoninstance can make a thread trying to access mstringb wait until a thread that is manipulating mstringa releases its lock

12044154
getter	setter
would you create two member variables like â and in myclass and use them in the synchronized block of the getter and setter methods of mstringa and mstringb respectively

12044155
google-chrome	firefox
the below example catches both errors when run in google-chrome and firefox as well as if i use devtools in ie9 and set browser mode to ie8 or ie7

fastcgi	scgi
lighttpd allows both to start fastcgi and scgi application or connect to independent one

12044238
fastcgi	scgi
cherokee afair allows both to start fastcgi and scgi application or connect to independent one

12044238
fastcgi	scgi
nginx - does not start applications at all however for fastcgi currently not the best for comet streaming because of buffering so scgi would be better with nginx assuming you are using latest nginx version

12044238
fastcgi	scgi
small note scgi is a protocol that is very similar to fastcgi but significantly simpler

12044301
jar	war	jboss	weblogic
with this one i can manage deployment on jboss weblogic websphere for ear war jar

12044305
min	max
you can however do something like setting the variable to be the max or min

12044396
folder	directory
so currently i have two loops running within another i don t know if this is like taboo or something d but what i m aiming for is if the number of files in a directory pages are more than in another directory posts i want it to delete the corresponding files in the pages folder

12044396
folder	directory
all the files in the pages folder are numbered and every time there is a new text file in the posts directory there is a corresponding page created in the pages directory with the same number ie 12.txt will create 12.html

12044407
for-loop	loops
since i want to loops over the keys of a map i first copy the keys into a vector vec_keys and the i run the parallel for-loop over the elements of vec_keys

12044438
google-chrome	firefox
it has click and arrow key navigation enabled so you can see the stark differences in speed between ie8 and firefox google-chrome etc

12044470
google-chrome	safari
you probably want to this in google-chrome or safari as the developer tools are better on them in my opinion

12044480
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox google-chrome and safari you ll is getting of hello

12044498
ssms	ssdt
you would need to use a seperate tool like ssdt or ssms anyway

12044570
google-chrome	safari
im not sure if this can really be considered a bug since the solution is really outlined in some places in the webkit spec - in fact as it stands it appears as though google-chrome are the only ones that got this -right- and since it looks like theyre just beginning to support this though safari does not

12044614
width	height
i also added in flexible width and height so that it would rotate properly

12044620
pdfsharp	sharppdf
i looked at sharppdf pdfsharp and it seems this library is only for generating pdfs from scratch not saving docx as pdf

12044626
width	height
you will need to set a width if you use this i believe so also add the width you can set your own width to what you require same for height

12044702
crypt	hash
i try doing phpunit md5test from the tests crypt hash directory and get the following

12044727
folder	directory
then run through the second directory and use in_array to determine if it s in the last folder

12044735
folder	directory
for example if your compiled code is in mycode com somedomain someproject mymainclass.class then you will execute the java command from the mycode folder like this again take special note that the directory structure is the same as the package declaration

12044769
cpu	processors
you are probably seeing 50 cpu usage because you have a dual core processors

12044790
google-chrome	firefox
when video.js fell back to ogg video for firefox it wrapped the video in a different div but not in google-chrome

12044799

12044799
jar	war
is there a way to automate the process of jar exporting to war of the second project into a location on the first

12044801
width	height
when resizing viewports you cannot use resizing percentages on an image since it will take on the parent element width and height right

12044820

12044825
tiff	png
ie jpg png tiff etc

12044913
folder	directory
you have to select each individual project in the solution explorer and click the show all files icon for each one and then the folder structure shown will be that of your directory structure

12044955
pow	math.h
i can t use pow from math.h because i need a constant expression

12045046
instances	transient
so trying to bind to these transient class instances wasn t really sensible on my part - i would have to keep 96 instances of that class around

12045080
free	malloc
functions like mempartinfoget require part_id in the manual it states that malloc uses free lists of system memory partition

12045083
fontfamily	font-size
they re just using a standard font fontfamily impact and making it big font-size 50px

12045089
udp	tcp
don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong

12045089
udp	tcp
if you have to reassembly multiple udp packets into one you should probably use tcp

12045099
post	get
here s how it works you use the server url create a nsurlrequest assign the proper http method post get etc and other necessary request headers then you would call on nsurlconnection to get the response and the server data

12045103
uiview	subviews
this is all being run from a subclass of uiview with the uiimageview as a subviews

12045115

12045141
oncreate	setcontentview
do what you need to do in oncreate but do not call setcontentview - it d be pointless fire new intent to call another activity and then call finish to kill your transitional activity at the end of its oncreate

12045166
background-color	transparency
the css filter will change the elements to have opacity of 80 and i only want background-color to be transparency

12045187
winpcap	libpcap
the address information may have more than one ip address - libpcap winpcap s pcap_findalldevs call and winpcap s pcap_findalldevs_ex call supply a pointer to a list of pcap_if_t structures one for each interface that it found and each of those structures includes a list of address information items of type struct pcap_addr

12045211
post	get
so my question is how can i get the blog title when i am inside of a text or chat post

12045219

unsigned	short
does anybody know why the various to_string functions declared in section 21.5 of the c++11 standard lack overloads for short and unsigned short

12045252

and i did the trick is to reopen the php file and pass the element value to it accessible by using the expression _post element or _get element when using get method instead of post

12045254
ubuntu	linux
i ve been working on a custom pe binfmt handler for ubuntu linux 12.04 intel x86_64 architecture if this sounds familiar i ve posted a few questions related to this project already

12045306
google-chrome	firefox
scenario is that when i work on it everything go fine in google-chrome while firefox and ie doesn t have any effect on click of button tag

12045314
width	height
instead of using wrap_content you can specify a view s width or height using dp density independant pixels try changing wrap_content to 50dp or whatever value that suits your needs

12045324
hash	md5
generally you will store an md5 hash on the original binary and check the md5 against new versions to see if they are the same enough md5 can t guarantee a 100 match

12045366
hash	salt
you could salt the ssn hash which will mean that if someone runs a brute force crack against your table they will have to do it once for each row rather than be able to get all the rows at once

12045371
getter	setter
i ve tried to use getter and setter to do this but i think the problem lies in that there is no persistant variable so the first block of code is always called

12045412
debian	linux	debian	mint
i ve tested it on my computer linux mint debian edition and it seems to work perfectly

12045432
children	parent
i want to have a parameterized query called via the wcf service that takes an id number and finds the children in the server table based on their parent id value which is embedded within the xml of their server_info column

12045438
wordpress	joomla
there are many cms applications that you can install such as wordpress and joomla

12045452
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it just puts an nsstring into an nsmutablestring pointer

12045486
memcached	apc
if you are using apc or memcached you could have the same result as persisting the state without the performance penalty

12045548
post	get
now when user post this form you will get the selected items value in the selectedgroups property of the viewmodel

12045552
google-chrome	firefox
everything seems to be working great in google-chrome firefox but not in ie8

12045553
children	parent
if you make sure the children of your parent movieclip you want to access all have instance names which are sequentially numbered you can do something like this

12045559
ubuntu	linux
operating system we want to compile on is linux ubuntu to be exact

12045569
post	get
i found one blog that discusses the issue of post redirects being converted to get s and resulting in errors which is exaclty what i was experiencing

12045604
hide	show
so if one is clicked it will show the div associated with it and hide the others ect

12045625
hide	show
if they are expensive what are the efficient alternatives such as show and hide or is there anything else

12045707
hide	show
and as i already mentioned for a tab type interface where you d need to make groups of elements appear disappear at once you can just show hide a div that contains all the elements for the current tab

12045707
hide	show
the child elements will show hide with their parent

12045707
fadein	hide
also with jquery .show and hide or other animation methods like fadein and .fadeout you can add some nice transitions between your tabs

12045711
getter	setter
now let s say we want fubar to have a getter and setter or in other words become a c# property

12045722
width	height
a brute force way that seems to work in some browsers for getting the height and width a little before the full image has loaded is to poll the loading image for the existence of .width and height

12045722
put	get
if you go the route of an onload handler and your image tag with the .src specific is in the html of the page the only way to make sure you get notified when it is loaded is to put an inline image handler so the handler is installed from the very beginning

12045730
ssl	https
this is becuase its https ssl

12045738
getter	setter
however if it s just a basic getter setter with no extra logic you can just write

12045740
getter	setter
if there s no logic in the getter setter use an auto-property

12045745
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
some of the changes include using println rather than printf s n ... which is just clearer and using an enhanced for-loop instead of manually tracking the position in the arrays in a loops

12045768
getter	setter
if you name your private variables starting with lower case you can right click on them and have vs generate your getter setter code for you

12045772
ubuntu	debian
i suggest you to try the live-cd of some modern distribution debian testing ubuntu 12.04 fedora 17 and see if it works fine

12045795
carrierwave	paperclip
i am switching over from paperclip to carrierwave and am running into an issue i cannot solve

12045846
uilabel	uitextview
if you just need a row of text why not use uitextfield uilabel or uitextview depending on your needs and just position it above your uitable whereever you like

12045852
filesystems	hfs+
one notable exception is mac os x which is unix-based but uses a default filesystems type hfs+ that is not case sensitive

12045879
hide	show
if you have just those two alternatives put them both in your layout and hide show the one you want

12045886
rss	feed
i can t find anything inside graph api or fql nor any rss feed

12045925
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear and viewdidappear are not called in newviewcontroller_iphone

12045940
strlen	substr	multibyte	substr
the application uses various php string functions such as strlen strpos substr etc and my understanding is that i should switch these for multibyte string functions such as mb_strlen mb_strlen mb_substr etc in order for multibyte characters to be handled correctly

12045959
pull	push
how do i pull from the origin and push to github

12045983
pull	push
so i followed your steps to push a tag on one eclipse and then pull it from another eclipse instance

12046213
n-gram	words
after some research i found that i can use either the bag of words approach or n-gram approach to represent a document as a vector

12046214
g++	gcc
you need to use g++ instead of gcc

12046214
g++	gcc
generally speaking gcc is for compiling linking c while g++ is for c++

12046233
strlen	substr
functions like strlen and substr are probably more frequently used with bytes than actual text strings

12046242
jquery	simplemodal
simplemodal fails with jquery 1.8.0 and ie9 with the error

12046261
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

12046276
post	get
and you would get your post data already formatted like

12046286
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and firefox

12046322

12046388
implements	extends
i have a list of objects and those objects extends from a class you can also do it with interface and implementation i do it with extends for other reasons in common and that class have a method public view getview and the in all the classes that extends from the father class or implements the interface you override implements the method and add the code necessary to make that page look like you want then on the adapter you only need to have a list of objects of any of the classes that you created and depending on which type each of those objects are they will create the view passed to the viewpager

12046418
width	height
the issue there is that you can get the width and height after onwindowfocuschanged but if you try to add some views in it then you can t get that information until everything have been drawn

12046471
google-chrome	safari
this works in safari and in google-chrome

12046472
subtraction	addition

12046493
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
first of all the tags are new in html 5 which is not supported by ie so they will not work in internet explorer they should work fine in firefox 4+ google-chrome 3+ safari 4+ opera 9+ and any other html 5 enabled browser.

12046497
google-chrome	firefox
and as mentioned it work on firefox but not on ie and google-chrome

12046502
google-chrome	firefox
i think this happens because google-chrome handles cacheing a little differently than firefox

12046507
nant	opencover
i m using the -register user param when kicking opencover off in the nant script that doesn t help

12046522
spaces	delimiter

12046595
google-chrome	firefox
t return data in ie but does in firefox and google-chrome

12046651
pull	push
better yet instead of running them on a loop where an exception could kill all of them push each query as a job in a queue and have a subsystem that pull jobs form the queue and query google analytics

12046675
width	height
i have a map of a specific area with about 1600 km width and 600 km height and i will cover this entire area -which is not a straight shape like a rectangle or a square- with 1 km x 1 km square grids

12046685
int	chars
and will the assignment of int be more efficient then assignment using chars for the same chunk of memory since i would need to loop 4 times as many times if i use chars versus int

12046710
imagemagick	wand
you can easily do that using wand a simple binding of imagemagick for python

12046724
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

adplus	cdb
...otherwise adplus with the -pn option might be making cdb attempt to reattach to the already crashed process...which it can t because a debugger is already attached

12046802
put	get
put up taskmanager and see if you ever get multiple instances of your application showing up if you do then you might have to use the -p pid option instead to get adplus to monitor the right process...not ideal as you have to have started the process first in order to get its pid

i am using wix 3.5 with new major upgrade feature i am also using wixui_advanced to allow user to choose between per user default or per machine installation scope

12048032
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the major upgrade works fine with per-user installation scope when installing the newer versioning with the same per-user scope

12048032
versioning	upgrade
however when the old versioning was installed as per machine scope installing new versioning with per machine scope does not actually upgrade the old one to the new one

12048977
stdout	stderr
your current code is sending both stdout and stderr to dev null so i m kind of curious as to why anything is printed at all

12048977
stdout	stderr
the syntax means duplicate stdout descriptor 1 as stderr descriptor 2

12048977
stdout	stderr
in effect stderr is made into a copy of the current stdout

12048977
stdout	stderr
if you put first then stdout is first redirected to dev null and then stderr is pointed at the current stdout dev null

12048977
stdout	stderr
but if you put second stderr will first become a copy of the current stdout the normal output stream before stdout is redirected

12048977
stdout	stderr
so the command s stderr prints to the tty or the interpreter as if it came from stdout while stdout is silenced

12048994
stdout	stderr
time command prints result to stderr not to stdout

12048994
stdout	stderr
you should reroute stderr to stdout to achieve what you want

12049003

12049350
int	boolean
if what you want do is assign to a boolean the value of an int variable what you could do is a conditional stating that if the variable has a value of 1 then make the bool true or false otherwise

the tricky part would be to tell the keydown keyup not to execute its code if the other one just did

12049987
children	parent
so now that we know how to get the children from the parent and we need to provide tastypie with a queryset in its meta you need to write a custom queryset backed by a custom manager on the record model that takes all your records more here custom queryset and manager without breaking dry

12065716
getter	setter
it throws an attributeerror on setting badprop not because it doesn t yet know that badprop is a property rather than a normal attribute if that were the case it would just set the attribute with no error because that s now normal attributes behave but because you haven t provided a setter for badprop only a getter

12065716
getter	setter
if all you re doing in your getter and setter is redirecting read write access to an attribute of the same name but with an underscore prepended then by far the simplest thing to do is get rid of the properties altogether and just use normal attributes

12065716
getter	setter
python isn t java and even in java i m not convinced of the virtue of private fields with the obvious public getter setter anyway

12065716
getter	setter
if you later discover that you need to run some code whenever an attribute is read written you can make it a property then without changing your interface this is actually what descriptors were originally intended for not so that we could start writing java style getter setter for every single attribute

12065716
getter	setter
if each attribute has independent custom behaviour then there is no more efficient way to do this than explicitly providing a getter and a setter for each attribute

12065716
getter	setter
if you re running exactly the same or very similar code in every single getter setter and it s not just adding an underscore to the real attribute name and that s why you object to writing them all out rightly so

keydown	keyup
if you rely on hooking events up to the keydown keyup events to track the state of the keyboard...then this may not be so accurate

12076468
keydown	keyup
that s becuase you are relying on the message pumping to process and dispatch those keydown keyup messages....they may be delivered after the real keyboard state has changed again

12076468
keydown	keyup
also because when your bit of code that is interested in the keyboard state is running usually on the ui thread ...the keydown or keyup can t interrupt you...as they are dispatched on the ui thread too....that s why using getkeyboardstate or the keyboard.iskeydown should be used

this requires the use of getter setter methods but you avoid most of the portability problems since you re explicitly specifying both the bit and byte orders for everything

12077333

in this case the detail view is not rerendered because the objects displayed are the same with the same height and width

12077341

width	height
thinking about it i realized that maybe the best way to implement it is by loading a texture with every character needed just like a spritesheet getting the relevant data about it width height advance line skip... and when rendering it basically we would do it after all the other rendering on the scene we would need only one glbindtexture to print every string needed on the screen

12077753

viewdidload	viewwillappear
to solve your problem set the textlabel s text in viewdidload or viewwillappear

12082654
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i believe this is fixed in ios 6 but it won t be backwards compatible so if you want to support ios 5 still you ll have to use viewdidload or viewwillappear to update outlets which i think is better to do anyway

12082705

json requests are handled with respond_with as well but unlike the html requests actually return the requested resource and perform the requested action in the case of put post and delete

12083084
cvs	svn
this seems to differ in my mind from cvs svn branches where after i merge in a feature branch to the main branch i don t actually consider the feature branch as part of the main branch s history

12083084
cvs	svn
am i correct in thinking that the concept of a branch in git is different from cvs svn branches in this way -- obviously the implementation of them is completely different but is the concept of a branch in this way with respect to merging in a feature branch making that branch now part of the main branch history including all interim commits checkins to the branch the same or different between cvs svn and git

12083094
google-chrome	safari
it works fine on safari iphone google-chrome android and even in an android webview native app

can t you just show the loading gif first and when everything is done hide it

12083378
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	ironruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
in mri yarv mruby and tinyrb it is c code in rubinius it is c++ code in macruby it is objective-c code in jruby and xruby it is java code in rubygolightly it is go code in ironruby and ruby.net it is c# code in maglev and smallruby it is smalltalk code in cardinal it is pasm code

12083447

1 confirm you re on plone 4.2 - plone.app.theming is part of plone 4.2 so you don t need to reference in the buildout

hash	salt
i try to create a function that hash my password with salt using haval160 4 hashing algorithm

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m developing an app right now and it basically consists of 2 view controllers the first being a uitableviewcontroller embedded in a uinavigationcontroller the second being a completely custom one being built on a stock standard uiviewcontroller

12083668
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i ve noticed that on my uinavigationcontroller view when the device rotates the uinavigationbar and the uitoolbar both perform a cross-fade animation when transitioning to their landscape dimensions

12083668
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
for technical reasons i didn t use a uinavigationcontroller for my custom view controller but i manually added a uinavigationbar and a uitoolbar in the same places to it basically because i need those elements to be able to be overlaid on top of the background view as they can optionally be hidden and i wanted direct control to do that

12083673
fgets	strcmp
the next thing to be aware of is that fgets will retain the newline in your input so you ll need to address this in your usage of strcmp

12083683
range	max
the user program never sees the real physical address space it always deals with the logical addresses.as we have two different type of addresses logical address in the range 0 to max and physical addresses in the range r to r+max where r is the value of relocation register.the user generates only logical addresses and thinks that the process runs in location to 0 to max.as it is clear from the above text that user program supplies only logical addresses these logical addresses must be mapped to physical address before they are used

12083714
put	get
put your keys to an nsmutablearray will help you get last first key

12084047
getter	setter
one possible way would be to introduce getter setter methods for the private variables of your class

12084047
getter	setter
edit your question has the following comment about getter setter that i missed

12084047
getter	setter
if you really do not want to expose the realvector vector field i think what you can do is have getter setter methods for individual attributes of your realvector class

12084087
uiview	subviews
the custom cell in the real code is adding uiimageview and uilabel uiview on the other hand doesn t have contentview so we don t need to add subviews to its contentview

12084107
decltype	auto
so for example if you have a function that returns a reference auto will still be a value you need to get a reference but decltype will be exactly the type of the return value

12084107
decltype	auto
also see david rodrã guez s answer about the places in which only one of auto or decltype are possible

12084124
decltype	auto
in the cases where auto can be used it is more concise than decltype as you don t need to provide the expression from which the type will be inferred

12084135
children	parent
does not work -- probably because i am performing set algebra to remove children from parent

12084147

but if i add a double in after 3 int the size isn t what i expect

12084283
put	get
however when we put it on the live server the website we get 406 errors randomly occuring

12084325

12084602
matlab	simulink
i could go on the mathworks has many toolboxes for matlab there s simulink and its related products for which there really is no equivalent in octave yes you d have to pay for all that

12084622
client-side	server-side
if you re asking about whether it s more important to pre-compile templates used server-side as opposed to client-side it usually is simply because a server is going to have to render them potentially several thousand times a second so it s wasteful to have to compile them each time they re rendered

12084640
getter	setter
manually implementing the setter getter to set return mutable instances is probably wrong

12084654
post	get
is telling the recipient that a xml file for the post is created and you will get this from post_url post

12084663
ivar	subclassing
edit i went a little deeper and found out nsstring declares no ivar leaving absolute discretion to its subclassing as far as storage is concerned

if yes you should use xml serializable to save your own objects to xml and deserialization to read them back

12084703
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
attaching a uitapgesturerecognizer to a uiview provides very similar and additional extra variable number of taps functionality to a uibutton

12084721
afnetworking	sdwebimage
just use sdwebimage or afnetworking

12084721
afnetworking	sdwebimage
what that means is if the image downloader library sdwebimage or afnetworking has found an image in its cache then it will just get that one from disk rather than redownload the image from the web

12084721
afnetworking	sdwebimage
sdwebimage or afnetworking will essentially do all the hard work for you and make your table responsive

it should work with bmp or uncompressed tga images after reading the file header though

12085284
button	checkbox
for radio button and checkbox i want the control to the left of the label for all other inputs i want the control to the right

12085301
arp	icmp
in addition seeing arp being slower than icmp doesn t necessarily mean icmp isn t deprioritized---it might mean bandwidth is insufficient to hit the limiting threshold

12085339
children	parent
you just have to think about this situation not like get parent or get children but as about related elements

12085369
udp	tcp
rule of thumb would be for requests less then 512 bytes long to be transported over udp and for more then 512 bytes long over tcp

12085393
dataframe	multi-index
if i maintain a multi-index dataframe there is no problem and the values are represented correctly

12085403

this includes abs sign floor trunc round roundeven ceil fract mod modf min max clamp mix step smoothstep and a whole lot more.

12085540
free	malloc
another point stack and heap may not necessarily be the same heap is a higher level abstract for malloc free type constructs whereas stack is used for saving callee registers when just 4 registers are not enough or used to pass function arguments data structures and all you can imagine but stack is a bit harder to manage because you have to keep track of all the data by yourself instead of just allocating region to a pointer and then freeing it after you re done

12085552
instances	transient
when a or b have a different lifetime than transient a new instances for each request you should also register them

12085571
decoder	encoder
think of this as the bitstream buffer between encoder and decoder

12085571
post	get
the simple reason you will get lower latency is that you will get lower bitrate post encoding to send the data out and you can go to full framerate

12085571
udp	tcp
if you can use udp it will reduce latency quite a lot compared to tcp though it can be lossy at times depending on network conditions

12085605
google-chrome	firefox

you can even have a two-way communication between instances using both push and pull queues

12085848
width	height
how can have the framelayout width and height same as that of the imageviews

12085876
post	get
why not just wrap the entire table in a form and change get to post unless you know that you re not going to be sending more than the max amount of data a get request can send

12085885
google-chrome	firefox
the new problem is that the confirm message is displayed twice on firefox and non of google-chrome

12086198

consistency	acid
the expected acid properties of relational dbs defining proper transactions too restricts how scalability can be improved we have to choose between giving up scalability consistency or fault-tolerance -- and most of these tools give up consistency and therefore acid

12096376
consistency	acid
a new weaker set of requirements replacing acid is base basically avalilable soft state eventual consistency
