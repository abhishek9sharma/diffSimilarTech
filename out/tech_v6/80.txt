maven	pom.xml
i d also like to be able to easily use it with maven which it s also not set up for so i d like to include a maven pom.xml that describes its dependencies

maven	pom.xml
i looked at the layout of various mavenized jars and found that they seem to include the pom.xml in meta-inf maven groupid artifactid

12304609
jar	manifest.mf
i think but not 100 sure that i m probably misreading bnd s documentation on -include - it looks like it might be for including extra manifest directives in the resulting manifest.mf rather than including extra files in the jar

ant	maven
you must configure a lot of ant tasks maven target in order to build for specific environment

i m using jsf 2 without seam

12307702
jsf	seam
i could dive into the spring seam and struts examples but for a pure ee 6 developer it s a lot of overhead and with a better understanding of this issue i can produce a simple working jsf only example which i will make available to the socialauth team for use on google code

12307725
uiview	cashapelayer
you could assign your path to a cashapelayer such as wrapping it in a uiview subclass that returns cashapelayer as its +layerclass

12307737
openssl	gnutls
the subversion that comes with el 6 is linked against gnutls which is a change from older releases which linked against openssl

12307737
openssl	gnutls
you could also try building subversion from the source code and using openssl instead of gnutls in the configuration

12307743
actionscript	mxml
css styles are set a little differently in actionscript versus mxml

12307779
onresume	onpause
you may want to move your code to onpause and onresume respectively or maybe you shall use intentservice instead if you dot require any ui for the task

12307791
free	malloc
or use malloc but be aware that you ll need to free this memory later

12307863
cos	sin
finally another approach is to use a taylor expansion for cos theta and sin theta theta

im using ubuntu linux if its neccesary i might tommorow check kernel version mono 2.8.3 visual studio 2008 and project in .net 3.5

12308002
for-loop	loops
if i understand your question correctly you could just use a while loops instead of your for-loop like

12308018
width	height
the wrappings part works fine the box will drop to the next line when there is not enought width for it to fit however there is a gap between the first row element and the second row element if the height are different

12308079
versioning	upgrade
note i won t be able to update these versioning to the latest versioning available because multiple teams are using the old versioning of these files and they dont want to upgrade to the latest

onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup
i want to add an onclick onmousedown onmouseup etc. event to

12308088
public	protected
this option in turn breaks down in many possibilities making dootherthing public easy to test but not safe as we might not want to expose the internal substeps of the operation to the outside making it internal as alski points out making it protected virtual and using a partial mock in your test to the verify the collaboration between the 2 methods

12308133
int	chars
the reason why you get 49 is because it s a chars code of the 1 symbol and not it s int representation

12308193
srp	principles
it follows basic srp principles

12308242
int	chars
you get a chars chars from read not an int

12308254
post	get
i don t understand this as i ve seen many recommendations to use post for getting around url length limits when you have a lot of report parameters -- what s the point if it redirects to a get url

12308271
inherited	subclassing
you either need to use inherited to make b a subclassing of a so that a b is an a or use composition and then refer to the appropriate subobject

12308278
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you had an employees and departments table in your database with a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship then you would have appropriate foreign keys configured

12308282
int	chars
now that you have a string you can use int.parse or int.tryparse to turn a string containing entirely numeric chars into an int

12308400
oncreate	ondestroy
if i bind my service in the oncreate of an activity but i don t unbind it in onstop or ondestroy i get the error

flip	slide
from what i can make out you need to simply flip the loops that create the sides in the slideshow so that it makes the last slide where it was making the first

12308493
gridview	rowdatabound
i would bind the datatable to the gridview and handle via the rowdatabound event

12308508
iboutlet	ibaction
at this point i began to wire the iboutlet and ibaction in the pasted view in the new xib file

12308508

although i see the iboutlet in the file s owner and connect them properly the function for the ibaction is never called when i press the button

12308514
for-loop	arrays
and then i want to use a for-loop to generate the arrays names and output certain elements of the arrays and or the whole arrays itself like so.

12308537
percentile	max
very strange that you wish to do this on the client you could very easily sort and get the value of the 85th percentile on the server where you are actually sending the data from and use it as a max value for the y axis

12308554
jcheckbox	jpopupmenu
edit if you want to put this in a popup menu note that jpopupmenu is a jcomponent therefore you can put anything there including normal jcheckbox

12308633
expander	grid
you ve got the expander sitting it column #1 of a 2-column grid

12308633
expander	grid
just removing that auto should fix your problem and make the expander content fill 50 of the space available to the root grid

12308677
ostringstream	std
in c++ you ought to use std string for strings instead of char arrays and std stringstream and its cousins std istringstream and std ostringstream instead of sprintf or snprintf for formatting in string buffers

12308718
getter	setter
keep in mind getter and setter

12308753
width	height
1 width and height size image - i improved

12308755
base-class	subclassing
the subclassing might rely on its base-class s invariants to protect its own invariants and if the base-class constructor has not completed then its invariants may not hold

12308771
websphere	ibm
i know out of my head that apache activemq has ajax support and the same goes at least partially for ibm websphere mq as well as jboss hornetq

12308783

with list you need to convert to chars when using that example or you get the int coding of the factor variable

12308794
ant	maven
3 build tools like ant maven etc

12308813
min	max
i m trying to change where the pointers min and max are pointer to but it seems that the change is not sticking outside the function s scope after the function has run

before running the function i set min and max to point to a double m 0

12308815
uitableview	reloaddata
calls reloaddata only when you create a new instance of uitableview or

12308843
width	height
if you still want to use a null layout you have to set the width and height of the component not just its x and y position see the setsize method

12308852
versioning	upgrade
my advice is to not upgrade in-place but instead install the newer plone versioning to another directory create a new instance and copy the data.fs file from the old site over to the new one

12308856
pop-up	dialog
anoother way solve the issue of the keyboard type i would pop-up a native dialog with a textfield and set the keyboard type of this field to the one you need

12308866
min	max
send an array a pointer like thing to retain the min and max values

12308866
min	max
say minmax 0 min and minmax 1 max the values will change no

12308866
min	max
well sort of but you re asking for a pointer to the array element that is min and max not the actual value

12308866
min	max
but your caller appears to want the actual address within the array of the max and min values unless this was a mistake due to being new to pointers

12308900
integer	unsigned
look at the context property of gkscore - which is a 64-bit unsigned integer - that way you may be able to assign different values for the context for different levels and filter that data when you get the scores from leader boards this will probably require you to use your own ui to display high scores rather than the generic gkleaderboardviewcontroller - good luck and let me know how it goes

12309000
children	parent
you can add to the has_many relationship which would delete the children of the parent when the parent is destroyed

12309000
children	parent
you probably don t want to destroy the parent if just one of its children is destroyed right

12309015
post	get
if you don t get an answer please try and post back if i have time i ll do the same

12309043
width	height
in this i m using rectangles with no width height to mark the sides of the brick

in my case i just wanted to post the binary file directly with no multipart junk so i just put the include .

12309074
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in everything that i have been able to test firefox google-chrome opera safari

12309074
width	height
the reason why your original version would have been extending beyond the bounds in internet explorer is due to the difference between browsers when calculating a percentage width height of a child when padding is applied to the parent element

12309080
processors	hyperthreading
which leads me to believe there may be something wrong with my computer or something dealing with how my processors deals with threads due to its hyperthreading ability

12309115
getter	setter
having them defined by attr_accessor only guarantees that you ll have setter and getter and roseburg which has nothing to do with rails s mass-assignment checks

we re gonna try debugging step-by-step our offending code and checking the database profiling to detect which resources are being blocked at a given time

12309500
jsf	seam
i m using jsf 2 seam 2.2.2 tomcat 7 with eclipse ide

12309501

different behaviour in localy and on mobile browser i used usedialog is false and when i put it in mobile browser i get dialog

12309845
put	get
if you put just usedialog is true does not work if with is greater 400px then you should put usedialogforcetrue true and you will get dialog in all browser

12309851
hash	md5
it is hashing with the sha1 algorithm then combining that hash with then hashing the resulting combined string with the md5 algorithm

12309857
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
what it is doing is that it is concatenating the password with the sha1 hash version of it one of these is the salt then hashing it into an md5 value

you can convert the nsstring in an nsdata with lossy ascii encoding or utf-8 then you can use the method - nsdata bytes to get to the raw bytes

12310051
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
use a for-loop to loops through them 2 bytes at a time you can then either copy the two bytes characters you are upto into a char arrays of of size 3 3 to include the 0 make sure you initialize it with 00 to get a terminating 0 you can then use the c function

12310099
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox supported cover since the past couple of years at least

12310258
nsurl	nsstring
it still gives me for absolutestring i wonder is there any reliable way to compare to nsurl or one nsurl and one nsstring

12310258
nsurl	nsstring
convert the nsstring to nsurl and use the isequal method to compare two nsurl and hopefully nsurl s implementation of isequal can figure it out

12310264
folder	directory
three.js package is in the same directory as my html file and it s in a folder called three.js

12310277
prepare	execute
if you re going to use pdo you need to look at prepare and execute otherwise you re losing the security that pdo is offering and retaining the sql injections

12310345
udp	tcp
also there is no such protocol as tcp udp

12310345
udp	tcp
there is tcp ip sometimes just called tcp and udp ip sometimes just called udp

12310345
udp	tcp
for example http runs on top of tcp not udp and udp is considered unreliable but has less overhead so it s good for streaming

12310346
prepare	execute
other important things to look at are statement prepare and execute

hash	md5
for instance they could generate it using an md5 hash of the fully-qualified class name or a similar methodology used to handle duplicates in their rare occurrence which is i m sure what eclipse does when asked to generate the id anyway

12310465
hash	md5
the reason i would like to know because i am going to try to create an aspect in aspectj or other language that will add the serialversionuid field using an md5 hash and is able to handle collisions in a way that is acceptable to the api

12310465
post	get
i will post the results if i can get it working

12310519
profiling	instrumentation
when you run in instrumentation mode the profiling injects a bit of code at the entry exit points of every method to record the performance data

12310519
profiling	instrumentation
i ll assume it s a library in which case you need to specify your c# application as the start program -- so the profiling will start the c# app but will actually instrumentation and profiling the f# library

what i want to achieve is to create this cloud of buttons with hidden tex make them show but hide as soon i push another button

12310639
integer	unsigned
if a protocol specification stipulates that a 16-bit unsigned integer field exists then you d hold the value in a 32-bit signed integer and write out or read the raw bytes to from network streams on a per-byte basis

12310685

12310891
getter	setter
getter and setter are highly overused

12310891
getter	setter
iâ ve seen millions of people claiming that public fields are evil so they make them private and provide getter and setter for all of them

12310891
getter	setter
iâ m not in favor of public fields but against making a getter setter or property for everyone of them and then claiming that doing that is encapsulation or information hidingâ ha

12310891
getter	setter
it is when some side effect occurs within the property getter setter that the question is a little more difficult to answer

12312447
getter	setter
the synthesize keyword tells the compiler to synthesize a generic getter and setter method as opposed to you providing your own

12312447

12316966
serializable	deserialization
i tried to make the serializable and deserialization of a custom object using the code below

12316966
serializable	deserialization
if the taskproperty class is decorated with datacontract attribute and with datamember attribute for each property the deserialization is much faster than when it is decorated with serializable attribute

12316966
serializable	deserialization
using serializable attribute the deserialization is very slow it takes about 30 seconds

12316966
serializable	deserialization
furthermore if the deserialization is preceded by the serializable of an object of the same type obviously with different contents the serializable is slow while the deserialization is fast

12316966
serializable	deserialization
in a similar way if serializable is preceded by deserializing an object of the same type the deserialization is slow while the serializable is fast

public	protected
to allow subtypes of non-serializable classes to be serialized the subtype may assume responsibility for saving and restoring the state of the supertype s public protected and if accessible package fields

onresume	onpause
in your case i d register the receiver that handles connectivity changes dynamically in all of your activities in the onresume callback and unregister them in the onpause callback

12318341
width	height
you need to calculate find-out the space needed by your controls and then you ll have a value to set in the form height width

12318341
width	height
it works like a property grid but you can hook it to running .net programs and it show you everything properties value private field value object reference... so you can try to dig in the scrollbars object to see if you can find out your height width value

i d like points goto peehaa because if anyone else finds this question i want other people to also know that post redirect and get is a good coding practice

12318873
post	get
post to your inserting script redirect away from the page to a confirmation page and use get to get values to show

12318888
int	chars
but this code does not change 12 into int 12 and also gets chars in strings can pyparsing handle this value transformations

12318896

for-loop	arrays
then run a for-loop to check if the number is in the arrays

12319233
implements	extends
you cannot trust classes that extends you to create a single instance of themselves 1 even if you could somehow ensure that they all implements getinstance there is no way to tell that inside that method they check inst before constructing a new instance of themselves

12319264
google-chrome	firefox
this code is working fine in ie9 firefox 4.0 and latest version of google-chrome

12319266
mouse	keyboard
i can tab through the control and use the keyboard just fine but the control does not respond to mouse clicks the buttons don t even recognize when you hover over them

width	height
width height and other dimension-based media features all refer to the dimensions of either the viewport or the device s screen in screen-based media

12319284
box-sizing	border-box
if the padding is critical you might want to try setting box-sizing to border-box but i didn t notice anything other than the elimination of the rubber banding of your items

12319309
width	height
some improvements can be made e.g you can store the width and height values of the view in a local variable to avoid calling getwidth and getheight all the time but you can only do this in specific places like inside your activities onwindowfocuschanged callback otherwise getwidth and getheight will return 0

12319317
apache	nginx
first domain.com is a django apache server second f1.domain.com is a file server nginx

however where in vb6 or vb.net i have

12319466
google-chrome	safari
just for google-chrome and safari

12319468
affinity	processors	affinity	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
you can disable hyperthreading in the bios programmatically set processors affinity for your threads or set affinity from task manager if you want to experiment

12319470
width	height
for your problem just create a image with width and height equals half of width and height of your given image then set whatever pixel in wherever you want

12319494
google-chrome	safari
as you specified google-chrome and safari i ve used queryselectorall to find the initial inner dom element

12319500
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am thinking of creating uiview classes and adding all views to single horizontal uiscrollview so that when we are done with one view and click next button it slides to next view instead of creating multiple uiviewcontroller and use uinavigationcontroller to navigate to next page

12319533
subobject	instances
in my company we do enough work with jaxb that it was worth writing an xjc plugin which generated safe versions of every getter that were guaranteed to return non-null values for any non-trivial value immutable instances in the case that a subobject did not really exist

12319556
screens	mdpi
if you want to support multiple screens sizes you should provide also ldpi mdpi and xhdpi versions of your image

12319583
ssl	https

12319681
hash	salt
the purpose of a per record salt is to make the task of reversing the hash much harder

12319681
hash	salt
the encryption or hash creation always uses the latest salt algorithm but the decode verify function always uses the algorithm specified in the record

12319686
processors	hyperthreading
i was reading a book which says that a processors with single core and no hyperthreading can process only one process at a time so a doubt arises that when we do so many operations on a pc and also some background processes are always there then why not music player stops in between for short while

12319723
getter	setter
note that it doesn t help to have threadsafe getter setter for the dictionary if the items contained aren t threadsafe themselves

12319728
gridview	rowdatabound
i am trying to delete a row from a gridview based on a condition and then add than row to another gridview inside of the master gridview s rowdatabound event

12319757
ireport	subreports
from ireport any version everything works well but when i try to compile it from my java class the main report get compiled successfully but the subreports one doesn t get compiled cause the jaspercompilemanager doesn t find the subreport.jasper

12319757
ireport	subreports
so i compiled them with ireport 2.0.7 and used them compiled the only version working with my java class is the one compiled from ireport 2.0.7 problem there is no possibility of adding new band for another subreports

12319757
ireport	subreports
i compile subreports using ireport 2.0.7 and the main report i designed with ireport 4.5.1 containing many bands and many subreports and i compile the main report by the first code

the sound processors does not get its data directly from the cpu instead it reads the samples from one of these two buffers

12319921
google-chrome	firefox
this will also hide the other parts that are used in google-chrome and firefox from ie

12319921
google-chrome	firefox
the second stylesheet there will be used only if the browser is not ie so if everything displays correctly in google-chrome and firefox you can leave those rules untouched

in firefox google-chrome only works for empty tabs and tabs windows opened via window.open method as mentioned above

12319926

your concrete problem is caused because you re converting the incoming bytes to characters by using filewriter instead of fileoutputstream here

12319946
mvp	presenter
the mvp pattern is a must if you have any non-trivial logic because testing a gwt-free presenter is very quick and easy with junit whereas gwt tests have much more overhead and are much slower

12319946
implements	extends
each widget implements an interface that extends iswidget

12319946
implements	extends
if the widget is very simple i will have a single class that extends composite and implements the interface

12319946
implements	extends
there will be a presenter class that implements the public interface of the widget a view interface that extends iswidget that the presenter depends on and a view widget that implements the view interface

12319946
mvp	presenter
there are many files that get created for all the interfaces and implementations in mvp but the abstraction is absolutely worth it because they enable easy unit testing of presenter and allow you to change how the top-level interface financialchart in this example is implemented change from a single composite class to mvp with no client needing to change

12319949
ubuntu	linux
i was not able to reproduce this on my linux system ubuntu 12.04 intel i7-3770k quadcore ht see screenshots below

12320198
melt	reshape
both the function reshape melt and reshape2 melt result in the same error

12320222

my presumption is that the view controller s view is not in the window s view hierarchy at the point that it has been loaded when the viewdidload message is sent but it is in the window hierarchy after it has been presented when the viewdidappear message is sent

12320272
post	get
note this runs a get request not a post request but it does it in the background and runs efficiently

after much reading it seems that when people say browser engine they refer to the layout engine such as gecko or webkit

12321448
put	get
then on selectedindexchanged re-open and query again same query to get the names associated with that ssn and put those results into the textbox

12321539
public	protected
typically this type of problem is solved with a public function template and a protected virtual function taking in a type-erasure object

12321539
public	protected
otherwise you can still rely on a similar pattern of protected versus public functions

12321562
setinterval	settimeout
i think you want to do settimeout instead of setinterval

12321564

mouseup	mousedown
next add mousedown and mouseup events to the stackpanel

12321777

in the mousedown event attach a mousemove event handler to the stackpanel and have the panel capture the mouse so all mouse events will get handled by the stackpanel

12321777
mousemove	mouseup
in the mouseup event detach the mousemove event and release your mouse capture

12321814
post	get
you re passing in request.post even in the get stage of the view after the else when the post dictionary will be empty so naturally there will be validation errors

12321828
invokerequired	begininvoke
best practice is to always use invokerequired begininvoke

12321828
invokerequired	begininvoke
it invokes the tick handler on the ui thread and you don t have to bother with invokerequired begininvoke

12321832

12322445
integer	unsigned
this is an unsigned 32 bit integer type

12322445
integer	unsigned
your code could define word to represent an unsigned 64 bit integer if it chose

12322486
put	get	post	put	post	get
what happens is the constraint kind of fakes in the method so that this route will only match the default get post put and delete methods

one of the overloads for dbcontext takes an existing objectcontext

12322626
dbcontext	objectcontext
i thought this would allow me to wrap my existing objectcontext in a dbcontext and expose my existing entityobjects through idbset properties

12322626
inherited	properties
unfortunately when creating the dbcontext the idbset properties are not created and instead an exception is thrown with a message of verify that the type was defined as a class is not primitive nested or generic and does not inherited from entityobject.

12322626
dbcontext	objectcontext
is there no way to use a dbcontext with idbset exposing an existing objectcontext and entityobjects

12322626

versioning	upgrade
so once you upgrade to mountain lion upgrade your versioning of rails

12322905
versioning	upgrade
also if you install the upgrade you will have multiple versioning of ruby and rails on

12322912
hide	show
this is the code i added to show the new column and hide the previous

12322927
width	height
if anything still isn t resizing properly adjust its constraints so that its width and or height is no longer constant

12322927
put	get
for example if you put a button next to another button at the appropriate distance you ll get a blue line across that distance and if you drop it you ll create a constraint that those two buttons must remain that distance from each other

12322948
put	get
you can put a limit 1 clause at the end of the query to only get the first row which has the biggest value of difference

12322993
post	get
the model the view is bound to is the model that is expected to be procesed on an post action and is the model that i want to assign the value on the view or on the previous get action

12322993
post	get
i just want to pass a value a from get action to view assign model.a a and then process the model with a attached to it on post action

12323039
puts	gets
but since we don t know what it is we can create a spring factorybean which just gets locationrepository from the app context via autowiring and puts it back into the app context under a new name

12323040
sorting	filtering
the biggest downfall of this approach is it s complexity and the risk that my own sorting filtering algorithm won t match sqlite s

12323056
public	protected
so this won t let you circumvent public get but protected set properties you can t make a property only initialized via this method

12323068
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade the dotnetcharting to the latest versioning 7.0 and now it works fine

12323101
folder	directory
i want to read from a text file which is saved in a folder in my working directory

12323107
getter	setter
when i compile my program without and getter or setter on the addparam method

12323107
getter	setter
so i defined some getter and setter methods for the arr parameter within the m_model class member

12323112
width	height
basically i have a generic list of products with length width and height properties

12323123
background-image	background-position
an alternative would be to use gwt s sprite system to generate a background-image on which you will be able to override the background-position property

12323145
google-chrome	firefox
after a conversion post appending this table using innerhtml works great in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

12323145
google-chrome	firefox
the result shows its image in firefox and google-chrome in the table jobheaderresults

12323215
nsstring	nsdata
then convert nsdata to nsstring

12323221
width	height
you have total control on height width and alignment

12323271
folder	directory
first write the directory and then the subsequent folder with double slashes in between till you reach the text file

12323297
int	chars
since int do in fact have an upper boundary i have to convert it into a string before parsing it using apostrophes to denote each set of three chars placed into a sub-string

12323302
getter	setter
i envision my data classes having typical getter and setter as well as calculate methods these calculate methods will take vars from the data class and do some meaningful business logic on them returning the result is this a good idea

12323317
vim	emacs
also i do not want to use something like visual studio i want this to be installed simply so i can create c++ projects using editors like vim and emacs

12323331
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the short answer is no you can t just use setenv dev 1 in httpd.conf and then use ifdefine to detect it in your .htaccess which would seem intuitive and reasonable based on the syntax and nature of programming logic any of us are used to

12323378
versioning	upgrade
the adt stop compiling my app nothing else changed reading a lot seems that this upgrade was the problem one of the most important think its that i didn t find how to downgrade the java versioning o fix this issue can t update to the java se 7 because android its based on java se 6 more accurately on apache harmony that doesn t support completely java se 6

12323391
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie8 and ie7 work fine safari google-chrome firefox are all ok

12323434
serializable	deserialization
i m using mythz s servicestack.text package version 2.9 typeserializer for serializable and deserialization to deep-copy objects in a cache

this is true for ieee double precision and 32 bit int but it s not actually guaranteed by the c standard

12323453
post	get
i used this stackoverflow post just a few days ago to get video uploads to work correctly

12323476
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
while this works for selecting it in ie firefox google-chrome safari and opera it won t let you edit it by clicking a second time in firefox google-chrome and safari

12323482
intersect	contains
using the google maps javascript v3 api s editable polygons and or drawing library is it possible to somehow prevent the user from creating complex polygons where two or more of the contains polylines intersect each other

12323499
sorting	grouping
since doing a decile computation requires sorting the data and then dividing that sorted data into grouping it seems like the mpp structure of netezza would handle this very well

12323542
oncreate	ondestroy
if you override oncreate you must also override ondestroy

12323542
onresume	onpause
if you override onresume you must also override onpause

12323542
oncreate	ondestroy
would your app crash if you implement oncreate but omit to implement ondestroy say

12323562
folder	directory
i need to copy it to c program files 86 program folder directory

12323570
onresume	onpause
typically if you re handling something in onpause you re probably also going to handle the inverse operation in onresume

12323579
partition-problem	np-complete
this is the balanced partition-problem which is np-complete

12323603
oncreate	ondestroy
would your app crash if you implement oncreate but omit to implement ondestroy say

12323603
oncreate	ondestroy
many programmers open their databases in oncreate but forget to close them in ondestroy

12323611
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
another solution to this problem is to modify sudoers file and add your account to it and state that you should never be asked for the sudo passwd

12323611
sudoers	visudo
i would suggest reading the man page for sudoers and visudo before going this route

12323650
war	manifest.mf
when war is created it has manifest.mf file with the default content

12323650
war	manifest.mf
so when the war is created it should also have build revision number head revision number of svn and the manifest.mf in the war should look like this

12323729
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox google-chrome safari all validate the form perfectly fine

12323745
mouseup	mousedown
i m trying to replace the text of the lastclick div on the mouseup and mousedown events but this code is not working

12323827
mouseleave	mouseenter
the way hover works is that the first function is executed when the mouseenter and the 2nd is executed when the mouseleave

12323835
int	double
to go from a big int to a double just do it the same way you parse numbers

12323835
int	double
to go from a double to a big int do it the same way but in reverse starting with the most significant portion

12323856
rational-numbers	fractions
the api z3_mk_numeral expects a string which encodes a rational-numbers in decimal format 1.3 or fractions format 1 3

12323870
integer	unsigned
you don t say explicitly but i assume your library is integer only and the unsigned longs are 32 bit and binary not decimal

12323870
multiplying	add
for each of the unsigned long ints in your bignum multiplying by the current multiplier and add it to the result then multiplying your multiplier by pow 2.0 32 4294967296.0 for 32 bits or pow 2.0 64 18446744073709551616.0 for 64 bits

12323870
int	double
you need to use 2 even if the number of bits in your int type is larger than the precision of a double since the number of used bits in the most significant value might only be 1

12323882
google-chrome	firefox
but the problem came when i tested it in firefox and google-chrome

12323890
textmate	sublimetext
coda ships with it and there exist textmate and sublimetext plugins several of the core team members use sublimetext and i hear it s pretty good.

12323944
put	get	post	put	post	get
is there an easy way to add an httpmethod get put post delete... column to the fiddler display

12323972
integer	unsigned
first convert the most significant integer s into an unsigned long long

12323972
int	double
for converting from a double to a biginteger first seperate the mantissa into a double m and the exponent into an int e using frexp

12323972
multiplying	add
if performance is a concern you can add an overload to your bignum class for multiplying by which simply returns

12324058
google-chrome	firefox
this works well in firefox but google-chrome seems to ignore the 5 part and renders it just like it was 700

12324060
int	chars	int	double
it should operate on chars int floats and double

12324069
sudo	passwd
you can save file with some anonymous name then pass into stdin of sudo the user passwd like

12324080
ord	chr
setup the end point to decode the strings coming from js as unicode then re-encode them as bytes in python it would be something like .join chr ord ub for ub in your_unicode_string

12324147
width	height
you are not putting target s and owner s width and height into calculation

12324154
children	parent
i have a parent class implementing inotifypropertychanged and the parent class has multiple children

12324184
google-chrome	safari
tested working in ie8 ie9 google-chrome 21 ff10 ff15 and safari version 5-ish ipad3 ios 5.1.1

12324262
pull	push
depending on your push fetch pull habits then you can either use the gitk viewer to see what you know locally including the remotes you have fetched or you can use the network capability on github to see what it has

12324305
bash	subshell
bash -f option turns off globbing at the right time - when bash subshell is first invoked meaning before parameters are parsed

12324330
pseudo-class	visited
then you won t need to specify the link and visited pseudo-class since you can basically guarantee that all your remaining elements are links

12324386
subset-sum	np-complete
then your problem is equivalent to choosing signs for the d_i to minimize the sum which is equivalent to finding a subset of the d_i which sum to half the total sum which is equivalent to subset-sum which is np-complete

12324404
perl	tcl
its claim to fame is that it was written in c especially for perl not a port from tcl or bindings to something else

12324448
gtk	gio	gtk	gdk	gtk	cairo	gdk	gio	gdk	cairo

post	get
rcurl greatly simplifies the process of interfacing r programs with web services and provides simple functions to perform common http calls such as post and get

12324627
rcurl	httr
users may also be interested in the httr package which provides a further simplified wrapper around rcurl for common requests

12324628
rcurl	libcurl
rcurl is an r package that provides an r-friendly wrapper for the libcurl c library

12324645
children	parent
you could get differing results depending on what else has changed not changed in the parent object and other children in the parent.children collection

12324647

children	parent
i m trying to use jquery ui to set up a system of nested sortable lists but i don t want children becoming parent and vice versa

12324713
move	drag	children	parent
the borders make it a bit hard to see but in the fiddle you can drag the children up to the parent level and then can t move them back

12324713
children	parent
you also can t move the children from the first parent to the second

12324825
uiview	subviews
also make sure that the textfield is a subviews of the uiview

12324827
inherited	properties
however you could argue that those properties should then be part of the parent and inherited by the child

12324827
children	parent
given that your validation rules will be stored in a db you could write a method in the parent that would allow the children to retrieve the validation rule s for their properties

12324915

post	put
all code in this post is put under bsd license so feel free to use it for your projects

12324998
accessor	properties
the problem here is that jackson consider jsonignore here to mean ignore properties error whereas you are probably only hoping to ignore that particular accessor

12325007
ddms	adb
open eclipse window preferences android ddms change adb connection time to 90000+

12325071
width	height
puts you in the middle then you apply a fixed width and height and set margin-top and margin-left to negative a half of that width and height

12325094
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome

12325100
guard	autotest
i like the guardfile setup of guard i don t know where the watchers are in autotest

12325102
width	height
in order to center something with fixed positioning then you will need to know the height and width of the element

12325102
width	height
you then just need to margin-top and margin-left to negative half of the width and height in order to center it

12325102
width	height
this class would center and element that has 100px height and 200px width

12325102
width	height
if you don t know the height and width of the element that needs to be centered ahead of page load then you ll need to use javascript to detect the size

12325130
vbscript	vba
if you have worked with vba .net vbscript or any other language to work with excel many of these excel methods will look the same

12325167

the program runs in visual studio 2010 and the odd thing is that there are two folder on that drive in the same directory and the error only occurs for one folder

12325170
mouse	keyboard
i don t know if there s a library for java that allows you to record keyboard mouse inputs and then replay them however you can use java.awt.robot to script any mouse keyboard behavior

12325170
mouse	keyboard
the only software that i ve used that allows you to record keyboard mouse inputs and then play them back to you is ibm functional tester

12325196
subtract	add
you have set although you have 6 numbers and you have so if you calculate it only runs the loop 3 times because if you add the -- before the operator it will first subtract 1 and then compare

12325206
min	max
you are really having a problem finding the min max and middle of three numbers

12325296
width	margin
set your total width for each left-floated child div to the correct fraction using for left or right margin or padding so that they equal 100

in google-chrome and safari it all works ok but in ie firefox not so much

12325470
accessor	properties
that d be useful if you want your data objects to include methods beyond just the accessor for the entity s properties

12325479
public	protected
oh i see you need a constructor that has more access than protected but less than public

12325519
google-chrome	firefox
i am testing in google-chrome and firefox

12325529
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
three of them are regular uiviewcontroller but one is a uinavigationcontroller

12325579
width	height
the formula is area height width and so that is what i have entered

12325579
width	height
however the outcome is not actually answering height width

12325592
width	height
the behavior of double.parse is deterministic so you are assigning the same value to height and width

12325618
.htaccess	httpd.conf
all resources i am looking into mention either php.ini or .htaccess or httpd.conf files for setting configurations and stuff

12325629
width	height
re assigning the height value to temporary then assigning the width value to temporary

12325684

google-chrome	firefox
here s a drag and drop from desktop to browser using jquery firefox and google-chrome

12325710
intersect	contains
you can write it by yourself just remember that two areas intersect if their areas overlay not just when one contains the x and y coordinates for which you are testing

12325710
intersect	contains
it already has contains and intersect methods you need

12325744
width	height
assuming you have an class named box with three parameters length width and height and that you have created a strongly-typed collection containing instances of this class

12325752
inherited	properties
if invoice inherited transaction then it is a kind of transaction and the compiler requires it to inherited all of its properties

12325774
public	protected
you can hide the transaction as a protected or private member of the invoice and expose manipulate it using the public properties of invoice

12325783
pop-up	dialog
and a dialog pop-up telling me that it can t rename the folder and what to try to get it to work

12325791
accessor	properties
in javascript it seems like using properties accessor is not all that common unlike in other oo languages such as java for example

12325791
getter	setter
even in a dynamic language i think the principles of using getter and setter apply the same way they do to statically typed oo languages encapsulation adding validation restricting access etc

12325834
accessor	properties
javascript has intercept-able properties accessor

12325861
post	get
it requires you to get accustomed to working with those technologies -- forms get post requests and ajax

12325872
getter	setter
it is not necessary to use getter and setter with prototypal structure as you can simply set an object by well setting it to a value and get it by calling it as a value

12325882
post	get
so option two would not be a good fit for millions of comments i ve never seen a site with a million of comments per post but reddit does get over 5k for popular post

12325893
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

12325893
put	get
it doesn t protect not really and what you put in is what you get out

12325893
put	get
on the other hand i m rather fond of methods that put information in then get information back out

12325893
getter	setter
what is the point of hiding it behind getter and setter

12325893
getter	setter
you don t play with getter and setter

12325903
jlabel	jlayeredpane
for that i tried with a jlayeredpane in the gridlayout and put two images jlabel in a different level

12325910
inherited	base-class
my recommendation in order to reduce the amount of code duplication would be to create a base-class that each specialized class will inherited from where the base-class contains all the methods and members that will not change depending on the type that the class is instantiated with

12325912
folder	directory
in a file in which folder in the directory tree

12325918
for-loop	arrays
so i would like to extend it assigning pointers of real components to elements of an arrays to them work with all of them with a for-loop

12325932
google-chrome	firefox
the explanation why it worked fine in google-chrome and firefox but failed in ie though is much more interesting

12325932
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox will spit out a reference error warning right where it belongs - at line

12325947
int	chars
since there is no way to call nextchar i am not sure how i am supposed to read an input which could either be 2 int separated by a white space or a chars

12325991
children	parent
almost every example i ve seen involves only 1 parent with multiple children

12325991
children	parent
notice how in family echo parent nodes are spaced out properly depending on how many children they have so as not to collide with other surrounding nodes

12326040
daemon	cron
but when i put it on the crontab i instead got an email from the cron daemon saying

12326041
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have a website that was originally designed for enclosed intranet use under ie 7 8 and is now needing to be running on the web which means making adjustments for firefox safari and google-chrome

12326041
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
how differently do safari and google-chrome render sites from ie and firefox

12326056
pull	push
and if the linq provider doesn t support the max or contains though it should then it ll pull eveything client-side and that s a lot of data to push over the wire

12326059
inherited	properties
basically i want to know if there is a better solution to hiding the backing value of a properties than the use of inherited as shown

12326059
inherited	properties
solution using inherited and protected properties with private backing value

12326063
next	except
this doesn t bother me except now for some reason the db has been adding new entries to these empty spots so the count vs what is actualy their is off and this causes the highest value s next to point to a higher value than what actually exists since it is over the total count keep in mind that even its id is over the total count.

12326094
width	margin
margin auto + width x where the width of .project_content is calculated and x is the calculated width

12326094
width	margin
how do i get my script to pick a random variable for each instance of project_content and how can i add the margin auto + calculated width into the mix

12326095
spaces	delimiter
the following example uses a spaces as the delimiter

12326101
width	height
i tried supplying a height and the code doesn t compensate for the width of the scroll bar

12326120
width	margin
to add margin and width into the mix you can no longer use css since you need to modify one of multiple properties but you can do it using .each

12326147

having read the wordpress docs and done some research it seems as if the advice on how to get the last 10 post on a wordpress site is to do the following

12326471
yacc	bison
a generic parser in the style of yacc lex bison or a static analyzer somehow relaxed to tolerate code in the process of writing able to make sense of javadoc-style comments

so i m writing a relatively simple program that prompts the user for a command add subtract etc and then prompt for numbers to complete that operation

12326589
subtract	add
everything is written and it compiles fine but when i enter a command in add subtract etc. it isn t comparing it properly

12326809
ciimage	uiimage
after i finished i wanted to cleanup the relatively lengthy code and noticed that instead of going from the filter s outputted ciimage to a cgimage and then a uiimage i could go directly from a ciimage to uiimage using uiimage s imagewithciimage method

12326809
ciimage	uiimage
my understanding of this is that making a uiimage from a ciimage results in a null cgimage property in the uiimage which is used in drawinrect

12326809
ciimage	uiimage
if so is there a better way to display a ciimage than to go through cgimage followed by uiimage

12326812

for-loop	arrays
to give you an idea of what i was trying to do i was attempting to enter the words into a string sentence then break that string up into individual words in an arrays words then run a for-loop to compare the strings to each other by comparing the lengths to the entries in the arrays

12326958
profiling	debugging
in addition a cool plugin called debugging queries is useful for tracking down performance issues although the wordpress profiling above actually does track queries too

12327281
width	height
the mosaic has rows and columns of the same width and height

12327281

by default the 32-bit jdk will install into program files x86 and a 64bit jdk will install into program files

12327364
prepare	execute	prepare	pdostatement
when constructing a pdo prepare statement we use the array keys to specify placeholder names instead so we can pass the array directly to pdostatement execute

12327366
g++	gcc
with gcc g++ you can do something like

12327412
width	margin
once the design drops to an iphone for some reason the width of the top elements logo menu has some margin padding or is only approx 80 width

12327423
width	height
my end goal here is to resize the input image to 100px width 125px height

12327423
width	height
i ve tried compositing the resized image into an empty newimage with the set width and height but it just seems to overwrite the dimensions regardless of the composite type setting the gravity to center and then the extent to 100x125 has no effect it always sits at 0 0 and trying to set the y offset to 125-imageheight 2 resulted in an offset that was way more than it should have been

12327439
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested it on google-chrome safari and firefox btw and they all do not work i m on a mac so i can t test it on ie

12327492
button	checkbox
after user selects some particular checkbox and clicks the send button

12327510
division	addition
it will return a 0 if there are no errors and -1 if an error occurred in the case of addition there wouldn t be many errors - but division for example divide by 0 would be an error

12327580
superclass	subclassing
the standard argument for making immutable classes final is that if you don t do this then subclassing can add mutability thereby violating the contract of the superclass

12327580
superclass	subclassing
if you take this argument to its logical extreme then all methods should be made final as otherwise a subclassing could override a method in a way that doesn t conform to the contract of its superclass

12327589
for-loop	loops
i have also made this program using for-loop but i want to get matrix n x y without using loops operations

12327621
direct3d	directx
i am not familiar with slimdx but in native directx if you want to draw a quad in screen coordinates you should define the vertex format as translated that is you specify the screen coordinates directly instead of using direct3d transform engine to transform your vertex

12327648
multiplying	add
for example if we are multiplying two bit-vectors x and y of size n then we must add n zero bits to x and y to make sure that the result will not overflow

12327654
rss	feed
full story i am modding the markup of my blog s rss feed for google currents and for the app to display image galleries in articles as slideshows the markup of my feed should look like this

12327654
rss	feed
but due to the way my wordpress blog works the galleries are shown within the article which is usual which means the same happens in the rss feed as well

12327654
rss	feed
so i am wondering if i can do it like this and it d still be valid rss feed

12327671
rbenv	homebrew
there s also rbenv and ry as alternatives to rvm but i just use 1.9.3 across all my apps so homebrew is fine.

12327679
put	get
i started out with multiple files and decided to put it all in one main.cpp file for now just to get it working

12327707
free	malloc
but with a normal malloc free mismatch i would expect all the memory to return when the program terminates

12327707
free	malloc
can there be a malloc free mismatch that will lose memory permanently even after the process completes

12327716
opera	safari
i am testing in windows opera safari 2 firefoxes+firebug ie+f12 and two androids

12327720
width	height
here s a working example that will capture the height and width of the image and assign it to a variable

12327779
free	malloc
can there be a malloc free mismatch that will lose memory permanently even after the process completes

12327779
free	malloc
no malloc and free and even mmap are harmless in this respect and when the process terminates the os suse linux in this case claims all their memory back unless it s shared with some other process that s still running

12327779
free	malloc
like malloc free and mmap files opened by the process are automatically closed by the os

12327779
disk	ram
writes to disk or mmap may be cached for a while in ram

12327816
free	malloc
malloc free work on the heap

12327821
for-loop	loops
on the next loops you see the output you want because as previously the j defined inside the for-loop is referred but as you have initialized the value of j local to the for-loop with the same value of the j outside which has nothing to do with the j inside the for-loop hence you get the second output in your question

12327830
hide	show
it is a common requirement and you can very will jcheckbox extend a to some jfoocheckbox which has the foo object in it and a listener should take care of the show hide of foo

12327836
post	get
so change your type to from post to get

12327850
width	height
place the image inside a with the width and height set to your desired size overflow set to hidden and position is either absolute or relative

12327850
width	height
essentially this figures out how much it would need scale the image to make the width fit and to make the height fit then picks the larger of the two so the image fits on one side and overflows on the other

12327864
src	attr
#frame attr src source

12327893
width	height
fyi createcontrol uses twips one 1440th of an inch for left top width and height

12327901
width	height
style issue your code would only have worked with a linear axis as you convert width and height via a single call to xscale yscale instead of calculating the absolute coordinates in domain space first then convert both via scale to calculate the width height in output space

12327901
width	height
if you want faster code instead you need to prepare your data so that the output will produce valid svg here processed input x 80 y 80 w 10 h -60 in particular positive values for width and height or similarly x2 x1 and y2 y1 for

12327935
cos	sin
first take a look at coordinates for my javascript game - based on an angle when do i use sin cos and tan

12328232
for-loop	loops
therefore row + 1 two so when you enter the second for-loop again it will loops until hit hits two

12328240
jline	readline	bash	tcsh
people familiar with the readline editline capabilities for modern shells such as bash and tcsh will find most of the command editing features of jline to be familiar

12328243
serializable	deserialization
i think i can use the reflectionmodelservices class to create import export definitions but that still leaves the serializable and deserialization parts

12328247
post	put
i m trying to use django tastypie to allow an implementor to post put data to create models that are related several levels deep

12328335
superclass	subclassing
for your first question subclassing can call superclass constructors with a call to super

int	boolean
public abstract boolean committext charsequence text int newcursorposition

12328489

post	get
in the pseudo-code i m assuming that you get a row_array with the getcomment function that this comment is the head of all the comments like the initial post

12328600
matlab	simulink
as far as interfacing with arduino is concerned there is a support package from the mathworks that allows you to interface matlab code and simulink models with arduino

12328600
matlab	simulink
the only other general suggestion that i have is to consider using simulink for this project rather than matlab

12328633
screens	tablet
abd there is difference in screens size of both the image which is perfect on mobile is became very small on tablet

12328666
screens	tablet	screens	mdpi	tablet	mdpi
speaking about density motorola xoom also uses mdpi drawables so to differenciate drawables between tablet and small phones you should use folders with respect to screens sizes

12328666
screens	tablet
phone screens size is usually treated as normal and a 10-inch tablet is xlarge so drawable-xlarge-mdpi is the folder name you should use to place drawables for 10-inch tablet

12328673
tablet	mdpi
you could use the mdpi folder with a single image of high enough resolution for the tablet then let android scale it for smaller devices using the scale properties of an imageview

12328678
folder	directory
i ve installed nose already using pip but when i run nosetests in the directory above the tests folder i get the error

how can i set the processors affinity of a particular thread in microsoft .net

12328752
affinity	processors
.net provides the ability to access native operating system threads using the system.diagnostics.processthread class and this class has the ability to change the thread s processors affinity using the processoraffinity property

12328752
affinity	processors
this makes it possible to set the thread s processors affinity with the following code to be called from inside the thread

12333541
min	max
but then someone might write something that exceeds the max min values like 10000000 1000000 1000000 or someyhing like that and then the program should be all like hold up that s way too high

12333558

if you are implementing comparator interface then you can use only compare method but you are trying to access comparator method of comparable which you didn t implement

12333760
move	drag
from the description of your problem it sounds like a drag and drop interface where you can select multiple elements and move them

12333760
move	drag
you have three events start move and end in drag and drop it looks lik this

12333778
width	height
i have a drawpos essentialy being 0..1 and multiply that with the display width and height

12333778

innodb	myisam
it appears that i have a choice of 2 database engines - myisam or innodb

12333785
innodb	myisam
i know that i can build a relational database with innodb storage engine however as far as i can see i cannot build a relational database with the myisam storage engine as i cannot link the tables

12333785
innodb	myisam
do most people use myisam or innodb

12333798
portrait	landscape
in my case needed to rewrite the gui skeleton and i had portrait landscape requirements

12333798
portrait	landscape
solution 1 create different xib for landscape and portrait

12333798
portrait	landscape
storyboard or xib it is almost the same for me there can be 2 uiviewcontroller and pop push the portrait landscape to not fill the stack with rotations

12333834
innodb	myisam
there are a lot of resources discussing the pros and cons of myisam vs innodb mdash

12333853
put	get
this is working fine for the get presentaciones requests but when i try to make a put request i m getting a 403 forbidden

12333868
lan	localhost
it probably has to do with binding to localhost instead to the actual lan interface 192.168.1.x or all interfaces sometimes referred as 0.0.0.0

12333886
mouseover	mouseenter
however since you only want the event to occur when fist entering the div is there a reason you don t want to use mouseenter instead of mouseover

12333899
integer	unsigned
the format specifier lu is for an unsigned long integer

12333913
boost	stl
using stl boost to initialize a hard-coded set vector int

12333922
typedef	struct
i am trying to pass a typedef struct pointer to a function and the compiler is complaining with this error message error unknown type name â rootpâ

12333938
typedef	struct
i would instead declare the struct root_st and have typedef struct root_st root

12333951
ubuntu	debian
you can easily install it like that debian ubuntu

12333956
width	height
try the code below it should adjust the surface holder to be the same width and height of the screen size

12333977
kde	gnome
it is unlikely that you can reliably determine this especially if the user is not using the same desktop kde versus gnome versus unity

12333989
mouseleave	mousedown
in spite of the fact that the jquery documentation says to use mouseleave instead of blur i found that in ie7 when i moved the mousedown the drop down list it would get a mouseleave event but not a blur

12334028
width	height
please note that i do not want to set my image s width height since i want the image to be in its actual size and the parts outside the div should not be displayed

width	height
simply give your wrapper 100 width and height

12334109
width	height
okay so i learned that the list should be in a container and that i should give it a width and a height

12334114
post	get
i can post my code but it s complicated so let s see what kind of responses i get first

12334123
codeigniter	yii
my advice is to stick a bit with vanilla php vars operators loops conditions core functions then pick a framework symfony zend framework yii codeigniter and follow its conventions and principles

12334145
multiplying	transpose
before mapping a single point we need to append a 1 to the point to be mapped and transpose it so we have column vector and then map by multiplying it by the transformation matrix

12334199
put	get
i d like to put it into an array and simplify and shorten my code that is where i get lost

12334199
put	get
this is the only way i ve been able to get it to work but i know that these can be put into an array i just can t figure it out

12334208
post	get
i hope this helps people and i don t get down-voted for the post because i really couldn t find it with any searching

12334220
portrait	landscape
this way it takes care of not only landscape versus portrait but also makes universal apps especially if there s ever other devices with different screen sizes in the future easier too

12334243
touchesbegan	touchesended
then in the main file like i said just override those touch methods touchesbegan touchesended etc to play that custom property you can pass in that we defined in the header file

12334284
jax-ws	jax-rs
jax-rs jax-ws

12334300
width	height
you should set the bar height not width

12334305
next	except

when i save an image i check the image s width and height

12334346
bower	npm
bower npm requirejs bower webpack gruntjs gulp

12334356
yacc	bison
the parser created by yacc or bison sometimes uses default reductions -- states where it can reduce a rule without having to read the next token first

12334370
textview	imageview
however if you want to set a static same image for all the row items then you may define your custom resource xml for the row with a textview and imageview or comppund drawable-textview inside and pass it to your default adapter when initializing

12334379
hash	md5
it seems that the default choice for this kind of thing is an md5 hash

12334379
hash	md5
are there any problems with using a hash function such as cityhash or spookyhash for this purpose or should i just stick with md5

12334389
ppl	tbb
oh and ppl tbb are fair game too

12334390
for-loop	loops
for the second loops you re using myarray.count as the end condition for the for-loop but myarray.count is decreasing by one each iteration of loops because you re removing the last object from myarray each iteration

12334430
post	put
in post body put

12334432
datediff	difference
now that we have the consecutive dates beside each other we can take the date difference via datediff between the two

12334438
getter	setter
every property that you can use in the original code would have a getter and setter

12334438
getter	setter
in the transformed code there would also be a version number of the property and additional code added to the getter and setter

12334438
getter	setter
the deuce framework in the paper above shows how to change all your getter and setter by injecting new java bytecode into your classes at load time

12334438
getter	setter
specifically with deuce your source code objects can have simple getter setter pairs but transformed classes at runtime have enriched getter setter which do the bookwork

12334446
backslash	double-quotes
backslash or double-quotes without having to use special codes or

12334452
put	get
so i am building this form in symfony 2.0 and for some reason when i retrieve a object from the db and put it into an object it is gone when i want to save it so i get the following error

12334460

i used for methods such as equals hashcode and tostring

12334483
width	height
there is quite a difference between the wpf actual height width versus the rect.height width it may take some calculations to get the exact sizes you want

12334483
width	height
and in the op s code i changed the height and width target properties accordingly

12334483
width	height
when i changed the order in which i was adding the animations to the storyboard sb.children.add instance i got the height animating with no width

12334569
width	height
if i set mappanel height and width i can see it in tabpanel but it can t fill tabpanel because i set it height and width.following code

12334569
width	height
but when i clean height and width in mappanel options i can t see it in tabpanel

12334626
width	height
note checks all tags because the second or even third target locations might need padding if the window has a large vertical height and or a large horizontal width

12334666
button	checkbox
in the settings form users can set a hotkey by clicking a button checkbox with appearance set to button then the button text is set to that key

12334681
bash	zsh
i ve been to their site where they tell you how to do it within bash but i don t understand how to do it within zsh

i ve got this piece of code to search the contents of html elements with the class widget and use the jquery functions fadein and fadeout to only show elements that match the search term

12334765
google-chrome	firefox
the creator uses firefox and i have tried it in both firefox and google-chrome and it does nothing at all

12334847
rsa	aes
for this reason and because it is expensive to perform rsa encryption decryption rsa is mostly used in combination with a symmetric primitive such as aes - in the case of aes a random aes symmetric secret key is encrypted instead of the plain text

12334851
folder	directory
a simple function to sort the php scandir results by files and folder directory

12334866
put	get
so if your orderby is simply formatting the data to be friendly to view put it at the end after you have trimmed your collection if your looking for the first value of a sorted collection then maybe you would need it before the collection is iterated to get the first

12334918
libstdc++	libc++
i ve done exactly that for for vs libstdc++ and libc++ here

12334923
hide	show
what this does is change the width of the image to show hide the arrow

12334964
button	checkbox
the function is called with a form button .addtomailer is the class for all of the checkbox and #addresses is the form id

12334969
post	get
post can have multiple categories so i store them in posts_categories using post and category id when i get results from database using below query it just display the last category is it possible to display all categories otherwise i have to run a separate query here my code

12335005
width	height
this code specifies that you want to copy a rectangle with the dimensions 50 width 50 height of the source starting at position 0x 0y and draw into the destination bitmap starting at position 50x 50y and occupy it until 200x 200y - therefore stretching a bit - because as the source is only 50 pixels long to stretch to 200x and 200y the copy will end up with the size 150width 150 height

12335007
width	height
you are also using the screen that the window is on to get width height with device.displaymode which is something you should avoid because this will only work when your window is the same size as the screen

12335019
button	checkbox
checkbox to select those i want to send invitation email and a submit button that submits the form

12335045
std	ostream
note that there is rarely a need to use the template approach nor is there a good use of deriving from std ostream for a different purpose than convenient initialization of a std ostream with a custom std streambuf

12335066
hide	show
the correct approach would be to add kml region tags to your placemarks so that placmarks show hide as the user pans zooms etc

12335105
mouseover	mouseleave
my first thought is to add an overlay that blocks all mouseover mouseleave events

12335108
children	parent
i have this piece of code within a wordpress loop that gathers all parent terms of the current post and displays children terms of each parent in an unordered list

12335108
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

does the child class always just inherit all the public and protected variables and methods from the parent class

12335209
pop-up	dialog
those views each in a panel might then be managed by dialog option panes pop-up tool bars layout managers very rarely other frames or windows

12335210
post	get
the additional slash is not caused or avoidable by your apache configuration it s a feature of browsers that are composing the http parameters of the browsers created http post or get request to the web server

12335210
post	get
and the browser is simply displaying the concatenation of the host name plus the string after the get post

12335216
public	protected
also private protected and public are call access-specifiers

12335231
int	double
if x is an int double or some other type for which -x is meaningful this sets the value of x to -x

12335236
put	get
i have tried to put an nslog inside the -drawrect method and it doesn t get called during normal execution

12335237
post	get
now it will use ajax to post get the value in the number input and because we added the php code that number will be re-outputted and the success function will receive it back add it to the #popup element along with a close button and fade it in

12335244
bash	zsh
aliases in zsh are created in the same manner as in bash

12335304
post	get
this message is basically either a post or get message possibly containing a file of a few megabytes

but now i am wondering if it is possible to allocate the memory in a dynamic way as using malloc or calloc but for this new instructions

12335379
folder	directory
now i have a new project and i put my c project folder inside the visual basic project folder in hopes that visual basic would fetch the dll from that folder and copy it to the output directory

12335409
put	get
the issue is that when i do my first search based on the search filter i get from ui i don t know the uuid of the first row so i prepare a query which gives me first 6 records i store the key of the 6th record in a map and put it in a session so when user from ui request for a second page i retrieve this key uuid and take it as a start for the next set of records to be retrieved

12335439
google-chrome	firefox
of course different runtimes use different heuristics to decide when to convert from one implementation to another so in some cases optimizing for google-chrome for example can hurt performance in firefox

12335448
d3.js	protovis
for semantic zooming you ll notice that d3.js is significantly faster than protovis

12335534
post	get
i had a post request but the url had get variables hanging off of it

12335539
int	boolean
i thought about having another class b which contains the int array as a static member an init method which would fill this array according to some formula and a static boolean flag initialized if this variable if true then the init method would do nothing but i m not sure this is the best way to solve my design issue

12335553
gif	png
i find gif png files upload without triggering the echo but jpg files trigger the echo

12335556
implements	extends
yes you can extends abstracttablemodel and implements the other interfaces by delegating to a default implementation

12335570
udp	tcp
in this day and age there is no reason to dip down to tcp udp unless you are inventing a new protocol

12335596
min	max
also min max and eval are built-in functions - you are shadowing them

12335604
floating-point	integer
i think it s because you re performing integer arithmetic where you really intend to perform floating-point arithmetic

12335703
post	get
what i m really trying to say is that you won t get an orphaned queue you might get poisoned messages that you will need to handled this blog post gives some very detailed information re service bus queues and their capacity and quotas which might give you a better understanding

12335722
apache	nginx
i need to convert apache mod_rewrite rules to nginx

12335741
post	put
also in your simple_form_for method in your html file take out the following as you are duplicating the functionality of rails - it already knows to change the request and correct routes to a post put based on whether or not the form is a new record or not

12335746
min	max
i m having a bit of trouble coming up with a good design that can support a min spec of 768x1024 and a max spec of 1200 x 1920

12335755
post	get
i want to get the last 10 post where section 1

12335755
post	get
this was the old case and i solve it but i found another problem that if the client had deleted a post as id 800 so there aren t id 800 in db so when i get the max id minus num from it and this operation must be equal id 800 so i have a programing mistake here how can i take care of something like that

12335828
width	height
we use width x height so your 768x1024 would be tall

12335834
folder	directory
open from source control will create a workspace mapping for the solutions root directory d tfs repository main solutiona but not a separate one for the solutionx folder which is a peer to solutiona

12335839
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
but one way to make something draggable is to make it a uiview subclass implement touchesbegan and touchesmoved as you have grab the point the user touched in your coordinate system compare it to the point the person s finger is when it moves then offset your position based on that

12335841
multiplying	add
if you use unit you get a string instead of a number but if you multiplying by zero and add 1 you have what you need

ggplot2	colorbrewer
you can find good color schemes on colorbrewer but note that ggplot2 already has a function for those scale_brewer

12335860

qvboxlayout	qwidget	qscrollarea	qvboxlayout	qscrollarea	qwidget
i have a qscrollarea which contains a qwidget which has a qvboxlayout

however whenever i start it it ends up completely freezing the computer no mouse keyboard input seems to be accepted

12335911
pow	sqrt
when my program tries to calculate ecuacion1 using mathematical functions such as pow and sqrt at least thatâ s what i suspect it just stops working without a compiler warning and says build succesful

12335919
folder	directory
you need to either serve files from higher in the directory tree so that closure closure goog base.js is accessible from limejs in this case or copy link the files into your game folder

12335923
spaces	delimiter
the first parameter is the event s can be spaces delimiter for multiple events while the second can either be the targeted element or the function to execute

12335976
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
other java se layouts that might achieve it are gridbaglayout or nested boxlayout gridlayout as mentioned by ray

12336002
pow	sqrt
what is happening is that the arithmetic and or calls to sqrt and pow are generating nan values

12336009
fadein	fadeout
tried using jquery s nice fadein and fadeout functions but they only wait for the duration then appear disappear abruptly without transitioning the opacity

12336010
drawrect	layoutsubviews
depending on how you re drawing the buttons it might be a better idea to use layoutsubviews and setneedslayout than drawrect for repositioning subviews

12336029
rss	feed
i use hpple to parse html from url that i got from the rss feed that contains the space inside

12336029

12336075
inherited	properties
when i want to know if an object has a properties and i don t care if that properties is the object s own properties or being inherited and i don t care what the value of the properties is then i simply look for someproperty in anobject

12336075
inherited	properties
but that will only tell you if the object has that properties and has not inherited it somehow

12336087
for-loop	arrays
the nested for-loop completes properly and if i alert line before entering it into the table object it returns the current line arrays correctly but still does not assign that arrays to the object line

12336097
sorting	filtering
obviusly i need to open a new window and i want that the url will take as params the filtering and sorting that i were using on the grid

12336097

xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
i think you are confusing the xmlhttprequest object with jquery s jqxhr object used by which is supposed to be a superset of the former

12336218
folder	directory
for example if my working directory was home jon folder other and i was user jon with being home jon i would get folder other from the command

12336219
for-loop	arrays
you don t have to use a for-loop if the colors are stored as an arrays

12336242
user-controls	tabcontrol
user-controls is placed on tabcontrol the following way

12336246
for-loop	arrays
as you have it array.size is initially 0 so that first for-loop is never even entered so nothing is being added to arrays

12336274
min	max
for the min and max price per category

12336280
for-loop	arrays
i can do this using the glbegin and glend method calls inside a for-loop using the fixed functional pipeline but i would like to know how to do this using vertex arrays

12336307
concave	convex
you can get convex and concave shapes using css3 border-radius

12336323
for-loop	arrays
firstly you need to refer to the individual arrays piece with inside your for-loop

installation	upgrade
i recently upgrade my eclipse installation to juno and installed the latest android adt and now when i try to compile one of my older applications i get a problem

12336385
width	height
in fact the screen width and height will be the computer screen resolution itself so i m not sure what you mean with screen width with the scroll bar

12336385
width	height
first don t forget to set you body tag to be 100 width and height just to make sure the measurement is accurate

12336404
implements	sealed
in first case nobar class is explicitly sealed and hence no derived classes can implements ifoo and compiler knows that it does not implements ibar itself - hence can fail at compile time

12336460
union	distinct
since i don t know if the query could produce duplicate rows i used distinct in order to collapse duplicate rows in the same manner that the union did in the original query

12336484
children	parent
it is in its parent node where that score is returned and compared with the other scores corresponding to other children

12336493
children	parent
the forking processes creates children in a tree-like manner.consider each fork to be the different layers of a binary tree.when you dont issue a fork u have a process tree of only a root node.when u issue a single fork then u have a binary tree with two levels now the first level will the contain the parent process the second level will contain two processes - the parent and the child process

12336563

12338029
temp	tmp
in windows the temp folder s have the address es tmp and temp

box-sizing	border-box
here is a solution for you using box-sizing border-box

12338251

on all of the computers i work with int is faster than unsigned significantly faster than signed chars

12338473
scatter	graphing
i recently created a program that calculates flow rate through a pipe and generates line by line a scatter graphing of the output

12338492
int	chars
there is no way you can assign a chars to an int value

12338509
int	chars
d is for decimal int c would be for chars the variable holding the value should also be a chars

12338513
int	chars
in c chars are just int

12338568

12338663
qunit	sinon
seems there is no equivalent in qunit and sinon

12338687

not entirely sure in jquery but in straight javascript clicking on the item gives it focus and the focus is retained until you click elsewhere so what you want to do is test for loss of focus i m guessing mouseenter mouseleave check if the mouse is hovering over the item

12338688
google-chrome	firefox
it looks as it should in google-chrome and firefox but ie really messes it up and none of the animations sliders work

post	get
is it possible to implement post-redirect-get pattern with two overloaded action methods one for get action and the other for post action in asp.net-mvc

12338704

in all of the mvc post-redirect-get pattern samples i have seen three different action methods for the post-redirect-get process corresponding to initial get post and the redirection get each having different names

12338707
box-sizing	border-box
you might have to set box-sizing to something consistent to make it work cross-browser like box-sizing border-box

12338709
hide	show
and how do i render this - should i pass in a modelform for each type of cuisine or have a single menu modelform that has everything in it and just show hide stuff on the client-side

12338749
instances	transient
ideally you want a transient generated field in your entity that reconstructs the calendar instances you want using the timestamp and interval stored in the database

12338840
min	max
i though it should have a max min and according to the bounded value it will move by using a transform that s the easier part but the actual graphics are tricky here.

12338854
textarea	textbox
in your case you have only one textbox that you need to disable but consider the case where you have multiple input select and textarea fields that yout need to disable

12338948
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to get my html tidy c++ wrapper library to build on linux testing on ubuntu at the moment but make fails with a libtool error libtool link you must specify an output file

12338952
ubuntu	linux
so binaries from your ubuntu gcc will most likely run on any linux system that s no older than the machine it was compiled on

12338952
sunos	aix
anything compiled on aix 6 say or sunos 5.8 or hp-ux 11.00 or whatever runs with no issues on all later releases

12338952
freebsd	linux
freebsd knows the linux syscalls and when you tell it do the 42 thing it checks a flag in the header of your elf and does the appropriate action for the linux syscall numbers if the elf is stamped as a linux one

12338952
freebsd	linux
but a statically linked linux binary will run fine in freebsd with no externals.

12338977
integer	unsigned
corresponding unsigned integer type and the value is representable in both types

12338977
int	chars	int	boolean
â 6.3.1.1 boolean chars and int

i have parent div tag and him must be several children div tags i want that children tags placing horizontal

12339065
children	parent
count children div tags is not known advanced on this i can t set width parent div tag with css for this i use js

12339133
children	parent
that way the parent div will get the appropriate width automatically so that the children can fit into it

12339170
public	protected
if i have public internal or protected property setters there is a risk that inheriting classes will break the original contract

12339220
allocator	stl
in c++03 this would have been relatively difficult however c++11 now requires that stl containers work with stateful allocator so you could perfectly create an allocator with a small stack for its own use.

12339308
aggregate-functions	sum
when you use a value of -1 for downvote and 1 for upvote you can calculate the total score of an article by using the sum aggregate-functions it would also easily allow you to introduce weighted votes later when you feel like it

12339327
typedef	struct
don t bother with typedef for struct

12339331
debian	linux
check the httpd.conf file is set in apache to allow overides so htaccess will work - this might be apache.conf if using a debian box with debian squeeze - not sure about other linux types though

it is taken straight from stack overflow question android screens size hdpi ldpi mdpi

12339555

this proves you get out what you put in regardless if it contains quotes or not

12339568

as far as i understood i should squash the merge commit 34db3b8c08.

12339625
button	checkbox
qml quick markup language includes basic necessities like text fields radio button checkbox etc which can be animated and controlled with event handlers

12339665
hash	md5
again this feels right - trying to do the md5 step in method would cause issues if the model_user were one pulled from the db as the password field would clearly already be hash

12339681
post	get
you cannot have overloaded action methods when they respond to same type of requests get post etc.

12339716
apache	nginx
finally now i have all working both in nginx and apache

12339882
tablet	mdpi
for xlarge tablet you probably only care about mdpi right now

12339898
int	double
once you declared your variable as say an int you won t be able to store a double in it - however you cast the division etc

12339934
hide	show
unfortunately there s no event for it but i guess one could listen to when a textbox gains or loses focus and set a margin or perhaps show a control at the bottom of the page when a textbox has focus and hence the sip is displayed and hide it when it doesn t

12339943
superclass	subclassing
i am using a uitableview which has a custom superclass customtableview - this is a subclassing of uitableview

12339944
int	double
if it s double then you don t have to do anything int division won t be used in any case

12339944
int	double
but if it s int then your cast doesn t make any sense you can t store a double value in an int variable

12339970
int	chars
if you re looking to sanitize the string then maybe you need to remove everything that s not and then validate against the difference is while int are allowed chars a class function name may not start with one

12339990
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
you can make use of nsblockoperation and nsoperationqueue to create a cancellable download task

12340060

put the as the middle clause of your for-loop then it s checked earlier and you break out of loops sooner

12340119
lan	intranet
if you are writing an internet web app as opposed to an intranet lan app there is no way to determine the local address and mac address of the client unless the client explicitly sends it to you

12340122
int	double
you can but you do not have to bit shifting will double the number no matter what base you use for interpreting it later because internally these int s are still interpreted as binary by the underlying shift operations

12340134
post	get
you can not use javascript to get the mac address however you can get the ip address and post it back

12340152
integer	unsigned
if you need to add a 33rd you are out of luck unless you go to a 64 bit unsigned integer

12340168

folder	directory
how do i put every file name on the root directory and and all the file names in each sub folder into an array in php

12340341

what ends up happening is that the browser firefox google-chrome ie handle both pages meaning the ajax call and they do a get from page i m trying to redirect to but only the original page is rendered so no redirection takes place

12340355
getter	setter
all of the getter setter constructors and other methods are pretty much so we can put values into those variables

12340382
datamapper	activerecord
this is a common approach when you re using the activerecord pattern instead of datamapper which is a bad thing

12340395
post	get
but you can find with firefox s httpfox extension for example what request your browser sends to the target site than you get recommendations and make the same request i m sure this is post from your www mechanize object

recvfrom	datagram
its main loop consists of a blocking recvfrom call which listens for udp packets arriving on a datagram socket and some sophisticated code that parses the message and manipulates loads of stl containers in the process

12340613
minimum	max
the numbers in the array would be consecutive if the difference between the max and the minimum number of the array is equal to n-1 provided numbers are unique where n is the size of the array

12340631
hide	show
this will effectively let you move the mask layer around with your finger and will begin to hide portions of the top image view and let the bottom one show from beneath

width	margin
since you say that your site is a fixed-width layout then with width device-width it is likely to look bad if it is shown on different size devices for example you might see a white margin down the right hand side on wider devices whereas with width 320 the browser will scale it up to fit the device s screen width it may therefore look somewhat enlarged but that s probably better than having a white margin

12342197

you might argue that an unsigned int serves dual purpose as a bit pattern and an integer value but int does not

12342973
stateless	stateful
in addition you ll find that frameworks claiming to be stateless and doing anything but pure rest are actually doing a pretty bad job at being a stateful framework typically that involves round tripping state into cookies or serialising it into a hidden form field

ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
that said if you want to map your existing xml to some sort of c# data structures the way you re doing it seems reasonable - i d just recommend replacing your public fields with actual properties and maybe making the list properties a less specific type - say ienumerable or icollection or ilist if they really need to be in order

everything works fine in ie9 firefox mac + pc safari mac + pc and google-chrome mac + pc however when the requests are sent from ie 9 the ajax requests are fired correctly and correct responses are returned without error but it appears that it is sending through a different session for each of the calls so the 3rd party system recognises the 4 different requests as coming from different sessions

if i get it right you need the array value to contain int and boolean but you set there an object at first which is replaced by a string after that

12346539

due to that java cannot invoke the method string getlist int boolean because string is not castable to int nor to boolean

at this point it s worth noting that all trigonometric function sin cos tan atan etc. use radians

12346918

i think it is because of directory structure followed for all applications of same types as all the application contains some files folder on the root folder that is the name of our application e-g android project contains files like .project and .classpath and folder like .myeclipse src bin .settings etc

also you must add padding to the parent in place of margin on the children

12347074
implements	extends
the simple solution is to write a class that implements an interface rather than extends a base class

12347087
implements	extends
handy you should create a class that extends from arrayadapter then you implements the method getview to tell your list what to do on each item add the image and the text

12347100

getter	setter
suppose there is an atomic string property called name and if you call from thread a call from thread b and call from thread c then all operation on different thread will be performed serially which means if one thread is executing setter or getter then other threads will wait

12347236
getter	setter
this makes property name read write safe but if another thread d calls simultaneously then this operation might produce a crash because there is no setter getter call involved here

12347239
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade your copy of netcat the modern versioning 1.10 for one have an option to execute a program or a shell command upon connect

otherwise you can make the netcat think it runs in a terminal to disable buffering of stdout by using for example script it just saves everything on stdin stdout stderr in the given file

12347246
packets	multicast
to send multicast packets all you need to do is bind to a local interface 0.0.0.0 with a random port works as you ve discovered and then address a packets to the correct group port which is what sendto will do

12347246
packets	multicast
when you make this call the system sends an igmp onto the network instructing the routers to forward multicast packets for a specific group to your interface binding to the correct port is then enough to receive them

12347246
packets	multicast
you can normally also instruct the os to duplicate multicast packets with the loopback interface so you can use multicast on the same machine

12347246
packets	multicast
the traditional solution to this is to create an igmp packets yourself which would allow multicast to work via a switch but not on the local machine

12347246
udp	tcp
unfortunately this needs access to send raw ip packets not tcp or udp and chrome.socket doesn t provide that

12347259
getter	setter
with atomic the synthesized setter getter methods will ensure that a whole value is always returned from the getter or set by the setter regardless of setter activity on any other thread

12347259
getter	setter
so if thread a is in the middle of the getter while thread b calls the setter an actual viable value will be returned to the caller in a

i researched various stackoverflow posts regarding ncover + moles and mstest and the those posts are the base for my execution

12347305
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if your case enables you to feed the dictionaries with items in a sorted ascending order you may want to switch to a sortedlist rather than a sorteddictionary because in the list adding items is o 1 rather than o log n if the new items will wind up at the end of the sorted collection

12347305
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
this is not yet possible with a sorteddictionary but the sortedlist supports that feature

12347309
jlist	jtable
for most complex output to the gui or array is based on java.util.list map hashmap then to use jtable with one column based on abstracttablemodel because jlist has implemented reduced methods or features in compare with jtable

12347761
curb	libcurl
the dependency is on the libcurl headers so you could try to find those headers in the available search paths and then make a recommendation of which package to install based on the platform being installed on but the libcurl headers could be installed by any number of packages or even from source so there s no one way to say curb requires libcurl-devel in a general case

12347785
getter	setter
the setter .text string affects all elements in the jquery object and the getter .text concatenates the text of all elements

12347785
getter	setter
the same applies to most other methods the setter affect all elements and the getter read usually the first element

bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
the only option would be using the original inputstream and write it into a temporary file or a bytearrayoutputstream if the file s are small enough to not use too much memory so you can access the data several times

12347934
serializable	deserialization
transient field of an object is ignored for serializable deserialization like java orms ignores transient fields

12347967
min	max
in other words your example code should work exactly as you d expect it to return the max of comparing b to the min of comparing c to d

12348067
min	max
i ll just write two short functions to do these checks and return the min or max long

12348067
min	max
edit2 here s the function for limiting a long to its min max value according to the answer i linked to above

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the behavior i m experiencing is that google-chrome 21 and firefox 15 displays scrollbars inside the box resizing it s content thus hiding some of the text however opera 12 and internet explorer 9 displays it also on the inside but without resizing it s content and resizing the box instead which is in my opinion correct since the box doesn t have width defined

12352875
post	get
im trying to get uploadify to upload my image to my server which works fine but then send the filename to the hidden field so that i can post the data into my database update class

12352879
preventdefault	keyup
you didn t cancel the events themselves you just cancelled the browser default actions the default registered event handlers with preventdefault - which is exactly what you wanted - but you now want to specify your own keyup and or keypress event handler right

12352879
keydown	keyup
so now of course nothing happens - you took the default event handlers out like you wanted to for keydown event and there were probably no other event handlers registered to the keyup and keypress events so there were no more actions handlers to fire anymore

12352879
keydown	keyup
i mean just bind keyup directly now from same keydown handler to whatever function you desire and i believe that when key goes up it should actually fire that function event handler that you bound to that event

i don t remember the exact numbers off the top of my head but my recollection is that throughput for vfp add and multiplying is on the order of an op every 8 cycles on that core

12356799
set	bag
however findall 3 returns a bag duplicates are allowed rather than a set no duplicates allowed so if your two source lists aren t sets you won t get a set out

12356836

it just takes the portrait picture and uses it for landscape

12356840
google-chrome	firefox
because my cookie parsing code not shown worked on google-chrome firefox but not on ie i thought it the url was being entered correctly

12356894
disk	ram
i m not sure how temp tables are handled in ram or on disk and how much space they take up as this is a large data set and it would likely take up several gb s of ram or disk space

fast-forward	merge
it may not be a fast-forward merge on your production server

12357017
pull	push
in simple terms i have a pair of push pull sockets in python

12357017
pull	push
the push socket never stops sending but the pull socket should be able to clean itself up in a following way

12357017
pull	push
i don t want to affect the push socket in any way it can keep accumulating its own queue until another pull socket comes around or that might be there already

12357017
pull	push
one option might be to have a broker in between with the broker push and receiver pull hwm set to zero

12357095
getter	setter
i ve noticed that often times when i create a custom getter setter for a property in objective c at least once somewhere in my class i forget to use self.variablename to access my property and instead access it directly with just variablename which defeats the purpose of the getter and setter and may cause a bug later on that could be tough to track down

12357095
getter	setter
to avoid the accidental non-usage of getter and setter

12357095
getter	setter
don t get me wrong sometimes it is nice to be able to access instance variables directly and avoid the getter and setter but sometimes when i write a custom getter and setter it is important that these getter and setter get used every time and do not get forgotten

12357103
execvp	fork
i am developing a gtk+ application for linux that is launched from another gtk+ application using fork and then execvp

12357182
post	get
you can always use ajax to retrieve and send post and get values

12357202
chown	chgrp
note that user mysql had already got permissions throught chown -r and chgrp -r

12357214
int	chars
a is a chars constant - of type int in standard c - and represents a single chars

12357214
int	chars
that a is an int instead of a chars is a quirk of standard c and explains why it s because

12357215
post	get
i ve looked into the answers posted to similar questions but i couldn t get anything to work for my situation so i will post my question

12357235
width	height
i mean layout height of both spinner is wrap content but width should be first half for the first spinner second half of the screen to the second spinner

12357268
post	get
the only way you might be able to achieve this is if the other site doesn t employ xss protection and allows you to directly get post a login url to their site

12357282
implements	extends
create a class that extends runnable implements the run method or make it call your current method that should be enough to do this

12357325
versioning	upgrade
upgrade spring versioning to last best versioning 2.5.6.sec03 - this still shows the same issue

12357326
ant	maven
we use maven to for our web application and we used to use ant

12357327

12357357
pop-up	dialog
this will pop-up dialog box

12357375
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you want to add server side filtering outside of your repository methods you need to return your types as iqueryable rather than ienumerable and not call .tolist .asenumerable or any other method that would cause .getenumerator to be called

12357380
maven	m2e
i m converting some of our projects into maven projects but m2e changes my .classpath jre entry from

12357441
width	height
i would also like my canvases to have same height and width at all times

12357464
opera	google-chrome
only in google-chrome and opera the normal for-loop is the fastest

12357517
stdout	stderr
using readline twice you should strictly consume stdout stderr simultaneously

12357567
swing	windowbuilder
i have recently started making a minesweeper-like game in java with swing using eclipse windowbuilder and in the app there is an ordinary jframe with a jmenu with options in it

12357599

simply put don t make data modification methods work on get requests

12357713
post	put
if you re doing some rest service use the proper post put delete patch methods

12357741
implements	extends
if a class is made abstract you can give body to all the methodes or none of these but if any class is extends abstract class it must implements all the methode which is only being declared

12357769
ready	each
this is a limitation of mongoimport - essentially each piece of data you import must be insert ready even though you are using the upsert functionality which is basically working as a de-duplication mechanism for your input data

12357812
int	chars
the problem with your current implementation is because you re trying to compare an int value that you ve in your selection variable with chars which is internally getting converted to its corresponding int value int value of 1 is not the same as 1

12357812
int	chars
so when you set you would find the output from the int block however if you set you would find the output from the chars block

12357813
air	flashdevelop
since flash builder is kinda expensive 249 you could use flashdevelop there is some tutorials to compile in air with it

12357878
put	get
put the bytes in a memorystream and then use setsource member of bitmapimage to get the image into your ui

12357887

12357925
jar	war
is the jar put into the war

12357936
concave	convex
the faces usually consist of triangles quadrilaterals or other simple convex polygons since this simplifies rendering but may also be composed of more general concave polygons or polygons with holes

12357986
free	malloc
so for example if the interruption happens in the middle of malloc calling free in your signal handler to clean up will deadlock

12357997
implements	extends
then each concrete class that extends bird that can fly should implements this interface

12358019
uuid	uniqueidentifier
for databases that do not support a uniqueidentifier uuid type you should use string

12358038
google-chrome	firefox
you can use firebug for firefox or google-chrome inbuilt web developer tool to debug such error

12358040
solaris	aix
this seems to work fine on solaris and aix but on linux i get this error messages

12358050
maven	pom.xml
i wish for something like maven clean install -dspecific.build and some configuration in the pom.xml to build this additional module

12358079
requestfactory	gwt
you should probably use requestfactory as it does not require that the bean be serializable as the gwt rpc service does

12358079
getter	setter
you would create a value proxy on the client side and make sure it maps getter setter that you need

12358087
google-chrome	firefox
this issues occurs in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox

12358125
folder	directory
my mistake is probably that is nstreecontroller does not differentiate between the simple objects files and the directory folder

12358127
try-catch	exception-handling
i have a try-catch sentence for it and it doesn t throw any exception-handling

12358127

with firebug i get the post request is successful along with the response this i got adding an aftersubmit option function and checking postdata

12358128
backbone.js	sammy.js
when doing more complex stuff with javascript you can also consider using a framework like backbone.js sammy.js or knockout.js there are many more

12358132
onresume	onpause
is it appropriate to define instance variables on the top of the class or we need to define them in onresume onpause of the activity

12358140
popover	tooltip
the only features that are opt-in are the tooltip and popover

12358151
profiler	visualvm
also it would help if you use a java profiler such as visualvm

12358169
boost	stl
using the stl and boost will probably help avoiding some mistakes

12358215
unsigned	short
unsigned short gf_t 44

12358249
google-chrome	firefox
it seems it s a little faster than a while backwards on firefox and on google-chrome they tie

12358265
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql or sql server

12358295
int	double
also there is a slight rounding issue with double and if you need perfect precision doubtful given the rest of your code but typically the standard is to use 2 int to store currency

12358313
subtract	add
go through both arrays for each number in n add the exponent of each prime in its factorisation to the value in the map for the numbers in d subtract

12358316
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i know google-chrome extensions technically can t save files to disk like firefox

12358357
google-chrome	firefox
try using google-chrome or firefox s developer tools to identify any elements on the page that might be interfering

12358391
versioning	upgrade
i could not upgrade my jboss tools to recognize jboss as 7 so i upgrade my versioning of eclipse as well

12358419
http	spdy	google-chrome	firefox
you could even go overkill and look into spdy which is an alternative lighter http protocol supported in google-chrome and firefox

12358426
int	double
2 casting from double type to an int

12358442
put	get
you might as well always use cgcontextdrawpath and put in your own parameters to get the type of fill stroke that you want

12358554
int	boolean
i have 3 separate boolean variables bit1 bit2 bit3 and i need to calculate the decimal int equivalent in javascript

12358621
int	boolean
the left shifts will automatically convert the boolean to their corresponding int values

12358640
translation	localization
now you can decide to have a multiple-bundle approach or follow a single-bundle technique in the latter case you can package all the languages and then use the unique updated bundle for language translation by using the automatic system localization rules

12358660
int	boolean
if your language allows the use of boolean as int values true 1 false 0 these get easier

12358675
implements	extends
instead of extends a concrete list adapter and modifying the getview method i created a new class implements the listadapter interface that blindly forwards almost everything to another listadapter except getview

12358675
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
to use it simply instantiate it supplying any other listadapter be it arrayadapter or simplecursoradapter or anything else

12358679
getter	setter
in avoid internal getter setter section is

12358689
post	get
if i happen to get better results i will post em here

12358690
sorting	grouping
each script handles a different incoming flat file with it s own formatting sorting grouping and outputting requirements

12358690
put	get
because the processing of the data is different for each file i need to open the file to get my counter value because this is a common operation i d like to put it in a sub to retrieve the counter

12358821
int	double
the standard conversion methods begin with to 20d.toint will convert a value 20 of type double a value 20 of type int

12358836
inherited	properties
also you should make application derive from component so it can inherited all the same properties behaviour without duplicating the code

12358861
caanimation	calayer
caanimation calayer caanimationgroup etc are nearly identical between mac and ios

12358894
google-chrome	firefox
it works flawlessly in firefox but google-chrome and ie act like the observers don t even exist

12358901
profiling	benchmarking
as a rule of thumb exception handling is more expensive than ifs but i agree with thez that the best approach would be to benchmarking profiling both versions under the expected load

12358910
int	double
i have comboboxes than bind to collections of type int or double in my silverlight application

12358913
range	minimum
i am planning on using a device such as the microsoft kinect or an asus xtion pro for 3d imaging purposes and they are great on all specs except for the minimum range

12358913
range	minimum
is there anyway to make the range shorter either through software modifications or is there any similar hardware with a closer minimum range

12358916
google-chrome	firefox
this works great...in ie9 firefox and google-chrome

12358927
google-chrome	firefox
this works in the browsers i ve tested google-chrome firefox ie8 ie10 but this does not pass jslint bad invocation

12358974
google-chrome	firefox
i went to firebug on firefox and the developers tools on google-chrome and tried to find a solution perhaps looking at styles but nothing came up

12358999
awt	swing
you can learn about abstract classes here and about awt swing painting here

12359061
implements	extends
just write a servlet that extends httpservlet and implements dopost

12359063
getter	setter
the second quote suggests that without jit using a trivial getter setter is slower than direct field access eg

12359100
versioning	upgrade
i have not changed any settings recently but the server admin may have upgrade the versioning of apache or php

12359102
width	height
this is because of limitation set to display routes in the region of quarter of world size in height and width around the current location

12359122
mouseleave	mouseenter
note that it subscribes to the ie specific mouseenter and mouseleave event so you also have to reference jquery which simulates those events in the other browsers

12359143
getter	setter
you should always keep your variables private and use methods to manipulate them getter and setter or something else

12359210
hide	show
here s the thing first i m loading a video in html5 and then when the video finish the function hide the video and show the iframe div which is occult with jquery but for some reason when the video s hide the iframe doesn t appear and when i inspect the element the tag is there but appears with the src empty

12359228
x86	64bit
are there any modern x86 32- or 64bit machines where rep movsb is slower than rep movsd or rep movsq

12359261
instances	transient
almost any component is also using a repository instances which is also transient and also implements idisposable and again no particular reason for that

12359328
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
if you re going to subclassing make each subclassing a module with its own public-facing interface and its own privately-scoped vars and then make that module the properties of whatever you were trying to make rather than trying to get chains of inherited working

12359359
persistent	transient
every non static non transient property field or method depending on the access type of an entity is considered persistent unless you annotate it as transient

12359384
floating-point	integer
in your case if all your probabilities are multiples of 1 96 then you can do the same thing choosing a random integer less than 96 instead of a floating-point number

12359384
int	double
just use int s instead of double s and use rnd.nextint 96 to choose an int between 0 and 95 inclusive instead of math.random

12359445
hash	md5
is there a way to use something like md5 hash or some other sort of encryption or something else to secure my password

12359502
udp	tcp
the fact is i m bound to use the tcp server to communicate with both users the udp server is just here to return user s port to himself so it can send it back to tcp server

12359579
cpython	ironpython
this use of traceback only works with those implementations of python that uses frames such as cpython but not jython or ironpython

12359599
put	get	post	put	post	get
since i get 200 ok status i think the code for post works ok so i won t put the whole httprequest class here just the most important methods

12359624
children	parent
the parent always resizes to that of the size of the children s space if not anything else is declared

12359627
solaris	aix
solaris and aix do just fine

12359629
width	height
unfortunately it s not quite as configurable as views slideshow but views slideshow requires hacking to get it responsive as it inserts width height attributes directly in the dom

12359632
children	parent
i think you don t have to do anything special to have the parent div as high as the children blocks

12359650
single-quotes	double-quotes
in xml codes you can use either double-quotes or single-quotes for setting strings

12359724
put	get
when i tried to put the data in mysql i get this error java.lang.outofmemoryerror java heap space

12359745
min	max
however why can t you just use min and max on date addmited and discharged

12359747
google-chrome	firefox
but when i try to use the same form with google-chrome or firefox the asp.net server is still receiving a file count 1 but it is empty contentlength 0

12359747
google-chrome	firefox
with fiddler i can see the content of the file when i m using ie and i can see the empty file sent from google-chrome and firefox

12359785
integer	fractions
reducing integer fractions algorithm

12359800
dbf	dbase
i want to build a program that can open dbase dbf file faster like other normal files

dbf	dbase
i want to build a software that can open dbf dbase file faster way and modify it .also i wan to import data from .csv file

12359801
int	double
java and scala allows you to cast a primitive double to int in scala s case double to int

12359842
width	height
then you for-loop the width and height getwidth getheight

12359867
google-chrome	firefox
i was under the impression that both my syntax and use of data-attributes was correct as i had managed to get full functionality within firefox and dreamweaver s preview window but it soon become evident that my method didnt work in google-chrome or ie9

12359924
int	double
or can it be that i am passing 2 values one is int and one is double

12359942
int	boolean
if you re going to be returning mixed values int + boolean you should use the strict equality check

12359947
union	distinct
using union is like adding and implicit distinct requirement which takes up processor cycles and makes the query plan more complicated

12359967
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works great in ie but not in firefox safari or google-chrome

12359978
ember.js	backbone.js
am i better off using something like backbone.js node or ember.js - or just using a websockets gem like em-websocket and pjax

12359993
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works nicely on firefox but i just can t get it working on google-chrome and safari

12360000
put	get
in the log below whether i put into the db.key.from_path command c_key or court i get exactly the same result which shows that the values of the 2 weekday_key s are identical not different as i expected

12360070
int	boolean
or since c casts int to boolean automatically

12360070
int	boolean
if you really want to get a 0 or 1 value out of your comparison you can take advantage of more automatic type-casting to turn a boolean back into an int

12360094
folder	directory
i think most of the views templates are mapped as filesystem directory folder

12360098
post	get
my actual project is too large to post here but basically what happens is i get a huge amount of error output as if the classpath was improperly set they re errors on library functions

12360101
wadl	wsdl
soapui can take your wsdl and or wadl and general your first order tests

12360233
ceil	floor
floor could be replaced with round or ceil if appropriate

12360267
width	height
you can specify the width and height parameters in the graph api call to retrieve the picture in alternate sizes

12360304
x86	64bit

my advice for you is to first extends codeigniter s ci_controller class be implements the techniques outlined on phil sturgeon s blog entitled keeping it dry

12360383
pop-up	dialog
i use the following code for a likegate but the pop-up login dialog box is getting blocked

sorting	grouping
i am currently grouping them and sorting by most recent vote

12360438
post	get
while it s good practice to fix non-structural errors such as the one you mentioned in your other post browsers are forgiving if you get the basic structure right

12360440
capitalize	uppercase
capitalize transforms your string to lower case but for the first letter which becomes uppercase

12360465
put	get	post	put	post	get
the content of an http get request will always be empty - it is only valid to send content on post and put and possibly delete requests

12360494
packets	pcap	sniffing	pcap
this is not providing the correct checksum that is sent to me from pcap i use it for sniffing packets

12360494
packets	pcap
i downloaded other code examples running around on the net and neither of those gives the result that every ip header contains with in it when pcap forwards the packets to my code

12360517
inherited	properties
it shows me a long list of inherited properties which are hard to navigate through

12360526
ivar	subclassing
if it s instantiated in a storyboard scene nib then you can hook up an outlet to a property ivar in your subclassing fairly easily

my plot currently looks like this notice the ticks - x longitudes y latitudes in utm wgs84

12360555
easymock	powermockito
i m trying to learn the ins and outs of various mocking libraries and powermockito specifically the easymock extension is next on the list

12360586
width	height
not supplying the same size for example 100px- height and 100px- width

12360589
uiview	subviews
important notes i m not using a uiscrollview because the mentioned uiview has plenty of draggable subviews so if i use a uiscrollview i can t drag because the uiviewscroll scrolling event executes over the subviews events

12360602
codeblocks	codelite
one wants to provide project files for many different ides under different platforms such as linux 32 bit 64 bit windows 32 bit 64 bit mac 32 bit 64 bit codeblocks eclipse cdt kdevelop3 codelite microsoft visual studio etc

12360602
folder	directory
i have already looked at cmake which gets very close to the final goal but it creates an additional cmake folder to the ide project files and also doesn t copy possible example source into the build directory

12360608
int	boolean
if some of them are categorical int markers those feature should be exploded as one-of-k boolean encodings instead as scikit-learn implementation of random forest s cannot directly deal with categorical data

12360611
width	height
i want to make the rectangle fill all space of the pane without set the width or height manually because the pane be resizable

12360626
uiview	subviews
i would rather make a uiview container clipping subviews add the content view which we will drag as a subviews and change it s frame

12360643
versioning	upgrade
i ve since upgrade the os on my server which in turn upgrade the php versioning and this issue has been fixed

12360652
virtualenv	setuptools
virtualenv is now using distribute not setuptools

next i was writing my own class to treat a stream or array of bytes as a big number and add multiple operator methods to perform hex arithmetic until i read about the system.numerics.biginteger class online - but being that there is no biginteger.maxvalue and that i can only load a max of 2 gb of data at a time i don t know what the potential of biginteger would be - even compared to the object i was writing called number which does have my desired minimum potential

12363976
division	multiplication
i ll be treating the 4-5 gb of data like any other number instead of an array of bytes - performing such arithmetic as division and multiplication

12363985

12364559
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
as an sql table doesn t naturally map to a tree you might have to look at using a proxy model or extending qabstractitemmodel yourself to work with the qtreeview as this will be specific to your business logic and whether you are using nested sets or materialised path etc

12364580
nsstring	nsobject
which is technically correct as nsstring is derived from nsobject and nsobject does not have writetofile function

12364596

also consider putting the uiimage inside an nscache purging them when memory goes low and use a uitableview instead of a uiscrollview to reuse the interface elements

12378879
google-chrome	firefox
however it works in both google-chrome and firefox

12378890

12378916
google-chrome	firefox
why does the following work correctly in firefox but not google-chrome

12378916
google-chrome	firefox
if i change the return value in the .each loop to true it works in google-chrome and not firefox

12378924
int	chars
the way i want to do it is just turn the chars back into an int before it reaches the switch but i am not sure how i could do that

12378961

12379073
int	chars
you can turn a chars into an int with a typecast

12379073
int	chars
if variable is a chars entered by the user the typecast int will convert it to its ascii code for the switch

12379073
int	chars
usually though c doesn t require typecasts to interpret chars as int

12379096
post	get
used the loop to get the post and a counter which increments everytime a post is fetched

12379096
post	get
if i try to rewrite the query to include all post i get infinite looping because i m already inside the loop

12379099
int	chars
but you are passing it an int not a chars so its output is meaningless

12379104
width	text-align
i recently tackled the issue of equally spacing and arbitrary number of elements across an unknown width using text-align justify

12379105
do.call	lapply
for more complicated problems the lapply split dat fac fun approach may be needed or use do.call rbind by ...

12379116
children	parent
other questions that i d use the doc for are about how to access a node s parent directly traverse children access text data etc

12379123
cpu	processors
i would believe that it varies from server to server depending on connection speed and memory and possibly cpu if you re doing something processors intensive with the result

12379123
apache	nginx
the remote server is set up to allow very few maximum concurrent clients generally nginx handles many concurrent clients better than apache since it doesn t need to fork a new process for every request so if it becomes an issue you might want to look into switching web servers

12379133
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari

12379146
rank	max
having read your previous question how to create a column of rank while grouping in r so we know that max actno is simply the number of rows in each group then

12379306
submit	submission
if you re submission a known form then you can omit the first step of downloading the original html form as your program already knows what the fields to submit are

12379306
webkit	gecko
a more sophisticated version of this done to bypass sites that use client-side scripting to prevent trivial screenscraping is to host an instance of a web browser component mshtml.dll trident gecko or webkit and have it to evaluate the page as it would in a normal desktop environment

12379329
post	get
after cleaning rebuilding and following instructions in every other post i could find on the whole internet i can t seem to get around this problem with these current settings

12379341
put	get	post	put	post	get
that s because the magic 4 get post put delete should be enough for all actions no users activate user edit stuff around

12379341
put	get	post	put	post	get
this is the route for all interests of id-th user - you can issue a get over it to retrieve them all or a post to add an element to the list a put to set all the list from scratch

12379357
width	height
note the order of execution and half the width height is pre-computed

12379391
post	put
and whereever you want to make your post put something like this

12379419
jwindow	jdialog
the toast class extends jwindow just for test i could use jdialog with a more stable release

12379424
sudo	passwd
i ve tried using expect but to no avail it just refuses to work on os x and it seems the only other option to pass a passwd in a bash script is to use but then it s just a standard user trying to sudo and it doesn t work

12379424
sudo	passwd
i ve tried echo 1234 | sudo -s su root and echo 1234 | sudo -s su but they all just return sorry try again. even though it is echoing the correct passwd and i know because i can successfully login root

12379439

hide	show
if it is the profile plugin you mean you can set the individual fields to show or hide in the plugin

12379511

part 1 override equals hashcode and tostring

12379600
comparator	comparable
declare that it implements comparable and implement the comparator method described by the interface

12379601
int	double
so to fix the error convert your int to a double before calling sqrt

12379603
min	max
if it then works better then min max are not the std min and std max

12379603
min	max
it does not make sense that it would work better if split because the std min and std max are functions inline or not and the calling convention just cannot break

12379605
width	height
image repeat-x by ul width and repeat-y by text height

12379612
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
is a uiviewcontroller method not a uinavigationcontroller method

12379614

i ll try and get a code sample but it s so ingrained i can t just post a couple of lines of code

12379712
pull	push
if someone else logs into the instance they won t be able to pull push the repo if they have no access to it

12379716
doc	rtf
since you asked for possible alternatives there is a web service you can call docmosis which provides the ability to create doc rtf other documents from objective-c and stream back to the device and or email store etc

12379764
hide	show
though for your example it might be easier to always have the label textbox on the page but contain it in an asp panel which you toggle the visible property on it or show hide it via javascript

12379793
rss	feed
i have a mailchimp rss campaign that reads an rss feed on a website and is set to once a day

finally you ll need to understand that properties aren t persisted for subsequent installation so you ll need to use system search appsearch reglocator to pull the property back in so that it doesn t get wiped out during repairs and upgrade

12379959
inherited	subclassing
to cover all possibilities by inherited you d need 1024 subclassing

12379988

12379995
post	put
everything works great except for when i type in a phrase with like an apostrophe example here s my title wont post put heres my title will post

12379997
cpu	irq
things might be different now with usb keyboards but this seems to discuss what would happen with an old ps 2 connection where an 8042 -compatible chipset on your motherboard signals on an irq line to the cpu which then executes whatever code is at the address stored in location 9 in the interrupt table traditionally an array of pointers starting at address 0 in physical memory though from memory you could change the address and last time i played with this stuff pcs still had 1mb ram and used different memory layout modes

12380019
mouse	keyboard
you can for example use the pagination layout from the javafx 2.2 to navigate through your slides when not in fullscreen and bind page slide transition to keyboard or mouse events to navigate through the pages of your pagination object

12380019
awt	swing
there s this new feature that make it possible to take a snapshot with javafx to make thumbnails or printing them with some swing awt magic of your scenes or nodes and programmatically style them as your pagination buttons since you are using javafx objects this could be a cool and easy way to integrate your slide content with your navigation

12380032
verilog	hdl
the common string operations copy concatenate and compare are supported by verilog hdl operators

12380102
versioning	upgrade
that is if you truly want the two jars to be interchangeable meaning that you want to use the newer versioning of derby then go back to the older one then make sure you only do a soft upgrade since once you have done a hard upgrade you can t go back to the older versioning

12380102
versioning	upgrade
myself i would say switch to the newer apache derby.jar do a hard upgrade of your existing databases and plan not to go back to the older versioning of derby

12380107
qtableview	qabstractitemview
since qtableview comes from qabstractitemview if the editing mode is triggered by other way such as mouse double click the program will run default qabstractitemview edit instead of a edit

12380239
haskell	agda
i searched on google and the closest i have found is parsing addressed in haskell but usually libraries like parsec are used that are not available in agda

12380267

12380480
qevent	qmodelindex	qevent	qabstractitemview	qmodelindex	qabstractitemview
however qabstractitemview edit const qmodelindex index edittrigger trigger qevent event is virtual so you can override it

qabstractitemview	qobject
qabstractitemview editordestroyed qobject editor is also virtual so i m not sure why it isn t be working

12380480
qabstractitemview	qwidget
however there is also qabstractitemview closeeditor qwidget editor qabstractitemdelegate endedithint hint which is also virtual so you might want to try reimplementing that in your subclass

jasmine	mocha
testing supports generating test cases for mocha or jasmine and automatically building them as part of the build process via karma

12381082

there s nothing wrong with storing config in an ini file but you d be better off not touching the php.ini file

12394949
filtering	grouping
you can add the following filtering before grouping by

12394951
inherited	properties
ensure that the inherited properties and the class defined in this code file uses the same name and try and add the namespace before the class name

12394955
width	height
the solution i ve foud to center it was removing the button height and width because it will expand to wrap the span and it will be centered

12394955
width	height
but for bigger buttons like 30px x 50px it will just be fine to set height and width or at least the padding is very very hard to notice if there s some

12394956
bitwise-or	bitwise-and
they perform bitwise-or operations and bitwise-and operations with the result being stored in the lvalue

12394988

12395029
keydown	keyup
i want to be able to send a keydown message and a keyup message

12395073
folder	directory
as far as how the framework goes can i install this framework inside of my htdocs folder say placing it in its own dedicated folder at the same directory level as my application and forbid public access to it using .htaccess

12395126
button	checkbox
basically i would suggest you to create a delete button which executes the logic to delete the selected rows - i guess you are using a tempalte column with a checkbox inside

12395126
button	checkbox
so lets say the name of the class for the checkbox is cool then you can execute the following logic in the delete button click handler

12395153
width	margin
when true is passed it will take the outer width of a container including the margin

12395153
width	margin
therefore when you have an item of width 0 and take the outer width it will be only the padding margin border you don t want included in the width

12395174
apache	lighttpd
the lighttpd is running on the webserver on my computer i m using xampp with apache i set the same regex rules there and it works just fine

12395185
uitableview	nsindexpath
this is the code i use it is a part of - void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

12395307
maven	pom.xml
because you mention a pom.xml i assume you want to support maven users or you want to publish to a maven repository

12395307
ant	pom.xml
if that isn t true you don t need to publish to a pom.xml and you can just work with ivy metadata like in the ant ivy setup

12395310
ant	maven
can maven do what we are doing in this ant build.xml

12395316
google-chrome	firefox
if i remove this event google-chrome and firefox and still ie will receive my file

12395331
children	parent
my favourite approach is using windows powershell but you ll need to delete the blueprint children first before attempting to delete their parent

12395349
min	max
therefore and indexed views containing top or for the matter max or min which suffer from the very same problem cannot be maintained efficiently and are not permitted

12395362
getter	setter
furthermore if a local variable exists it takes precedence over getter and setter

12395362
getter	setter
i d say that this is bad language design if setter can t be called without self why should it be okay for getter - especially when it can lead to rickety context-sensitive code like the above

12395362
getter	setter
if you re using a getter or setter always use self even when it s not strictly necessary

12395362
getter	setter
and that ended up being a bit long-winded but i was unable to find a good demonstration of the getter setter local problem to link to

12395481
folder	directory
i have a directory with folder structure as follows

12395483
config	ini
then setting them in ini file makes further use of myqsli convenient since you don t have to parse any file define your own config simply connect

12395515
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
this is why most developers use concurrent nsoperation using asynchronous nsurlconnection to do the downloading - so the get the cancel message in real time

12395520
int	chars
i know typecasting int to chars is quite simple in plain-old c however i m wondering if the jni will negate any performance gains

12395520
int	chars
edit 2 i changed the text above to say that c code can cast from int to chars instead of int to byte

12395533
put	get
problem every time i add let s say a text view i get a green box around it that will put it in a location

12395549
ant	maven
as a last-ditch effort maven also has an antrun plugin allowing you to run custom ant tasks if need be

12395576
mouseover	mousedown
noticed that i declared px and py in the mousedown event making them accessible as a closure to the inner function that is bound to the mouseover event

12395608
folder	directory
to simpelify usage you can also add a .git file not directory in your dropbox synced folder with the content gitdir path to repo.git so that you can use git as normal

12395660
stateless	stateful
difference between stateful v stateless bean behavior when calling different methods

otherwise you re stuck moving everything server-side simulating the post on your own webserver and scraping the html to get the status back

12395909
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval will do it once-every-n-miliseconds and clearinterval will stop it when you re done

12395929
hide	show
onmouseover and onmouseout events are used to show hide the popup

12395929
google-chrome	firefox
in ie google-chrome and firefox in windows the system dialog disables events handling by page

12395929
mouseover	mouseout
which means if you move a mouse cursor out of the dialog window on one of the page element the page won t do anything like reacting on mouseover mouseout events

12395929
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
unfortunately in case with google-chrome firefox on mac safari is ok the page elements do react on mouse over out

12395929
pop-up	dialog
assuming having an upload form in a pop-up is a must what are the possible ways of keeping that panel form visible while system upload file dialog window is up

or better write it as a for-loop and apply a suitable #pragma and compiler options to make the compiler do loops unrolling for you

12396012
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
in ios 5 you can use the following call to start an nsurlconnection and add it to an nsoperationqueue

12396013
versioning	upgrade
if you recently upgrade to phpunit 3.6 there s a possibility you still have an older versioning of file_iterator installed and that s the problem based on a vague memory of the same error

12396013
versioning	upgrade
if anything looks not-right or just to be sure upgrade phpunit to ensure it s at the latest versioning and so are all dependencies

12396024
ant	maven
after recently converting to maven from ant run configurations that launched immediately pre-maven take an excessive amount of time and consume an abnormal amount of resources while eclipse prepares to launch the projects

12396024
maven	m2e
i am only using the latest m2e maven plugin with the latest version of eclipse

12396035
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome successfully parse the entire page correctly

12396035
google-chrome	firefox
again firefox and google-chrome do not have trouble interpreting or displaying this page

12396046
ready	each
for each branch you want to update with the caveat that i would generally advise against simply going through every branch until you re actually ready to do work on it

12396056
integer	unsigned
cf carry flag - similarly to the overflow flag of it can be used to determine overflow of integer arithmetic operations performed on unsigned operands

12396056
operands	decrement
the value of this flag tells whether the memory operands address es should be incremented or decrement after each iteration

12396137
put	get
i would like to do something like the above code to get the values in the duedate element so i could manipulate the values then put them back into ocrvar.duedate

12396159
mouseevent	mouselistener
you can add mouselistener to gui component whose top left pixel should be threated as 0 0 point and get x and y from mouseevent

12396191
google-chrome	firefox
using uploadify in firefox doesn t work while using it in google-chrome does

12396247
submit	submission
also i recommend to redirect user to the same page after form submission it ll prevent from repeated form submit on page refresh

12396252
ant	maven
for typical distribution you would use ant maven gradle to build your own jar file with the compiled groovy class files in it

12396281
nant	xmlpoke
you might also consider using nant xmlpoke if you are running from nant script

12396304

i m working on a firefox extension and i am trying to make it add an image stored with the extension the kind that you access using google-chrome although i m not sure if there is an official name

12396328
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux under ubuntu in a vm on windows 7

12396408
width	height
i only see 0 as height and width

12396443
hide	show
my guess is that in mobile and ie8 these sub-menus start out as hidden so this function does what it is supposed to show the sub-menu on first click and then hide it when clicked again

12396487
width	height
that way i get a box that is 220px width and 440px height it was important that the text box has the same size as the image

12396504
apache	nginx
they can be requested directly from the web server apache or nginx

12396506
width	height
the solution was to restrict the size of the context to maximum 2048 width and 1024 height

12396510

hadoop mr built under assumption that single split processing can be done using single node resources like ram or disk space

12396556
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
when you specify a height width or margin or anything else in your css it will display in the correct size on a normal display and a retina display will do the double pixel conversion internally so it uses double the device pixels

12396560
jar	war
this process can still slow down especially when redeploying large applications with multiple jar files and war files and all the classpath has to be refreshed

12396628

12396663
scala	typesafe
typesafe stack is a bundle of common scala tools if you happy with standalone play framework and don t use most of the stack tools just continue usage but if you are using sbt g8 and or akka it s a natural choice to have it all packed together you install stack and have instruments up and running

12397075
hide	show
both work on their own on the page - meaning - if i take out the nicescroll code and keep the show hide div code then i can click on the link and the page will become longer and a regular scroll bar will appear and i can scroll down to the bottom of the content

12397075
hide	show
conversely if i take out the show hide code just making the content show at the load of the page and leave in the nicescroll code then the page will load as a long page and the nicescroll bar will show up and work just fine

12397075
hide	show
into the function that is called when the show hide link is clicked hoping that would restart it but that didn t work either

12397075
hide	show
the show hide functions looks like this

12397075
hide	show
everything is wrapped in a div with id right which is why the nicescroll script applies it to #right which again works fine when i don t have the show hide functionality.

12397137
maven	pom.xml
we have a project that has worked fine in maven 2 but in maven 3 we are having issues with copy-dependencies when it s configured as an execution inside the project pom.xml

if you want to prevent a lot of setter getter you could implement magic setter getter

12397172
maven	pom.xml
eclipse junit launcher choose is a independent test runner which has its own pre-defined build and running life cycle and has nothing to do with maven it will not pick up your pom.xml magically and read in the surefire configuration and use them to drive the test running

i just don t want to install this one and then have to reinstall when the app store versioning comes out because then upgrade will be installed through the app store

12397225
decoder	encoder
but i d avoid any key encoder decoder approach if possible as you ll continue to pay the inconvenience of that in perpetuity where a json restructure would presumably be a one-time cost

12397249
hide	show
what s happening is that it s set to be visible by default so it show before the javascript jquery runs to hide it

12397287
mousemove	mousedown
i think i need to implement an if statement that says if mousemove mousedown use this cursor else if mousemove up use this cursor..

the point is that i need to migrate my entity model from using objectcontext and entityobjects to dbcontext and pocos then i want to go code-first

12397390
int	chars
instead of using a prepared string of chars you can cast between int and chars and generate a dynamic list of chars to select

12397390
int	chars
when i m doing random chars generation i prefer to work directly with int and cast them over instead of writing out the list of chars that i want to draw from

12397695
haskell	agda
moreover infinite processes are programmable in agda just as io processes are programmable in haskell the only restriction is that infinite processes cannot be unfolded indefinitely when being executed in the course of typechecking

12397695
agda	idris
i d recommend agda as the better vehicle for getting to grips with the ideas behind dependently typed programming but idris is the more practical option

12397703
getter	setter
thus you must have a getter and setter for every property that is to be serialised by xml serializer

nginx should work in front of apache or in front of php-fpm without apache at all which is even better

width	height
what i want to do is that everytime the width of the image is wider than the height of the image i want to rotate the picture by 90 degrees clockwise into landscape layout mode save it on app s documents folder and then present it on the screen - this way the picture of the widescreen tv appears 90 degrees rotated but the image aspect ratio is not totally destroyed

12398127
getter	setter
otherwise you can simply provide a settest method and it will automatically be used as the setter for the property even if you use the synthesize directive in which case the synthesize directive will only implement a getter

12398155

you can use 3u or 3ul or use the usual integer suffixes to change the type 3ull for unsigned long long

there is a particular reason for not using typedef with a struct that in the end is used as a type

typedef	struct
all typedef does is allows you to take out the struct part of the definition in this scenario and isn t necessary

stateless	stateful
stateless partially stateful and completely stateful apps

12428316
stateless	stateful
request-by-request basis a lift app can be stateful or stateless for example

12428324
int	chars
what i d like to do now is to generalize the above idea such that by only implementing the listf and currentf functions for a given z a b say a chars b int moveleft and moveright do the right thing automagically

12428326
width	height
when the picture is portrait height is greater than width the output is automatically rotated how can i prevent this behavior

12428332
post	get
i would use an ajax form to post the new comment and get the status message

12428334
equals	compareto
the compareto logic tells obviously how to sort the dataset and also tells the reducer what elements are equals so they can be grouped

12428375

12428575
16-bit	64bit
the 1024 bits are divided into 16 groups of 64bit each and each 16-bit group is appended with one parity bit

google-chrome	firefox
i m seeing strange behavior in google-chrome v21.0.1180.89 but it works fine in firefox

12428618

is this expected and google-chrome is behaving correctly or is firefox just being more tolerant

12428646

i d like the listview to display underneath the mapview and header in portrait mode and on the right of the mapview and underneath the header in landscape mode

12428838
width	height	portrait	landscape
i d also like the mapview s height in portrait and width in landscape to be a percentage of the available window size minus action bar status bar and navigation bar - if one exists on the device

12428838
width	height
i ve tried a few things recommended in similar questions but the solution always returns the height width of the device and not the window size of the activity

12428883

12428918
hide	show
i populated the tableview with some all-the-same cells for testing it but the table view won t show floating section headers the only thing where i can see section titles by the way anno 1 and anno 2 are the titles i need to show is the bar on the right is there anyway to hide this index bar

rails receives a get and shows the post but it does not destroy it

12429098
post	put
i would post code but i have tried so much i wouldn t know what to put anymore

12429143
getter	setter
the way you would do that is by making currentlat and currentlong private with public getter and setter and synchronizing the get set functions

12429149
portrait	landscape
i m not sure the answer here is to get the screen dimensions but rather to use appropriate layouts for portrait and landscape that use the weight property to allocate the screen space between the different views

12429157
junit	mockito	junit	powermockito
i m using junit mockito and powermockito

12429177

but your better option would be to wrap the main area in a div or other block element sectioning root set it to the width that you want and then center it with margin 0 auto

12429187
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol where each tabitem shows a listview

12429191
for-loop	loops
observation i noticed that i made a newbie s mistake -- i only used a single ctx.beginpath and ctx.moveto posx posy prior to the for-loop and a single ctx.stroke after the for-loop and loops itself wrapped a single ctx.lineto

12429195
addition	multiplication
i typically only use matrices for a short-time to take advantage of the syntax for multiplication but with the addition of the .dot method on arrays i find i do that less and less as well

12429237
getter	setter
experimentblock inherits its primary key field with annotations a getter and a setter from its superclass periodresident

12429237
getter	setter
this is the mystery of this bug the exact same field getter setter code is being used for every subclass of periodresident but experimentblock is the only one that eclipselink returns with a nulled-out primary key

12429241
backtracking	greedy
normally the term greedy is used to describe algorithms that do not backtracking

12429279
pandas	pytables
being a regular user of numpy i am falling in love with pandas for its syntax and concepts and started to read about pytables which seems very robust and performance-oriented

12429279
pandas	pytables
if i were to use a home-made framework composed by pandas + pytables which layer of the data-processing pipeline data importing converting analyzing storing retrieving should be delegated to each one

12429279
pandas	pytables
what s the natural talent of pandas and how it is related to the natural talent of pytables and how their talents relate

12429286
sharpbox	dropnet

12429286
sharpbox	dropnet
is there any way i can use those dropnet sharpbox etc in my monodroid app

12429287
cvs	svn
of course in cvs that would never have worked but since svn allows you to move files around on the server i presume it is smart enough to know how to merge files that have changed directories

12429306
getter	setter
in particular note that it defaults to public members only - which means that every public getter setter pair and every public field will be automatically bound to xml unless annotated by xmltransient

12429396
width	text-align
to get your centered text in the header is as simple as text-align center which will work no matter the width of the container

12429436

i am fairly new to xslt and have scanned through several post on the topic but cant seem to get the final peice i need to make this work

12429438
tablet	galaxy
i have tested it on samsung galaxy 1 and 2 note mobile devices and on a lenovo thinkpad tablet

12429454
children	parent
this makes the child parent more loosely coupled so that you could swap in any parent that implemented that protocol and the children would still work fine

12429468
required	placeholder
i initialized two threads in the constructor using the placeholder _1 as the argument required by member function fillsample int num

12429556
gevent	django-socketio

12429736
floating-point	integer
given your last two examples with 4543621235648200192 and such it seems you want to accept numbers that are integer multiples of .0001 and reject those that are not and you want to do this not using .0001 but using a variable that contains the floating-point value nearest .0001

12429736
floating-point	integer
for example it is possible perhaps not easy to answer this question is the floating-point value x the floating-point value nearest to an integer multiple of .0001

12429736
floating-point	integer
in other words is there an integer k such that multiplying .0001 by k and rounding to the nearest floating-point value produces exactly x

12429737
google-chrome	firefox
the page renders properly in ie but not firefox and google-chrome

12429742

i have a preferencescreen made with a custom listpreference and a checkboxpreference

fyi i am using range min for these sliders

12429821
width	height
width 1600 height 530 mode crop scale downsizeonly

12429821
width	height
browser window size 1600 width x 530 height

12429821
width	height
orignal image size 1024 width x 768 height

12429821
width	height
expected result 1024 width x 530 height so it should crop the remaining height

12429821
width	height
height and its cropping is ok but 1600 width is wrong i want it to be 1024 width so image didnt loose quality

12429831
strcpy	memmove	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	strcpy
what happens if you use your knowledge of the lengths of the strings and use memmove or memcpy instead of strcpy and strcat

12429831
strcpy	memmove
marcus yes memmove is faster than strcpy and faster than python but why

12429831
memcpy	memmove
knowing that length allows python to use memmove or memcpy the difference being that memmove works correctly even if the source and destination overlap

12429831
memcpy	memmove
it is relatively unlikely that they ve got anything faster than memmove memcpy available

12429831
strcpy	memmove	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	strcpy
i modified the c code to produce more stable timings for me on my machine mac os x 10.7.4 8 gib 1333 mhz ram 2.3 ghz intel core i7 gcc 4.7.1 and to compare strcpy and strcat vs memcpy vs memmove

12429831
debian	linux
on linux debian 5.0.9 amd64 the differences seem to be negligible

12429863

12429890
xmlpullparser	saxparser
as far as parsing xml you can use the xmlpullparser or saxparser

mouseup	mouseleave
to avoid this i decided to force draggable to stop when the mouseleave the #window tiggering mouseup i read this on the forum and it works

12429899
move	drag
and now the problem when the mouse is move again and drag event is trigged it remembers the distance with the box and magically move it without touching.

12429942
getter	setter
it will not work in your case because your getter method is not projected by the lock which protects the setter method

12430021
accessor	properties
note the use of the object properties accessor

12430053
put	get	hide	show
following is my javascript in which i ve been trying to show certain div and after the function being performed the div should get hide by itself but i am having this issue that in same function both doesnot work like to show first then after some time interval hide that div but when i put event of show and hiding separately it worked fine

integer	unsigned
note that cgglyph is not an object type but an unsigned integer

12430316
bmp	tga
now this window supports functions to export the plot to bitmap tga jpg and bmp

12430316
width	height
i managed to get hold of the cdc device handler and use the hdc of it to create an empty emf with the same width height as the plot however i have no clue of how to migrate the content of the plot onto the emf file

12430339
cout	cin
i m developing a class for large number arithmetic it now knows how to do addition handle cin and cout

12430339
cout	cin
i will detail how it handle cin and cout here

12430386

uiview	subviews
i have a uiview which is a subviews and it contains several uitextfields

12430397
hide	show
everything works fine if the datetextfield is the first field to edit but when another textfield is edited and of course show the keyboard and then try to edit the datefield the keyboard doesn t hide and everything goes normal but with the keyboard doing anything

12430443
uiview	subviews
the best way is to use a custom view your custom navigation bar as a subviews of the main view then do the animations yourself using functions like uiview animatewithduration .... with translation function using something like catransform3dtranslate

12430451
division	multiplication
since the multiplication and division segments are right next to eachother just read from left to right for that part

12430451
division	multiplication
remember when multiplication and division are right next to each-other just read left to right

12430544
put	get
i would like to be able to put up my project to our git server and make my colleagues able to pull the project and get to work without having to struggle with getting the same sdk s of the same versions as i used setup and referenced in the project

12430576
implements	extends
you can easily implements a myspace-like system in asp.net assuming that each skinnable feature is implements as a control subclass just extends your render method to allow for the insertion of said arbitrary html

12430607
width	height	opera	firefox
so i did a test of the actual size width and height of the jquery ui combobox button on the jquery demo page in opera 12 ie9 and firefox 15 to see if it was a zoom thing or something else

12430607
width	height
opera width height 30px 25px

i have tested it in google-chrome ie and firefox all with same results

12430668
width	height

12430668
width	height
but the height and width are not set instead the background yes

12430668
width	height
can you let me know how can i set the width and height through css style classes

12430715
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in some browsers firefox and google-chrome but not in others safari

12430724
button	checkbox
so to use multiple option button as checkbox you will need to store the correct value of the option button probably in an array .

12430809
firefox	safari
i have checked in firefox ie and safari which all yield the same results

12430855
keydown	keyup
using keypress prevents the bounce effect that keyup has keydown also does but event.which doesn t distinguish directly between upper and lower case here--shift key check is messy owing to caps lock

12430897
matplotlib	scipy
if you would like to easily install ipython scipy matplotlib etc

12430906
min	max
assuming that pids cannot be repeated this is a trivial task put everything in a table select min time max time pid group by pid

12430921
innodb	myisam
i decided to change the table engine from myisam to innodb

12430942
client-side	server-side
if you re talking about some application that runs solely client-side with no server-side processing whatsoever then there s really no such thing as pre-processing

12430953
web-inf	xwiki
i m trying to write a class separately from my project and separate from the xwiki package it up as a jar and put it in the xwiki web-inf lib folder of the xwiki project as that s what the instructions say for the xwiki custom authentication

12430953
web-inf	xwiki
how am i supposed to create a class that extends some of the xwiki classes if it s a separate class that needs to go into xwiki s web-inf lib folder

12430966
guava	java.util.concurrent
also iirc there s a concern that many of the components used like those in java.util.concurrent or guava may assume that interruptions are solely for cancellation so if you use interruption for something else those objects may not do what you want

12430990
move	drag
if you click and drag it you can move a dark version of it around the screen

12430992
move	drag
by having a margin between tiles and allowing them to move over into another tile s space before a collision detection began and then springing back into their correct places when the user released the drag

viewdidload	viewdidappear
here is my implementation of the viewdidload and viewdidappear methods

12431072
ctypes	boost-python
but you can wrap up any c or c++ library i d start with sp pretty easily as long as you re comfortable writing your own wrapped in c cython boost-python whatever or using ctypes

12431078
width	height
the best way is to replace the image with a div that has the same width and height of the image and set the background-image property to the image you want

12431137
post	get
in chrome the same action just does a normal get on the link without any of the post data

12431159
mp4	h.264
both videos open and play perfectly in vlc so i don t think there s any issue with a corrupted file and both are mp4 s with an h.264 format using yuv color space

12431171
hash	md5
it seems the hash function uses md5 by default though when i specify md5 in hashbytes it returns the same value but with a 0x prefix

12431364
int	boolean
that means strtotime is returning a boolean false to indicate failure and then you force php to convert that false to an int 0 to handle your minus 3600 calculation

12431434
margin	height
i need to dynamically find the full height of an element usually a div including padding margin and border

12431452
daemons	launchd
if you peek into the teamviewer_linux.rpm for example by running the command rpm -qpl teamviewer_linux.rpm you won t find any launchd agents and daemons since on centos teamviewer is wrapped around a windows emulator wine

12431459
asterisk	freeswitch
you can use the asterisk ices command 1 or install a parallel freeswitch server bridge both servers and use freeswitch s mod_shout 3

12431459
asterisk	freeswitch
you can use freeswitch and asterisk together to solve this

12431459
asterisk	freeswitch
make a call to freeswitch from asterisk instead the ices command

12431472
libsvm	liblinear
in the case of linear kernels libsvm and liblinear produce similar results

12431615
mp3	flv
could i use xuggler and convert to mp3 without downloading flv

12431647
textview	imageview
one kind of kludgy solution that seems to work is to add a blank textview in a third column to force the 2nd column holding the imageview to be exactly the width of the imageview s bitmap

12431687
portrait	landscape
when a list item is selected the landscape view should show the list and the details side-by-side while the portrait view should show only the details fullscreen

12431687
portrait	landscape
when nothing has been selected the landscape view should show the left on the left and blank space on the right while the portrait view should show only the list fullscreen

12431687
portrait	landscape
consider the opposite case shown above -- rotating from portrait to landscape while the details are visible means the details activity would need to be finish ed so the main activity could display the two-pane layout but this also destroys the details fragment and its savedinstancestate

12431687
portrait	landscape
consider the case in the image -- rotating from landscape to portrait when the details are visible should show show the details single-pane but how do i properly manage the back stack and actionbar home icon to show the list single-pane

12431730
width	height
create an element with zero width and height and outline 8px solid invert

12431757
ioexception	printwriter
printwriter and printstream never throw ioexception

12431765
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it seems to work fine on safari firefox and ie but is not working consistently in google-chrome sometimes it does sometimes it doesn t

12431792
ioexception	printwriter
the fact printwriter doesn t report ioexception makes it a poor choice for writing text to a socket where you often need to know the connection has failed

12431812
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and opera you can use event.detail property if it is not predefined by inituievent

12431824
put	get
do note that that difference will get smaller the more actual code you put into your functions though

12431879
listview	gridview
on datagrid the the way i deal with it is listview gridview and calculate the width of each column

12431887
int	chars
the table unicode contains each unicode chars along with an id it s int encoding value

12431955
post	get
the browser sends a get for the original page immediately followed by a post for the same page

12431955
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried google-chrome firefox on a mac and ie 9 on windows and they all demonstrate the problem

12431955
post	get
i ve seen questions about post followed by get but i haven t been able to find this situation

12431959
post	get
i suspect they are caching the conversion so the first person that post a youtube link has to wait for the download and convert all subsequent users just get the already processed file immediately

12431964
openssl	libcrypto
since i am cross compiling openssl i need only the libssl and libcrypto with architecture armv7 other intermediate executables should build with i386 architecture

cout	cin
but if this is just to make std cout and std cin more convenient i wouldn t bother

12433100
cout	cin
if you re really just going to pass them on to cin and cout you can save typing by using a template member function like

12433101

actually when you are use r.id.listtextview as a parameter in simpleadapter then its directly accessed by adapter to create view so it is every time new not what you have defined in oncreate of activity so either using custom textview and adding font typeface to it in xml and then use it as argument in simpleadapter or write customadapter and in getview of it re-define textview using view inflater and set font typeface in this method

what i would like to develop is an hourly cron job which will run the query against the postgresql database then insert the results into the mysql database

12437379
getter	setter	ivar	subclassing
obviously i m able to set the numberofbackseatpassengers on the sportscar - even though that ivar was declared as private - but that s because i made it an property in car.h which means that the synthesized getter and setter for it are instance methods thereby available to all subclassing of car

12437379
getter	setter
the other option would have been to not declare numberofbackseatpassengers as an property in car.h keep it there as only a simple ivar and instead manually create a setter and getter for it in the implementation of car.m like this

12437379
getter	setter
this would have made the getter and setter for numberofbackseatpassengers available only within car.m - which i suppose would make them private - but they d be too private i could never call them from main or from anywhere outside of car.m moreover and this is the real point doing it this way means the private directive back in car.h doesn t really come into play at all in any of this

12437379
getter	setter
i mean i could now go back to car.h take out the private directive there -- and my manual setter and getter for numberofbackseatpassengers would still work exactly the same as they are now being supposedly private - so what s to be gained with private

12437379
getter	setter
2 aroth s also absolutely right in saying that in sportscar we can simply override the car class s setter and getter for numberofbackseatpassengers and have these overriding methods reset it to 0 or give an error etc

12437379
getter	setter	ivar	subclassing
or is there still some instance where you d want to declare an ivar in the header as private but not declare a setter and getter for it there in the header - so those won t be explicitly available to subclassing - and have it all make sense

12437379
ivar	subclassing
- we could solve a lot of problems - but its still very likely that sooner or later we ll run into a situation where we d perhaps want an private ivar for one of our classes and not want to create another subclassing to deal with it

12437379
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
i keep trying to think of a real-world example of some properties of a car that we would want only the car to have - and that none of its subclassing should inherited

12437379
getter	setter
cause its not like putting private in front of phantomivar freed us up to still be able write a setter getter for it in the header and have those be only accessible to car class objects and not subclasses of car

12437379
getter	setter
to get privacy you d have to go in the implementation file and write your setter and getter there

12437398
jar	war
i commented properties for war building and uncommented properties for jar building

12437445

12437447
accessor	properties
your current code simply calls into the same properties accessor method infinitely until you run out of stack space

12437460
getter	setter
this would have made the getter and setter for

12437460
getter	setter
the compiler wouldn t treat them as publicly visible and would complain if you tried to call them directly but you d still be able to call your getter and setter on any subclass of car simply by using performselector

12437460
getter	setter
i d suggest that if sportscar is meant to extend car and never allow any backseat passengers to be recorded that the standard way to do that would be to simply override the getter setter methods in sportscar to either always set return 0 or to raise some error if an attempt is made to set a nonzero value

12437460
ivar	subclassing
so a subclassing of car will not be able to see the numberofbackseatpassengers ivar itself

12437460
getter	setter	ivar	subclassing
but since you ve created a public getter setter for it the subclassing will of course be able to see those and use them to modify the value of the ivar

12437460
public	protected
without private protected every ivar declared in a header would be public which is definitely not good in an object-oriented environment for all the reasons jonathan pointed out

12437460
getter	setter
as for use-cases properties with getter setter are probably not the best example

12437460
getter	setter
the purpose of getter setter is virtually always to provide a public interface for modifying querying the property value and as noted in objective-c it s not necessary to explicitly declare an ivar in any scope to back a synthesized property

12437460
getter	setter
so you would declare them in your header and you generally would not add any getter setter methods for these ivars

12437460
ivar	subclassing
so subclassing can use the datarecorder through the api but they can t mess with the backing ivar itself to disable or modify the behavior of the mandated black-box data recorder

when i replaced the bionic libc from the gingerbread 2.3.4 sources distribution with the libc from the ti dsp sources it resolved all of my libc reference errors

12438036
bionic	libc
suggestion i would make sure that the c library which your android.mk build is pointing to for linking is the c library provided for the dsp project and not the default android bionic libc

12438077
qitemdelegate	qabstractitemview
2a is the default behavior and 2b can likely be achieved by using qabstractitemview setcurrentindex in a re-implementation of qitemdelegate eventfilter as suggested here in a similar context

use ie tab available for google-chrome and firefox and set that to handle all links of the form file by adding an autourls entry like this

12438088
translation	localization
i think you are mixing up localization with translation here

12438139
folder	directory
a good article covering what i ve said above as well as delving into code to copy the db from your assets folder to the databases directory can be found here

12438139
folder	directory
you cannot put the db directly into your apps data directory as its blocked from access by anything except your app unless you root your device so you must put it in your assets folder and then copy it from there to your apps data directory or somewhere else that it can be used.

mongodb	bson
i am just starting out with mongodb and one of the things that i have noticed is that it uses bson to store data internally

12438280
mongodb	bson
however the documentation is not exactly clear on what bson is and how it is used in mongodb

12438314

note it sometimes works as expected the nested svg stays crisp in firefox and google-chrome but not always for example if i open the attached jsfiddle in google-chrome it s blury broken

12438353
mongodb	bson
bson is the binary encoding of json-like documents that mongodb uses when storing documents in collections

12438353
mongodb	bson
in practice you don t have to know much about bson when working with mongodb you just need to use the native types of your language and the supplied types objectid of its driver when constructing documents and they will be mapped into the appropriate bson type by the driver

12438370
int	chars
string.charat i will return a chars and string.charat i - 0 will return the actual int value

12438382
int	chars
i don t know what is the purpose of this specific operation but in java and in many programming languages chars chars are represented as an int value only smaller 2 bytes in java

12438382
int	chars
you can explicitly cast chars to int like this

12438382
int	chars
the string.charat function returns a chars and if you treat it like an int it has a value like 120 only an example

12438472
min	max
you can use min and max to constrain a value

12438484
superclass	subclassing
the method has been overridden in the subclassing so it s effectively replacing the method on the superclass

12438484
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing itself can call the method in the superclass

12438497
int	chars
what you re trying to do is read a chars one at a time convert it to an int and store it in your array

12438523
int	chars
edit but as bali182 said just casting the chars to an int is more readable

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you want a full compatibility with almost all the browsers in usage from ie 5+ onwards i m saying ie cuz this one is the shittiest and the hardest one to achieve compatibility for firefox google-chrome safari dolphin mobile phone browsers etc the modular design of the closure library enables you to compute browser specific css at runtime without it having to be an expensive process

12440117
width	height
what i can see here is you are creating a new webview so either specify height and width to webview or add webview control to xaml with some name and specific height and width .

12440125
filtering	grouping
with that in mind you should either name all your grouping or filtering out numeric grouping names

12440127
int	double
if you used an id column definition like id int primary key autoincrement where the system defined the values automatically for you this isn t an issue but if you manually populated the id column it might be something to double check

the idea is that i m re-creating them in a for-loop because the length of these arrays changes inside it

12440365
put	get	google-chrome	firefox
the accepted answer for this question is concise and nicely put together function - don t get me wrong - but it s about 70 slower than just scanning the string with a for-loop in my tests on firefox google-chrome at least .

12440389
folder	directory
other files in the directory include the gemfile.lock which was created through bundle install if i remember correctly and folder for r18n public views

int	double
is there a guarantee that a ieee 754 real number float double etc can cover all int within its range

12442735
integer	fractions
a 32-bit float can represent many values that a 32-bit signed integer can t either because they re fractions 0.5 or because they re too big 2.0 100

12442741
int	double
use d for int instead of i and f and for double instead of d in the following line

12442770
put	get
however put more thought into your solution and i guarantee you ll get more points than a simple work-around

12442805
chunked	transfer-encoding
though to be honest i like the idea suggested by user189423 of multipart content-type or chunked transfer-encoding as well

std	ostream
the proper way to do something like this is to have a stream buffer writing to multiple destinations and use this stream buffer via a std ostream

12443391
ostringstream	std
still creates a stream which should actually be a std ostringstream and allocates some memory

12443433

12444226
ffmpeg	libav
ffmpeg merges most commits from libav but it s not as reciprocal so libav does not have as many features

virtuemart	prestashop
i am using it for the last two weeks and i am planning to switch all my customers from virtuemart to prestashop

getter	setter
the main point is that you put that xmlelement tag above the variable declaration versus putting it on a getter or setter

12444277
for-loop	arrays
you say that in the code before the value of y should stay the same which means for every other index of y in the 2-d arrays they re set to null but in the for-loop you have this

12444307

similar to calibrating a single camera 2d image with a chessboard i wish to determine the width height of the chessboard or of a single square in pixels

12444307
width	height
i am using the camera to determine the translation between consequtive frames successfully achieved using fourier phase correlation at the moment my result returns the translation in pixels however i would like to use techniques similar to calibration where i move the camera over the chessboard which is flat on the ground to automatically determine the size of the chessboard in pixels relative to my image height and width

12444359
google-chrome	firefox
it works normal in firefox and google-chrome

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works great on google-chrome safari and firefox but ie7-9 does not play well

12444641
put	get
problem since the browser usually has default actions on key combos like ctrl d activates the bookmark window or ctrl shift c activates skynote on maxthon you might also want to add return false after so users of your site won t get frustrated when the duplicate file function being put on ctrl d bookmarks the page instead

width	height
for the camera s height and width i use gdx.graphics.getheight

12449229
width	height
i set the cameras position to the camera s width divided by the two and its height divided by two.

12449229
width	height
when i draw the texture i set it s position to the camera s width and height divided by two -- so it s centered..or so i think

12449246
explode	implode
i highly suggest to use php for this one as you said yourself and explode your data replace what you want and then implode it back and update your record .

12449251
ant	maven
under an ant project you can change compiler flags by going to project properties - compiling but maven projects don t seem to have any such option

12449263
post	get
ps i don t want to frame a get kind of urls for my post request

12449292
portrait	landscape
since a recoded video s orientation has to be portrait or landscape it ll error out on you

12449297
innodb	myisam
as far as data portability is concerned an innodb database will be completely accepted by myisam because myisam does not check data integrity is there a user number 4 in the user database when i insert a new record in user_car for example

12449297
innodb	myisam
if you start out with myisam exporting to a full-fledged innodb database will be a nightmare even if your data has all keys table data must be imported in the correct order user and car before user_car

12449297
innodb	myisam
never simply because less people use it therefore you will have less support as compared to myisam and innodb

12449333
children	parent
now when i persist parent the children in childrenuuids are automatically persisted because the manytoone relationship

12449372
post	get
anyway what a huge post on a two year old question - be good to get some feedback though.

12449400
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
of course if you haven t additional ip s you can also use apache as a proxy however as far as i know nginx or lighttpd are just much faster for this task

12449469
integer	unsigned
i am working with an assignment where i have to write a c function that calculates log2 of an unsigned integer n by finding the most significant set bit and returning the position of that bit

12449471
for-loop	loops
you can simplify your while loops by just using a for-loop and a range object

12449471
dictionary	map
to actually make your code spit out the real song with spelled-out numbers use a dictionary to map numbers to words

12449504
strncmp	strcmp
as was stated in previous answers you should use the strcmp or strncmp functions from the string.h library to compare strings

12449506
folder	directory
ensure that existing folder in the root directory work

12449567
uitableview	nsindexpath
first thing i will try to debug is - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath method

12449571
srp	principles
since one of the tags of your questions is oop and one of the solid principles of oop is the single responsibility principles it might be a good idea to try to follow srp

12449601
versioning	upgrade
i need this so if someone has used my free app for a few weeks and saved a lot of data they can upgrade to the full versioning and their data will be preserved

12449618
nswindow	nsstatusitem
assuming that you know how to display your ui in a nswindow and separately in a nsstatusitem then you can switch from one ui to the other by

12449618
nswindow	nsstatusitem
hiding the nswindow and showing the nsstatusitem

12449618
nswindow	nsstatusitem
hiding the nsstatusitem and showing the nswindow

12449621
hide	show
i would like to show the header in the top of my page and hide it when scrolled like this site

12449648
folder	directory
so basically i think i need to write a condition that looks for the folder people and removes the third directory from the url

12449657
google-chrome	safari
now i added it in the body and works well in google-chrome and safari but not in the others

12449695
factors	matrix
for some matrix i can avoid this by using cholesky factorization instead which factors to c hh which at least for this is mostly okay but this requires a matrix that s positive definite

12449714
hide	show
i can hide show it on checkbox selection

12449753
width	height
i also gave the width and height 200 but you can make it dinamic something like

12449758
button	checkbox
i ve made dynamic forms that can update an entire list of options with a single submit button using the technique but for some reason i am having issues achieving the same thing with checkbox inputs

12449769
xuggle	vlcj
i have worked with this issue for several days and researched using the following existing frameworks jmf fmj vlcj xuggle jmyron javafx javacv

12449771
minimum	max
the principle means the minimum number you need equals to the number of max matching pairs

12449796
comparator	comparable
you can provide a comparator for comparing any type you wish comparable or otherwise

12449799
min	max
it can be equally converted to min cost max flow problem you may check out that

12449800
plone	buildout
finally in the eggs section of your buildout you tell plone to actually install the product

12449807
post	get
has more than 500 post and get the feed of each category

12449821
ctime	strftime
the c format is the same as is used by ctime but strftime is more flexible

12449855
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you can see it in action in firefox google-chrome safari etc under enter names for the guestlist here

12449861
google-chrome	firefox
on clicking it it shows main.php page in live view in dreamweaver but not in google-chrome and firefox

12449868
gentoo	ubuntu
i saw somewhere that arch gentoo ubuntu server without any packages selected during the installation slackware susestudio etc

12449925
for-loop	while-loop	for-loop	loops	loops	while-loop
- its always better to use for-loop when you know the exact nos of time you gonna loops and if you are not sure of it go for while-loop

12449930
google-chrome	firefox
this happens under mac lion with both google-chrome and firefox

12449954
dictionary	map
if say you cache the result of each factorial call in a dictionary a map from n - factorial n you will get an algorithmic complexity which is equal to the iterative one but

12449962
getter	setter
if you go down this path you can simply add any getter setter or other method to your application extension to store retrieve data and do operations on it

12450002
getter	setter
hibernate will access the field directly and not use the getter or setter

12450002
getter	setter
if there annotations are on a getter then only the getter are considered for persistence and the state is accessed via the getter setter

12450014
textview	imageview
alright what i m trying to do is setting an imageview to be on the right and the 3 textview will be located on the left relative to the image

12450014
textview	imageview
with the following xml code the imageview is on the left and the 3 textview are located in the right of the imageview

12450019
post	get
but how do i get this to run in php in my functions.php file when i save a post each time

12450035
int	chars
the int representation of a chars need not be the base 10 representation of the chars that you see in your string and typically isn t

12450035
int	chars
you need to explicitly convert the chars to an int value

12450035
int	chars
one trick is to subtract the integral value of 0 from a chars that represents a number to get an int conversion 5 - 0 yields 5

12450035
int	chars
presumably you don t want to include that value in your sum but if you do as you see it won t influence the sum as the null chars also has an int value of zero

12450040
hide	show
then simply show it whenever you hide the header

12450061
rss	feed
and some suggested using twitter4j and others uses public rss feed

12450080
post	get
i think you can add your text into a get parameter or a post parameter for your http request

12450098
fish	bash
bash fish command to print absolute path to a file

12450175
width	height
an object according to only that point will just redraw the object with the lower left corner in another point and the rest part will be determined according to the height and the width of the object which does not do what i want

12450178
button	checkbox
if the user didn t check the checkbox before hitting the reset button then nothing special happens

12450199
int	double
i have to make a program that takes two input int and squares the smaller one and double the larger one and keeps the int the same if the two inputs are the same

12450239
inherited	properties
if you force dependency properties all viewmodels need to inherited from dependencyobject

12450262
dictionary	map
since the user input has to be digits you need to create a dictionary to map the digits to numbers in words 1 becomes one

12450266
jar	war
in jboss as 7 applications that are packaged as top-level archives such as war jar and sar are assigned the following module name

12450313
g++	gcc
first of all you should use gcc instead of g++ to produce the exe file

12450360
daemons	systemd
systemd daemons all permissions possible which includes read write and execute to given file or directory

12450387
public	protected
but be carefull with this method you cannot access to protected properties and methods of current instance from this other context only to public elements

12450431
marmalade	bada
loader loads marmalade code that is same for ios android bada and other arm platforms

12450435
getter	setter
also you need getter and setter methods for all the class attributes and a default constructor

12450442
awt	swing
you might like to read is it safe to construct swing awt widgets not on the event dispatch thread

12450454
setinterval	settimeout
you can use setinterval to call a function periodically or settimeout to call a function after a while

12450470
put	get
i m trying to extract information from xml using xpath and put it into a page but i m not able to get a result

12450491
ubuntu	linux
i work under linux ubuntu 12.04 so i use wine for launching the programs

12450522
ember.js	backbone.js
it is framework-agnostic and you can use it with angular reactjs ember.js backbone.js or your framework of choice

12450594
post	get
so i tried to follow the advice from the get a histogram plot of factor frequencies summary post but i think that the problem is that i m trying to define my factors using a row containing strings instead of say generating one using rep

12450610
yacc	bison
making a robust lexical analyzer and parser is the subject of many libraries lex and yacc flex and bison etc. can be an application of others such as regular expressions and is even entire college courses

12450611
google-chrome	safari
- for example safari or google-chrome have this cool feature inspect element on the context-menu if you right click on an element - and voila here is the solution

12450613
put	get
ideally i would like to put the output in a matrix as follows once i get the counts

12450657
width	height
so is it possible to iterate through all the tags within the and change the height and width that way

12450682
x86	64bit
64bit x86 cpus are still heavily optimized for efficient manipulation of 32-bit values

12450688
mouse	keyboard
it launchs xquartz but does t seem to simulate mouse click or keyboard inputs like before

12450698
setinterval	settimeout
as mentioned in javascript the good parts by douglas crockford passing a string to settimeout or setinterval invokes eval and should be avoided

12450728
apache	nginx
by using the jre or some other runtime environment is it possible to compile java code on a web server such as apache or nginx

12450776
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works on firefox but not google-chrome nor safari

12450776
google-chrome	safari
any idea how to make it work on google-chrome and safari

12450783
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning is in progress but i would still like to know what caused this

12450804
installation	upgrade
i have upgrade from os 10.6 to 10.8 and done a full new installation of xcode command line tools macports and pip

12450829
try-catch	exception-handling
so in those cases the best you can do is use a try-catch block to deal with exception-handling

12450829
iprincipal	iidentity
the alternative is to completely throw away membership and create your own iprincipal and iidentity implementations and simply write your own user management i would still use the sqlmanagementprovider source as a basis for this however as it s a good implementation

12450829
iprincipal	iidentity
if you can t accept a dt then either change your workflows change your code to work with a try-catch-finally statement though this won t guarantee rollback in case the app code dies suddenly like a power outage or use a custom iprincipal and iidentity implementation

12450852
erd	diagram
so huge in fact that when i went to view the erd it took up 3 plot diagram

12450880
children	parent
tree structures with multiple children are easy enough oct-tree quad-tree binary tree etc. but coming up with an elegant system where whenever a parent spawns multiple children the children are also implicitly linked to only specific siblings was a mind-twister for me

12450958
hide	show
that is loop through all elements with the state class and hide them then show just the one that was passed into the function with

12451067
post	get
if you wish to get the file name check this post

12451088
post	get
think about what happens in process_step if if s not step 0 or if it s a get rather than a post or if the form is not valid

12451089
opentbs	libreoffice
opentbs is provided with a synopsis of the main elements of ms office and libreoffice

12451144
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this only seems to happen with firefox tested on google-chrome and safari as well

12451190
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	cakephp	kohana
there are better frameworks for beginners like codeigniter kohana or cakephp - you should start there imo.

12451209
sorting	filtering
i created an app with real time filtering and sorting the list changed dynamically when text in a textbox changed

12451209
sorting	filtering
i used an in place quicksort for sorting and visibility property for filtering items

12451209
sorting	filtering
after sorting filtering was done i fired notifypropertychanged mylist

12451269
superclass	subclassing
i m had the same problem as well and i thought i had a valid reason to delete the class attribute in the subclassing my superclass call it a had a read-only property that provided the value of the attribute but in my subclassing call it b the attribute was a read write instance variable

12451269
implements	extends
since python has duck typing it does not really matter that b does not extends a i can still use them in the same places since they implicitly implements the same interface

12451276
post	get
if you want to default the checkbox to ticked then you can use to detect a get or a post

12451276
post	get
you could also use instead of to default the value from the post or from the query string via a get

12451294
folder	dir
just tested this in eclipse debugger and the commandline arguments are correctly placed in args you may check if the file you test with are in your project folder or actual dir . because if not it will otherwise prompt for new files anyway

12451301
int	chars
if you require the behaviour that you expected on x86 you ll have to explicitly build the int from chars ie assuming little-endian

12451305
int	double
in c# i work with complex data from database that must often contain int double strings all in one element

12451305
int	double
this is so i can work with grouped strings int double in the same element

12451310
maven	pom.xml
the maven jetty plugin documentation does claim that the default context will be named the same as the artifactid in the pom.xml but that doesn t seem to be working here

12451326
int	chars
perl strings are conceptually strings of chars which are positive 32-bit int that normally represent unicode code points

12451345
stdout	stderr
2 the file descriptors for stdin stdout and stderr are 0 1 and 2 respectively

12451345
stdout	stderr
it is sometimes useful to assign one of these additional file descriptors to stdin stdout or stderr as a temporary duplicate link.

12451398
nginx	lighttpd
lighttpd nginx and others use a range of techniques to provide maximum application performance such as aio sendfile mmio caching and epoll and lock free data structures

12451398
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
so we tested it with apache bench and compared ours with lighttpd and nginx and have at least matched the performance for static content for files from 100 bytes to 1k

12451429
folder	directory
im trying to display all the folder that are in a specific directory

12451431
decoder	encoder
json â json encoder and decoder in the python documentation but it s pretty discouraging to read through this horrible-looking documentation

12451432
uitableview	uipickerview
i solved my problem here add a search function to uipickerview in xcode or open select menu in uitableview

12451482
put	get
but when i use fgets to get all the chatlogs from the server it doesnt return it bascially for example when i write something in the textfield and send it using the button in the following code it sends message to the server i want it to return that value back from the server or get all the chatlogs from the server and put it into the client which is a php website here is the code

12451495
width	height
so my question is how do i add 9 boxes of size width 10 height 10 to this larger box

12451530
min	max
this is equivalent to finding the min and max of the array where min appears before the max

12451544
disk	ram
regarding exe file in memory constraint can you copy it to ram disk

12451576
width	height
jquery actually overwrites your min-width and min-height by width and height so what you could do is this

12451581
knitr	latex
the module knitr requires a package that is not available in your latex installation or a converter that you have not installed

12451597
post	get
a get or for any post

12451599
hide	show
hide the elements first then show the one you want

12451612
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox google-chrome and safari does it in a way where if you click on the anchor link the radio button beside it is not selected automatically - which means there wouldn t be anything preventing the user from being directed to the anchor element

12451616
udp	tcp
tcp is 6 and udp is 17

12451616
winpcap	libpcap
you should be using libpcap winpcap to read the pcap file as that also means your program may be able to read some pcap-ng files as well if it s using a sufficiently recent version of libpcap.

12451633
sorting	grouping
i ve tested it on a sample collection based on your schema and it works for me sorting the grouping post codes by number of students descending

12451641
width	height
each big image has to have the css height set to auto and the width set to 100 because i am making a responsive fluid layout

12451641
width	height
but height auto and width 100 are set in this example to 600ms after the attributes do their replacing

12451641
width	height
this doesn t work because i am using isotope jquery plugin for this and this plugin needs the real width and height of the element to position the grid properly

12451641
width	height
when height auto and width 100 are set during the loading of an image the plugin gets lost and makes positions the elements incorrectly

12451647
jtextfield	jlabel
i have several jpanel s with which contain jlabel s and jtextfield s for user input in my swing application

12451647
jtextfield	jlabel
i can tweak the hgap to make my jlabel s and jtextfield s the right size but i will have to do this individually for all of the jpanel s

12451659
post	get
edit also see my older post about this programm to get background informations c# - making a backgroundimage update in real time while editing it in other programs

12451664
children	parent
each category can have a parent and children

12451666
ordinals	difference
difference between ordinals will remain the same as they belong to the same partitioning criteria and date series

12451687
post	get
this code waste about 2.5seconds on 3g or wifi to send the post and get just ok string from server even with good wifi this time down only to 2.2 2.0 seconds

12451692
capistrano	rvm
so i installed those on production...specifically rvm capistrano gem and rmagick

12451692
capistrano	rvm
the rvm capistrano gem was the main problem and reason i was getting errors when i depoloyed

12451701
portrait	landscape

12451755
for-loop	loops
i have a lambda inside a for-loop with loops variable parameter in the lambda

12451775
rss	feed
so as i understand it the plugin grabs content from external rss feed and creates them as posts in your website

12451783
solaris	aix
there is a pretty large difference bewtween sed for the aix vs solaris vs the gnu seds usually found in a lunix

12451784
scheme	racket
if you re interested in the subject take a look at scheme and especially the racket programming language

12451815
udp	tcp
however you should be aware that reliable udp will generally perform much worse than plain old tcp

12451815
udp	tcp
if you implement reliability on top of udp by necessity you will need to implement something functionally equivalent to tcp and then several factors will penalize you

12451815
udp	tcp
what can make udp faster in some circumstances is discarding much of the work that tcp does by being unreliable

12451815
udp	tcp
so many games send movement data over one unreliable udp channel then all control messages over a more reliable tcp channel

12451866
pull	push
but whenever i try to push or pull i get

12451930
hide	show
how do i only show the selected div and hide the others

12451932
folder	directory
everything is working fine on localhost myweb but when i upload the folder myweb to my public_html directory i get error

12451970
hide	show
to hide all other div s but the one chosen in the dropdown menu you can hide them all and then just show the one that was selected

12451971
put	get
to get back put a back button in the toolbar that pops the push or pushes back to the original

12451973
serializable	deserialization
this document was used to populate that value in the database so it appears that only deserialization is an issue and serializable is fine

12451974
hide	show
i added a class to each div to make it easier to show hide all at once

12451997
rss	feed
however i have written a piece of code to look at an rss feed open the link and extract the text from the article

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the regular expression below works on google-chrome and opera but not on firefox

12452153
opera	google-chrome
but in google-chrome and opera it returns an array

12452222
button	checkbox
in ios the next and previous button do not work for checkbox

12452234
getter	setter
or i have to create entries with pure c# validation in the setter and getter and then create a map objects for the database creation

12452260
textview	imageview
you can also use a textview and set the background image to what you wanted in the imageview

12452334
ironruby	ironpython
c# is pretty easy to understand and if you re set on dynamic typing you can use ironpython or ironruby

12452345

12452385
folder	directory
so how can i upload a file to a folder in a folder that is in the same directory as my python scripts

12452402
profiling	instrumentation
if you are running xcode 4.4 or later the time profiling instrumentation has two columns for each symbol in the call tree running time and self

12452402
profiling	instrumentation
the time profiling instrumentation isn t the best tool for profiling opengl code

12452402
profiling	instrumentation
if you re writing a mac app the opengl profiling tool profiling opengl code better than instrumentation

12452402
profiling	instrumentation
if you re profiling an ios app use the opengl es analysis instrumentation template and the opengl es performance detective tool

12452415
imperative	declarative
a declarative language requires you to code for what you want to happen rather than in an imperative language where you code how the computation should be done

12452415
imperative	declarative
in general this means that a declarative language does not allow for side-effects whereas imperative languages almost require coding with side-effects

12452415
imperative	declarative
this makes f# a general purpose language but does so by allowing imperative style coding to be mixed in with declarative coding

12452417
folder	directory
in my cases folder i created a test suite file that uses the recursive directory lookup

12452426
free	malloc
in c because all memory needs to be manually managed with malloc and free statically allocated buffers save a bit of hassle since they are automatically free when the function exits

12452428
fflush	gets
you aren t seeing print or find because they re in the output buffer which you haven t fflush -- you re crashing before your code gets a chance to fflush it

12452430
rss	feed
i was parsing a reddit rss feed and noticed that the time was in utc

12452430
rss	feed
reddit item node in rss feed

12452456
textview	imageview
this will create a textview and a imageview on each row of the list populate the textview with the items in your arraylist items and show the image if the item is clickable

12452476
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
after that it still works in firefox safari google-chrome but not in ie

12452524

when i compile and run this under solaris 10 sunos 5.10 it doesn t stop

12455849
getter	setter

maven	pom.xml
i am new to spring development and i tried to add maven dependency for spring orm in the pom.xml file it gives the following exception when the server starts

note that in that model scheme i use the typeid properties both as a condition of my inherited and as a properties for domainentity

12456145
inherited	properties
lets say i will not use typeid as a properties and keep it as a condition for the inherited association that will result in the following when i ll try to populate a tree of my domain entities

12456145
inherited	properties
if i use inheritances and typeid as a condition for each inherited i can not access it as a properties of domainentity that will require me to use switch-case against typof entity to determine what type i should send to my jstree plugin because he expects a type identification for each node in his json if i will not use inherited i will loose the polymorphic capabilities

12456145
inherited	properties
there will be other methods and properties relevant only for the inherited entities and i can see some injections points in the future.

children	parent
is there other right way to make children fit parent

12456788

in order to build the children you must have the parent root built also

i have put the war file in the webapps folder then when i click in the start button i get the error fail - application at context path black.artesppap could not be started

12457277
serializable	deserialization
my only guess would be that i am sending a number of serializable data packs through the stream each encapsulated by some serializable headers and that therefore the deserialization process in the web service only finds and decapsulates the first one but that s just an idea and i am not sure how to do it differently

12457287
queue	fifo
using a serial queue guarantees you that all blocks will be executed in fifo order

12457322
width	height
for example you pass the top and left of image and you already know the width and height of div so if the left is -375px you know that you should crop the image from 375px to 375px + div s width and same goes for top

12457349

onfocusin and onfocusout are required for ie 9 and lower while all others make use of onfocus and onblur

12457358

12457378

12457537
put	get
can anyone please tell me how to get the native look and feel and put it correctly in the code

12457547
children	parent
the parent #mainholder div is not increasing its width when child elements are added â as a result the children breaks the parent div

12457562
range	max
its also a good idea to specify a range via min-width and max width because there is a possibility that if you dont the test conditions will load multiple javascript files

12457569
hide	show
i have my existing code here which works to a certain extent in that it hide show the video

12457603
super	self
why super .__init__ call in b.__init__ at 2 calls c.__init__ when self is an instance of d

12457604
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox the property doesn t affect the children but on google-chrome the children are misaligned

12457648
int	chars
so when php cast a string to int usually return 0 unless the first chars of the string it s a number

12457653
width	height
but that works if you want to increase width not height

12457672
super	self
q why super .__init__ call in b.__init__ at 2 calls c.__init__ when self is an instance of d

12457672
super	self
so super b self .__init__ calls c.__init__ self

12457695

although cygwin supports the unix permission bits on an ntfs filesystems native windows programs like my eclipse don t know about them so that all files created by windows programs have the executable bit set 755

12457914
folder	directory
make sure your source directory for example myproject src is listed as a source folder

12457922

to get the correct height for a 16 9 video you just divide the width by 16 then multiply it by 9

12458026

unfortunately though like windows 7 8 phone winrt does not support normal berkeley socket access but instead offers its own version of socket programming with discrete classes for different socket scenarios streamsocket for a connecting tcp client streamsocketlistener for a bindable tcp server and datagramsocket datagramsocketlistener for the udp versions

12458032

after doing this i found out that properties of progressbar control alertdialog tabhost have changed like background color height width etc

12458479
alarmmanager	wakelock

12458495
filesystems	fat
the filesystems is fat the sd card should stay be readable by windows systems

width of the page is 1026px and height is 680px

12458669
client-side	server-side
so you have to implement either the client-side or the server-side auth flow in your app

12458705
x86	64bit
i have found few remarks on the fact that this library cannot be used natively on 64bit machine and that it and all apps using it should be compiled targeting x86 platform

12458705
mef	prism
my even the simplest sample application that uses prism with unity mef always crashes with exception that an attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format exception from hresult 0x8007000b

exponent is a standard integer but mantissa a value between 1 and 2 is a number of bits where each bit represents a fractions 1 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 and so on.

12458719
int	double
so the actual value of the double is not 33.30 its 33.2999999999999971578290569595992565155029296875 which of course rounds down to 33.29 when you do the type cast to int

12458719
int	double
sadly printf works by conversions to int inside it and will not properly print any double precision floats that have more than 6 decimal places which is why you see it as 33.30 even through you are asking printf to print the value of a double

12458732
implements	extends	comparator	comparable
if possible you can extends the class and write a new class which implements comparable so that you can implements comparator

12458762
getter	setter
in any case i suggest you use getter and setter as there is no overhead caused by them what so ever

12458768
filesystems	fat
the corruption probably happens because the os didn t complete its write operations on the fat filesystems

12458768

12458824
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so google-chrome opera ie calls the function with no problem after you enter text and click somewhere else - but firefox safari doesn t

12458842
opera	google-chrome
italic is not apply in google-chrome and opera

12458856
put	get

12458867
typedef	struct
the tag name space the name after the struct and the identifier name space the one you declare with typedef eg. are distinct in c

12458867
typedef	struct
the easiest i find is to always forward declare the struct tag and the typedef in one go

12458867
typedef	struct
from then on you could easily use the typedef name even inside the declaration of the struct

12458894
equals	tostring
the equals and tostring methods in each of the ai extending a and in the t class are overridden similarly and appear to behave as expected

12459188

12459198
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
at the build step i select build execute windows batch command where i want to start a browser such as opera google-chrome portable or firefox portable the command never terminates

since i ve never worked with ant only worked with maven my idea of using this plugin inside pom.xml would be to define following targets

12459408
onstart	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
so no call to onpause onresume ondestroy oncreate onstop or onstart

12459413
qsort	strcmp
if you want to learn qsort - change std string to and define function based on strcmp

12459427
memcpy	qsort
the reason is that qsort will memcpy the array elements around which is not possible for c++ objects in general unless they re sufficiently trivial

12459452
cpu	processors
i suspect as the processors needs to copy the data from ram to do the calculation in the alu or even hardwired calculation in the cpu via bit shifting but i am not really sure how c++ handles memory and i am curious as to how that works on the back end

12460738
strcpy	strncpy
since internally i print the number as a string i thought what i could do is write a custom implementation that would automatically add the comma depending on the number 1000 10000 100000 and so forth but then i realized that functions like strncpy or strcpy will essentially replace not add the comma to the desired position

12460757

though drummer says that nsviewcontroller isn t very useful i must disagree - it is useful for splitting up your nswindowcontroller once it gets too large and has clear logical divisions in terms of views

12465312
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
you could have one nswindowcontroller and once it gets complicated enough the nswindowcontroller could delegate tasks corresponding to specific views to subclasses of nsviewcontroller and in that respect it is very useful

you making unnecessary function call for every single value so javascript virtual machine has a difficulty optimizing this pattern also your arrays will not be treated as a simple arrays internally but as much complex data structure in your while loops on the other hand you using very simple arrays access pattern and i suspect if you will use a for-loop with rv.length as a stopping condition it will be faster still

since the performance of the bulk update will be affected by auditing you may wish to change your design - for example if you have a parent entity with related children and you are performing a bulk update on the child records you could update attributes of the parent record and then call saveorupdate after doing the bulk update

teamcity	dotcover
there is okay documentation out there for this usage notably on the teamcity documentation where they cover integration with dotcover

12466521
teamcity	dotcover
does dotcover support the attribute filter in its console i assume so since teamcity basically just passes the arguments through to the console runner and is there a known syntax that works for it

units using different format of data or non-standard transmission protocol for sending it for example cheaper units are unable to use udp protocol and are transmiting data through tcp protocol using packets that not always follows standards or definictions

12467413
udp	tcp
in general any tk102 related devices is opening a socket for a direct tcp transmission original one can be switched to use udp protocol

12467413
udp	tcp
many really many cheap clones uses tcp while only original tk102 allows switching to udp

12467413
udp	tcp
this is convenient because you need really basic server configuration to handle tcp connections while you have to use specific server-side software like node.js or specific configuration open to certain ports to handle udp

12467413
udp	tcp
but the key thing is to determine correct protocol as listening to tcp data while your localizer sends udp will most certainly fail

width	height
thankfully i came across a neat little trick of setting the padding-top of the slideshow viewport to a percentage value dynamically calculated desired slideshow height set in the settings panel for this script divided by desired width

12467946
width	height
as padding-top percentages are relative to the width of the element this did a great job of providing responsive height and correcting the viewport again no longer looking collapsed

qstring	qdatastream
the language toolkit shouldn t matter but for completeness the language is c++ and the primary toolkit i m using is qt i m actually trying to get a list of strings into a single qstring because it s one of the few qt types that doesn t get pickled in a non-human readable way when it goes into a qdatastream qvariant qsettings.

when you find this string in oncreate you can either use a switch case to recreate this object or better have a factory function in your custom class to work with bundle and stringclassandinstancename

12468895
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
classes bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream

12468901
post	get
you should use percent escapes when passing characters thru the get or post parameters

12468911
int	chars
i have an assignment that requires three chars be read with getchar as the three int next to one another are relevant to each other so i set up a loop structured as such

this will allow you to define constraints and dynamic element height width sizes margins paddingsâ with each other elements

12468942
post	get
then to get the post in posts#find you need to do

12468945
getter	setter
in python you don t generally privatize member variables and you don t bother writing trivial getter and setter so you can remove the getx and gety methods and just refer to p.x and p.y directly given a point p

g++	gcc
i was not able to execute even gcc g++ command

12469249

i am using google-chrome firefox does not seem to load the resources at jsfiddle or i am doing it wrong

12469361
min	max
building on this approach i ve attempted a normalisation modifies the bytes in getaudiosamples to a normalised value considering the max min in the file

12469370
put	get	post	put	post	get
knowing your system s book representation will allow me to make a get call to retrieve one and understand it or make a post or put call to create one

12469447
for-loop	loops
you were getting out of bounds error as your for-loop wasn t looping correctly i have modified it so that loops doesn t go out of bounds and also your secretword variable wasn t populating correctly the code should now work as intended

12469472

the closest i can get is the enforcing of the min and max occurs but the order is enforced

it is a boolean and not int

12469677
dictionary	map
i am trying to show multiple pins on a map using latitude and longitude from an array of dictionary

12469694
google-chrome	firefox
to check to make sure it shows up correctly do an inspect element in google-chrome or firefox firebug to see if the code is on the page

12469738
width	height
might be just because i am brand new to d3 and svg this month but there is a getbbox method on the text element most elements that will generate an object with the width height x y and it really should be used instead of jquery for all svg dimensions

12469741
folder	directory
vs will by default copy the dll to your application project s output directory so you just need to configure your installer just to include all of the files in your bin folder except maybe xml documentation files

12469752
vim	emacs
you just need to take the beginning ssh-dss or ssh-rsa then your public_key then make ups some label to create a new public key file - use emacs or vim on your computer and save it as id_dsa.pub or id_rsa.pub and upload it to assembla - should work just fine

12469810
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
to further illustrate this behavior could be recreated in pure javascript in a es5 supported browser ie9 or latest versions of firefox google-chrome or safari

12469813

what do i need to put there in order to get this to work correctly

12469844
restrict	shared
is this a feature restriction of using a shared hosting provider - the subdomains are restrict to the folder where they are pointed

i would suggest to remove the framework from the project then go to finder and make sure that there is no residual files or directory in the project folder

12469947
hide	show
here s an example of what i am doing - i am populating the div with mysql database through php and there are two divs clicking on button chat hide the div 2nd div and clicking on chat2 hide the first div and show the second using jquery

12469974
udp	tcp
to make matter more confusing on a lower level a single tcp or udp message with tcp ip headers prepended to the data can also be called a packet

12469991
uicontrol	uibutton
i d suggest subclassing from uicontrol instead of uibutton

12469991
uicontrol	uibutton
instead of working around the 1 label and image you get in a uibutton it s cleaner to start from scratch with a uicontrol and create your tiles

12469995
post	get
i got categories and post each category has to have its own unique filters that can be strings or booleans i ll get them via textboxes or checkboxes

12470000

12470032
x86	64bit
i m running an x86 emulator on a ubuntu 64bit installation configured with kvm

12470045

12470080
width	height
now i want to modify my application like load the bmp from byte array i have the raw image width and height do any one have sample for this

12470091
filewriter	bufferedwriter
you should close the bufferedwriter before closing the filewriter

12470180
width	height
the graph is a custom control of mine that wants to be as big as it can its onmeasure function just returns the provided width and height which i think is where the problem lies

12470268
inherited	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
while it is a debated recommendation to favor composition over inherited my view is to ensure that an abstract-class devoid of abstract methods is not simply a convenient container for methods convenient to subclassing but instead that each subclassing could stand in for its superclass

12470274
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
and the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object. the actual argument names don t matter it is the order that matters

12470314
mdpi	hdpi
if you wanna design for android you have to provide 4 different files of the same asset ldpi mdpi hdpi and xdpi

12470329
integer	unsigned
but a better way might be to change the id filed type to auto increment unsigned integer and then by knowing the last id before the gap equals to gid you can do a query like this

12470329
integer	unsigned
since all the records in your id field have the letter e in common it might be possible to get rid of this letter and change the field type to an auto increment unsigned integer

12470363
put	get
i want to get the phone contacts and then put them into a listview

12470364
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the following code works well in firefox opera but not in google-chrome

12470374
jar	manifest.mf
its because of run-time classpath.the solution i found is opened manifest.mf in the manifest editor.then at the run-time tab classpath section added required jar

12470376
cydia	tweak
i have made a cydia tweak which does just this

12470378

also to help reduce the risk of dictionary attacks salt is appended to original pass-phrase before generating hash

12470387
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
2. the default openfiledialog and savefiledialog is restricted to the mydocuments folder

12470391
put	get
as i told it works in some environment with a database but in the other environment doesn t work the trouble was that i had a multiple saving and dependant registers but the first takes some time to get saved so when i saved the second register different tables the second one dependant on the first one the data for the key s wasn t saved already so i couldn t saved in cascade as is usual cuz it would take to change a lot of code as this is not a begin from zero development so what i did was to dig more into the code and get where the data was exactly saved and put there the saving of the other register

12470455
put	get
i just can t figure out how to put together a bit of code that says get all mentions to user

12470469
uiview	subviews
you can then place any uiview subclass into that uiview as subviews

12470474
daemon	cron
now to use it in the php daemon cron i could call these commands using php mongo driver

12470489
children	parent
i want to modify the loop so that it ll only display the children of a single parent page the page id number is 116 just for reference

12470531
for-loop	arrays
and since you are using for-loop you d better use string and not arrays of strings

12470583
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked for google-chrome firefox ie8

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the code to push the value works fine in google-chrome 21 and opera 12 but not in ie9 and firefox 15

12470657
spaces	delimiter
textscan uses spaces and newline as delimiter by default

12470657
spaces	delimiter
if you give newline as delimiter explicitly you loose the spaces as delimiter and the portability windows often uses r n as a single newline whereas unix-derived oses use n

12470657
spaces	delimiter
you proceed by splitting the stuff by a pass through regexp with a spaces as delimiter but since textscan already splits on spaces that s not needed either

12470680
min	max
what i want is concate the static string to dataset i want to add string as min avg max to the fetched data

12470685
rspec	minitest
otherwise stick with minitest which will enable you to collaborate with people ignorant of rspec such as me

12470707
getter	setter
considering the above code setter and getter are use to act on the private members of a class

12470740
post	get
my suggestion is sidebar has the list of games each element in the list has name of game edit button...on the top of sidebar will be the plus button which on click will allow you to add a new game once a new game is created it ll be added to the list of games which will have the edit button...we can accomplish this pretty neatly using ember.collectionview will post the fiddle when i get some spare time asap

12470751

at the moment you re trying to resize images that aren t loaded yet and have a width height of 0 0

12470754

getter and setter are simply an object oriented convention

12470759
getter	setter

google-chrome	firefox
one can use firebug to debug in firefox firebug lite in google-chrome ie web developer in internet explorer

dictionary	map
the fastest lookup is a dictionary in my benchmarks twice as fast as the c++ map but it is heavy on storage

12470854
post	get
a tags normally dont work with post there default behaviour is to request the server for a resource via get although you can override this behaviour using javascript but in your case that is not an option therefore you can try

12470890
distance	polygons
i would give each light source a maximum distance and if i gave it enough rays then there should be no point within that distance that any two rays are too far apart to miss a polygons but that only increases my problem with the number of calculations to perform

12470928
jstl	taglib
2 load jstl relevant taglib into the jsp page

12470951
sorting	filtering
the tablesorter features such as sorting and pager work very well but the filtering only works on the default table that is built whenever page loading not on the dynamic tables built by ajax

12470995
getter	setter
you need to implement this interface in your form bean that is having getter and setter methods in it

12471002
hide	show
i need to show hide a field based on the value entered in another field

12471036

12471469
bids	ssas
it s pretty straight forward to use teamcity as ci tool for asp.net websites and we are looking for similar approach for ss s we made some practice to use scripts to build and deploy ssas but it require bids to be install to teamcity server

i have methods using put post annotations

i m trying to parse rss feed from a link

12471505

i just want to point out the fact that if you five it as get you will be limited to 255 chars instead of infinite if you chose a post request

12471505

12477194
x86	64bit
not using the logarithm instruction is easiest to explain the logarithm instruction in x86 is defined to be accurate to 80-bits whereas you are using a double which is only 64bit

12477194
division	multiplication
this is because multiplication and division is faster in sse the 80-bit vs 64-bit issue again and that the sse registers are faster to manipulate in the fpu you can only access the top of the stack and rotating the fpu stack is often the slowest operation on a modern processor in fact some have an extra pipeline stage solely for this purpose

on the other hand not having getter setter will not be very usable by a lot of frameworks that expect camel case getter setter

12478864
getter	setter
what i also like with getter setter is that you clearly see what you are doing get or set

12478864
getter	setter
my hands-on experience is that i usually am better of with getter setter and constructors

12478963

the form loads well into sharepoint and looks proper in google-chrome and firefox but for some reason my font styles are not applying and my input field settings aren t taking affect in ie 7 and 8

12479259

this will specify that which browser should have what kind of height or width

12479670
median	max
that way if you have an odd number of objects the median would be exactly the max object in your max-heap

12479670

if you have an even number of objects your median would then be the average of both roots of your heaps max of max-heap min of min-heap

12479695

12480737
rspec	minitest
rails and i think minitest and rspec are both fine choices depending on your needs

postgresql	mysql
first postgresql and mysql are completely different beasts when it comes to performance tuning

12495775
postgresql	mysql
not only does postgresql have a far more flexible indexing than mysql but the table approaches are very different also meaning the appropriate indexing strategies are as different as the tactics are

12495775

i am more a postgresql guy than a mysql guy so of course i think you should go with postgresql

it works in firefox google-chrome opera and safari i was afraid to test it in ie9 though both transform and background-clip work but only if the width for .outer has a value that s a multiple of 100px

12496235
google-chrome	firefox
unless using a width that s a multiple of 100px it only works in firefox and google-chrome there is a little glitch in google-chrome - could be fixed by using a webkit-only left to right linear gradient that sharply goes from transparent to that semitransparent blue really close to the start

12496235
opera	safari
it breaks in opera and safari if using a width that is not a multiple of 100px

12496867
cdr	cons
i assume you understand the primitives cons car and cdr as they are implemented in scheme already but just to remind you cons constructs a pair car selects the first component of the pair and returns it and cdr selects the second component and returns it

12496867
cdr	cons
the version of cons car and cdr that you ve pasted should behave exactly the same way

12496867
cdr	cons
first of all car and cdr are not defined within the scope of cons

12496867
cdr	cons
in your snippet of code all three cons car and cdr are defined at the top-level

12496867
cdr	cons
if you were to execute the same repl session i had above with these new cons car and cdr functions the argument z in car will be bound to the function-based pair which is what cons returns which is dispatch

12496867
cdr	cons
if you follow this same logic for cdr you ll see that it behaves almost the same way but returns the second argument to cons y which is the second component of the pair

if you do need other classes to change the state of the field then you can then do that in a more controlled manner by way of getter setter methods

the problem now is if i execute the maven goal release prepare the variable will be interpolated with the current user which is fine generally but when the execution is over i end up with a pom.xml file where not only the versionstring is updated which is fine too but also the variable stays replaced with the current user

12497257

that said it s also all likely that you are accessing the controls properties through a reference of this derived type namely bauergroupbox and as mystere man correctly argues the member bauergroupbox.controls hides the inherited member wherever it is last defined -- it does not override it
