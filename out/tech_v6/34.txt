3100241
valgrind	memcheck
it s slightly strange that valgrind is not reporting any errors -- but there are some errors that the default memcheck tool can miss

3100309

even a cpu bound task might run faster multi-threaded if properly designed to take advantage of cache memory and pipelineing done by the processors

3100429
inline	inlining
i know the compiler does not have to inline anything if it doesn t want to so i assumed it placed f in the object file instead of inlining it in case of both main.c and file.c thus multiple definition error

3100429
inline	inlining
it seems like gcc assumed f would be inline so it didn t add it to the object file but later because there was no -o2 it decided to generate calls to these functions instead of inlining and that s where the linker error came from

3100447
versioning	upgrade
since upgrade xcode to versioning 3.2.3 with iphone sdk 4 my code doesn t work anymore

3100452
servicecontract	servicebehavior
in case of wcf it wants to say that although it is allowed to mark classes with servicecontract attribute better to have it on separate interface and implement that interface in concrete class marked with servicebehavior attribute

3100642
width	height
however using javascript and ajax you can just load the svg file since it s xml and put it directly into the dom you might have to set some width height somewhere

3100646
cifs	smb
you can use jcifs to access smb cifs shares using pure java code

3100728

i believe you can achieve the yz rotation using shear transforms something similar used to draw objects in isometric perspective in design apps such as adobe illustrator

3101010
udp	tcp
it never passes tcp or udp packets to raw

3101011
width	height
the problem is the bitmap has fixed width and height if you paint outside the bitmap s area you re basically silently ignored

3101026
websphere	ibm
i have seen and experienced similar productivity killing problems in ibm s websphere products too

3101050
google-chrome	firefox
it looks like the issue was selected .html returned google with a space in ie7 but returned google in ie8 firefox and google-chrome

3101053
folder	directory
also try running the script using an administrator account or changing the permissions of the generator folder to allow the user running the script to write to the directory if you still have problems

3101063
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
in practice i d change your class to instead not have the sqlconnection or sqldataadapter or sqlcommandbuilder as a member on the class if you must then you should implement the idisposable pattern but instead create new instances wrapped in using statements on the class methods that need to use them

3101111
folder	directory
now folder src contains some other folder with javascript code that is minified during build process and placed in lib directory

3101269
uiview	subviews
the structure of my implementation looks like this i have a subclass of uiscrollview with a uiview added as subviews

3101292
width	height
however what i would do is make the a tag display as block and set the width and height to fill the li that way you can use a hover and change the whole bg which makes it look like the li is changing

3101314
pop-up	dialog
take a look at the jquery ui dialog it comes in many flavours and you can put whatever you want in it if you absolutely have to you can even use it as an iframe pop-up

3101314
pop-up	dialog
the dialog works by showing and hiding a div which is positioned on top over all other elements there is little chance a pop-up blocker will cause any problems but it does require javascript to be turned on

3101324
alarmmanager	timertask
and if every x time means you have a busy loop or are using timertask or something please consider whether alarmmanager is possibly a better solution

3101341

affinity	processors
but as a work around we set the processors affinity for 2 of those services and observed that the crash did not happen after that

3101407
width	height	cos	sin
newheight height cos radians + width sin radians

3101407
width	height	cos	sin
newwidth height sin radians + width cos radians

3101407
cos	sin
temp sqr cos radians - sqr sin radians

3101407
cos	sin
height newheight cos radians - newwidth sin radians temp

3101407
cos	sin
width newwidth cos radians - newheight sin radians temp

3101407
cos	sin
i m sure it involves sin cos or both somewhere but brain freeze prevents me from building the formula

3101407
width	height
eta in this case i increase the width but i need a general solution for the width height or both changing

3101407
width	height
i change the width and or height of the bounds

3101434
int	boolean
a boolean expression always returns an int value 0 or 1 in mysql so you can use sum to count up the 1 s

3101661
webclient	webrequest
we have recently migrated from a soap service plain xml-generation on the server and rx came just in time so that we could use it instead of webclient or webrequest actually we wrap webclient in observable right now but will probably move to webrequest

3101666
dateadd	datepart
you can also do it in a more convoluted but probably slightly faster way using dateadd datepart

3101698
firefox	safari
all of the internal web pages at the place i work were designed and built specifically for ie 6 but now they want me to research what it would take to move to firefox and safari and other major browsers.

3101698
firefox	safari
so how do i get the activex stuff to work in firefox and safari specifically on mac for starters

3101700
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout with a delay of 0ms would achieve that effect although a looping settimeout or setinterval would cause another infinite loop to be created so at least some delay is necessary as i pointed out above

3101704
hide	show
well on slow browsers the show hide method might cause the box to flicker though the computer have to be really slow

3101743
cpu	processors
i understand that a scatted read for a classical cpu can be quite slow as each access will cause a cache miss and thus a processors wait

3101777
stdout	stderr
the problem is that after mounting a filesystem i have no access to stdin stdout stderr from my fuse script

3101834
folder	directory
go to the folder properties in iis manager - directory security tab - authentication and access control

3101940
nant	cruisecontrol
we use nant and cruisecontrol but the available options are as plentiful as opinions

3101957
postgresql	mysql
rather use a db-managed autogenerated pk mysql bigint unsigned auto_increment oracle postgresql serial sqlserver identity and give the email field an unique key

3101995
for-loop	loops
thanks folks for the help but i cannot introduce new function neither i can replace the while loops with for-loop i would be very thankfull if you can help me in re-editing the given while loop.

3102027
icmp	tcp
although i noted that emil s answer didn t address the question it might address the problem - the time it takes for an icmp packet to go to a server and come back will be different from the time taken to complete a tcp handshake on port 80 across the internet they should be roughly the same on a lan provided the webserver is not saturated

3102028
boost	allocator
maybe you could use a boost scoped_array but if this really is that performance critical maybe you should try putting the initialization allocator outside the innermost loop somehow

3102058

however the call to msiopenproduct pop-up the windows installer is preparing the installation... dialog

3102119
post	get
please post a link when you get done

3102141
ncover	nant
nunit 2.5.5 is now out and this supports projects build using .net framework v4.0 but you have to use an additional parameter namely framework 4.0.30319 which looks something like this when used in nant through ncover

3102141
ncover	nant
my nant script calls out to ncover 1.5.8 and that calls nunit 2.5.5 which tests my unit test assembly .dll that was built using .net 4.0

why don t you use c_uint for the enum parameter and then use a mapping like this enums are usually unsigned integer values

3102301
google-chrome	firefox
using base64 encoding # it works pretty well with firefox google-chrome but not in ie7

3102331
qabstractitemmodel	qabstracttablemodel
firstly i think you should try inheriting qabstracttablemodel instead of qabstractitemmodel

3102403
svg	vml
you could use something like raphaã l to abstract the vml or svg into a single js script but that would add a dependency on javascript

3102498
pop-up	dialog
but when i debug in mono i see the mono console window pop-up stay there without displaying any messages for a while and then i get an error dialog saying failed to start xsp

3102504
rpm	yum
you probably don t want the typical rpm package breaking all of the automated software updating tools like yum up2date etc

3102510
getter	setter
and then testcase class exposes this in the usual way with a getter setter #history and #history

3102548

3102666
int	boolean	int	double
i am writing an interpreter and tried to use solution from how-to-set-up-implicit-conversion-to-allow-arithmetic-between-numeric-types for the same problem i need to be able to add boolean + boolean int + boolean boolean + int int + double double + double etc

3102679
stdout	stderr
by default the android system sends stdout and stderr system.out and system.err output to dev null

that means you can use long long int for scratch variables when doing long multiplication long division etc

3102755
wordpress	joomla
moodle can integrate well with google sites apps joomla drupal and wordpress sso web services...

3102776
children	parent
that is you can t have a pk or fk on the parent table and have it automatically apply to all the children as well

3102884
int	double
for instance if you need to be able to have a list of vertex objects with different types double int etc. and access them polymorphically

3102902
getschematable	executereader
edit 2 found out why it didn t work - you can use getschematable to get table information but you have to set commandbehavior to keyinfo you do that in the executereader call

3102969
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
how can i measure how fast the user is moving their finger across the screen of an ios device using the touche events touchesbegan touchesmoved etc

3102981
innodb	myisam
we change mysql internal db engine for the table mdl_user from myisam to innodb after we reached 12000 users now we have 16000 it gave a huge positive performance impact on mdl_user related queries

3103007
unsigned	short
i have a which is a string representation of the short i want such as 15 and need to output this as unsigned short unitid to a binary file

3103035
int	chars
that cast will give you a truncated int version of the pointer assuming temp is also a chars

3103035
unsigned	short
take a look at the function atoi it may be what you need unitid unsigned short atoi temp

3103035
unsigned	short
note that this assumes that a temp is pointing to a string of digits and b the digits represent a number that can fit into an unsigned short

3103049
unsigned	short
if you cast a to an unsigned short you ll be taking the value of the pointer which has nothing to do with the contents chopping off everything that doesn t fit into a short and then throwing away the rest

3103130
pop-up	dialog	move	drag
common application modes include drag and drop operations move size operations anytime a dialog pop-up that needs input before the application can continue

3103138
packets	multicast
i was surprised to learn that android supports multicast packets

3103138
packets	multicast
does having a multicast lock mean i can receive all packets broadcast or does it only apply to packets with a multicast flag if such a thing exists

3103159
folder	directory
i would like to set a directory in my home folder

3103195
unsigned	short
it s also somewhat strange what you are doing -- 2209032000 is the number of seconds in 70 years and the result of multiplying a short by 2e32 will overflow the size of unsigned int

3103231
post	get
you need to use post redirect get prg pattern

3103235
post	get
i noticed from your original post that you are using the datepicker plugin for jquery to get the date in the first place

3103259
public	protected
also what you don t have in smalltalk is access modifier private protected public

3103323
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
bmp png or tiff formats accept binary images as input arrays

3103323
tiff	png
for png images you can use png library and for tiff i can t remember but you can search or choose the other options

3103326
equals	gethashcode
in your case you should override equals and gethashcode like this

3103333
hide	show
i m passing an array to a function i want to be able to show or hide columns in a table depending on what s passed

3103333
hide	show
i can handle the show hide bit

3103336
equals	gethashcode
your gethashcode and equals methods should look like this

3103336
equals	gethashcode
the rule is that gethashcode must use exactly the fields used in determining equality for the equals method

3103366
hide	show
which basically show and hide a div with a class of leftcolumn

3103378
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested the following in ie6 7 8 google-chrome and firefox

3103381
vbscript	jscript
asp pages are usually written in vbscript but can be written in any language supported by the windows scripting host - jscript and vbscript are supported natively with third-party libraries offering support for perlscript and other dynamic languages

3103581
range	max
average range of results number is 0-400 but i always want max 20 results

3103592
int	chars
under the really rare circumstances that you need to do this dealing with a foreign floating point format such as data in vax g-format being manipulated on a pc you normally do it by putting the floating point data into an int of the same size or else into an array of chars again of the right size

3103599
internationalization	translation
this allows for a strongly typed key but it also allows for easy internationalization of your application as you can get the resource file translation to a new language and it will be automatically applied for users of that culture

3103660
post	put
instead of letting the observer post window messages to its subscribers i let the observer put data into synchronized subscriber buffers

3103683
cvs	svn
compared to making zip-file snapshots of code both git and svn or mercurial or even cvs can dramatically improve your coding workflow

3103702
post	get
you should follow the post redirect get pattern to prevent form submission duplicates

3103709
inherited	properties
this method ignores the inherited parameter for properties and events

3103709
inherited	properties
to search the inherited chain for attributes on properties and events use the appropriate overloads of the attribute.getcustomattributes method

3103709
inherited	properties
this basically means that this implementation s second parameter bool inherited is ignored for event members and properties members

3103733
packets	multicast
multicast means the packets was addressed to a multicast address in monitor mode you can pick up everything that is transmitted on the channel

3103733
packets	multicast

textchanged	selectedindexchanged
some of these are txtinput1 s textchanged chkoption1 s checkedchanged and cmbstuff1 s selectedindexchanged

3103964
persistent	transient	instances	transient
i can map name as the identifier for a but this causes lots of extra select queries because nhibernate can t identify whether an instances of a is transient or persistent

3103964
instances	transient
what i m really looking for is a strategy for using a single-column natural key while allowing nhibernate to identify transient instances

3104035
google-chrome	firefox
in my computer everything is fine firefox google-chrome ie6 7 8 etc.

so if the limit n is a double variable and the incremented variable i is an int i gets incremented beyond its limits

3108049
tabs	tabpanel
you can assemble your tablayoutpanel in code by adding each uibinder templeted object into a tab in the tabpanel or define another uibinder template with the tabpanel and all the tabs defined

3108065
folder	directory
when i check the flex framework directory c program files adobe adobe flash builder 4 sdks 4.0.0 frameworks projects spark src spark - here are the original skin classes located - i can see all the missing folder

3108108
fflush	gets
not sure but it sounds like you are not flushing the output to a socket it probably gets fflush by force when it closes when the application closes

3108126
inherited	properties
at best at this point i can say is inherited is useful when the derived class has some fairly unique properties - like encyclopedie has properties explaining which type of encyclopedie it actually is and those properties do not in any way belong to a novel

3108166
put	get
and i don t seem to get why it would put new columns last even if the table is a new one and i have deleted every previous one from that location

3108210
post	get
for future reference if you post a little code you ll get better responses

3108221
maven	cargo
i know that cargo hard-codes the versions of its container dependencies instead of using the maven dependency mechanism probably for good reason jira - cargo-571

3108224
width	height
just remove the __self argument it doesn t belong there and overrides your width and height settings

3108244
openssl	m2crypto
unfortunately this function is not included in the standard library or m2crypto python openssl wrapper but you can find it in pyopenssl

3108248
inline	inlining
you don t really care for inlining in debug versions but you would prefer decoupling the inline code to avoid long recompiling times when you touch the inline code

3108331
integer	unsigned
bug id 4186775 request unsigned integer types esp

3108331
integer	unsigned
i have been wondering why there are no unsigned integer types in java

3108331
integer	unsigned
did they consider unsigned integer types evil

3108335
realloc	malloc
now you either use realloc or assign a bigger space to pointer1 with malloc at earlier stage

3108337
draggable	droppable
i have a tree ful with data that are draggable droppable

3108339
implements	extends
so if you need to implements different behaviour within the book in response to the method invocation extends book and override some of its methods

3108342
boost	stl
i use boost pointer containers in preference to a stl container of shared_ptr s

3108393
int	chars
having a separate byte type removes the confusion in c between the interpretation of chars as an 8 bit int and as a character.

3108393
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer values section 3.1

3108474
post	get
the attacker should be able to make a get or post request to your amf server using html techniques like or or an tag

3108475
width	height
set the width and height of that via css and then set width and height of the object element to 100 so it follows the parent wrapper

3108501
inline	inlining
the reason i prefer this is that there are times when even the best optimizing compilers cannot inline code if you put it in the cpp file like if the math class was being exported no inlining across dll boundaries

3108501
inline	inlining
the second reason i prefer this explicit style over inlining directly in the class definition is because i work with a lot of lazy coders who often inline things just because it saves time to write instead of actually inlining after a profiling session which is generally the only time you should consider inlining unless you are a superb compiler assembly genius

3108505
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
im performing certain database operations after which i attach cursor to the simplecursoradapter for display list on my listactivity

3108525
implements	extends
to accomplish that i was trying to extends the the edit new actions in order to implements the client requirements

3108575
printf	strlen
the closest thing was to use c to print a fixed numbers of characters and pass the textcase #x as parameter to printf - but i couldn t figure out how to determine the size of #x especially if it contains zero bytes which rules out any use of strlen

3108600
getter	setter
you should define properties private protected and define getter setter methods to work with them from outside the class

3108632
getter	setter
use getter setter that are public to access private variables

3108638
stateless	stateful
the connectivity aspect stateful stateless etc. may impact how much you really need to keep in memory at any given point

3108648
superclass	subclassing
maybe the frameworks you referred to are using this pattern in subclassing where the members are defined in a superclass

3108683
ilist	icollection
i suggest icollection or ilist

3108693
put	get
i ve tried to put an app_offline.htm usual for iis maintenance mode but get en rs error message instead of the message set into app_offline.htm

3108751
sctp	udp
we have an application that uses two types of socket a listening udp socket and an active sctp socket

3108751
sctp	udp
i would have expected some packets to be lost on the udp and some retries on the sctp socket but not this behavior

3108761
allocator	stl
this is actually a design flaw that alexandrescu points out with the standard allocator not operator new delete but what were originally the stl allocator used to implement std vector

3108761
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	memcpy	memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc
a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

3108761
free	malloc
a class like std vector could certainly use it even if the default implementation is to malloc the newly sized block and free the old one

3108788
hide	show
the problem i have is when the user clicks elsewhere on the page it will hide the leftcolumn as i want but the toggle function doesn t know this so when the user clicks the sidebartoggle link it wont show the leftcolumn as it treats it as hiding

3108807
mouseup	mousedown
if you want to detect right-clicks then you have to implement the mousedown or mouseup event

3108829
vbscript	jscript
it also means that any application supporting windows script can use multiple languages â jscript vbscript perl and others

3108829
pop-up	dialog
in order to pop-up a dialog box to the user in this case you can use the following code

3108851
uialertview	uiapplication
i have this on my todo list but my first instinct would be to listen out for the notifcation uiapplicationwillresignactivenotification see uiapplication in the views where you have things like uialertview - here you can programmatically remove the alert view with

3108887
put	get
then you don t have to put any code here moreover if you put code that will try to create table that exists you ll get an sql exception

3108966
inherited	properties
this will inherited the default style and new foreground properties will apply to the new style

3108980
goto	break
you can break or goto in c# but what you cannot do is not state which you want because that s a potential source of hard-to-spot bugs

3108980
goto	break
it s a lot easier to spot that your code says goto when you wanted break or vice versa than it is to spot that you forgot to add either

3108981
entities	entitymanager
and you have the entitymanager injected by the container and ready to operate jpa entities

3109005
rss	feed
a plugin the manipulates your rss feed

3109064
cpu	processors
if you look at modern computer architectures - shared instruction and data memory virtual memory l1 and l2 cache bus speed limits north and south bridges multi-core or many-core cpu solid state disk graphics processors fpga accelerators - then there isn t one language which has semantics which echo all of the variants nor does the c language have anything to do with them

3109186
folder	directory
how do i transfer files from one folder to another where both folder are present in oracle home directory

3109196
versioning	upgrade
i m considering to upgrade to higher gcc versioning

3109290
public	protected
if you don t the destructor should be protected and not public

3109323
filtering	grouping
it lets you search the text of work items as well as other useful filtering and grouping tools

3109440
hash	hmac
as far as using a password goes it sounds like you re looking for an hmac - a construction that uses a hash but can only be verified if you have the key

3109454
nscoder	nsobject
does nsobject implement nscoder

3109495
goto	break
in c# the switch statement requires that explicit flow control occur at the end of a case either a break goto return or throw

3109540
glassfish	resin
jetty supports websockets resin supports websockets and glassfish 3.0.1 supports it as well

3109555
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the app currently have a uitabbarcontroller shifting between some uinavigationcontroller s

3109570
range	median
this will give you the median and interquartile range in one fell swoop

3109570
median	percentile
this should calculate the correct median and percentile values when you have an even number of data items

3109570
median	percentile
again uncomment the final where clause if you only want the median and not the entire percentile distribution

3109646
children	parent
another higher-level remark on your code if the parent and their children are of the same type domain won t domain.list actually return all children too

3109670
range	infinity
the technical range is 0 to infinity but from sample sets that i ve seen it s 0 to 70

3109688
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
i recommend you get a copy of paint.net and try saving previewing images in different formats png jpeg gif bmp etc and get a feel for the trade-offs between image size quality and performance yourself

3109695
nscoder	nsobject
nscoder is a class and nsobject is the class from which all the other cocoa classes are derived

3109702
pop-up	dialog

edit this should work with any range regardless of what min or max are

3109765
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i usually open minimum 5 different browsers internet explorer firefox google-chrome apple safari and opera all in the current latest version - sometimes i also go backwards one version - especially with internet explorer as their standards changes like the wind blows

3109765
google-chrome	firefox
secondly google-chrome and firefox are great for debugging weird css html bugs

3109765
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
4. never ever mix width height settings with padding and margin in the same css class this will make some older browser mess up your designs

3109773
nltk	mallet
i am aware of few text-mining packages like gate nltk rapid miner mallet and minorthird

3109818

always use a salt hash

3109906
rss	feed
i am creating a simple feedreader iphone app where a rss is feed is parsed using nsxmlparser

to do things with the elements within it you can use .children or .find on your clone variable with a selector to select the children descendants you want once you ve added the clone to the parent

3109957
post	get
my post on how to get oo 3.2 working in java 6 applets is here is you want to take a look

profiling	instrumentation
i am profiling my code using instrumentation but it takes a lot of time about 6-7 minutes to run and then further 10-20 minutes to analyse

3110120
post	get
if the get is too long you could use a post instead you ll have a 16k limit which is more than enough

3110160

3110255
tcpclient	networkstream
reading the tcpclient instance i can see that the property connected is true so it should be fine but when i try to read from the networkstream it hangs

3110326
udp	tcp
i would go for tcp instead of udp

3110328
getschematable	executereader
you can use getschematable to get table information but you have to set commandbehavior to keyinfo you do that in the executereader call

3110337
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you should be able to do the in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

now when i have a companyentity loaded and access the comid properties it is always 0 but the inherited id properties contains the correct value

3110481
post	get
final comment if it works when you paste the address into your browser do a get request rather than a post request in your ajax code

3110539
profiling	debugging
i believe that the publishing profiling are independent of the build profiling which is a bit of a shame as you could easily accidentally deploy a debugging configuration to your production servers

3110545

3110636
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream from sstream

3110642
ienumerable	ilist
no offense ... it doesn t work because you are using the ilist overload of contains and not the ienumerable overload of contains

3110642
ienumerable	ilist
by adding the you are telling the compiler to use the ienumerable overload instead of the ilist overload

3110662
dictionary	map
heres the final typemapper implementation with thanks to stephan as a feature will only map the two types when the keymembers are equal mappings defined via a dictionary string string representing the member names works in silverlight

since 1.0 not equals 1.00 one should use compareto

3110878
post	get
i know that i must use something called post get but i don t know relly how to use them

3110893

put	get
put them in a combobox so the user doesn t have to guess and can t get it wrong

3111103

int	chars
the second argument of string.substring int int is the index of the end chars

3111219

then show it on change and hide it in the success or error callback

3111243
google-chrome	firefox
its doing the same in firefox google-chrome and ie 8

yslow	pagespeed
as already mentioned you can use yslow or pagespeed firefox extension

3111329
maven	pom.xml
try adding this plugin to your pom.xml maven build section

3111344
maven	m2e
however you may find that using tools like maven can help having some independence from the ide and individual settings in which case you wouldn t need to commit .project .settings and .classpath in eclipse since m2e would re-create them for you automatically

3111357
pop-up	dialog
so if you use that you could just set up your application such that it s continuously running as a background process and will pop-up a modal dialog box or your idea of a transparent window or something that prompts for the user s login info when the computer has been idle for a certain amount of time

3111360
hash	salt
awesome he s hashing stuff using a salt but there s only 366 000 000 possible hash i m gonna blaze through this at 10 000 a second and finish in 10 hours

maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
my thoughts were to add maven-antrun-plugin to the reporting section of the pom.xml but i cannot have an node under plugin in the reporting section

3111641
ordinals	difference
the difference between and is that the former is implemented by a class to say i can compare myself with another instance of the same type. it doesn t have to be the same type but it usually is. this is appropriate if there s a natural comparison - for example the comparison chosen by string is ordinals equality - it s got to be exactly the same sequence of char values

3111652
public	protected
why there s no modifiers public private protected in front of methods and properties defining an interface

3111681
public	protected
protected private methods etc are implementation details not part of the object s public contract

i was content with keeping it like this but then i realized i wanted to add in about 5 sections each with show and hide for all the rows and i made two new functions that gray out elements enable them

3111783
pull	push
it seems like you only need to change the remotes that git push and git pull use by default

3111806
spweb	spsite
credential info is kept inside the spsite object that is used directly or indirectly by most spxxxx objects including spweb splistitem etc

3111806
spweb	spsite
in order to modify item permissions you will have to recreate any spsite splistitem spweb you use inside runwithelevatedprivileges using only the ids provided by the event handler

x86	64bit	x86	mips
now i am new to x86 assembly and my assembly class was taught in mips which i took forever ago but i suppose this isn t working because i am compiling this is a part of a photoshop plugin in 32 bit mode and rbx the 64bit version of ebx bx etc right

3111983
integer	unsigned
however there is a warning emitted by the compiler whenever you compare a signed integer with an unsigned one.

3112031
put	get
the only thing that really matters here is if you have put finalizers classname on your objects needlesslessly - this will causes them to be backed up in the single-threaded finalizer queue before they get gc d regardless of them containing unmanaged resources or not

3112044
width	height
to load the image the image needs to have a height width on the page

3112044
width	height
i think most people commonly insert the image into dom setting a height width making sure display is block

3112081
backgrounding	multitasking
if you need to get back onto wifi after doing the initial data transfer you could make some clever use of the ios 4 multitasking and local-notification apis when your application enters the backgrounding it could start a background-task handler using -beginbackgroundtaskwithexpirationhandler in your app delegate s -applicationdidenterbackground to wait for the wifi connection to become unavailable do its thing with the cell network then create a uilocalnotification to tell the user it s okay to turn wifi back on again

3112644
switching	screens
specifically how do i get it to pop up as the numbers entry screens but still be able to switching to letters

3112689
abc	isinstance
unfortunately there is no abstract class in 2.6 s standard library to summarize the concept of this number is integral but you can make one such abc by checking whether the class has a special method __index__ don t use __int__ which is also supplied by such definitely non-integral classes as float and str -- __index__ was introduced specifically to assert instances of this class can be made into integers with no loss of important information and use isinstance on that interface abstract base class rather than the specific implementation int which is way too restrictive

3112689
abc	isinstance
you could also make an abc summarizing the concept of having m h and s attributes might be useful to accept attribute synonyms so as to tolerate a datetime.time or maybe timedelta instance for example -- not sure whether you re representing an instant or a lapse of time with your mytime class the name suggests the former but the existence of addition suggests the latter again to avoid the very restrictive implications of isinstance with a concrete implementation cass

3112696
getter	setter
i have a managed bean with some private property with public setter and getter methods

3112717
fflush	gets
â if the parent directory s mtime changed the file handle cache gets fflush by flushing its attribute cache

checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the grid is in an updatepanel for asynchronous postbacks as changing the selection in dropdownlistfor and checkbox needs to enable or disable other controls on the form

post	get
i wanted to ask why does the response from a ajax request using the native ajax not post or get return my entire page

3117368
onchange	onblur
consider these two events onchange and onblur

3117368
onchange	onblur
the event onchange occurs only onblur of the text box

3117380
sorting	grouping
and only putting a limit after sorting doesn t work because the order by refers to the whole result and not only to one grouping of the result

3117631
short	base
be carefull wit enum as valid base types are byte sbyte short ushort int uint long or ulong

3117638
free	realloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined

3117638
free	malloc
short of keeping a record of all malloc and free calls to ensure you don t double-free a block i can t see this as being workable

3117638
free	malloc
no i think the current malloc and free are just fine provided you use them properly

3117646
free	malloc
as you note malloc and free usually do some form of bookkeeping often in the few bytes preceding the allocation

3117646
free	malloc
the heap the code for malloc an free management has at this point already lost track of and or overwritten the bookkeeping data because the memory has gone back to the heap

3117679

i have created a custom button class and i want to be able to change its width height depending on some factors in addition to the content width height

3118052
children	parent
you could then query this table by a single parent and get all of its implied children descendants

3118054
viewmodel	caliburn
i solved a similar scenario leveraging the viewmodel lifecycle i created an isessionaware interface with a setsession method to be implemented by repositories then i initialized the repositories through isessionaware in the oninitialize method of the viewmodel which is enforced by caliburn when the viewmodel is managed by a screenconductor

3118066
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene

or you can add eventhandlers for the mouseenter and mouseleave and change the cursor

3118930
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
don t store plaintext passwords store a hash instead like md5 sha-1 etc and at that point there s no harm in generating a salt for each password a random string that you append to the user s password before hashing it and store that salt with the password hash because you ll need it later--this prevents dictionary hash attacks ie rainbow tables

3118931
children	parent
how you have it modeled now you have to use recursion to get from children notes to parent or from parent down through children

3119030
vb6	vba
however if you have freedom in how you style your code you might choose the reddick vba naming convention vba is the same codebase as vb6

as an alternative to the accepted answer there s rarely a reason to this .is checked in an if statement you can use the dom .checked property directly and .toggle bool instead of show hide like this

3119474
comparator	icomparer
create a comparator for your custom type which implements the icomparer interface

3119490

solaris	aix
it builds fine on linux solaris x86 and windows but this is the first time we ve tried to build on aix

i achieved this by setting the uiwebview subviews to not clip to bounds then i could put a toolbar on top of it and get the desired effect

3119654
int	chars
you might consider a function such as the following which counts the number of whitespace chars in the given string giving a positive int is any are found true zero if none are found false and -1 on error

3119697

we are not setting the cpu affinity here i suspect that might help but ideally i would like all the cpu hw threads to handle the network traffic

3119744
rss	feed
google will accept an rss feed as a site map if that s all you have but points out that these usually only contain the most recent links - the value in having a sitemap is that it should cover everything on the site not just the latest items which are probably the most discoverable

3119813
cassini	iis
i noticed that if i use the filename property in iis it gives me a path + filename however if i run in cassini it only gives me the filename no matter what directory i use

finally a general tip with these kinds of ui objects and weird xaml object graphs once you ve got the basics working best to put it in a resourcedictionary and use something like resources name as storyboard to get it back later

3119902
chown	chmod
for example php has chmod and chown which could be used to simply deactivate a website

3119908

3120126
vsto	add-in
i have a form which spawns from an excel add-in written with vsto

3120177
int	chars	int	double
so since your textbox input doesn t convert well to int double with alpha chars an exception is thrown and will be continually thrown until you correct the value of the dependency property here the textbox s text property - the property setter of the underlying dataobject is never reached now

3120195
hash	salt
you generally don t want to store the password at all -- you store a hash of the salt password

3120275
hash	salt
1a don t store the user s password only a salt hash of it

3120280

now to add the spring libraries open the maven build file - pom.xml - and insert a new dependency on the spring mvc framework

3120328

3120477
getter	setter
the setvalue and getvalue methods that you implement in the setter and getter of the clr property are basically lazy evaluation on steroids

in python all class properties - all objects in fact - are stored in dictionaries and so you can get to their value either through properties accessor or just by looking them up

3120495

3120511
int	chars
i have a dictionary of int to chars decimal ascii chars associated with that int

pop-up	dialog
as a matter of fact it not only does not work in firefox but it pop-up the dialog box then you must end the firefox process in order to continue working

3120739
width	height
i know with a jpeg or whatever i could have it stored as a 50 by 50 icon then actually display it as a rather pixelated 100 by 100 thumbnail or 10 by 10 by manually setting the height and width in the image_src tag

3120739
width	height
however svg files seem to be used with object embed tags and changing the height or width of those just results in more space being allocated for the picture

3120785
width	height
erase width and height attributes

3120838
post	put	post	get	put	get

3120949
folder	directory
since at least in windows you can t have both a file and a directory with the same name it seems like there should be a function that accepts a string and returns either folder file or nothing

3120955
hide	show
can you show your markup with the panel and the codebehind where you hide it

3120956
apache	lighttpd

3121325
hash	salt
a better approach is to keep a salt hash of the user s pass and compare that to a hash of the input

3121342
getter	setter
in your example value # examplebean.date examplebean is your bean which you should have configured in your faces-config and date is the attribute for which you will have a corresponding setter and getter - accessing the java class properties at run time is the biggest advantage of expression language

3121342
post	get
refer balusc post get jsf api s expression language in sun sites

3121357

3121830
post	put
i found this post and it was very useful but i need put the logentry model into read-only in the admin interface its that possible

3121834
put	get
you can also code up your code so the routine that does the real work is called with stream handles or some other mechanism to get and put the data and have a test build feed the data through files that it opens instead of stdin and stdout

3121930
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the link tags show up across all browsers but the script tags only show up in safari and google-chrome they do no show up in firefox or ie

3121947

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit latest versions of google-chrome safari firefox and opera already support this

3122202
hash	md5
if you are generating a url that the client will then send just add an expiration timestamp and do an md5 hash signature on the entire url adding the result as a final query paramter

3122215
mouse	keyboard
successively the monitor shall detect mouse and keyboard events always system-wide and also it has to emulate mouse and keyboard events

3122260
onfocus	onblur
notice the onfocus and onblur events on the input boxes

3122260
onfocus	onblur
if you re open to using the jquery library you can easily get away from the onfocus and onblur events inside the input tags by just adding and removing the focus class

3122267
backgrounding	multitasking
when ios 4.0 multitasking puts my app into the backgrounding i save the data but don t close the database

3122287
put	get
put an exit at the end of your script append the file to the end of the script and use tail -c 80 to get at the contents

3122324
mouseover	mouseleave
another way to do it would be to take the variable out of the mouseover so that it can be shared with the mouseleave

3122380
post	get
i m looking for suggestions from someone who has already done this - how did you rewire your website to post get data from the iphone app

3122414
x86	mips
in x86 instructions must be preceeded by a lock prefix in mips the rmw cycle must be surrounded by an ll sc construct .

3122432

3122548
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it appears that most major browsers - google-chrome safari firefox and opera enumerate object properties in insertion order

3122555
post	get
while you can scrape html and send post requests it can get quite messy fast

3122555
post	put
if you look at the site there is a how to use it page with sending data with post or put requests

3122595
udp	tcp	put	get
you should get rid of the udp heartbeat attempt and put in a real tcp heartbeat

3122609
int	boolean
c originally didn t have a bool type until the 1999 standard so it used int to represent boolean values

3122610
google-chrome	firefox
other browsers i verified google-chrome 5 and firefox 3 place the reassigned property at the end of the iteration order

3122621
width	height
next write a function w y s which is to calculate recursively the number of walls of width x height y and top row s

3122627
pascal	delphi
there already is a 64-bit delphi object pascal

3122641
webrat	cucumber
try cucumber + webrat + selenium

3122643
onresume	onpause
then in the onresume onpause i handle registering and unregistering the receiver

3122668
packets	multicast
so this means you need to explicitly send a multicast packets on every up interface that supports multicast or provide the user with a means of specifying a particular interface

3122698
tabs	tabpanel
and add tabs via a wrapper on tabpanel

3122752
bash	zsh
if the directory name you try to cd to isn t in the current directory the other entries in your cd path will also be looked at and it s also tab complete aware at least in bash and zsh

3122752
bash	zsh
switching to zsh rather than bash and using the excellent directory stacks abilities

3122770
width	height
it s easy enough to do a quick bounds check using the width and height of the canvas before drawing but what about drawing parts of things

3122793
put	get
how do i get the different parts of the object and put them separately into strings

3122820
put	get
do not use regex - get a proper parser where you can put in a syntax file

3122857
pop-up	dialog
you can pop-up the dialog with an image and any other text that you might want

3122894
stdout	stderr
i do it like that so that stderr from gcc is fed to stdout and i my perl script processes stdout

3122963
stdout	stderr
the monitorhandle delegate works like redirection except you have the option of using a separate filter for each of stdout and stderr

3122988
width	height
you could generate the tag which embeds the swf file via javascript and print the width and height programmatically based on the size of the containing window

3122988
width	height
the method for retrieving the window width height will probably vary per browser but i m sure you can find a reliable cross-browser way to do it somewhere online

3122988
width	height
if you need to dynamically resize whenever the window is resized then you can attach a handler to the window.onresize event which retrieves the necessary object and embed dom elements and change their width and height properties

3123051
ldf	dbcc
you can shrink the tempdb mdf ldf files using the shrinkfile shrinkdatabase dbcc commands

3123069
vsto	add-in
the only ways around this are to create an add-in vsto vba etc. to sink the document_open event on client machines and run some code to update all fields or create an interop app on the server that opens the doc renders it with some code and then saves it back before sending it on further

3123074
prepare	execute
you now need to create a prepare statement from that string and execute the result

3123094
filesystems	ntfs
though the php documentation only looks about ntfs filesystems

3123124
hide	show
when passing over div1 you show div2 and hide it only after the user get inside it and then exit

3123171
button	checkbox
another reason i would recommend forms to you is that the downloadable code has an error in the checkbox code and doesnt have radio button code there are very simple fixes in the comments on the page i listed but it would be a good challenge for yourself to try and fix the error and add a radio button class

3123184
hide	show
i m using jquery toggle to show hide a div on different links

3123184
hide	show
it show hide them fine however if you click on one of the other links before closing the first link toggle the first div is still show

3123196
min	max	minimum	max
in this equation the min and max are the minimum intensity value and the minimum intensity value in the current image

3123242
hash	salt
hash and possibly salt your passwords before storing them in your database if you ll have user accounts

3123256
vxworks	rtos
you can also choose to use rtos like vxworks or embedded linux that do a whole lot more but are either expensive or huge or both

3123263
ready	each
the html string you re using is cached as a document fragment re-used for future insertions so the second will have that entire string styles and all ready to clone immediately rather than setting styles each time so in a loop it s much faster

3123263
google-chrome	firefox
here s a quick test demo that works in google-chrome or firefox firebug just open your console to see the results the page will lag while it opens...running the tests

3123273
stateless	stateful
using sessions in php is not really a means to encrypt potentially sensitive information like credit cards but to allow programmers to have a way to have stateful information in a stateless protocol http

3123293
min	max
first pass find the max and min level of the image

3123293
min	max
second pass use the max and min values to do the contrast stretching

3123294
put	get
then if possible deal with the chunk you ve receieved and go back and get the next chunk or if it s not possible to process in chunks politely put out an error message and stop

3123334
firefox	safari
my osx.6 firefox safari show only two weights

3123387
datediff	difference
if you are just interested in some part of the difference between the two dates then you should use datediff instead.

3123389
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
a properties declaration simply creates accessor methods for an ivar

3123389
accessor	properties
so properties don t really have names only the accessor methods do

3123389
getter	setter
you can change the names of the methods using the getter and setter decorators like this

3123389
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
now as i said a properties declaration simply creates accessor methods for an ivar

3123389
accessor	properties
so you use properties when you want accessor methods

3123394
division	modulo
you should be consistent if the intent of the operations is arithmetical use modulo and division if it s just for raw bit manipulation use shift and mask

3123402
accessor	ivar
such a correspondence is expected if you re going to synthesize the accessor methods but there are quite legitimate reasons for creating the methods manually and making them do something other than just getting setting a matching ivar

3123402
accessor	properties
for simple synthesized properties it is common to use the accessor either explicitly using or using the dot notation as self.xxx except within dealloc and possibly init depending on who you ask

3123402
accessor	properties
but if you ve gone to the trouble of making them properties you probably want whatever functionality is encapsulated in the accessor methods to be called most of the time

3123407
nsurl	nsstring
make sure that url is of nsurl type and not nsstring

3123408
getter	setter
by using the properties from outside of your class you can for example do some lazy loading and it becomes a lot easier to make any potential api changes by providing deprecation warnings in the getter setter

3123412
hide	show
i am using java swing to create a jdialog and i am trying to create a show hide details button to show hide a report at the bottom of this jdialog

3123418
listview	gridview
with a wpf or other kind of visual app you could have a nice grid listview with the view set to a gridview bound to the collection of simulated clients with columns for things like status duration errors - if you made them dependencyproperties you would see the results update in realtime

3123438
x86	64bit	128bit	64bit
but some sse instructions under x86 support 64bit and 128bit atomic load store of course you must first ensure memory aligment

3123443
put	get
arthur s answer shows that you can t really put both forms on one page because any given controller will only supply one form object you ll never get both active at once

3123482
ada	pascal
i ll just point out that pascal is semantically though not so much syntactically very similar to c so there are options like object pascal modula 2 ada and oberon out there where you will be re-using most of the non-trivial part of what you already know the trivial part being the spelling

3123496
folder	directory
when it comes rather than printing the itself it prints the folder inside the directory + works fine

3123514
inherited	properties
will change the font family in the whole document since css uses cascading styles nested tags inherited certain style properties from their parents â in this case the font

3123515
realloc	strcpy
the call to realloc allocates enough space for the string - so it doesn t actually crash but when you strcpy the string to propdata- northtexture you may be overwriting anything following northtexture in propdata - propdata- southtexture propdata- westtexture etc

3123558
put	get
if you now add the style this will put a border on the body div form and input elements and both the text and the input element will get the font size

3123617
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my xcode from 3.1.2 to xcode versioning 3.2.3 and upgrade my device to 4.0 os

3123621
rss	feed
i am making an iphone application which has a list of rss feed and i want to show a blue bubble on the left with the number of unread articles one bubble per feed just like in mail app as shown here

3123684
gtk	fltk
no mainstream gui toolkit win32 mfc cocoa gtk kde fox fltk does it

3123699
inline	inlining
let s assume for a second that the compiler indeed inline my overloads then it is predetermined at compile time which code will run and i save the call to a function by inlining + a complicated switch case scenario in reality there will be 5+ overloads for + operator but am still able to write easily read code using basic arithmetic operators

3123792
int	chars
assuming some typical sizes for the int and the chars and lack of padding bytes at the end if you write this

3123809
maven	pom.xml
sbt is compatible with maven and ivy so you may generate the project file layout with maven archetypes and switch to sbt later - it will recognize repositories and dependencies specified in the pom.xml

3123828
children	parent
for example if i want to create a click event on the children of a parent element which one should be preferred

3123847
width	height
a non-block element can t have height width specified like that and with no content inside it ll have nothing to give it size - instead you want inline-block like this

3123849
hide	show
easiest would be to give the id of the section div elements as radio button value and then loop through all radio buttons and show hide the element based on the button s checked state

3123857
primes	palindrome
for example my utils module for pe consists of functions for computing primes splitting numbers to digits checking for palindrome and so on

3123868
datediff	difference
for a web query you don t have datediff function but as the others point out a simple difference between the two values will give you the number of days

3123906
ready	each
split each line once when it initially enters the system pass that array or more likely a reference to the array around while doing your processing and then do a single join to turn it into a string when you re ready for it to leave the system

3123918
mouseover	mouseout
i have a problem with my mouseover and mouseout functions

3123918
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
when i mouseover a link it show a hidden and when i mouseout of the div it hide the div

3123935
lisp	scheme
can those who have done anything useful with lisp scheme tell me what how can i take advantage of this type in python

3123980
int	chars
as per the comment it seems that a int to chars conversion a demotion

3123989
int	chars
an int can be converted to a chars and a int can also be converted to a long

3123991
unsigned	short
notice that this is only true on platforms where int can store all values of unsigned short

3123995
public	protected
given classes it is possible to make their methods private public default or protected

3124024
pull	push
pull from a after there are updates push it to b

3124024
pull	push
pull from a merge it with my local files then push it to b merging with the repo on b

3124029
inherited	properties
and inherited of these properties from ancestors

3124040
public	protected
given classes it is possible to make their methods private public default or protected

3124059
min	max
int type min and max is not validating for me it is giving a negative number when i try to give the correct greater than 4 numbers

3124112
wav	aiff
fortunately there seems to be a ruby binding for the audiofile library so you may be able to send your output into that in order to generate a proper aiff wav file

3124152
implements	extends
declare an event handler class and specify that the class either implements an actionlistener interface or extends a class that implements an actionlistener interface

3124173
google-chrome	firefox
project in action can be seen here only supports google-chrome and firefox so far check out fps at bottom left try spreading out the objects i get 14 fps at startup benned celestial

3124192
dao	facade
is it the facade of an api that has a database behind it dao objects your database structure

3124216
implements	extends
since a class can extends other classes and implements interfaces you should check for the most derived or specific one first if you want to distinguish between say sprite and movieclip

3124227
getter	setter
just keep it short and simple aka kiss principle write setter and getter

3124237
srp	principles
the single responsibility principles srp is quite common on the java world

3124269
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your versioning or switch to a better alternative

3124305
debian	linux
install a linux distribution that includes a postfix or qmail package such as debian

3124315
free	malloc
one benefit is that it may help fight memory fragmentation or malloc free overhead when you have a huge number of tiny data objects especially in threaded environments

3124344
erlang	ocaml
approximately on par with ocaml erlang and go

3124365
client-side	server-side
no solution using just system.drawing on the server-side will allow you to have client-side interactivity potentially if you use maps or ajax in conjunction you could but at that point it might make more sense to use a rich framework that is unless you are an expert in javascript

3124410
google-chrome	firefox
still everything looks fine for google-chrome firefox and ie8

3124423
profiling	debugging
i ve tried running ngen update debugging profiling but it didn t change a thing

3124624
vim	emacs
but then reverted to vim where i found ways to do all the things that i was happy doing in emacs

3124726
hide	show
also consider using the hover method if you want to show hide the stuff when mouse enter leaves them

3124761
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout	hide	show	slideup	slidedown
keep in mind though you should use display none instead of visibility hidden so that you can more easily control it s visibility with functions like hide show fadein fadeout slidedown slideup

3124773
hide	show
in this case you will have to use silverlight.js to check for the version of silverlight installed and if it is below v4 show the user your custom message show hide your div

3124775
client-side	server-side
i was wondering if there s a way to use php or any other server-side or even client-side if possible language to obtain certain pieces of information from a different website not a local file like the include nav.php

3124778
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream objectinputstream

3124796
arraylist	treeset
if your application is such that a list will work then an arraylist or linkedlist will be more efficient than either a hashset or treeset

3124810
cos	sin
the haversine formula requires a ton of cos sin function calls but wouldn t it be simpler to store the projected x y and z of a lat lon point on the database and apply the dot product directly

3124855
nhibernate	automapper
whenever i let the fluent nhibernate s automapper hit these guys it makes the child class have a non-nullable foreign key

3124869
width	height
the button is not given a height or width

3124869
width	height
give the button a percentage width or height and it should resize appropriately as the screen changes

3124891
salt	md5	whirlpool	md5	whirlpool	salt
i would not use md5 for hashing passwords consider using something else like sha1 or whirlpool and maybe salt the passwords as well

3124904
children	parent
each child essentially has knowledge of the parent but the parent has no knowledge of the children and the children have no knowledge of each other

3124944
client-side	server-side
there s a significant distinction between php and javascript the former is a server-side scripting language the latter a client-side scripting language

3124979
eigenvalue	diagonal
then take an eigenvalue decomposition of the 3x3 r q dq tick means transpose giving you an orthogonal q and diagonal scaling d

3125011
int	double
i ve been a java developer for 10 years...when it comes to managing numerical data for the most part i ve stuck with int and used double when i need some decimal precision

3125011
int	chars
originally i defined this attribute using an int but now i ve decided to use chars

3125030
ienumerable	icollection
i don t want to expose modification behaviour to them and i don t want them to treat my variable as an icollection in case i later change the way i generate that ienumerable

3125032
google-chrome	firefox
my advice is to use firebug for firefox and devtools for webkit browsers since only firebug lite works on google-chrome and it lacks many features the normal firebug has and the devtools are built into google-chrome

3125061
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i can t think of specifics at the moment but sometimes i ll try debugging something in safari or google-chrome and it seems like such a pita that i launch firefox and get whatever done quickly

int	chars
while this is perfectly acceptable its typically how i do it unless there are more than one chars in a row alignment issues will force the next variable to waste 1-3 bytes anyway which could otherwise have been used for free by an int

3125115
put	get
if line items can only be part of one appointment then i can actually just put a list of line items in each appointment when i get appointments i d already be getting line items

3125123
implements	extends
i am trying to create an application with the only purpose to implements a applescript dictionary and extends applescript

3125146
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	modulo	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	modulo	addition	modulo	addition	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
however i didn t think you could take nibbles from a byte using modulo and subtraction and division nor reassemble them with simple multiplication and addition

3125147
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox you have to cancel the ondragover event for the ondrag event to fire

3125156
put	get
the contents of different .cpp files don t get put together until the linker runs

3125183
16-bit	64bit
which option should be enabled in gcc to generate 16-bit or 32-bit or 64bit object code

3125184
cos	sin
if you precompute and store sin and cos of lat lon and use haversine you will get the exact same performance improvements

3125185
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction can be used to combine the values

3125201
x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
note however that gcc does not support 16-bit x86 and that if both 32-bit and 64bit x86 compilers are installed as an exception you can use -m32 or -m64 to select the desired target format

3125214
pascal	delphi
the switch from 16 to 32 bit was easier because there was less legacy delphi 2 was 32 bit and the object pascal language was a lot simpeler than it is now.

3125218
vim	emacs
if you need only the feature to jump of to the definition of a specific function or class then vim and many other editors like emacs epsilon and joe can read the jump location from the ctags file

3125218
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
for programmable editors like vim emacs epsilon eclipse and gedit you can write your own plugin for your custom language but it may quickly become time-consuming and a maintenance nightmare because new versions of editors tend to change the plugin interface

3125253
width	height
note prior to iphone os 3.0 uiview instances may have a maximum height and width of 1024 x 1024

3125255
mockups	balsamiq
i would give them mockups done with balsamiq mock or some other tool

3125306
g++	gcc
many compilers support it including ms gcc g++ and intel

3125334
post	get
feel free to post more code particularly how anotherview is assigned and you may get a more specific answer

3125351
client-side	server-side
it will automatically generate all the javascript code you need to the server-side validation to work on the client-side

3125367
int	chars
int types but no chars reals subranged or enumerated types

3125398
post	get
this is because post and get are querydict objects which has some implications request.post members will return always one object

3125417
getter	setter
if in some case that s not true you can add a getter setter that actually acts upon the proxied object com.foo.graphics.a

3125458
perl	tcl
it s possible that you re seeing the consequences of the fact that both perl and tcl are independently trying to work around the bugs misfeatures in the system implementation of environment variables

3125458
perl	tcl
i d quite expect perl to work around this and i know that tcl does too but it does mean that only one language should set environment variables and that almost certainly needs to be perl in this case on the basis of evidence you ve presented

3125458
perl	tcl
- otherwise we re talking about having a different build of tcl so that it asks the perl side of things to do the memory management or doing some magic to disconnect the tcl side from the real environment

3125540
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in my experience this works in ie 6 up google-chrome firefox and safari

3125554
accessor	properties
why not just set properties in interface and synthesize accessor in implementation

3125567
portrait	landscape
which means that if the first picture is a landscape and the second one a portrait the second one will be display as landscape with the same dimension as the first one

3125577
stdout	stderr
will return a tuple of strings one for stdout and another one for stderr output

3125605
listview	gridview
listview and gridview seems to be popular for this usage

3125605
listview	gridview
what is the difference between listview and gridview

3125611
listview	gridview
windows presentation foundation wpf provides a gridview view mode that partitions the listview data item content into columns

3125611
listview	gridview
the gridview class and its supporting classes provide the infrastructure to display data items that are specified for a listview control in a series of columns

3125615
hash	md5
while concurring with the previous suggestions of md5 or sha1 hash for generating the unique codes you may also want to care about making sure that those codes could not easily be reverse-engineered

3125615
hash	salt
if this could be problem then include a random salt string with the username string before creating the hash

3125620
equals	tostring
tostring is a method so you need it to be tostring and equality comparisons are performed with two equals signs not one

3125628
listview	gridview
so in other words it s not a choice of listview or gridview

3125628
listview	gridview
if you want to display tabular data in a listview you would create a listview and set its view to a gridview which defines the column layout.

3125631
stdout	stderr
the remote stdout and stderr are piped back to you

3125632
wordpress	joomla
examine how this is achieved in existing established applications such as wordpress drupal or joomla

3125680
portrait	landscape
this code works fine on the iphone simulator with version 4 of the os but when i try to run it on the iphone 4 simulator or the ipad simulator the views are completely off i can only see the about a quarter of the map in portrait and none of the table and in landscape i can see only the table

3125713
hide	show
i am using jquery to show and hide a div by adding removing a class to it

3125713
hide	show
would it be better to use show and hide for the linksdiv than to depend on css

3125725
firefox	safari
works with firefox and safari

3125736
subclass	abstract-class
i m trying to change the signature of the setsomething method in the subclass b but it gives me an error that the subclass b doesn t implement the base abstract-class is there anyway to do this

3125745
centos	linux
what suggestions for centos linux do you have to increase performance

3125753
inherited	subclassing
when you inherited from an abstract-class you either need to provide implementations for all abstract methods or else you must declare the subclassing also as abstract

3125768
portrait	landscape
for example if the device is portrait load pview if landscape load lview

3125869
google-chrome	safari
the reason the video played in google-chrome but not safari is because the agent that makes the 2nd request in safari quicktime 7.6.6 qtver 7.6.6

3125878
rational-numbers	floating-point
gmp is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic operating on signed integers rational-numbers and floating-point numbers

3125903
googletest	cppunit
do yourself a favor and go straight to googletest which makes cppunit and boost unit_test look clunky and repetitive

3125946
mp3	wav
i want to know if it is faster to load and play a small wav than a small mp3 file on android media player

3125949
prepare	execute
the function prepare puts the pieces together for the query and the function execute binds the params and returns the array

3126049
min	max
it is often used to find a better approximation for the max or min value of a set of discrete data points

3126049
min	max
trim again computes the quadratic y a+b x+c x 2 and then finds a max min of this quadratic xm ym

3126049
min	max
there is then some logic to force the returned xm ym min or max values to lie within certain bounds

3126049
min	max
so x3 x1 and the condition says that if the quadratics max min value is outside the interval x1 x3 then set xm ym to x1 y1 as before

3126049
min	max
if not then if y1 is above the min max value in y then again set xm ym to x1 y1

3126050
postgresql	mysql
query insert id the last generated row id as a scalar autoincrement in mysql sequence in postgresql etc

3126079
disk	ram
well the b+ trees i can keep them in ram but the hash table i must be able to maintain it in the hard disk

3126130
implements	extends
they all extends a service class where the singleton behaviour is implements looking something like this

3126179
chown	sudo
sudo chown mysql mysql tmp mysqld.sock

3126182
voip	sip
i don t think there are many sophisticated attacks out there yet so implementing anything beyond dos flooding detection might be a waste of time because creating voip sessions with sip and recording and analyzing multimedia streams is more complicated than just to listen for scans on a specific port

3126197
integer	unsigned
the length of the data is an unsigned integer not an object so you have to use an appropriate format specifier

3126213
cpu	processors
a processors or cpu is the physical chip that is plugged into the system

3126225
hex	binary
you can use unhex function to convert a hexstring with hex pairs to binary and hex to do the other way round

3126253
mouse	keyboard
each mouse click mouse movement keyboard press etc

3126262
hash	md5
md5 isn t encryption - it s a one-way hash

3126288
vbscript	jscript
if i can use vb.net or c# and interpret vbscript or jscript in it i m happy with that

3126299
folder	directory
directory i was using for the new folder

3126308
hash	md5
you can t recover the original password from the md5 hash

3126327
public	protected
it is safe but you should consider providing either a public virtual destructor in zero or a non-virtual protected destructor depending on whether you want to be able to delete objects derived from zero through the base pointer

3126331
switching	screens
do you have the screens orientation lock switching turned on for your ipad

3126339
gif	png
my designer produces psds for the layout and supplies jpg gif png images for the graphical elements

3126368
int	chars
i need to work with the input given by the user how can i get the int and chars input from user and how to store it and how to use it for manipulation in c#

3126374
post	get
i m assuming it s the primary key. i d expect to get nothing unless there were some orphaned post in the post table

3126377
sorting	grouping
what is important is the client want the reports to be displayed in a kind of datagrid with sorting and grouping capability and he wants to increase the 1000 row limitation

3126377
sorting	grouping
he just wanted to increase the current 1000 limit with a sorting and grouping capability

3126377
sorting	grouping
the dotnet version is so poor in performance that i have to use paging but with the silverligh xamlgrid one i have good success in displaying as many as 15k record in less than 3min with all grouping and sorting capability

3126394
put	get
uiwindow doesn t cope well if you try to put views from two view controllers into it only the last one will get the appropriate callbacks and they won t know about each other

3126397
draggable	droppable
i have a problem where the element calls .show when the draggable triggers drag does not let me drop into the droppable

3126405
inline	inlining
with the profiler you can see these more commonly executed branches and inline them selectively but never start by inlining profilers do a good job at telling you what to consider inlining but never what shouldn t be inline

3126419
voip	sip
voip with sip is becoming the de-facto standard

3126419
rtp	sip
this challenge is designed to examine and explore some of attributes of the sip and rtp protocols

3126436
width	height
i m pretty sure this means that i tried to divide a string but in the pyglet documentation it says that width and height are ints

3126448
folder	directory
i would like that xcode after compiling my libs copy them to the executable folder or better copy the libs to a system directory where they would be loaded without having to compile thus copying the libs over again

3126448
folder	directory
there is a install directory in the project s settings the default is usr local lib but i don t even have a folder called local at usr i tried to reach it through the terminal so i guess this isn t working at all.

3126460
disk	ram
we want to minimize storage on disk and ram

3126501
google-chrome	firefox
at least firefox and google-chrome ignore the trailing comma but it s a syntax error in internet explorer

3126501
google-chrome	firefox
after i fixed that your code worked fine for me in google-chrome firefox and ie

3126511
google-chrome	firefox
my website renders correctly in google-chrome but it shows a 16px gap between divs in firefox

3126544
min	max
now i if i have a series of pageviews of a time period but i want to display a time period even if there are no pageviews flotilla seems to render a graphic that only encapsulates the time of the first and last pageview not the min max i want

3126546
scrypt	md5
sadly they do not publish scrypt timings. your md5 is millions of times worse than either of these ready replacements

3126557
integer	unsigned
i just write a procedure to decompose an unsigned integer to prime numbers

3126561
photoshop	fireworks
i have also downloaded several tools like color scheme designer and i even know how to use photoshop fireworks i have read some books about design

3126563
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
as noted above the filesystem on mac os is case-insensitive unless you specifically set up your filesystem to be case-sensitive

3126579
versioning	upgrade
worst case you can always just stick with whatever versioning of the compiler interpreter you currently have you re never forced to upgrade in that respect

3126580
rss	feed
i have two websites that declare an rss feed like so

3126599
google-chrome	firefox
what you ve posted here renders similarly in google-chrome and firefox

3126640
onreadystatechange	onload
with that in mind assuming you must load the yui files asynchronously you should use an onload onreadystatechange handler as noted by digitalfresh

3126659
multiplying	multiplication
seeing as rows in a with the same column entries multiplying to the same result in ab over vector b you can cache the result and use it instead of calculating it again itâ s always good to avoid 100m 100m multiplication if you can

3126683
google-chrome	firefox
have you used the developer tools in your browser firefox - firebug ie - f12 google-chrome - resources tab donno others to either add a breakpoint or monitor the ajax call

3126694
salt	md5
note the method that deepali suggested will not work because newest joomla versions 1.5.x are using the md5 salt form which means that the password is saved in the database in the form of

3126698
opera	firefox
this is my web page which doesn t work in ie8 but works in firefox 3.6.4 and opera 9.63 -

3126706
postorder	inorder
you might find it helpful to study breadth-first search and depth-first search with tree structures as well as pre-order inorder and postorder tree traversal

3126747
uiview	subviews
my app is actually an ipad app with a main uiviewcontroller and three subviews uiview s

3126806
versioning	upgrade
our c++ application hosts sun s jvm and i need to upgrade it to the newest versioning on windows

3126902
cos	sin
you can create 4 new columns being sin and cos of lat and lon

3126902
cos	sin
since and other appearances of sin and cos like can be calculated in the program before running the query the big distance expression reduces to something of the form that can be handled by sqlite3

3126940
ubuntu	linux
will the module compiled on my linux distro ubuntu 10.04 will be able to run on other linux distros as well

3126948
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
this is done with a fileoutputstream objectoutputstream combo as described below

3126992
profiling	benchmarking
the result after a week of researching os-specific methods to detect stack range alignment requirements and doing a lot of testing and profiling was an allocator that could allocate memory in 4 clock cycles according to our tick counter benchmarking as opposed to about 400 cycles for malloc operator new our test involved thread contention so malloc is likely to be a bit faster than this in single-threaded cases perhaps a couple of hundred cycles

3126992
free	malloc
max_align is easy enough to use but if you re after speed for memory allocations and assuming you ve already profiled your code and found hotspots in malloc free operator new delete with major contributors being in code you have control over writing your own allocator can really make the difference

3127006
datediff	difference
instead of casting your datetimes into floats to calculate time difference i suggest using sqlserver s datediff function with the minute or second argument as appropriate

3127034
google-chrome	firefox
i understand why pdf and gif will attempt to open in a browser but the dxf files will using firefox and google-chrome try to open inside the browser window too - unsuccesfully but attempting

3127072
tiff	png
so if the jpg format does not allow to do this any other compressed format like tiff or png would do

3127074
post	get
i am trying to make a query to get the post title link and images of the post

3127074
post	get
now what i really want is to get only the last thumbnail inserted in the post not all of them

3127106
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure if it works in any browser works on firefox google-chrome ie8 doesn t work on ie7-

3127113
udp	tcp
so for best performance should i use tcp or udp

3127126
udp	tcp
udp will for sure give you the best performance because it is connection-less you save the expensive connect call from tcp and the tcp flag management during transmissions

3127132
coalesce	isnull
if you wanted to display a username or their email address if they don t have a username you could use coalesce or isnull for example select isnull username email_address - which gives the value of username unless it is null in which case it gives the value of email_address

3127135
udp	tcp
imho the main difference between tcp and udp is tcp makes sure that packages arrives the destination and udp does not

3127135
udp	tcp
because of that udp is a bit faster than tcp

3127141
ubuntu	debian
it s all from the latest debian packages ubuntu 9.0.4 64 bit

3127146
google-chrome	safari
i should note for the record that google-chrome and some other lesser-known browsers also use webkit but safari for the desktop is more likely to reproduce the results of safari for ios since they re both maintained by apple

3127182
qtextedit	qitemdelegate
what i ve tried is to subclass qitemdelegate and just return the instance of qtextedit i already have like this

3127189
post	get
i ll post an example below to get you in the mood -

3127216
implements	modifiers
i used a few tricks in the get and set methods to allow dynamic property modifiers i m sure you could do the same kind of thing to implements your signals and parent child relations etc

3127225
pull	push
i have a similar usage scenario svn over https password using git for a local repository and push pull to the svn server however i haven t encountered this issue you are mentioning

3127238
int	boolean
how do i convert java.util.map string object to scala.collection.immutable.map string any so that all values in the original map int boolean etc. are converted to the right value to work well in scala

3127254
inherited	subclassing
so all subclassing of command have singleton classes that inherited from command s singleton class

3127264
debian	linux
i use linux kubuntu and downloaded the numpy package as a debian package

3127277
ubuntu	linux
you can use wine and run visual studio s on ubuntu the best option before a total conversion is to dual boot between windows and linux

3127282
ubuntu	linux
i would advice you to keep windows until your work on these projects will be finished dual-boot install ubuntu on another partition and boot it when you don t need to work on your projects or install windows in a virtual machine inside linux f.e

3127282
vmware	virtualbox
using vmware or virtualbox

3127290
post	get
so instead of get or post use delete messages inbox 1234

3127296
httpresponse	request
instead have a render_inbox request method that returns an httpresponse and call the method at the end of each of your views

3127309
put	get
however let s put aside exactness and instead consider a simplified model that might help get you into the right ballpark

3127309
width	height
for example if you count the number of hard line breaks in the text you can treat those as separate since they add height without adding width

3127311
jruby	rubinius
should be easy to build on rubinius clearing methods caches would be the main issue no clue about jruby

3127314
ssms	sqlcmd
in ssms and sqlcmd you have a go separator which is a client-side tool for separating batches

3127318
post	get
with the author parameter you get only post from this author

3127347
textview	imageview
this helps to avoid the overhead of calling findviewbyid for rendering each component inside complex item layouts with multiple components like the textview and imageview in this case

3127373
centos	linux
i tried running this on os x and centos linux

3127375
versioning	upgrade
you re going to have to maintain your own versioning of drupal s htaccess file and deal with this work around every time you upgrade

3127386
dictionary	map
i know i can create a normal array vector and then use an object dictionary to map the keys to the index in the current array

3127401
submit	submission
but radiochoice doesn t naturally submit the form and something likely needs to be done client-side to make an actual form submission occur

3127403
skip-lists	tree
we re left with 2 data structures binary indexed tree ironically the very name fenwick used to describe his structure and ranked skip-lists

3127445
put	get
a debug build will force the compiler to put all variables on the stack and keep them around for their entire scope so you get the expected debug view

3127459
post	get
index.php can examine the requested url segments and potentially whether the request was made via get or post and use this information to dynamically invoke a certain script without the location of that script having to match the directory structure implied by the request uri

3127485
maven	m2e
i working with eclipse helios m2e maven plugin and glassfish plugin

3127495
post	get
nearly every implementation of xmlhttprequest out there chrome internet explorer msxml has a bug where it performs a get instead of a post after following the redirect

3127518
mockito	easymock
the switch from easymock to mockito was very straightforward and i managed to make the tests down compatible test cases behave the same

3127518
mockito	easymock
do you see real reasons or shootout criteria to prefer easymock over mockito

3127568
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
an aggregate-functions avg count sum min max grouping stdev stdevp var and varp

3127582
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
write a menu program that ask a user for a number indicating the four basic math equations addition subtraction multiplication division

3127635
error-handling	exception-handling
the beauty of exception-handling if you do it correctly again see raii is that it avoids the need to litter error-handling code throughout your system

3127637
jar	war
i m using m2eclipse 0.10.0 and i don t use any special workaround it just works for at least 3 projects in my workspace of type jar ejb and war

3127713
width	height
the plugin editor currently requires the user to provide the video s width and height in order for my code to push out the relevant dimensions to the flowplayer

3127713
width	height
i was wondering is there a way to automatically determine the flv width and height rather than having the editor having to provide this information each time

3127713
width	height
ideally i d prefer it if the user simply had to provide the flv location and let the new plugin automatically provide the width height to the flowplayer

3127733
typedef	struct
you can use struct s and enum s without writing struct or enum before every declaration or using typedef

3127737
int	chars
you re going to want to look for the last space before the 0 then you re going to want to call a function to convert the remaining chars to an int

3127758
put	get
if you want all customers do a get to example.com customer if you want to edit a customer you ll probably want to put to example.com customer your customer id

3127758
post	put
have a look at put vs post in rest for the difference between post and put edit and create

3127768
getter	setter
you re obviously getting a collision because the ipcontainer class has two dynamic method definitions one generates just a setter and the other a setter and a getter

3127768
getter	setter
after all in a readonly property in the protocol you ve defined a getter method but in the class you ve also defined a setter method

3127768
accessor	properties
with a dynamic properties the complier has to generate a message to the runtime explaining what accessor to generate on the fly

3127769
post	get
if you happen to have the images in a single directory not really advisable but that s for another post you could run scandir against the directory and then array_rand to get a random image zero database overhead but be careful about having a single directory overloaded with files and be careful to skip . and .. when pulling the random entry

3127784
min	rank
i m looking for the best solution to store the ettings for a website like the limit of posts for users limit of users online rank min

3127794
multiplying	multiplication
if you multiplying them like you would on a normal multiplication you ll have

3127818
post	get
i would like to move this logic to its own logincontroller but that would require remembering where the original request was to and saving all post and get data then doing a redirect to get to the logincontroller

3127849
put	get
when first requested you can put it in the cache object so afterwards you can get them from there for fast retrieval

3127858
cassini	iis
i can t install iis on the designer s machines cassini doesn t support classic asp and we need live save preview

3127871
boost	stl
one of the big reasons for that is the stl the standard template library and boost

3127881
disk	ram
then using a jpeg library that works directly on that array which is independent of the size of ram installed on the machine you should be able to feed the array into the library and have it save the contents out to disk

3127890
scheme	racket
any pointers to scheme racket or clojure bayesian classification libraries

3127914
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
also it s hard coded into all uiviewcontroller - they always have a reference to the uinavigationcontroller that contains them

3127934
int	double
is it not possible to use int or double as a type parameter and use addition in scala

3128022

the issue i m having is that when trying to grab the frames of two nstableview s hosted within portion b and c of my nssplitview i receive relative coordinates

3128893
width	height	nstableview	nssplitview
as you can see from the returned nsrect values i m given the correct width and height of the nstableview but what i m really after is their position relative to the parent nssplitview

3128893
nstableview	nssplitview
of course i could use a number of iboutlets and construct the correct rect value myself but what i m really looking for is an easy way to grab the frame of the nstableview relative to either the parent nssplitview or the containing window

3128896

3129248
cdr	cons
also cons and car and cdr are primitives the implementation you see below is the demonstration in structure and implementation of computer programs that shows they aren t strictly needed as them but having them as primitives dramatically increases performance so better not re-define your cons car and cdrs

try-catch	exception-handling
however if your destructors do something more complicated like maybe remove a lock file on disk or something where it would make a difference whether the program called destructors or not when crashing you may want to wrap your main in a try-catch block that catches everything only to exit on exception-handling anyway just to ensure that the stack always unwinds before terminating

3129383
division	modulo
it shouldn t use division or modulo

3129383
subtraction	addition
not that these are bad granted they tend to be an order of magnitude slower than addition subtraction negation etc. but they aren t needed and if they re present it probably means the implementation isn t really that efficient

3129443
move	drag
i have a wpf 4 app which i want to enable drag and drop with currently i have it working with a basic drag and drop implementation but i have found that it would be much better if instead of the mouse cursor changing over to represent the move operation i could use an image underneath my finger

3129443
move	drag
my drag and drop operation is initiated inside a custom user control so i will need to insert a visual element into the visual tree and have it follow my finger around perhaps i should enable the manipulationdelta event on my main window check for a boolean then move the item around

width	height
span for one thing cannot have width and height

3130305
width	height
some earlier ie version actually let you have width and height

3130306
width	height
by default a span element is display inline so the height and width properties do not apply to it

3130306
width	height
use a different element one which is block by default or change the display property to one that height and width apply to to get this to work

3130307
width	height
would allow you to set the height and width of the span element but it will no longer line with other text

3130340
equals	gethashcode
there s only one way to satisfy the requirements of gethashcode with an equals like this

and no md5 hash does not change

3130401
free	malloc
even if your system s malloc implementation happens not to store metadata adjacent to the allocated memory blocks you re likely going to be walking recursive structures just to find all the pointers you need to free

3130425
stdout	stderr
try redirecting stderr to stdout and using to capture that

3130425
stdout	stderr
since your command redirects stdout somewhere it shouldn t interfere with stderr

3130435
stdout	stderr
dd writes both stdout and stderr

3130440
postgresql	mysql
the same goes for mysql and postgresql

qtableview	qtreeview
and if you have a view qtreeview qlistview qtableview etc and you want to edit the currently selected item connect the appropriate signal slot

3132448
puts	gets
the --all option puts all of the changesets into the bundle file -- you can be cleverer and only export recent changes but that gets a little more complicated and risks losing changesets using --all is brutal but fail-safe

3132459
post	get
i read about sending http requests and receiving their responses on iphone sdk 3.2 using nsurlrequest and nshttpurlresponse all my requests are get and there s no post but i don t know how to do that exactly cause some of my responses are just strings plain text and some others are binary files gzip and mp3

3132738
children	parent
in this diagram you create a parent table i call it poster and the employee and group tables are children

3132801
ant	maven
i tried using maven with the a project but that wasn t working so i switched to the in-built ant ivy system

3132801
groovy	gsp
while both have groovy and gsp support neither seems to be able to use ivy

3132836
post	get
if that s the case then i think you have a javascript error that is causing the link action a get to be invoked instead of the ajax post call

3132857
google-chrome	firefox
i get around 79ms in google-chrome 117ms in firefox for a million runs...so this will fix the hanging issue

3132858
powerpc	i386
for comparison the last time ubuntu compiled eglibc for a 64-bit machines it took about 1.75 hours for amd64 and about 2.5 hours for both i386 and powerpc

3132887
folder	directory
this probably means you ve installed workpress in the yoursite.com blog directory - for example if you ftp into your site you ll see the folder listed which is the base directory of your site

3132909
postgresql	mysql
also i don t like to run postgresql locally so i have it run with like in development mysql sqlite and ilike in production postgresql

onclick	onchange
you could use the body s onload event or another event in your input like onclick or onchange depending on what you want to do

3133076
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
unfortunately in opera 10.54 safari 4 and firefox 3+ the checkbox isn t clickable as the #right-column is capturing the click before it propogates down to the checkbox

3133089
hash	md5
there s only so many bits in an md5 hash so by the pigeonhole principle it s impossible to reverse it

3133179
pascal	delphi
the reason i started the project with prism was two-fold i wanted to program in pascal again and i found out that delphi prism pays lip-service to crossplatform development and i want my program to run on mac os x with a native gui at the end

3133254
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side language if you need to perform client-side actions you need to use a client-side language

3133268
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
apparently self-closed tags will not render in firefox + ie but will in opera + google-chrome and are not valid in general per why don #39

3133306
jtable	jlabel
then when a single row of the jtable is selected i need to display some information regarding the model object corresponding to the selected row on some jlabel

3133315
google-chrome	firefox
so i have this in my ror app it works in firefox google-chrome and safari.

3133336
mouse	keyboard
which works for keyboard keys not mouse buttons

3133343
int	boolean
the first thing you will benefit from is you are not restricted to string values you can get int boolean guid and string values out of your configuration object without any work and anything else you need you can create custom type converters

3133362
post	get
if you want people to get a better idea of what is wrong you should post your code

3133379

google-chrome	firefox
firefox didn t mind ie and google-chrome were seeing the session as being expired as soon as it was set

3133406
client-side	server-side
before reading the uploaded file the server-side code must save it on the server client-side file location is mostly irrelevant at this point

3133408
put	get
i would not put them in high priority on your side until ie9 get nearer to release or late beta

3133421
put	get
what you have to remember is that the directories are only for the developers purposes once you hit compile that does not matter because all files get put into 1 root compilation

3133458
config	ini
you could also take out the middle man and have the config stored in a php array no need to parse an ini or xml or whatever if that s the case

3133468
put	get
otherwise it probably will get more difficult - maybe put some controller class in between that caches the relevant data or synchronizes access to core data

3133498
maven	pom.xml
i am wondering if there is a way to reference websphere jars other than via dependencies in pom.xml and loading them all to maven repository

this is what i usually do with my radio button and checkbox

3133615
firefox	safari
in ie and firefox it appears normally but in safari the menu items appear blank

3133646

i guess that this form is either using get instead of post or the input fields are not named username and password

3133706
listview	gridview
i would like to bind a to a gridview in a listview and i m not having much luck

3133739
installation	upgrade
we were quite fortunate in this respect that if there was a change to the centralised static data we needed to include it in the upgrade part of the installation instructions so by default it was stored in the scm repository checked out by the developers and installed as part of their normal workflow

3133762
mouseover	mouseout
when you handle your mouseover and mouseout events you should use the stop function to clear the animation queue

3133762
mouseleave	mouseenter
the usefulness of the .stop method is evident when we need to animate an element on mouseenter and mouseleave

3133763
mouseover	mouseout
your mouseover and mouseout events would then modify those variables that are polled and so you wouldn t have to worry about triggering hundreds of animations

3133786
try-catch	exception-handling
so you could wrap the whole thing in a function that contains a try-catch and return false if you got an exception-handling or true if you got an actual value

3133801
webclient	webrequest
for http use either the webclient or webrequest webresponse classes

3133827
post	get
some users are trying to submit forms via get when my form method is post

3133855
post	get
if the administrator is the only one allowed to post then you may be able to get away with using limit 1

3133862
cassini	iis
update just a thought to rule out iis config try running the site under cassini built-in dev server

3133881
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere mq explorer 6 does not seem to have an option for this.

some browser plug-ins toolbars have a feature which allows changing forms from get - post and vice-versa

3133900
rss	feed
content is coming via an rss feed that includes images

3133914
width	height
for the sake of simplicity you might want to consider using the x y width height values

3133944
folder	directory
my problem is that i want to make php think that the root folder is their home directory and they cannot go upper than their home directory

3134000
equals	gethashcode
edit something has to be up with my equals or gethashcode implementations somewhere since assert.areequal expected unionedcrs.distinct distinct should remove duplicates

3134003
post	put	post	get	put	get
you design your site to work as intended you put your get post restrictions on your methods for security or other reasons

3134003
post	get
if the user tries to get around your security with some advanced tools plugins such as get post switches it s not your concern

3134015
colorbox	thickbox
i have tried using colorbox and thickbox

3134065
post	get
redirect the user to a second page after the submit using the post redirect get pattern preferably in combination with one of the above

3134069
post	get
use the post redirect get pattern

3134084
vsto	add-in
clickonce is designed for desktop applications console apps xbap apps and vsto add-in

3134123
width	height
the width and height of the wall is constant but the width and height of the toy s is variable also the number of toy divs is dynamic and as the number increases toy s need to arrange as rows

3134139
onresume	onpause
or you could use sharedpreferences to store intermediate value that s read in onresume .. to restart the timer and saved in onpause ..

3134165
int	double
unboxed types are like int double etc. and the boxed types are like etc

3134183
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to capture global mouse and keyboard input

3134188
accessor	properties
i get the error accessor must declare a body because properties is not marked as abstract or extern

3134204
solaris	aix
for example if you options are windows linux osx aix solaris and you type in then the options that would show up are windows and linux

3134205
hide	show
i am able to hide the correct when clicking show more however i am lost as to choosing the correct expanded paragraph and then implementing the opposite for collapsing

3134315
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
for example you can loops through an associative arrays using a for-loop which you can t do with a hashtable

3134320
post	get
i was wondering if i am allowed to have one python file with several request handler classes each of which has get and post methods

3134328
quicksort	heapsort
for example using linear search instead of binary search using wrong sort algorithms for example quicksort heapsort are faster than bubble sort on unsorted data but insertion sort can be faster than quicksort on partially sorted data

3134336
versioning	upgrade
did you recently upgrade tortoisesvn from a previous versioning

3134365
allocator	stl
learn what memory allocator strategies are for each stl container

3134370
post	get
has get and post methods

3134370
post	put	post	get	put	get
this doesn t mean the yaml file lets you call any method whatsoever of course rather it hands control to a .py file whose main is responsible for all that follows and with the webapp mini-framework that comes with app engine it will always be get or post method or put delete ... etc if you also support those -- few do unless they re being especially restful

3134430
boost	allocator
we can mitigate the issue by making vector store shared_ptr but now we pay for two additional heap allocator per expensiveelement inserted one for the reference counter in boost shared_ptr and one for expensiveelement along with the overhead of a pointer indirection each time we want to access expensiveelement stored in the vector

3134430
boost	allocator
you can really get a speed boost by writing your own memory allocator though this is not a trivial thing to do and don t forget alignment if you do

3134434
post	get
and in your form post action in controller you can get the value as

3134435
width	height
the height of the .wall and the width of each .toy collapse when the toys are absolutely positioned but you can just add a few more lines to get set their width and height in the above .each loops

3134444
pop-up	dialog
unfortunately i don t enforce that the button cannot be clicked while the dialog box to browse file is opened so i get error error #2041 only one file browsing session may be performed at a time. if i click on the button while the pop-up dialog box is up

3134444
pop-up	dialog
it does not let you click on their button above select files to upload while the pop-up dialog box is showed

3134486
width	height
simply display the swf inside of the html with 100 width and 100 height

3134494
pull	push
thereafter a plain git pull git push will do what you expect

3134495
rss	feed
i have the following rss feed that i m trying to parse using touchxml for an iphone application

3134495
rss	feed
the code i m using the following method to parse the rss feed

3134512
google-chrome	firefox
that plug-in works great in firefox and google-chrome and ie8...on adsense and some other ads programs...but the problems begins on ie7...from some reason sometimes the ads loads in the containers and sometimes they not.

3134583
folder	directory
copy to output directory copies folder structure but only want to copy files

3134592
skip-lists	tree
an associative array could be implemented by a hash table most implementations will do that but it could also be implemented by some sort of tree or a skip-lists or the algorithm just iterates over all elements in the array and looks for a key that matches this would be awfully slow but it works

3134602
strstr	substr
i m trying to evaluate different substr search ala strstr algorithms and implementations and looking for some well-crafted needle and haystack strings that will catch worst-case performance and possible corner-case bugs

3134654
int	double
so particular unboxed types like int# double# really are represented just as double or int on the machine in c notation

3134672
fadein	fadeout
i have a refresh button and i want the old content to fadeout and then the new content to fadein

3134672
fadein	fadeout
so when my refresh button is clicked i launch jquery s fadeout effect and also my own portlet.content function which does an async get builds a new bit of content and passes it on and then when both are complete i remove the old content append the result of the second function which is in and fadein the new content

3134679
postgresql	mysql
if that helps i m using symfony 1.4 with mysql innodb and have also tried with postgresql with the same result

3134725
width	height
the element that wraps the actual button and shows the visual pointer cursor and background image has a width of 140px and a height of 30px

3134725
width	height
now you don t want to hardcode these values to the button again you want to set this button to 100 width and height

3134731
rtp	rtsp
streaming via rtsp or rtp in html5

3134738
put	get
i am just starting to learn hashtables and so far i know that you take the object you want to hash and put it through an hash function then use the index it returns to get the corresponding object you want

3134787
abc	subclassing
i could only come up with well you force your subclassing to implement abstract methods and prevent them from instantiating the abc

3134788
equals	gethashcode
i m working on writing a compiler and one feature of this compiler is that it automatically generates gethashcode equals object and equals this value type methods for value types

3134825
haskell	ocaml
c c++ haskell ocaml

3134853
put	get
the simplest way to get all of the matches would be to put a capturing group around the whole thing like this

3134857
post	get
this method works because although an attacker can force your browser into sending get post requests he cannot view the response and there for cannot read this token needed to forge the request

3134857
salt	md5
md5 is used to obscure how the salt is generated

3134865
post	get
it works fine when javascript is disabled and the post method is used with just php but when the get method is used along with javascript i m getting this undefined problem

3134875
profiling	instrumentation
time just times the whole operation while profiling runs it under instrumentation so it can get a detailed breakdown

3134896
folder	directory
i d create a folder called tmp in your user directory and target that location instead

3134931
post	get
if this or my previous post answers your question please click the answer icon so i get reputation points

3134951
serializable	deserialization
i am now having to choose between using serializable deserialization and raw data buffer

3135047
getter	setter
i think you could best use one representation and provide getter and setter which eventually do the conversion to the other representation

3135070
button	checkbox
on selectall button i am selecting all the checkbox from my fieldset

3135120
getter	setter
it would also be wise to access fields like parent and child through getter and setter

3135191
multiplying	multiplication
at the processor level the multiplication is just load load multiplying load multiplying .

3135221
django	web2py
i plan on using a python framework to implement the website leaning towards django or web2py so existing python module support would be a plus

3135233
terminate	timeout
however timeout and other fatal errors still terminate the script as normal

3135238
ienumerable	ilist
i would do the null checks in the constructor and take ienumerable as argument instead of ilist

3135321
children	parent
the order in which they are added to the collection guarantees i think that the children will always be processed after the parent

3135358
super	implements
that has its own overhead being a tree but if you really find that to be an efficiency problem you could implements a fast memory allocator to insert and remove elements super fast note only do this if you profile and determine this to be a bottleneck

3135382
starttls	smtps
edit if you don t need encryption just leave out starttls and stick to the e smtps standard as defined in the rfcs .

3135399
expression-blend	silverlight
i have recently installed expression-blend 4 and created a test silverlight 4 project

3135403
parallels	bootcamp
it will probably run really slow in parallels but you could also use bootcamp and then run virtualpc

3135429
folder	directory
if the website s physical directory is not in c inetpub wwwroot and is instead in c myprojects project1 - which account needs what rights to the myprojects or the project1 folder

3135446
hash	md5
crypto ones md5 tea sha as well - though crypto hash tend to be much slower

3135453
postgresql	mysql
it only supports postgresql mysql and oracle by default

3135456
folder	directory
the resource bundle is in a directory version1 placed in a class folder in eclipse which is at the top of my class path

3135472
outputstream	inputstream
my current solution involves having a threaded reader that reads data from an inputstream and then writes the data to outputstream objects that have been associated with the reader

3135482
addition	multiplication
now if you re interested in the theoretical question there is also a solution using addition rather than multiplication

3135505
qcombobox	qstandarditem	qcombobox	qstandarditemmodel
i am trying to put a qcombobox into a qstandarditem to be used in a qstandarditemmodel

3135508
mouse	keyboard
in macos x every event every keyboard key pressed every mouse key pressed or mouse movement creates an event that travels the following path

3135521
post	get
if you implement something i would like to get the code don t forget to post back the results

3135524
crypt	salt
using characters outside of this range in the salt will cause crypt to return a zero-length string

3135524
crypt	salt
where it seems that crypt has cut the salt itself to a length of 22

3135524
crypt	salt
does this mean that if i use the same salt for all encrypting all my passwords i have to crypt it first

3135591
integer	unsigned
unpacking it as a big-endian unsigned 32bit integer 2i looks a bit like it might be projected coordinates of some kind.

3135638
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in general only google-chrome and safari webkit-based browsers support most of html5 the other browsers including ie8 and firefox lack support for various features

3135643
crypt	salt
the phrase using characters outside of this range in the salt will cause crypt to return a zero-length string referse to outside the range of base 64 not the range of 22 characters

3135643
put	get
try putting an illegal character in the salt string and you should find that you get an empty output or if you put 22 characters in resulting in illegal empty bytes

3135664
cvs	rcs
the cvs repository will contain the rcs files generally ending in v

3135664
cvs	svn
i d seriously consider migrating the repository to something other than cvs git hg even svn

3135697
hlsl	glsl
hlsl has some differences from glsl

3135697
hlsl	glsl
there is a sourceforge project hlsl to glsl tool

3135697
hlsl	glsl
also i believe that the nvidia cg toolkit can generate hlsl or glsl

3135706
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome support a pretty hefty chunk of the proposed html5

3135716
switching	screens
if that modeless dialog fills the whole screens is there a way to switching out to a different screens

3135716
switching	screens
does any one know a way to switching modeless screens with out closing the screens so i can stop it

3135736
octree	quadtree
usually bsp-trees or quadtree or octree

3135754
integer	unsigned
536739282 is well within the maximum boundary of an unsigned 4 byte integer which is upwards of 4 billion

3135756
folder	directory
if all the code isn t in the same folder or identified using references then you may want to add include directory - with vc this is typically located under project properties configuration properties c c++ general additional include directory

3135771
integer	unsigned
unsigned int your 4 byte unsigned integer allows for values from 0 to 4 294 967 295

3135780
post	get
edit the above is mostly wrong this blog post might get you started faster

3135846
width	height
in order to use the width 100 css property on an element the element s parent needs to have a defined height

3135854
int	chars
it s a common source of confusion for mysql users to see int 20 and assume it s a size limit something analogous to chars 20

3135890
map	quadtree	r-tree	quadtree
if your map is feebly filled and there are a lot of empty tiles it make sense to use some spatial indexes like quadtree or r-tree or bsp-trees

3135908
width	height
i have a div with a height of 500px and a width of 200px

3135910
uiview	calayer
i wasn t sure if you were adding a calayer or a uiview

3135912
mouseout	mouseleave
instead of mouseout here you want mouseleave so replace this

3135912
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

3135914
setinterval	settimeout
btw - you can use setinterval instead of settimeout - it sets a repeating timer

3135990
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in .htaccess or preferably in httpd.conf in the directory section for home domain_tld

3136004
google-chrome	firefox
is it because google-chrome has much better javascript support than firefox

3136019

if you re actually submission the form asynchronously then just set some token toggle in as form s data-xxx attribute after the succesful form submit

3136044
unsigned	short
i have tried passing in a pointer to an unsigned short bstr and various other things and the dll crashes on the string

3136054
folder	directory
also in this folder dialogs i opened a new directory complexwizard

3136086
post	get
i got a view where i list files and i got a delete button but i got problems the delete act like a link get instead of post

3136092
inherited	properties
i have a situation with a lot of redundant c# code and it really looks like some kind of crafty trick using some properties of inherited or generics would solve this

3136114
springsource	grails
not only because it has great grails support but because springsource is the company behind the grails project

3136142
profiler	yourkit
an alternative is to use a profiler like yourkit

3136308
jlist	jtable
i know a lot of people can be wary of including yet another jar file but to be honest no matter how simple the jtable or jlist or jcombobox i always utilise the glazedlists library

3136308
sorting	filtering
the great thing with using this library is it s seriously easy to add sorting and filtering to the table

onresume	onpause
so probably keep track of the current active activity or a flag that the activity is visible in onresume onpause or onstart onstop depending on exactly what behavior you want

3136408
onresume	onpause
if you re using a service you could bind to the service in every activity in the onstart onstop or onresume onpause

3136420
getter	setter
from my understanding using attr_accessor is used to create getter and setter methods for that variable so that we can access the variable like object.variable or

int	chars
so the only possiblity for a chars code to be larger than int_max is if int is a 16 bit type or specifically less than 22 bits

3136601
int	chars
if that would be the case then you simply can not store a chars code in an int

3136601
int	chars
if int is a 32 bit type or at least 22 bits then a chars code will not overflow when cast to an int

3136645
jquery	scriptaculous
lift s javascript can sit on top of jquery and yui and could sit on top of prototype scriptaculous as well. the actual polling code includes back-off on connection failures and other graceful ways of dealing with transient connection failures

3136656
vbscript	vba
this thread is about vbscript but it is very similar to vba

3136677

however you d still need to plumb in every movie feed or find some way to cycle through them is the tt1013743 part of your rss uri example incremented for each new film

3136677

your best bet may be to contact imdb and ask for a recently updated rss feed to be added

3136691

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am able to build the shared library on os x but i am not familiar with how to create a plugin bundle that firefox google-chrome safari can use

3136803
getter	setter
you can achieve that by implementing getter and setter in the delegate class

3136803
getter	setter
so the variable you to assess is set in the currentlink string by setter method and class where you want the string just use the getter method

3136806
min	max	minimum	max
we ll call min your target minimum and max your target max

3136822

3136893
qstring	qtextstream	qstring	qdatastream	qstring	qbytearray	qdatastream	qbytearray	qbytearray	qtextstream	qtextstream	qdatastream
better use qbytearray instead of qstring and qdatastream instead of qtextstream or for better error handling write directly to the socket

free	malloc
use normal malloc and free

3137339
width	height
i know the width and height i need the two divs to be but i don t know what absolute position they should be if i read correctly we need to specify absolute positioning for divs using z-index

3137363
for-loop	loops
given that your for-loop appears to be using a loops body dependent on ordering it s most likely not a candidate for parallelization

3137372

3137496
wordpress	phpbb
i have looked at phpbb wordpress and other apps to see if they specified foreign keys or not to ensure referential integrity

3137514
pop-up	dialog
if you are using the window.open type of pop-up then i would say make it a little simpler and bring it into your page as a jqueryui dialog box that pulls in your external html file are the content loading it in the div and accessible within the general page context inheriting the jquery and css as well

3137514
pop-up	dialog
where #id is the div that is hidden and will contain your dialog data and url is the external url to the html file in your pop-up

3137521
next	except
using a genexp rather than the listcomp syntactically round parentheses instead of the listcomp s square brackets it s the next that actually does most of the work advancing i and doubling it instead of lumping all work at construction time -- this takes up less temporary memory and may save time if the loop body s reasonably likely to break out early but except in such special conditions very tight memory or likely early loop termination a listcomp may typically be by a wee little bit faster

3137522
innodb	myisam
myisam years ago myisam was considered the fast storage engine and innodb was considered the storage engine you d reluctantly have to use if you couldn t do without transactions

3137522
innodb	myisam
but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam

3137522
innodb	myisam
when i need fulltext indexing i either maintain a myisam table as a mirror of my primary storage in innodb or else i use apache solr

3137585
getter	setter
it sounds like you want to synthesize create getter setter methods a property for a member variable

3137611
allocator	stl
use dynamic allocator or the stl

3137616
getter	setter
the synthesize line creates getter setter methods for the ivar

3137625
gif	png
gif jpeg and png are more complex - the data is compressed

3137631
gitignore	hgignore
you can add the .svn folders and the artifacts to the hgignore or the gitignore files to keep the repository clean and then when you get back you can just do an svn commit of the changes or if you want to get fancy do a staged commit back to subversion for every significant unit of work you checked into mercurial git while you were on the road

3137653
opera	firefox
adding a more compact version works in ie6 firefox opera chromium

3137658
post	get
while no longer really an issue in the later builds of php get post cookies used to have quotes automatically escaped.

3137673
getter	setter
the nice thing is you can synthesize your properties and the setter getter methods will be built for you depending on your property options of course but you can write your own instead and they will be used

3137673
getter	setter
in the case where you are providing your own setter getter you can alternatively use the dynamic propertyname line instead of synthesize to tell the compiler these are being provided by you

3137677

the dot notation is just shorthand for calling the getter or setter method

3137742
lisp	smalltalk
i understand that some languages such as smalltalk and lisp are incredibly flexible but i m not looking for something that can be done fairly simple by one team but something which is an attempt to bring this to the whole language and allow it as common practice

3137746
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko

direct3d	directx
go to the directx applet in the control panel and look under the direct3d tab

3138136
direct3d	directx
whilst in the directx control panel applet increase the debug output level for direct3d to maximum

3138139
getter	setter
if you have an atomic property and then override the getter or setter you lose the atomicity unless you implement it yourself

3138139
getter	setter
so it is generally safe to override synthesized getter and setter but there are caveats and it is very important that you understand what they are so that if when things break you know why

3138141
free	malloc
while it s possible for there to be multiple heaps in a single address space glibc is implemented in such a way that there is only one standard heap by standard heap i mean the one you access via malloc free

3138150
rss	feed
note that the qsystemtrayicon class will raise exceptions if it doesn t have an icon â â i grabbed the rss feed svg from wiki commons for my icon.svg but you can give qicon a png directly and not mess around with qtsvg

3138250
hex	binary
to expand on moron s answer what the bailey-borwein-plouffe formula does for you is that it lets you compute binary or equivalently hex digits of pi without computing all of the digits before it

3138251
rss	feed
if you are using database driven website you can manipulate a dynamic rss feed from your db

3138251

filtering	grouping
if you want to search filtering sort or grouping by a certain attribute the index structures and optimizations of a dbs are appropriate

3138296
filtering	grouping
however when using a db for storing large files blobs which contain unstructured data in the sense that you are not going to search filtering sort or grouping by any part of the files then these files just blow up the database size and make it slow

3138349
folder	directory
then the mywebsite part of that url is the virtual directory and iis knows exactly how to handle that because it is mapped directly to a folder on the file system

3138398
tolower	toupper
obviously modify the length if you want to allow more characters the example below requires a tolower toupper as it uses 26

3138402
inherited	properties
naturally all of this is also possible to do by creating a mycombobox custom control inherited from combobox with an added unselectedpromptproperty as a dependency properties

3138402
hide	show
then the logic to show or hide the unselectedpromptproperty would come from the validation callback on the dp

3138403
flex	osmf
according to here it s a combination of the new fms3.5 adaptive bitrate streaming flex 4 and osmf

3138475

3138486
typedef	struct
typedef struct _edgenode

3138491
int	chars
of course this assume that contains chars otherwise it s useless to capitalise it and to escape it with mysql_real_escape_string just cast it to int

3138508
children	parent
and i think it would be preferable to set the views widths based on the parent view s width as opposed to the screen s width but i m not clear on how to do that either because at the time that i m trying to set up the widths of my children views parentview.getwidth returns 0

3138676
equals	gethashcode
here s a convenient summary of the rules why is it important to override gethashcode when equals method is overridden

3138698
setinterval	settimeout
to clarify the question is to halt the script execution completely for a certain amount of time not to delay the execution of some piece of code which wouild be a task for settimeout or setinterval

3138698
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval do not halt the script execution like some people here seem top think

3138709

3139247
ant	maven

getter	setter
one trick i ve found useful is to create a package with stateful variables in the package body and simple setter and getter functions

3139432
min	max
otherwise your options is to store data differently and maintain a list of min max numbers associated with a table

3139446

you might expect numeric conversions between say int and double but you d have to code these yourself .net doesn t treat them as typecasts

3139754
jruby	rubinius
you should try an alternative ruby implementation like jruby or rubinius

3139771
range	max
i can never remember which is the best temp table mechanism for sql server sorry - it may be better to go with a table variable and may need to add indexes + keys either way. you can then select max totalallocated from that for a given date range

one way to get around it would be to put your select inside it s own sub and then you can exit it with exit sub exit function

openssl	m2crypto
openssl is reading extracting and verifying this files correctly but how can m2crypto report that there is no content

3139952
pull	push
it is doable with a central repo with access push pull managed by gitolite

3140027
put	get
i fully understand the reasoning behind this and i put in the numeric_limits check to see if i could get the compiler to shut up about it it worked for msvc

rtsp	sdp
turns out that sdp data is only transmitted when using rtsp

3140269
rtp	sdp
when streaming rtp i had to provide the sdp file myself

3140269
rtsp	sdp
use wireshark to record the sdp file transmitted over rtsp

3140272
pop-up	dialog
every time i access the website it pop-up a dialog asking for user name and password

3140294
public	protected
if performance is an important thing gaming programming for example does putting class attributes not public private or protected allow the compiler to make more optimized code

3140321
freebsd	linux
incidentally .communicate at least in python s 2.5 and 2.6 standard libraries will only handle about 64k of remote data on linux and freebsd

3140332
public	protected
there s no such thing as public private and protected once your code is compiled so it cannot affect performance

3140335
width	height
i think you can use a normal 2 dimensional array to represent the whole board inner board with the border and you can know the type of each cell if it in the inner board or in the border using its position the border cells have x value 0 or width -1 and y value 0 or height -1

3140353
xmltype	clob
incidentally if you are storing xml text it might be worthwhile using the xmltype datatype for the column instead of clob

3140369
mockito	easymock
easymock so you can get the idea easymock didn t have nicemock before mockito came along

3140378
accessor	properties
as regards your public void setsomethingforthecell ... instead i would provide an accessor properties for the cell elements

3140396
email	dkim
i have a script that is sending email via smtp and i m trying to get it to sign email with a dkim signature using cpan s mail dkim signer

3140477
width	height
as spliff already mentioned the problem is because the default w3c box model is content-box which results in borders being outside of the width and height

3140477
width	height
but you want those to be within the 100 width and height you specified

3140477
width	height
the only workaround for this is to use css expressions within a conditional comment to explicitly set the width and height of the wrapper to the viewport s sizes minus the width of the border

3140501
punctuation	words
words selection provides correct interpretation of punctuation marks within and following words

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
d oh adding it in viewdidappear or better viewwillappear did the trick

3140695
realloc	malloc
so realloc would be defeated by the malloc method but to say how much you should do tests and i think there s a bias on how the system is when the memory requests are done

3140695
realloc	malloc
depending on how many times you expect the realloc malloc have to be performed it could be an useful idea or an unuseful one

3140707
serializable	deserialization
you can use remoting for communication but if you are concerned with performance then you can use sockets and google s protobuf for message contraction and serializable deserialization

3140724
getter	setter
try reorganized your code to use getter and setter your internal structure is a mess and it will only get messier with time

3140750
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
however it occurs to me that you could use an associative arrays and reduce the nested for loops to a single for-loop

3140770
innodb	myisam
i mean the existing table uses myisam and the new one uses innodb

3140897
restrict	shared
i would reccomend shared ssh method you set up separate user account for repository management add developer s ssh public keys you should restrict them to be used only with mercurial with specific repositories and then use ssh hguser server path to repository as an url

3140897
pull	push
btw by default mercurial doesn t run any hooks if a user used to do push pull is not in trusted list

a couple of hours later i used protege s pellet plugin to create and export an inferred model

3140986
equals	gethashcode
btw note that when you override equals you should also override and implement gethashcode

3141013
onmouseover	onclick
since in your code you are using loadit this in onclick event you don t need to use document.getelementbyid because element is already referenced with this keyword also you may want to use the onmouseover event instead of click event if you want to something to happen when element is hovered like

3141095
ceil	sqrt
if these precomputations are inconclusive then i can t think of anything other than everyone else s solution a ceil sqrt a 2 b

3141095
ceil	sqrt
it is faster in principle to compute ceil sqrt a than sqrt a because the floating point arithmetic can be simplified to integer arithmetic and because you don t need as many newton s method steps to nail down high precision that you re just going to throw away

3141095
ceil	sqrt
if for whatever reason you don t have that microcode to help you then it might be worth it to hand-code ceil sqrt a

3141121
m2e	pom.xml
m2e can do that for you by deriving the settings from the pom.xml

3141123
iboutlet	ibaction
both iboutlet and ibaction are used by only interface builder to find outlets and actions

3141131
nsstring	nsdata
generally speaking do we have to release at the end of the method each object variables nsstring nsdata ... that were created within this method

3141190
hash	salt
since your passwords should be salt and hash before they are persisted that s definately out of the scope of what a user should be doing

3141190
hash	salt
then you could have a module separate of the user for authenticating the password using the same salt and hash method

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome leads over firefox in my tests but it can still take 5-8 seconds for the browser to render 300 records

3141284
google-chrome	firefox
one thing i have noticed is that both firefox and google-chrome do not render anything until they loop over all items in the json array even though i explicitly insert the newly created elements into dom after every loop as soon as i have the html

3141292
pull	push
i know that i can do this via sql cache dependency but i want to use a push rather than a pull kind of notification

3141297
integer	unsigned
the next question is why comparing an unsigned integer with a signed integer does not distinguish them

3141297
integer	unsigned
so likely the most natural thing is to avoid strange casting and permit a cpu like comparison which in this case lead to 0xffffffff -1 on 32 bit compared to 0xffffffff 0 on 32bit which are the same and more in genereal one can be considered as maxuint the maximum unsigned integer that can be hold and the other as -1

3141384
terminate	timeout
this script terminate only thanks to the timeout 1 line without it it simply hangs and will terminate only by user interaction c

3141384
terminate	timeout
my question i think is how to make an expect script that spawn a background process terminate without a timeout

3141426
sentencecase	uppercase
i m looking for a function to convert a string of text that is in uppercase to sentencecase

3141442
terminate	timeout
can t terminate any way except timeout or eof

3141467
toupper	uppercase
i would start by first converting the entire string to lower case and then as a first approximation you could use regex to find all sequences like and use toupper to convert the captured group to uppercase

3141479
button	checkbox
when a user clicks a specific button i want a customized prompt box to appear containing several fields a textfield a password field and a checkbox field

3141481
dictionary	map
that still leaves the switch itself of course - and this can be replaced by a static map in a dictionary say from portfoliosheetmapping to a func taking a holding and returning the sort key

namedtuple	dictionary
on the other hand if soup.findall returns one of a certain set of data types dictionary or list of dictionary namedtuple or list of namedtuple then you ll actually be better off because you won t have to do any conversion in the first place

3141800
post	put
lastly i m not sure what s involved in this so i don t know what tags to put for this post

3141811
put	get
the reason i set the max buffer is if your producer is much faster than the consumer you may end up consuming a lot of memory as more and more objects get put in to the collection

the closest thing besides listview listadapter naturally that i can think of offhand is viewswitcher and viewswitcher.viewfactory but there s really nothing magical there it s an interface that you can call to get a view

children	parent
now if addto and removefrom is always properly used i can get a parent s children via parent.children

3141941
children	parent
then i have to use child.findallbyparent parent to get all children

3141941
children	parent
my question are there any important reasons why i should use hasmany if can query a parent s children in the second way as well

3141998
super	implements
while this is a pretty crude approach it is super easy to implements pretty fault tolerant and you can easily split the .queue files between a set of servers and have them work in parallel

dictionary	map
so i would like to map to game slot because in the dictionary it has value 0

3142013
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended

width	height
the tilecont div is repeated and tiled along the entire page and the table inside occupies the entire width and height of that div

3142065
vb6	vba
the vb6 and vba editing environment forces you to build class files and keep each class in a separate file which are distinct from modules

3142065
vb6	vba
the vb6 vba paradigm envisions classes as a way to encapsulate an object s functionality and properties

3142065
vb6	vba
in this sense vb6 vba s objects exist just like any other basic oop environment and their use and design should be encouraged where appropriate

3142065
vb6	vba
however the lack of several key oop features cause vb6 vba to fall short in being able to thoroughly implement a complete oop design pattern

3142080
sproutcore	qooxdoo
being a newbie i am intrigued by frameworks like qooxdoo and sproutcore but don t understand exactly how they work

3142096
equals	gethashcode
this would also make the implementation cleaner as actual comparision logic now stays in gethashcode and equals which you may have already overloaded

3142096
equals	gethashcode
don t forget to overload gethashcode and equals methods on your object

sqldmo	smo
here s a pure ado.net solution if you are having difficulty installing smo sqldmo on the target machine it s a pain in the behind best avoided if you can

3142365
free	malloc
this avoids the use of malloc and free issue

3142373
oncreate	recreate
then you use oncreate bundle to get everything out of that persisted bundle and recreate your state

3142382
screens	tablet
my development environment uses dual-17 monitors which are far bigger than the tablet screens size of 10.4 1024x768

3142424
getter	setter
some problems with your setter 1 don t call the getter self.currentevent when releasing the ivar 2 always retain the new obj before releasing the old obj in case it is the same obj ie

3142432
stdout	stderr
most o s use them for stdout stderr etc and while there are usual assignments eg stdout is usually 5 i think and stderr 6 these are not defined in the fortran standard and compiler-writers are free to use unit numbers as they see fit

3142438
screens	tablet
set one of your screens to the tablet resolution

3142439
rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	rtsp	rtcp
using wireshark to sniff the packets sent from one of the public cameras that s available to view with the free dropcam for iphone app at the app store i was able to confirm that the iphone was receiving h264 video via rtp rtsp rtcp and even rtmpt which looks like maybe some of the stream is tunneled

3142494
post	get
a post probably shouldn t return anything other than a possible redirect to a get that returns the resource just posted

3142494
post	put	post	get	put	get
post put delete are actions not queries you don t get data with them other than what they may include to point you at some new resource via response headers

3142607
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter s got a slew of modules but all i can find for kohana codeigniter s fork is

3142607
codeigniter	kohana
is the assumption that codeigniter modules work in kohana or at least can be massaged to without too much effort or is it just that kohana s got fewer modules

3142646
children	parent
by clearing floats i mean make a parent element enclose all floating children contained within

3142679
post	get
edit when i get around to finishing up code for this project i ll post the layout i ve done here for everyone s future reference

3142685
pull	push
1 pull from a after there are updates push it to b

3142685
pull	push
2 pull from a merge it with my local files then push it to b merging with the repo on b

3142699
children	parent
an alternative to adding a clearing tag is to set an overflow style on the parent element of the floats that will make it contin it s children

3142699
children	parent
you can for example use overflow hidden but without specifying a size that way the parent will be sized by it s children

3142703
hide	show
i only want to show the control groups for the modules that are actually connected and hide the rest

3142713
prepare	execute
unless db2 is some sort of weird alien sql database or if it s driver does some crazy things then the database server will never see your prepare statement until you actually execute it

3142726
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use the jquery hover function to hook up handlers for the mouseenter and mouseleave events of the images which jquery will happily simulate on browsers that don t support them

3142726
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
mouseenter and mouseleave ie innovations that still aren t supported natively by many browsers but which jquery provides if missing are a lot less difficult to work with for this sort of thing than mouseover and mouseout since mouseover and mouseout bubble

3142786
children	parent
in your second example the cascading is set to all on the children side and none on the parent side

3142786
children	parent
if you delete the parent all the children will automatically be deleted

3142786
children	parent
and when you save the parent all the children will be updated

3142786
children	parent
how are you most likely going to access the data if you expect to need to retrieve a set of children for a parent having a parent.getchildren method is pretty convenient

3142814
titlebar	window
i wanted to have a completely different style of window minimize the content area and showing only the titlebar no system buttons etc so i created a wpf application for this

3142867
integer	unsigned
i have a unsigned 32-bit integer lets use the value 28

3142874
getter	setter
even more oop-like with setter getter

3142885
persistent	transient
this way the session thinks that the skill contained in p.skills is persistent and not transient

3142909
button	checkbox
useful in radio button and checkbox especially

3142946
base-class	subclassing
if given the possible problems you still want to take this route then making the lockable object protected rather than private will allow you to include subclassing operations inside the same base-class lock

3142962
hide	show
now i can easily set a generic ajax indicator to show and hide when the jquery is making an async call using

3142962
hide	show
and i can set some functions to show and hide the same indicator by passing values into the constructor of the ajax.actionlink constructor and setting onbegin and oncomplete but this means that i have to do this everytime i add a new ajax.actionlink to the site

3143041
grizzly	netty
grizzly and netty

3143178
pecl	pear
the call replaces the previous path with whatever you re passing as an argument so if any of your code loads other libraries ie pear pecl modules they ll no longer be accessible as you ve trashed the include path

3143194
openfire	ejabberd
you can use smack to connect to the server of your choice that supports pubsub openfire ejabberd ... so your application that creates the events is the publisher and the clients are all subscribers

3143236
bash	zsh
here s an example of process substitution which will work in zsh and bash

3143241
hide	show
so i would just use the standard jsf way to hide show components

3143268
hide	show
i would like to show hide a set of columns o a button click

3143268
hide	show
iterate through table s thead th and change class to show hide the th and td

3143268
hide	show
show hide say 20 columns takes about 5 10 seconds on maybe 80 120 rows of data

3143313
hide	show
to implement i would add logic into your global ajax options to show hide the dialog as needed

3143361
sproutcore	qooxdoo
frameworks like qooxdoo and sproutcore are designed to facilitate the creation of rias

3143368
accessor	properties
edit a slight mis-understanding of the question...i took properties to mean normal accessor functions

3143375
getter	setter
unless you add reflection to the mix being able to identify at runtime what properties exist on an object properties are nothing more than syntactic sugar for getter and setter

3143375
getter	setter
might as well just use getter and setter in that case

3143378
hide	show
very similar to yours except i used jquery toggle show hide

3143378
hide	show
it seems to show hide column of 400 rows under 1second.

3143390
pop-up	dialog
also if your pop-up is extremely complex you could also create a whole new activity but give it the themedialog theme - that way it will still look like a dialog on top of your previous activity and you can give it an additional style to dim or blur the background

3143410
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that the report is compressed to about 100px by 100px in firefox and probably other browsers such as safari and google-chrome

3143424
post	get
usually when i get post data it s send from a html form and the parameters has names from then i can receive and print this data with php

3143440
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
png bmp gif jpeg all give me the same result

3143485
squash	merge
it ll do fine squash but then when it tries to recreate the merge the conflicts will happen again

3143490
hide	show
consider removing the table from dom tree via .remove do the bulk show hide operation and insert it back in

3143527
post	get
when i post it to production the redirect doesn t happen and i get the iis 404 error

3143537

ubuntu	linux
i have a request to install a linux server preferably ubuntu 64bit server

3143581
post	get
you get that exception since your local post office is trying to find the queue nsqueue and it obviously doesn t know about that

3143613
int	chars	int	double
all cpu expect that the built in data types like int float chars double are stored in the memory at their natural boundary at address of their length.so structure padding is done to faster access of data from memory

3143641
integer	unsigned
i have jquery.ajax creating a request to a url cms2 docman dir id id is a numeric unsigned integer

3143646
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all is ok in firefox opera safari google-chrome and ie8 but in ie7 when i m over the div ul don t display

3143659
prepare	bindparam	prepare	bindvalue	bindparam	bindvalue
if you prepare a statement and use bindparam or bindvalue to supply variables you do not need to escape the variables

3143661
put	get
if i put an element just to test i get the yellow border between the purple blocks not around them

3143662
post	get
not entirely - you ll have problems using the back button on pages that are submitted using post but not get

3143698
google-chrome	firefox
i am running an ajax call in my mootools script this works fine in firefox but in google-chrome i am getting a uncaught syntaxerror unexpected token error i cannot determine why

3143715
post	get
if i understand correctly you are trying to do an http post or get to www.hello2.com logout.jsp while processing http request to your web application s logout.jsp

3143720
google-chrome	firefox
the majority of the time is spent re-rendering and time spent within the javascript function gives me on average 200-300 ms on google-chrome and 0 ms on firefox

3143747
move	drag
i initiate the startdrag event but here it will not drag the entire move clip for some reason it only drag the different pieces inside the clip

3143748
getter	setter
i agree with others - just use getter and setter

3143786
min	max
if you don t care at all about which record you get back from table 2 when a matching sub doesn t exist you could combine two different queries one that matches the sub and one that just takes the min or max division with a union

3143836
cat	tee
the problem here is that tee will get stuck trying to write things to cat which wants to finish with wcout first

3143836
cat	tee
there s simply too much data for the pipe from tee to cat

3143882
bazaar	git
if you want the history to be shared between git and bazaar consider using a third-party bi-directional bridge between git and bazaar

if you change min to max top will be insted of bottom on the second row

3143978
google-chrome	firefox
i know ie has some very strange bugs depending on the version - ie rotated images display good in firefox and google-chrome but unrotated in ie gave up on it

3143978
fadein	hide	hide	show
besides that you could try to use show slow and hide slow without the fadein and -out

division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
that last equation can be computed relatively quickly although the second part of it is a bit tricky to get right because division doesn t distribute over mod the same way addition and multiplication do

3144051
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
if you would use mouseenter mouseleave instead of mouseover mouseout

sorting	filtering
read the section from the swing tutorial on how to use tables in particular the part on sorting and filtering for an example

3144107
sys.path	distribute
remember that when you distribute your project to other users they typically install it in such a manner that the python code files will be automatically detected by python s importer packages are usually installed in the site-packages directory so if you mess with sys.path in your code that may be unnecessary and might even have adverse effects when that code runs on another computer

3144123
folder	directory
if the user selects a directory it scans the whole folder for mp3 files and returns them

3144152

jax-ws	jax-rs
for client to server communications you could use a jax-ws soap web services or jax-rs restful services implementation

3144246
jax-ws	jax-rs
all of these are based on various standards that make up javaee servlet 2.5 jax-ws 2.0 jax-rs 1.1 and jpa 2.0

i try to create bigger table and put the three drop down lists in one column and put in another column to get the side by side layout but it does not work

3144260
screens	tablet
then set your form to maximize itself on the tablet pc or if screens size is 1280x1024 - the anchor property has its limitations as to what size increase looks reasonable

portrait	landscape
i have been searching for over a few hours now to find out how to implement the rotation from portrait to landscape for my uitableview inside my uiviewcontroller

3144318
hash	md5
md5 and the sha family are hash functions which are the more appropriate ones to use

3144318
hash	salt
for best results the standard is to salt and hash a password to store it - google these terms in tandem and you ll find numerous references

3144320
post	get
i wan t to write a script to get the source of a website which requires a post login

3144327
hash	md5
md5 message-digest algorithm 5 is a cryptographic hash function while advanced encryption standard aes is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm so they are used for different purposes

3144327
hash	md5
a hash like md5 or sha is used to verify passwords because it s hard to invert that is to obtain the password from the hash-string

3144342

starting with shell programming curl can do a post to get you the source of a web page

3144382
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
compare the very active django tag on stack overflow with that of pylons or turbogears though and i d argue getting started is simply easier with django irrespective of anything to do with code

3144382
rvm	bundler
think about using ruby without gem bundler or rvm and you ll be in the right direction

3144394
google-chrome	firefox
while in the deployed iis google-chrome and firefox work just fine

3144402
instances	transient
i do not want to save the transient instances

3144408
ironruby	ironpython
while this could end up being more trouble than it is worth it is probably possible to leverage the java or .net platform and still run your django application in jython or ironpython with some minor adjustments i m sure and also be able to leverage ruby s haml gem via jruby or ironruby

3144417
pthreads	fork
mingw programs are therefore real windows programs with no concept of unix-style paths or pthreads niceties such as a fork call

3144427
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv .

3144442
width	height
you can also check for the boundary rectangle size since youtube plays at certain height x width windows

3144476
ssl	https
i would like to make some selected pages as ssl https

3144503
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
if you edit files manually with vim emacs or gedit instead edit the files with perl sed and awk or just crush the files by curl ing the modified version from a local webserver or copied from scp

3144564
put	get
the closest way i can think of to fake it would be to put the terminal in silent mode so that input characters are not echoed and unbuffered mode so that you get each character typed as it s typed without waiting for the end of the line then read each input character one by one

3144580
hide	show
depending on how different your layouts are you might be able to come up with a single layout and then show or hide elements of it in getview depending on the row

3144598
ubuntu	linux
os linux ubuntu 10.04 64bit server edition

3144617
int	double
int to double is a widening conversion

3144619
prepare	execute
on other platforms argv is prepare by execute before your program is even loaded

3144650
put	get
put this in a script tag after your markup is loaded right before the close of the body tag and you ll get a similar effect to the jquery example

3144669
width	height
for example if the operation is to perform some validation you may have a nullvalidationstrategy which does nothing and a paranoidvalidationstrategy which makes sure every mcguffin is the correct height width and specific shade of blue

3144679

no but you can have your own settimeout setinterval for animation in your function

3144809
google-chrome	firefox
update for some reason that belongs to another tag changing the javascript method encodeuricomponent to encodeuri makes everything work as intended at least in firefox and google-chrome

3144821
google-chrome	firefox
again i get back an object from the server fine but it either prompts me to download firefox or simply shows the object in a new tab in the browser google-chrome

3144852
post	get
i have been reading this post to help me get going on my caching and am running into a problem

3144861
actionscript	mxml
another way around this is to extend textinput using actionscript rather than mxml

3144877
salt	md5
hashing with sha md5 or any other algorithm solves the problem of key protection because you don t need to keep any secret value other than salt but salt is significantly less sensitive than encryption key

3144899
post	get
for some reason whenever i do an async request using yui and specify it to be a get or post and the request is https the actual request comes through with the options request method

3144906
profiling	benchmarking
the best way would be to run some benchmarking tests to test individual functions or profiling to test an entire application program

3144918
equals	compareto
it s not clear to me what you want but i ll mention that the date class also has a compareto method which can be used to determine with one call if two date objects are equals or if they aren t equals which occurs sooner

3144940
width	height
how can i set an imageview s width and height programmatically

3145008
addition	multiplication
the c++ version already has a lot of optimizations like pre-caching and pre-calculating the values of each color and storing the pre-calculated values in trees reducing distances between data in memory doing operations with bit operators rather than addition and multiplication when applicable but still the performance was not satisfying

3145030
int	chars
i want to convert an int into its chars equivalent based on the alphabet

3145082
mouse	keyboard
there are cases when one needs to start a process based on some events not involving activity of the mouse of keyboard from hardware or time-based

when do you use post and when do you use get

3145244
perl	tcl
of course they kind of suck at that compared to bash or perl python tcl

3145253

you could easily spend hours doing the above task if you had a deep root directory that is one containing thousands of folder

3145296
put	get
here s a sample script i put together that should get you what you want

3145302
int	double
my problem now arises because i am no longer limited to just double anything coming out of the sql database is fair game int varchar etc... and that i am no longer calling just 2 columns of data it can be however many the user specifies

3145330
google-chrome	firefox
the way google-chrome and firefox display textareas is a fair bit different

3145363
typeerror	attributeerror
then doing pretty much anything will cause attributeerror or typeerror

explode	implode
simplest way is to explode split the string shift the top and pop the last then implode what s left with you re separator and concatenate the three

3145378
objectdatasource	formview
working with .net 2.0 i have a formview with fields bound to an objectdatasource ods

3145387
getter	setter
if your getter is performing any logic so that it is returning something other than what hibernate sent to the setter then it will be marked dirty

3145427
codeigniter	yii
it s kind of like the codeigniter gets out of your way when it needs to and yii gets in your way and if you don t do it its way it breaks

3145427
codeigniter	yii
codeigniter gets out of your way but does it too much yii helps a lot but is butting in too much at times and it forces you to sift through its documentation so that you discover these functions without which you are not able to accomplish a task that would take four time less in codeigniter or in a non framework app

3145446
codeigniter	kohana
you could try kohana especially coming from codeigniter

3145449
public	protected
field must be declarated as public protected in the parent class or declarated in the descedent class and in yours dostuff method you must write not the

3145452
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i assume that has something to do with the way wsdl.exe and svcutil.exe work behind the scenes but regardless i m stuck on trying to figure out how to correctly get visual studio to recognize that this property should be a datetime

3145559
int	boolean
so for a large sparse list i d use a sorted int array instead of a lightly populated boolean array

3145575
getter	setter
i overheard two of my colleagues arguing about whether or not to create a new data model class which only contains one string field and a setter and a getter for it

3145582
inherited	properties
create inherited attached properties for ismouseleftbuttondown and for the other buttons too

3145582
inherited	properties
from there these properties are inherited down through the logical and visual tree

3145594
getter	setter
even if the getter and setter are trivial now a type makes sense if there is a real chance they could do something later

3145630
int	chars
that s why you re getting the warning you re trying to use a chars int as a pointer

3145639
button	checkbox
any change made to a model object except a data refresh from the database is considered editing whether it be done with a button checkbox etc

3145639
inherited	properties
whenever this properties changed if it is non-null and not the current view model set an inherited locked properties causing the view to lock

3145640
int	chars
and int has 4 or 8 bytes depending on the platform and each chars in a string is one byte or more depending on encoding

3145708
client-side	server-side
i have client-side and server-side validation so i want the same error message shown by both

3145717
getter	setter
add a class declaration a getter a setter now call those from everywhere that touches it and you ve added size to your code without an actual non-hypothetical purpose

3145763
versioning	upgrade
the code is currently written in asp.net 1.1 style no master pages but i can upgrade to any versioning of .net

3145768
outputstream	inputstream
when i use binary transfer mode which is not supposed to do anything but shuffle bytes from an inputstream into an outputstream the result is that the newlines 0x0a are converted to carriage return + newline pairs 0x0d0a

3145768
hex	binary
here s the hex after binary transfer

3145772
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
assuming your window subclassing don t override defaultstylekey you can simply add it to your window style since textelement.fontfamilyproperty is an inherited properties

3145818
post	put
note that the request s inputstream property does contain the expected data and obviously i can build my own key value collection using that however i would have expected put to work the same way as a post

3145824
filtering	grouping
furthermore you can filtering the buffer list by many criteria again use c-h m to see its help page and then generate a grouping definition from the current filtering and save your custom filtering and grouping for future usage

3145824
filtering	grouping
g web development ret create a named grouping from the active filtering

3145824
filtering	grouping
this way you can have a single emacs instance running and create filtering and grouping for different types of task and easily switch between them

3145831
postgresql	mysql
this would be everything from plain text files on the local filesystem to embedded systems like sqlite any standard sql server mysql postgresql oracle sql server whatever to various nosql databases mongo couch redis whatever

3145835
submit	submission
i just went to submit my first app involving iads and in the beginning of the app submission process there is a new button to enable iads

3145867
hash	salt
5 so obviously i can hash the passwords with a one way salt hash

3145867
hash	salt
substr hash sha256 salt

3145893
for-loop	loops
why doesn t python do what the code intuitively suggests and define each function by replacing i with its current value within the for-loop as loops is running

3145912
hash	salt
passwords with a one way salt hash

3145912
hash	salt
passwords must always use a salt hash and sha-256 is a great algorithm

3145912
hash	salt
the salt should be a cryptographic nonce as in a very random value that is only used 1 per hash

3145978
min	max
i ve tried using getsize and then setting the min and max height of the window using setsizehints but for some reason it always allows the window to be resized just a little and it looks rather tacky

3145978
min	max
the only other alternative i have come up with is to hard-code the min and max height but i don t think that would be such a good idea.

3145983
getter	setter
a new data model class which only contains one string field and a setter and a getter for it

3146014
min	max
if you don t want the height to change why would it be a bad idea to set min and max height to the same value the one you want to force

3146018
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
this was done so that as the data was selected and moved about the application ui updates would be refreshed using inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged

3146022
screens	tablet
c as for screens size i m doing this with android tablet in mind

3146089
hide	show
i plan on making it hide and show with jquery so it really shouldn t break the flow of any text inside i just want it to appear on top of everything else

3146101
width	height
do your big box have a fixed height width or not

3146110
arp	tcp
one-shot uploads would be too skewed by arp dns lookups socket buffering tcp slow start etc

3146124
width	height
its default is manual but if you set it to one of the other values width height or widthandheight you may see a better presentation

3146139
mouseleave	mouseenter
edit as noted by nick craver .hover is a convenient alternative to mouseenter and mouseleave since it accepts two functions representing both events

3146146
profiling	debugging
the biggest problem that i m having is that in the targets properties i go to build select debugging or distribution and when i want to select the profiling for code signing for the target xcode doesn t show me anything

3146146
profiling	debugging
just shows me my iphone developer name for debugging and distribution but it doesn t show me the installed profiling

3146164
pop-up	dialog
note the third example which positions the pop-up dialog to be aligned with an element on the page

3146180
children	parent
with parent and children i guess you mean server and clients

3146195
put	get
once i get the array i create a new array with capacity n+1 and copy all the elements to the new array and put the new element as the last element of the array

3146197
children	parent
you could obtain a similar effect in 2.6 and later with a class decorator but then all classes needing the functionality both parent and children ones would have to be explicitly decorated -- here they just need to have the same metaclass which may be less intrusive thanks to the module-global __metaclass__ setting idiom and the fact that metaclasses differently from class-decorations also get inherited

3146235
width	height
the circle might require width and height to match that s an invariant the class wants to maintain yet anyone can simply get a base pointer ellipse pointing to a circle object and violate that rule

3146262
hide	show
what s the right way to hide the div in the jsp code such that the jquery hide show methods will work correctly with it later on

3146268
mp3	flac
edit one of the reasons that i started with ffmpeg is that it can handle many file types notably mp3 aac flac

3146281
hide	show
simply use to hide them when rendering and jquery show hide will work with your server-side generated hidden elements

3146283
hide	show
the show and hide methods operate on the css display property

3146285
folder	directory
the tool takes a file path finds the revision of parent url a few levels up then exports a bunch of files and folder at that revision into a new directory

3146329
post	get
not sure how to get the post request to work

3146335
getter	setter
there s no other way to do it besides this for automatic properties since the fields for the automatic props are declared at compile time and replaced within getter setter

3146347
maven	pom.xml
so every time i add a dependency to a library using maven in my pom.xml it doesn t get deployed until i go to module settings and then click on fix

3146355
hash	salt
if each client has a key like a simple password that the server knows the key can be used as salt with a hash function to sign requests responses

3146358
children	parent
you could then have helper methods on the parent to query for children through the parentalrelationship object

3146383
hide	show
it helps organize things better than using one view with a whole bunch of subviews that you hide show and will also improve loading times and general performance

3146383
getter	setter
make sure you synthesize whichever objects you create in the app delegate s .h file in the app delegate s .m file so the getter and setter are created so you can access them

3146390
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie8 the numbers show up in the middle of my rows right next to the last div tag that doesn t have a float left

3146396
post	get
i currently check every get and post variable with isset and throw exceptions when isset returns false

3146407
width	height
the child div was then set to some arbitrary width and a height equal to the height in px of the scrollpane s content

3146494
width	font-size
the last step is to use a piece of javascript to detect the width of the viewport and set the font-size of the body accordingly

3146557
put	get
so new users won t get the .mypackagerc files unless you put it in etc skel also which is overdoing it in my opinion

3146610
nsxmlparser	nsurl
and according to nsxmlparser documentation initwithcontentsofurl accepts any fully qualified url with scheme supported by nsurl and file is supported scheme

3146618
google-chrome	firefox
when the above code is viewed by a browser the user was prompted to download a json file the javascript was not executed on modern versions of google-chrome firefox and internet explorer

3146628
int	chars
now as you see i just wanted to display the int value like an ascii chars such as int a but something like will be displayed as

3146628
int	chars
is it not possible to find the int value of a wide chars like that

3146629
bmp	png	bmp	tga	png	tga
to that end it is good if you still have all your asset s source hopefully still having your max or maya model files and tga bmp png texture source files

3146677
width	height
since grid is a dynamic layout it will be stretch to the window s width height

3146677
width	height
to restrict you window size you need to mention height width properties to the window

3146695
postgresql	mysql
in both mysql and postgresql you can write

3146703
calloc	malloc
casting the results of malloc calloc etc

3146740
versioning	upgrade
i believe this is the only solution if your o s such as redhat 5.8 upgrade you to a firefox versioning that uses xulrunner-2 but does not provide webkitgtk

3146756
ssl	https
ssl https

3146777
google-chrome	firefox
to test that you re doing it correctly i d probably use firebug on firefox or dev tools on google-chrome

3146804
post	put
i want to put facebook twitter flickr into my iphone app so that users can easily login in and post message from my app easily

3146804
put	get
put the question here is to get some clues or existing works for this purpose

3146805
client-side	server-side
i can t call the actual service implementation since the client-side code can t reference the server-side code right

3146824
post	get
also try setting the post type to get

3146837
queue	fifo
if so then a simple fifo queue for each servive will surely do the job

3146858
curb	libcurl
i am trying to install the curb gem which is libcurl bindings for ruby and of course i need to have a working lib libcurl installation with development stuff installed on my computer

3146868

3146881
width	height
here s a snip that successfully reads off to eclipse logcat the height and width of the .png on the sd card

3146888
width	height
if you were trying to log it at the same place as the height and width which pixel s value were you expecting to log

3146900
ccscene	cclayer
i ve made 2 empty ccscene 1 2 and added cclayer 1 2 onto their respective scene

3146900
retaincount	dealloc
can anyone probably tell me what i ve done wrong or is it just my misunderstanding that retaincount needs to be 0 before dealloc is called

3146914
width	height
for different results specify a sizetocontent parameter on the window as paxdiablo pointed out or explicitly set the size of your window with the minheight maxheight height minwidth maxwidth and or width properties

friends who ve used it on various linux builds admittedly mostly ubuntu also seems to have the same gui as i do - at least from what i can discern from looking over their shoulders p

3147034
spannable	charsequence
it s important to know the difference between a string and a charsequence and spannable - strings do not have html support and if you grab a string from the resources through context.getstring it will automatically strip out all html code

3147035
folder	directory
select installation folder directory

3147060
width	height
make the tag display block and give it a width and height so that the button fully consists of the element

this sets the maximum time in seconds a script is allowed to parse input data like post get and file uploads

3147067
.htaccess	httpd.conf
php_ini_all the following settings can be set in php.ini .htaccess httpd.conf or with ini_set

3147075
folder	directory
an alternative that is probably more applicable if you ve got multiple settings as you have suggested create a file in the after ftplugin directory of your vim configuration folder see below called txt.vim and it will be sourced whenever you open a .txt file

3147079
pull	push
however that approach is a pull from sql not a push from excel if you want to do that you d have to code some vba to do it for you

3147081
int	double
nothing bad will happen when you cast an int to a double

3147081
int	double
casting an int to double is a widening primitive conversion

3147113
width	height
assuming you have no css rules attached to a.link that would impart width height in the absence of content simply setting display none

3147162
maven	pom.xml
hi actually i am trying to create maven project in netbeans but when i am going to build it fails and give message as error building pom.xml may not be this project s pom.xml so i need help on it..

3147220
qtcore	qtgui
i added library frameworks qtcore and qtgui to the c++ path and symbols tab on the preferences dialog but for some reason although it can find the class names it refuses to autocomplete the class methods and member attributes

3147225
downcasting	upcasting
static_cast is the rest of it - value conversions int - float etc upcasting of object pointers references and unchecked downcasting

3147241
amend	undo
it says you can amend the commit with git commit --amend but we actually want to do a reset to the commit before head and undo it entirely

3147278
post	get
my situation is that i d like a java servlet or a listener to run at regular intervals on an apache tomcat server to make http get post requests to the google chart api and store the resulting images in the file system or application database

3147314
nsscanner	nsstring
i ve looked through nsstring nsstream nsscanner nsfilemanager nshandle but still have no idea how to do it

3147375
getter	setter
in addition i would like to know what if my object has a lot getter setter setpath getsize ...

3147381
stateless	stateful
you also seem to be mixing principles of stateful and stateless functional design which is bound to get you into trouble

3147438
inline	inlining
as an aside check this out for what optimisations that gcc actually has including a great many containing the text inline or inlining

3147452
put	get
you may need to put a in the div to get around some browser bugs

3147479
loops	if-statement
the code is just a statement similar to a method call and thus occurs in the natural execution stream at the point you placed it be it inside a loops if-statement or similar

3147490
ati	nvidia
my understanding is that right now gl is not well-supported by all the main companies nvidia ati intel which is a big issue

3147512
maven	pom.xml
it does seem to make sense since the for the parent maven project is pom.xml

3147517
hide	show
i could show the properties div by binding an event with the abc div but i want to hide the properties div when the div abc loses its focus

3147519
try-catch	exception-handling
i d put some messageboxes or logging in your app or put in a try-catch around the start routine and have it show the exception-handling and prompt the user for input in order to continue

3147553
width	height
it still interacts with it width height js but as for rendering .

3147569
width	height
fillrectangle brush 0 0 1 1 draws a single dot at 0 0 which is somehow understandable it s a rectangle with width and height one after all

3147569
width	height
the same behaviour is shown for other width height combinations drawrectangle always extends one pixel more to the left and the bottom which is a little annoying when using the clientrectangle property to draw a frame around a control

3147581
nsmutablestring	nsstring
granted for an nsstring -copy is probably implemented as doing a retain and returning self but if you pass it an nsmutablestring a genuine copy will occur

3147588
post	get
i am wondering if it is possible to somehow get the value of a div and attach it to the form post on submit

3147611
post	get
if you intercept the submit event of your form maybe by intercepting the click event on the formâ s submit button then you certainly can get or post with anything including content of an element

3147648
inherited	properties
i think the copy method should be inherited by derived classes d1 d2 and their responsibility to copy their own properties to from other types

3147661
min	max
some of these textboxes need to have their min max properties set dynamically when the values of other fields are changed

3147661
min	max
how can i change the max and min properties without this happening

3147702
sqldatasource	linqdatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource	linqdatasource	objectdatasource
are those custom objects coming from objectdatasource or you re using sqldatasource or linqdatasource

3147745
public	protected
there ll be no functional difference between the constructor being public or being protected but making it protected gives a clearer indication of the intended use

3147804
google-chrome	safari
however at the time of writing safari 4 and google-chrome 5 are still vulnerable to this

3147820
switching	screens
in particular this means that when a full screens app is up and running it is covering the dwm composed image and the user needs to switching to a dwm-managed window for the dwm to start drawing on top of the full-screen app

3147842
hide	show
i m using the focusin focusout events to either show or hide the text

3147842
hide	show
but if one clicks in an area of the input box where there is no text it does show hide correctly

3147859
ati	nvidia
ati and nvidia do provide very good implementations so it s not that much of a problem

3147877
width	text-align
you can use text-align right instead of float right with your current widths inner div with more than the outer div width

3147883
onclick	onsubmit
regardless you can save yourself the trouble altogether by simply adopting a stronger strategy implement the validation as an onsubmit action on the form rather than an onclick action for the button

3147939
portrait	landscape
i have a case where a portrait only mode view needs to be pushed into a navigation controller which has a landscape mode view as its current view

3147951
public	protected
in an abstract class there s no difference between a public or protected constructor

3147970
getter	setter
as for the backing bean the paginatedjoblist is just a list of jobs onjobselectionchange changes job the backing bean thinks is selected so that the detail div s contain the correct data when rerendered and joblistselection is just a getter setter for a simpleselection

3147986
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you need to show the uiviewcontroller or uinavigationcontroller code both the .h and .m where you are setting up the uisearchdisplaycontroller

3147997
put	get
i need such type of function where i just put method name i get the complete information of that function

3148035
width	height
if the line images are really easy to detect say you can find the line from ten yards away just scale the image from width height to 1 height and find the y-coordinate of the darkest pixel

3148080
inherited	properties
you could make your models all inherited a new model that has a properties function defined to get set the right variable

3148168
memcached	apc
for some benchmarks see cache performance comparison file memcached query cache apc

3148192
super	abstract
of course i could provide sum a a in class be and check if b is an instanceof b before calling either sum b or super but i thought that instanceof was to be avoided for efficiency reasons if it is inefficient it may be even less efficient as my abstract implementation

3148197
google-chrome	safari
if you are using keypress then that simply won t get called for the tab key in ie safari or google-chrome

3148235
restrict	shared
if you are on a shared host they can restrict you not to reach other than your content so absolute paths can cause troubles

3148270
centos	linux
we are running an asp.net web site v3.5 of the framework on 2 windows 2008 web servers and use forms authentication.they are load balanced using a separate server running apache 2.2 on linux centos 5

it is very likely that they use either a a-star or dijkstra s algorithm

3148331
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
clearly the legacy keyboard and mouse and now usb hid drivers many of which are usermode i think

3148331
mouse	keyboard
synergy+ for example can generate fake keyboard and mouse events on connected pcs and the consequence of the faked input is windows switching activation normally

3148386

can i get the position and size of another app acrobat reader to put mine on top of it scaled properly

3148512
datamapper	activerecord
maybe i should use a datamapper pattern to further separate responsibilities but in this still quite simple scenario i thought i d get away with activerecord

3148546
google-chrome	firefox
this is running well in firefox but problem happeninig with ie and google-chrome

3148562
inherited	properties
the only possibilty is to inherited arrayobject in your own class to get this done but i think you want to set different properties at runntime.

3148602
int	chars
# now you are using a chars for numeric options which you could have avoided by defining your choice variable as int

3148653
jdom	dom4j
google is your friend fire it up to learn about dom4j and jdom

3148674
inherited	properties
i know i could just do multiple inherited for vehicles and buildings or a simply use an instance thereof as a properties of foo bar but i wonder if there s a correct way to do it this way

3148696
getter	setter
it s kinda annoying that the premier ide for zend framework generates getter and setter that are not in compliance with the zf code convention

3148696
getter	setter
when you generate getter setter they will not include the the leading underscore indicating private or protected visibility

3148700
width	height
the css width and height then incorrectly covers the padding and border

3148735
stdout	stderr
is it possible in linux to somehow read the output from stdout and stderr of another process without it knowing about it

3148745
getter	setter
a simple workaround name your var labelname then generate getter and setter and finally refactor rename the var so it becomes _labelname

3148781
hide	show
with jquery i hide the second select then when the first select changes jquery looks at the selection and show the second select with only the relevant items in it

google-chrome	firefox
update i have used a slightly modified version of paolo bergantino s solution that works for sure on google-chrome and firefox yet to finish testing all browsers

3148803
post	get
for the get post to be successful the origin and the target fully qualified domain names must be exactly the same to comply with same origin security policies

3148803
firefox	safari
modern web browsers such as safari and firefox have implementations of the w3c cross origin resource sharing draft policy so you will see the options preflight communication when it fails - probably with some sort of security or network related javascript error

3148803
post	get
if the options preflight is successful the original get post can occur

3148838
rel	alt
i would feed the name and desc into the anchor as part of the anchor or it s child image perhaps using the alt tag for the name and rel tag for the description

3148928
google-chrome	firefox
this question seems to provide a solution dynamically change embedded video src in ie google-chrome works in firefox

nhibernate	llblgenpro
even the linq implementations between linq to sql and entity framework v4 vary greatly if you then look at nhibernate s or llblgenpro s implementations you will find there are queries that are possible in sql that each doesn t support in the same way if at all or that the support with different levels of efficiency

if you are doing only cpu intensive tasks no io n+1 threads where n is the number of cores will give you the optimum processors utilization

3149366
margin	height
i understand that the height of a box in css is the height of the contents excluding the margin and padding but why with this sample if you uncomment the border line in the containing div does the background color of the div extend above the first paragraph while if you have no border it doesn t

3149371
switching	screens

punctuation	words
when the punctuation sign follow right after a words then this words is not indexed properly

3149879
min	max
you don t even have to group by price if you use an aggregate do display it min or max for example

3149890
min	max
you simply can t assure that kvo sets the properties in the proper order that being first setting the min and max limits and then the other values

3149890
min	max
if i now create such a model with the values min 0.00 max 42.00 left 14.00 right 28.00 i end up with the following setup in the custom control min 0.00 max 42.00 left 1.00 right 1.00

3149921
portrait	landscape
- a landscape view controller that is used when the first itel of the tabbar is switch from portrait to landscape

3149921
portrait	landscape
a part of this works fine i mean the switch from portrait to landscape is ok when i am in the first tab the tabbarcontroller is remove from the superview and the landscape view is added as a subview instead

3149948
mouseup	mousedown
if you create events for mousedown and mouseup you should have the two corner points you need for a rectangle

3149980
min	max
you could do max min or average i guess

3149980
min	max
i don t recommend aggregating price though especially max and min since it will likely lead to confusion down the line when people try to use the value

3150041
interpreted-language	compiled-language
for example sometimes people talk about interpreted-language or compiled-language

gridview	sqldatasource
they ve simplified it to the point where you can drag and drop the necessary controls gridview and a sqldatasource for instance and define your datasource in a wizard for most simple table crud functionality

3150062
put	get
it s possible that the isdone flag read in the while test has been optimised out the compiler knows that it isn t going to change so it doesn t put in any code to get it from memory again - it just tests the same cpu register. you can overcome this by using the volatile modifier to tell the compiler it must re-get the value from memory

3150080
super	abstract
note also that i declared super as abstract - this is almost always good practice to follow with base classes

3150100

3150298
min	max
also for the code you re writing the min and max preprocessor macros will save you a lot of effort

inherited	subclassing
we prefer composition over inherited because when we add particularly or change functionality by subclassing we couple that new functionality to the class - so anywhere we need the new functionality we need that class

ocamllex	ocamlyacc
maybe i m just failing in a really simple thing but i m developing an intepreter written in ocaml with standard tools as ocamllex and ocamlyacc and i have this situation

post	get
update so let s say this is not being entered in the browser but being generated programmatically and being requested with a post request not a get request

3150672
submit	submission
however it is secure to submit as a post request to submission a form while passing the credentials as part of the post body since the post body is encrypted and sent after making a connection to the requested url

3150672
ssl	https
straightforward explanation of ssl and https

3150682
persistent	transient
hmm - if an attribute is marked as transient that means exactly that it s not mean to be considered part of the object s persistent state for serialization

3150683
getter	setter
the reasons i ve heard mainly crop up due to when you write your own setter getter

3150687
postgresql	mysql
you can get the sql for your specific database mysql postgresql etc. by compiling with your engine

3150689
nfa	dfa
the nfa is then transformed to a dfa to make state transitions deterministic

viewdidload	viewwillappear
in other words i set self.contentsizeforviewinpopover in - viewdidload and set popovercontroller.popovercontentsize in - viewwillappear

3150693

you could save them in the temp folder you can use path.gettemppath to get it or create a folder for them specifically outside of your web app virtual directory and save the files there

3150712
post	put
if it s at all possible use post over https on authentication and then set a authenticated cookie or use http digest authorization over https or even http basic auth over https - but whatever you do don t put secret sensitive data in the url

3150744
setinterval	settimeout
one way is to execute a setinterval right after you add the settimeout to the stack

3150772
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller

client-side	server-side
everything is being done client-side so the performance is purely down to javascript and jquery code and nothing to do with any server-side code such as asp.net mvc

3150882
button	checkbox
consider a simple .net form with a couple of radio button and a checkbox

3150882
button	checkbox
each of the radio button has a checkedchanged handler setup that performs some action based on the state of the checkbox

3150882
button	checkbox
my problem is when i initialize on the default radiobutton to be checked from the designer properties window the checkedchanged event is fired for that radio button but the checkbox hasn t been initialized yet so i either get a null pointer exception or the wrong value is used in the handler

post	put
you can check out the full project well an older build which at time of writing has yet to see this new oo method put in the whole way through up at - just check out my latest post

3150906
subclass	accessor
the main reason why is because a subclass might override your accessor and do something different

3150906
subclass	accessor
the subclass s accessor might assume a fully initialised object that all the code in the subclass s init method has run

3150906
subclass	accessor
similarly the subclass s accessor may depend on the subclass s dealloc method not having run

3151366
serializable	deserialization
i tried to go with serializable deserialization route it worked to some degrees but the copy is not exactly the same as the original one

3151492
hide	show
note that there could be many tabs loading at the same time and not all loading tabs are visible a new tab can be background loaded without leaving the current tab so just having one shared div which i show hide on top of everything else doesn t work

verilog	vhdl
the verification guild forum deals with hardware design verification with verilog vhdl systemverilog

3152757
int	chars
why some methods that write bytes chars to streams takes int instead of byte chars

3152757
int	chars
because chars in java is just 2 bytes length which is ok with most chars symbols already in use but for certain chars symbols chines or whatever the chars is being represented in more than 2 bytes and hence we use int instead

3152785

3152806
webclient	webrequest
fortunately .net has the webrequest and webclient classes to help you

spaces linefeed one or more time case insensitive and captured

3152850

overrides equals and gethashcode etc.

3153183
openssl	libcrypto
openssl 1.0.0 actually builds two libraries libcrypto and libssl

3153197
int	chars
so if you send it a to an array of chars 8 bits or 1 byte each and an int is 32 bits 4 bytes long on your system then it will just take the first four chars of the chars array and convert the resulting 32 bit number into an int

3153241
udp	tcp
pps you could try using a udp socket instead of a tcp socket

3153257

don t blindly go and remap the contents of the various superglobals get post request cookies on the assumption that everything will be going into a db

3153316
post	get
sloppy use of get post etc because

3153349
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested on ie 5.5+ firefox 2+ google-chrome 4+ safari 4+ opera 9.6+

3153436
chaiscript	c++
chaiscript - trying at the moment in a little project interesting this one is made with c++ in mind and works by just including a header

3153436
chaiscript	c++
it s not a one include embed as chaiscript but it s because it s really flexible and totally thought to be used in c++ only c++ code in libs - i ve decided to stick with it for my biggest project that require a lot of scripting flexibility comparable to ruby python

3153488
keydown	keyup
then use keydown keyup instead of keypress i believe in glut its something like keyboardupfunc and keyboardfunc but cant remember now

3153488
keydown	keyup
on keydown set the appropriate variable to true on keyup set it to false

3153492
post	put
if you want to those fields to retain its values you will need to put them in hidden fields so then they are binded back during post like such

3153539
children	parent
now i need to return only first 5 parent comments and all of the children that belong to them

3153540
cpu	processors
some build processes take quite a while and the amount of time depends strongly on the speed of your cpu and how much processors time can be devoted to the build

3153549
jobs	cron
we have several different scripts written in php running on a set schedule cron that queries something we talk to local db s various different web services and application api s even scrub an email address and use that information to do things such as db updates and mail jobs

3153551
kerberos	ldap
specifically the secure sealing flags instruct the ldap provider to use only kerberos to securely negotiate auth

3153564
put	get
so if all you need is on the order of get from amqp queuea put to wmq queueb and transactionality is not important you should have a an easy time of it

3153597
pop-up	dialog
now create a ready event for jquery to initialize the pop-up modal dialog

3153597
pop-up	dialog
those should get you to the point where your detail page is showing up in a pop-up dialog window

3153597
pop-up	dialog
to pop-up the other form in additional to the detail dialog or to replace the detail dialog it should be pretty similar

3153603
jar	manifest.mf
you need to specify it in the class-path attribute of jar s manifest.mf file

3153627
youtube	vimeo
with videos you could keep track of maybe the top three or so uploading sources youtube vimeo metcafe... and their embed codes

3153627
gif	png
if it s a picture you can easily tell by looking at the file extension of the link jpg png gif etc.

3153668
put	get
i m not sure the best way to ask that but whenever i put something like ptable string i get an error

3153682
for-loop	loops
in javascript i can use a for-loop and eval to evaluate a string + i loops var and then simply call the new var.backgroundcolor somecolor

3153700
client-side	server-side
bottom line it s very likely that you need to optimize your solr instance both the client-side querying and the server-side index and performance settings

3153718
hash	md5
if the hash function is more complex and cryptographically strong md5 or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible

3153728
hash	md5
a hash like sha1 or md5 is going to be pretty strong and more or less computationally impossible to find collisions for within a reasonable time frame

3153764
multiplying	add
it can also work with non-integer weights although if you re using nextdouble from system.random you ll have to scale all of the weights to add up to 1 or multiplying the value from nextdouble with s to get it in the desired range

3153780
int	boolean
for instance the following initializes the boolean to false and the int to 0

3153780
typedef	struct
like others said you can omit the typedef in c++ and just declare the struct and you are still able to refer to the type by just saying foo

3153799
udp	tcp
the defaults it opened ugly as it is was all tcp and udp ports when operating under the private profile

3153809
int	chars
one more thing if x is say an int just writing it to a file doesn t end the file with a line end chars

3153816
serializable	deserialization
sometimes using the built-in xml serializable isn t the best choice and when objects get complex it can be better to perform the serializable and deserialization yourself

3153830
button	checkbox
when doing a bulk delete you ll have all the checkbox values submitted like normal and you ll know it s a bulk delete based on which button they pressed to submit the form

3153840
jar	war
all jsp files including jspf have to inside a war not a jar

3153855
printf	strlen
my guess is that printf is always called strlen on data and i usually get lucky in that even though data isn t null terminated there is a 0 before i hit the segment and then occasionally i get unlucky and it is

3153888
printf	strlen
there s no guarantee that printf won t call strlen even if it doesn t necessarily have to in a given context

3153929
switching	screens
when i comment out my intent everything works minus the passing of data switching of screens obviously but when i run my project as is it fc s.

3153971
vbscript	jscript
the project i m playing with now is desktop status display shows the time some tasks mounted disks etc and it s built on strawberry perl and plain win32 apis mainly the win32 gui and win32 api modules so the code is easy to port to or understand any dynamic language with similar win32 api bindings or access to windows scripting host eg activeperl python jscript vbscript

3153990
move	drag
the problem i m seeing is that when the user drag across the list the whole window move a bit exposing the desktop underneath then springs back into place once the user stops dragging

3154012
hfs+	ntfs
put your windows workspace on an ntfs volume and your mac workspace on an hfs+ volume

then when the old mode button is pressed show the old tab bar and hide the new one

3154138
addition	multiplication
in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition

3154170
int	chars
edit i need to be able to apply this to int arrays as well - not just chars arrays

3154174
int	chars
strpos returns either an int greater than or equal to zero or it returns false if the needle chars is not found in the string

3154178
profiling	instrumentation
otoh on modern video hardware a few layers of overdraw in a 2d scene is usually not that big of a deal so i m still interested to know exactly how you determined this and if there might be some sort of bias in your instrumentation and profiling which could be leading you astray

3154180
post	get
run this new query in a page template to get the first post from mycategory

3154186
google-chrome	firefox
if this for an in-house purpose that you would not need the general public to use you could create firefox or google-chrome addin to do this

3154191
folder	directory
for you pass in the folder you want to list the directory from

3154199
opera	firefox
now i try it on opera firefox and internet explorer

3154211
mouse	keyboard
but a view essentially has mouse and keyboard events as input and drawn pixels as output

3154221
getter	setter
will this actually work ok or should i change it to use synchronized getter or setter on the boolean var

3154232
put	get
the workaround we put in was that whenever we started the app we d have curl perform a get on the app to prime mongrel

3154265
inherited	properties
if the object inherited from a standard interface or shared interface in another assembly you can cast it to that and run methods on the interface - otherwise you ll have to use reflection to access methods and properties

3154268
uilabel	nsstring
how do i set a nsstring using a value from a uilabel

3154273
google-chrome	firefox
there is some straightforward ajax code that works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

3154276
boost	stl
however my main concern is why my boost iterator_facade is not behaving the same as what i d expect from iterators for stl containers of pointers

3154313
getter	setter
create a synchronized getter setter

3154314
int	chars
someone told me in case of int instead of chars because chars in java is just 2 bytes length which is ok with most chars symbols already in use but for certain chars symbols chinese or whatever the chars is being represented in more than 2 bytes and hence we use int instead

3154314
int	chars
the real reason that reader.read returns an int not a chars is to allow it to return -1 to signal that there are no more chars to be read

3154491
backgrounding	multitasking
i my testing when i exit by pressing the home button my app it still is running in the backgrounding thanks to the multitasking feature

3154497
put	get
this string should be able to go at the end of your url in a get request edit by this i mean you should be able to put it at the end of your address in a browser and still work

3154497
post	get
using a library takes a lot of the mystery out of building ajax applications early on but it won t help you if you re using the wrong method post instead of get and debugging can actually be more difficult because you need to dig through a lot of code to see where things are failing

3154601
equals	compareto
after doing a lot of looking around it seems like vb6 doesn t have any kind of built-in compareto or equals methods like java does

3154601
equals	compareto
bottom line if you want compareto or equals methods in your vb6 classes just put them in

3154620
width	height
how can i get the width and height of it

3154628
put	get
since i put this in all my child activities i no longer get the exception

3154669
put	get
put that together and we get

3154676
fgets	fread
fread fwrite fgets and friends are all buffered i o by default see setbuf which means that the library allocates a buffer which decreases the frequency with which read and write system calls need to be made

3154707
width	height
by width and height i m guessing you are referring to the bitmap painted

3154708

3154786

3154795
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
appcache is awesome and accepted as the standard but the big browsers are still undecided about the database implementation with opera safari and google-chrome opting for websql sqlite and mozilla and supposedly ie backing indexdb

3154825
postgresql	mysql
not entirely portable but if you know you re using mysql postgresql it should be fine

3154843

google-chrome s output when scrolling the first scroll bar is scroll_table_1 while firefox and ie is scroll_table_1 scroll_table_2 scroll_table_3 etc

3154847
getter	setter
i have some getter and setter to change the bar to my liking however here comes the issue

3154850
ant	maven
everything builds just fine in maven and ant but will only deploy when building with ant

3154850
ant	maven
then there is a difference somewhere between the ejb-jar built by ant and the one built by maven

3154865
width	height
now that example is using some pretty crude detection - if might be better to sniff the other attributes that iphone gives to the document to more accurately tell what display your page is showing on width height initial-scale user-scalable minimum-scale and maximum-scale

3154872
awt	swing
keep in mind that awt swing have a dedicated thread that does gui work â handling event handlers repainting the gui etc

3154888

spaces	delimiter
but i think the nicest aspect is how natural depending on how much spaces you want to devote to it you can make the grammar specification read an open paren a word a comma a word a comma an open paren a delimiter list of words two closed parentheses if you find the assignment to s above not so easy to read i guess it s my fault for not choosing longer identifiers

3155073
urllib	httplib
i m writing a dead link detector and wondering which lib i should use httplib and urllib so i tried both

3155089
urllib	httplib

width	height
the first child div is not absolutely positioned so as to lend its height and width to the parent

3155424
children	parent
the above structure is just an illustration of my dilemma in reality the parent div will have many children not all of them will be divs none of their dimensions will be known

3155509

3156180
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that firefox and google-chrome do not deal well with having tags added to them dynamically

3156191
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
my best advice on these issues is to run the fiddler tool and trace the traffic and you should see silverlight looking for a clientaccesspolicy.xml file and also the crossdomain.xml file which is a different format and that should make it easier to determine where silverlight is looking for the file

3156206

csv	tsv
i started this morning and with the help of the internet got as far as reading in and parsing the csv which is actually a tsv since they use tabs not commas but hey

3156313
submit	submission
similarly when the enter key is pressed while the user is editing a form the submit event is triggered on the form but then the form submission actually occurs after this

3156315
cvs	rcs
cvs is inherently file-based based on rcs so cross-file operations are not supported

3156834
google-chrome	firefox
when you run on google-chrome or firefox hover over the element the tooltip shows

3156837
google-chrome	firefox
now if you trying playing the game in both firefox and google-chrome you would clearly notice that it is significantly slower in firefox

3156837
google-chrome	firefox
so my question is - is this because of a slower javascript engine in firefox when compared to google-chrome s

3156866
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is slower than google-chrome in javascript

3156866
google-chrome	firefox
there is also a nes emulator out on the web somewhere using js and canvas and it runs in about 30fps on google-chrome if i remember about correctly but only about 10 in firefox

3156897
try-catch	exception-handling
would be nice if it doesn t involve writing that block within a try-catch block creating a new exception-handling type throwing it and then catching it

3156918
children	parent
what you re seeing is the effect of wpf s bubbling event model whereby events that happen in the children usually bubble up to the parent

3156920
folder	dir
have you given the dir folder read write access

3156942
public	protected
i wonder if the interview was trying to elicit your understanding of public protected and private access level modifiers in the java language

3156954
submit	submission
when the form is submitted the plugin captures the event creates a hidden iframe on the page clones the form fields from the submission form and submit that instead

3156999

what this does is on mouseenter it fades in on mouseleave it fades out via .animate ...but moving the mouse from one to the other will let the fade happen for 1 frame before putting a .stop to the fade-out and fade it back in

3157126
public	protected
i ve been studying visibility issue in php public private protected and wondered how is this sort of dom-building is implemented in php

3157145
google-chrome	firefox
so i thought that after the firefox starts i can load the page from ie or google-chrome

3157149
public	protected
only at run-time when you call a method on another class php checks whether that method is accessible public or in some cases protected

3157195
octree	quadtree

just one addition one subtraction and a negation

3157314
codeigniter	kohana

3157608
put	get
get the real sensible information put it in a separate server put as much security as possible around it and acces the data only when needed

3157616
hash	md5
if the user is not technical enough to figure out how to generate an md5 hash this should be enough

3157616
hash	salt
a slightly better solution would be concatenate another hard-coded secret salt in order to generate the hash but leave this salt out of the output

3157616
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
this means that even if the user is clever enough to generate his own md5 hash he can t fake the output without knowing the secret salt as well

3157638
postorder	inorder
if you really want to go above and beyond still for academic purposes you could implement tree iterators which do pre-order inorder and postorder traversal

3157638
postorder	inorder
you could also avoid using magic numbers 0 1 2 for pre-order inorder and postorder traversal and use named constants instead

3157641
qlistwidget	qpushbutton
use two qlistwidgets populate the left one using qlistwidget additem connect the clicked signal of your qpushbutton to a slot of your choosing which could look something like this

3157685
rss	feed
while building a small rss reader for myself i discovered that the ipad reader pulse or the google reader let you search rss feed simply by entering a keyword

3157712
post	get
just attach an onsubmit event listener to your form that always returns false to prevent actual sending of your form via the usual get or post request

3157712
post	get
but remember to always create a fallback option with the usual get or post request of the form to handle your form in case javascript is not available turned off blocked etc.

3157728
hide	show
use the following functions to show and hide the frame

3157751
rss	feed
i believe they have a cronjob running that is constantly caching rss feed so when you do a search it searches their database of cached feed articles

i am using qgraphicsscene qgraphicsview pair in my application

3157809
width	height
to get both height and width you can use nsstringfromcgsize

3157858
width	height
if those are not the ones you are looking for set the frame of the view to the center of the view with 0 width height and transform it to it s final size and position

3157892
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
case-sensitive comparison is from a naive point of view that ignores canonical equivalence trivial simply compare code points but case-insensitive comparison is not well defined and extremely complex in all cases and the rules are impossible to remember

3157894
qpainter	qwidget
take a look at for an instructive example where you can also find the following quote it is possible to re-implement its qglwidget paintevent and use qpainter to draw on the device just as you would with a qwidget

3157920
cassini	iis
what you re looking for is iis or cassini for the ipad which doesn t exist as far as i know

3157944
for-loop	loops
the jit can take care of doing the range checks only when needed and indeed for simple loops the typical for-loop this is handled pretty well

3158016
google-chrome	firefox
i verified this in google-chrome firefox and exploder 8

3158027
versioning	upgrade
so if you want to upgrade the lib to a newer versioning later you can do so as long as system can find the same filename the path can actually be different and the same symbol names

3158027
dlsym	dlopen
dlopen simply put opens a dynamic link library just like fopen might and returns you a handle which then you pass to dlsym with the name of the symbol you want which might be a function name for example

filesystems	btrfs
if you re looking to do this in a special-purpose environment where you can control the os etc you may be able to do it under linux with the btrfs filesystems

3158214
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs supports a new reflink operation which is essential a copy-on-write filesystems copy

3158222
width	height
if you have the item in a viewbox and set the height and width of the viewbox to auto is should resize with the window...i hope this helps a little

3158236
pop-up	dialog
then i get this in a pop-up dialog

3158236
pop-up	dialog
the title of the pop-up dialog is android launch

3158275
firefox	safari
i believe firefox s has to be done recursively down the tree of elements and safari just uses the outermost element. this should be possible without manually setting the height using javascript you just may have to conditionally code it to work with all the browsers you want to support

3158363
xslt	xquery
is it xpath or xquery or xslt or xsd even

3158370
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome do this the right way and lets the style tag take precedence over the injected link tag so the background stays red

3158395
post	get
i believe that oauth_auth_type_form in your constructor forces it to do a post and not a get

3158456

3158569
width	height
but instead of x and y w-x and h-y is used where w is the width and h the height of rectangle

3158569
width	height
if the width of rectangle is greater than or equal to the height then the bottom left field of the rectangle is the field with the lowest value in the rhomboid and can be calculated that sum from before for h-1

3158569
width	height
in the other case when the height is greater than the width then the field at and can be calculated using that arithmetic sum and the rhomboid can be imagined as a rectangle with x-value x and y-value y- w-x-1

3158601
put	get
when the class is put into a windows service i get the following error

mouseover	mouseout
also .hover takes two functions as arguments - one for mouseover and one for mouseout

3158873
xslt	xquery
how about saxon xslt xquery processor

3158936
width	height
this means that it should have minimum height since its width is fixed because the small rectangles have fixed abscissas

3158936
backtracking	greedy
i don t know if i should use backtracking or there is a faster way i can imagine that at 50 rectangles it would take some measurable time to compute the correct solution and a greedy algorithm doesn t sit well with me

3158968
for-loop	loops
here loops is just a normal for-loop

3158996
setinterval	settimeout
i d blame a large part of it on settimeout and setinterval having a 10ms minimum in browsers such as ie and firefox

3158996
google-chrome	firefox
apart from timer problems firefox is just generally slower in js execution for now at least and it feels as if skia google-chrome s graphics lib is just faster at rasterising too

3159011
memcached	apc
use apc or memcached

3159098
getter	setter
first is that you want to keep object variables private and use getter and setter to access them

3159098
getter	setter
although it is a public property in this case the use of getter and setter improve readability and help prevents unexpected behavior

3159098
getter	setter
finally if you are accessing the variables from within the object you don t need to use the getter or setter

3159098
getter	setter
note its generally considered good style to keep object variables private and use getter setter for all languages

3159098
getter	setter
you may also be interested in the question getter and setter for class in class c#

3159149
accessor	properties
now granted there s also this option implementing a properties with only a get accessor

google-chrome	firefox
my flex app seems to have different frame rates in google-chrome and firefox

3159209

3159375
google-chrome	safari
i couldn t find any specific information on frame rates for google-chrome or safari

3159385
getter	setter
i m sure there are a number of java classes that will do the job for you but you could also roll your own simply by creating an encapsulating class with either a public field or a setter getter

3159422
iprincipal	iidentity
if it is totally a windows environment yes using iprincipal and iidentity makes sense

3159422
iprincipal	iidentity	implements	extends
the how party is tricky - just look at msdn samples you can extends the iprincipal and iidentity to implements your own authn and authz in case of non-homogeneous non-windows network

3159424
filtering	grouping

serializable	deserialization
the serializable process workes fine but after deserialization the value for property isperiodic by default is true eventhough it was false for some cases

3159672
queue	fifo
the biggest disadvantage is that priority aging is harder to implement than a fifo queue and may not provide any response time improvement

and you might want to deal with stderr just like stdout

3160082
int	boolean
specifies boolean add e e e get int index etc

3160122
coalesce	isnull
typically you may want to wrap these at the database in a view or a computed column with isnull col or coalesce col or handle these after extraction from the database as the article discusses

i have an app that requires scrollbars to be enabled in one landscape orientation but not in portrait orientation

3160974
portrait	landscape
i would then define separate values of the attribute for landscape and portrait modes

3160981
multiplying	add
if you have something that generates random numbers in a range such as 0 1 it s easy to transform that to another range such as -120 120 you just have to multiplying by the size of the target range 240 in this case and add the start of the target range -120 in this case

3160986
ant	jdepend
is there anyway to run a package dependency analysis using jdepend ant contrib s verifydesign task or any other similar tool which uses blacklists instead of whitelists

3160995
super	implements
it s not super difficult to implements don t implements it recursively you will almost certainly run out of stack space and it will be able to look at complex situations like a u-shaped region that has a border between two points but are not actually different regions

3161016
firefox	safari
the code is fully functional when view from safari but the reload command does not appear to work when the same page is viewed in firefox

can i just put it on my phone and use it or do i have to go through the iphone store process to get it on my phone

3161094
hash	md5
in order to do this the user will need to via shell integration or manually process their own md5 hash and compare it to the hash provided by the uploader

3161094
hash	md5
an md5sum hash won t assure you that the uploader who provided the checksum didn t fiddle with the file to do that you should trust the source of the md5 checksum ie

3161153

ideally you could use serializable deserialization in your implementation to persist the object but that may not be an option for you if the legacy format is required

3161344
disk	ram
there is another thing that really speeds up eclipse on both windows and especially linux - putting the jvm in ram disk

3161344
disk	ram
for windows you can use the commercial ram disk driver from qsoft

3161344
disk	ram
it is important to give additional space to the ram disk that is 10 bigger than the size of the jvm

3161357
maven	pom.xml
edit as a point of reference there is the following link available pom.xml element for source file encoding showing the nuances between these properties for both maven 2.0 and 3.0

3161372
decltype	auto
since the compiler generates a local class it generates a name and therefore you can never explicitly write the type you can only deduce the type from either type deductions of template function arguments or using auto decltype

3161381
profiling	debugging
the most important thing for debugging sql queries is sql server profiling

3161404

3161434
accessor	properties
while you can control access to a properties via its get and set accessor you cannot control access to a field

3161434
accessor	properties
if your properties accessor don t contain any additional logic you can just as well write

3161461
createfile	deviceiocontrol
before the usage of ioctl code in the function deviceiocontrol one need to open the corresponding device with respect of createfile function

3161461
createfile	deviceiocontrol
for the usage of deviceiocontrol one can use 0 as a second parameter of createfile because we will not use readfile writefile etc functions to access the device

3161468
getter	setter
edit if you wanted special logic handled independently in the getter and setter you could try the following code

3161482
getter	setter
and these getter and setter

3161500
onresume	onpause
say if onresume is called set a flag somewhere and when onpause is called reset it

3161539
inherited	subclassing
due to the way multi-table inherited works in django you ll need to access the onetoonefield that exists on the manufacturer to the subclassing instance

3161542
post	get
because we use post and not get method to get the data from the server all input parameters of the web method must be always set

3161563
pull	push
you described the two high level options available push vs pull polling

3161568

3161864
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization between javascript and .net types is done for you automatically by the .net javascriptserializer

3161886
rdf	owl
rdf id and relative urls are expanded into full absolute urls such as by using the base url of the owl file

3161887
ati	nvidia
another possibility would be nvidia scenix though given the source compatibility with intel and or amd ati graphics hardware may be questionable

3162068
int	chars
ie int chars etc

3162094
hash	md5
i could not find any built-in property telling me this information the content s md5 current hash value

3162104
post	get
in addition to what you asked you will get the date of the lastest post in the category as i think you ll need it if it is a good forum

3162114
filtering	grouping
from there you can sort filtering grouping query the contents of that library

3162143
bitblt	gdi
alternatively if you prefer to work with vcl rather than windows gdi you can replace the two bitblt lines with

3162171

using the provided input fields i have made a basic dropdownlistfor containing two items and a checkbox

3162183
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ajax paging works in google-chrome ie opera mobile firefox safari

3162183
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
scrolling grid doesn t render properly in ie8 safari google-chrome or mobile opera not even a scroll bar on the last one - support issue raised i think they ve fixed it already

3162183

grid rendering looks exactly the same in all browsers ie8 google-chrome firefox safari and opera mobile

3162183
opera	google-chrome
ajax activity image doesn t work in ie8 google-chrome or opera mobile but the grid still works regardless

3162207
sorting	filtering
as toby noted in the other answer in general you don t need to worry about performance when sorting such a small number of rows assuming you will always be filtering by designid .

3162267
int	chars
you should pass them either as unsigned chars or as a wider int type

3162308
nexus	artifactory
while it may not be the ideal solution you are looking for i found that the best case for this kind of thing is to install cntlm and a local repository proxy within the firewall such as sonatype nexus jfrog s artifactory or apache archiva

3162308
nexus	artifactory
i ve used artifactory and nexus and they are both pretty comparable

3162419
postgresql	mysql
if you re also considering approaches without mysql then you might want to look at postgresql which is another free and open-source database

3162419
postgresql	mysql
postgresql supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in mysql and also give better performance

3162473
caliburn	prism
you may find caliburn or prism useful for .net

3162494
post	put	post	get	put	get
2 for example using get on a form which requires data to be presented via post or using put on a read-only resource

realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size

3162534
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

3162553
eurekalog	madexcept
madexcept because either that or eurekalog tell you what actually went wrong

3162598
easymock	powermockito
not sure how to with pure easymock but consider using the powermockito extensions to easymock

3162604
fileoutputstream	filechannel
i don t see any reason why filechannel could be any faster than fileoutputstream in this case

3162627
postgresql	mysql
for an alternative coming from php you could try postgis on postgresql but i ve always favoured mysql for ease of use native support and all round speed

3162630
width	height
try putting these two lines in the constructor of the class that you want to use the stage width height

3162644

3162677
many-to-many	one-to-many
a little bit of data de-normalization changing that many-to-many to a one-to-many and duplicating the rolename and roleweight values would solve the issue

3162693
getter	setter
using a class interface that simply doesn t allow any operation that is able to modify what is inside your class just getter and no setter

3162712
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
htmlspecialchars with ent_quotes or perhaps a combination of htmlspecialchars with ent_noquotes and addslashes if you don t want your quotes to turn into html entities

3162745
queue	fifo
i guess my question lies in whether to create separate queue for each service and any common technology service broker that is well suited to the throttling if not i ll end up creating my own throttling queueing system which is why i was looking for common design patterns producer consumer or something since it s not fifo due to the above example

3162745
queue	fifo
so far it looks like a fifo queue for each service with it s own throttling looks like the way to move forward

3162760
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
what are the runtimeexception and what are checked unchecked-exception and difference between error exception.why these many types

3162769
udp	tcp

3162832
haskell	ocaml
note that this requires more powerful type inference than either f# or haskell currently have ocaml can infer sum types

3162834
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
this would work well with a uiviewcontroller or uiwindow which you can get through i think because these would have the most similar responder chains and would make the current firstresponder loose its firstresponder status dismissing the keyboard but also wouldn t bring up the keyboard as it would not be a uitextfield

3162879
uniq	grep
grep file name input.txt | sort | uniq

3162889
getter	setter
getter and setter

3162900

rather subclassing the abstract base class collections.mapping or mutablemapping if you want to also be able to modify an instance after creation implement the indispensable special methods for the purpose and you ll get other dict -like methods for free from the abc

3162924
firefox	safari
can we say for any site that it is cross browser compatible if it s working fine on desktop version of ie 7 8 firefox 3+ safari 3+

3162924
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
if i make sites compatible with desktop version of ie 7 8 firefox 3+ safari 3+ opera 8+ and use word cross browser can anyone assume it will work on mobile browsers and other devices ipad also

3162924

i know that i can override the multipartentity and make the writeto outputstream out method write to a filteroutputstream class that i created to wrap the default inputstream

3163142
put	get
but from what i gather some things that could get put into content might become entities that would make it no longer be valid

3163364
gcov	lcov
if it is not possible via gcov perhaps it is possible via lcov but i was not able to figure it out

3163382
int	chars
adding 4 to this value increments it by making it point to the second int of the array assuming 32 bit 4 byte int and one byte chars on a little endian platform

3163387
int	chars
that chars will be promoted to an int passed to printf and printed out

3163418

the usual way to handle this is to show the prompt but cancel the form submission and then submit the form programmatically if the user says yes.

3163595
submit	submission
set up a submit handler on the form so that it cancels the submission if it s told to

3163616
implements	extends
the purpose of anonymous inner classes is to extends another class or implements another interface ad-hoc

3163616
implements	extends
for that reason anonymous inner classes can simulate the job of lambda expressions to some extends for example by implements the runnable interface

3163617
int	chars
you would likely want to encode the string as hex or int for the normal representation or you will see garbage chars instead

3163620
hide	show
i would suggest to just hide and show that .

3163643
daemons	systemd
because of some specific behaviour in dream daemons i can t use a process.close call since dd intercepts that and simply minimizes itself to the systemd tray

3163658
hide	show
first one is the main group and the second is the subgroup what i want to do is hide the main group and just show the subgroups in my data grid

3163674
cassini	iis
i came across this interesting problem with an asp.net mvc website there is an action method to process uploaded files and it works fine with cassini webserver but when i tried with iis in my hosting machine the upload fails after spending lot of time i noticed that it is because of the url rewite rules inside set to change the incoming urls to lowercase and add a trailing slash at the end

3163681

if i asked about most popular free relational database i d expect to get mysql or postgresql or perhaps sqlite

3163685

i m using objectdatasource to bind formview

3163712
comparator	icomparer
as jon said you need to define your custom comparator implementing icomparer

3163714
int	chars
the reason it is not working is that get returns an int but you are using the input as a chars

3163716

i m trying to work out how to move data parsed from an rss feed into a uitableview into an entirely new view for example a uimapkit but not having much luck

3163979
rss	feed
it s created in a currentdogstableview class - which downloads the data from an rss feed using an rssdownload class

3164008
superclass	subclassing
the easiest way maybe not the nicest though would be to subclassing the propertyplaceholdeconfigurer load the commons configuration there and then pass it to the superclass

3164026
put	get
get your linq result and put it in loop compare every char with in list of char

3164034
boost	stl
also no boost or external libraries - pure c++ stl i really neeed only an algorithm

3164037
inherited	subclassing
you could either turn task into a subclassing also then have each inherited from something common using your names from above wherever possible

3164037
superclass	subclassing
or you move the shared functionality out to its own module then include that and avoid superclass subclassing altogether i would opt for this one

3164056
intersect	contains
the result is a manifold object which contains a collection of points where the shape boundaries intersect

3164072

3164171
hide	show
my problem is if the email is invalid the alert pops up but then when that is closed it continues to run the hide and show functions

3164171
hide	show
i need it to only run the hide show functions if the email is valid

3164234
stdout	stderr
the caller creates two pipes and passes the writing ends of both pipes to the createprocess as the stdout stderr handles to use for the child process

3164234
stdout	stderr
since it doesn t seem to be able to use one synchronization call which waits for the process to exit or data on either stdout or stderr to be available the waitformultipleobjects function doesn t work on pipes the caller has two threads running which both perform blocking readfile calls on the reading ends of the stdout stderr pipes

3164234
stdout	stderr
here s the exact code of the read thread procedure which is used for stdout stderr i didn t write this code myself i assume some colleague did

3164234
daemons	launchd
now the problem i hit is this b.exe might depending on user input launchd external processes which live longer than b.exe itself daemons processes basically

3164234
stdout	stderr
what happens in that case is that the writing ends of the stdout stderr pipes are inherited to that daemon process so the pipe is never broken

3164234
stdout	stderr
clearing the inheritable flag on stdout stderr inside b.exe doesn t seem to have any effect it would have surprised me if it did

3164320
rar	zip
actually i am having 10 files with boxes if i select more than one check box that files should get zip rar and i am able to save that in some path

3164338
subclass	abstract-class
we can use a abstract-class constructor to execute code that is relevant for every subclass

subclass	abstract-class
you can t force a particular signature of constructor in your subclass - but you can force it to go through a constructor in your abstract-class taking two integers

3164369
implements	modifiers
when overriding clone you should change the modifiers to public and implements cloneable

3164434

btw - you don t mention whether you re using iis or cassini

3164542
put	get
6.i did nt want to put these 16 led windows in resource editor but wanted to create them at run time.for creation of these 16 windows the co-ordinates of the mother window idc_leds are required.i tried the creation process in the cled_arr constructor.but probably at this instant the window of the class is not available so i get exception.so i wanted to do it using some message handler using the creation the window message of this class cled_arr.but the only message available for this class is bn_clicked

3164545
post	get
so building on my previous post xmlstarlet seems to get the job done like so

3164817
opera	google-chrome
in 4.0 it is a lot better but still not quite as good as in google-chrome or opera

3164817
google-chrome	firefox
also firefox 4 has hardware accelerated canvas that is marginally faster than ie9 and a lot faster than google-chrome

3164817
google-chrome	firefox
in fact canvas in firefox 3.6 is already at least as fast as in google-chrome but many tests don t show it since the javascript is slower

3164821
openfire	ejabberd
i was looking at following server technologies like openfire tigase ejabberd and rabbitmq

3164847

preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
my preferenceactivity contains a nested preferencescreen in another preferencescreen and i m applying a theme to my prefenceactivity that changes the background color

3164868
setinterval	clearinterval
this is stopping the interval previously set via setinterval from running anymore killing the current loop via clearinterval and clearing the timerid variable so the startrotation function restarts the loop when it s ready to on mouseleave

3164868
setinterval	settimeout
one change i would make never pass a string into setinterval or settimeout this runs an eval internally

3164894
portrait	landscape
you may like to consider having a portrait orientation nib and a landscape orientation nib if you are building your interface with interface builder

3164919
firefox	safari
...in terms of browser support queryselector and queryselectorall is supported in firefox 3.1+ ie8+ only in ie8 standards mode and safari 3.1+

3164966
width	height
to show that rectangular area correctly browser would need width and height data

3164975
maven	pom.xml
even my poms all has single company s internal repository specified maven goes to internet repositories taken from libs pom.xml files to fetch dependencies

3165002
width	height
generally you should provide the height and width tags so that the browser can reserve the needes space for the image

3165002
width	height
so you should stick with always adding height and width attributes

3165015
firefox	safari
tested in firefox and safari

3165032
folder	directory
no chance that you have either not copied it correctly or forgot something to copy to the deployment directory or not in the right place folder subfolder when you run it from your command line

3165042
getter	setter
also i see the equals and hashcode methods missing from your embedded pk as well as the getter setter

3165055
imap	nntp
these functions enable you to operate with the imap protocol as well as the nntp pop3 and local mailbox access methods

3165063
post	get
i also think the assigning the global work size to the nearest multiple and being careful about bounds should work i ll post a comment when i get around to trying it

3165125
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i ve a huge panel with dropdownlistfor and checkbox

3165125
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
to manage them i have to implement the clicklistener interface so that on expanding the dropdownlistfor or clicking on the checkbox some actions are executed

3165125
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
so it should be modal and it is except for dropdownlistfor and checkbox because clicking on them calls to the onclick widget sender method which knows nothing about the modality of the dialog box so it could expand the dropdownlistfor or tick the checkbox

3165141
getter	setter
you could however enforce your own type checking rules using getter and setter functions in your object

3165156
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in ie 8 and firefox but not in google-chrome

3165172
udp	tcp
when i pass a 0 value as the protocol parameter tcp and udp work as expected

3165216
gridview	sqldatasource
gridview to the sqldatasource is connected

3165229
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
however when i receive a memory warning didreceivememorywarning is called on the view controller although the app seems to handle it gracefully viewdidload gets called for the view to get set up again without any extraneous views etc - app doesn t crash and the uiimagepickercontroller lets me take a photo the uiimagepickercontroller s view in this case the camera doesn t get dismissed

3165305
updatepanel	scriptmanager
as i am using updatepanel and there is already a scriptmanager in master page so i am using scriptmanagerproxy in updatepanel

submit	submission
if the client has js enabled then you can hookup some jquery to hijack the form submission by attaching an event to the submit button click event or form submit event and send the data using ajax

3165373
doc	rtf
there is a way do convert html or pdf to rtf doc or html pdf to image using devexpress or infragistics

3165404
feedback	review
for the purposes of code review feedback i would suggest that it was bad practice because it implements an unexpected test even if we ignore the uncertainty of whether it will always behave the same when the types match

3165440
put	get
suppose my 100 threads are executing the same method work concurrently then if i put the following code help me get what i seek

3165633
width	height
but i need to handle some controls like media element height and width when the user restore the browser or let say resize the browser by clicking on the edge and resizing it

3165633
width	height
so again the buttom line is i want the the height and width of the broswer not the current system resolution

3165635
super	abstract
having a constructor in the abstract class allows you to call super foo

3165646
button	checkbox
i assume that there is exactly one form element that can be either a textarea input field select form a set of radio button or a single checkbox you will have to update my code if you need more checkbox

3165665
put	get
of course this answer just shows how ridicolous stuffs can get if we put too much rescrictions

3165672
std	ostream
if you don t need this level of flexibility and want to keep all this in a single class you could make the m_out variable a pointer to std ostream and add an extra flag to keep track of whether you need to delete it on cleanup

3165696
pull	push
i ve checked in some changes to my local repository that i want to push but when i do a git pull i get

3165800
memcached	apc
i use apc memcached to some extent but i also thought why have it hit the server at all so i devised this

the standard version of gcc has no support for blocks so you ll either have to port apple s changes to the linux gcc or use clang llvm

3165864
std	ostream
the classes in c++ inherit from std ostream

3165908
haskell	ocaml
go is much more c++ like and low level oriented than c# and c# has only a few functional features while scala allows you to write typical functional code more verbose than ocaml or haskell but similar

3165985
profiler	visualvm
a simple and free tool is to use sun profiler supplied with java visualvm

3165998

i was hoping one of the other answers would update and fix this but both of them never toggle they always show here s how to toggle and hide the others like you want

3166065
put	get
anytime there are schema changes they get put back into the scripts so that they don t get lost

3166102

3166189
bazaar	svn
i am using bzr-svn to chekout svn repositories using bazaar

3166202
versioning	upgrade
each endpoint having its own copy of the assembly reinforces the autonomy of the endpoints and will make it much easier if you ever need to upgrade to a new versioning of nservicebus since you would be able to test each endpoint individually and not just put a new assembly in the gac add a binding redirect and hope everything continues to run fine

3166210
16-bit	64bit
64bit versions of windows are unable to run 16-bit applications this is because a 64bit cpu running in 64bit mode does not support running 16-bit instructions

3166211
versioning	upgrade
to do so you ll have to either recreate your db from scratch which granted linq to sql does not do very well or use something like wizardby to versioning and upgrade your db schema

3166224
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller which has one uiviewcontroller added to it

3166244
width	height
i tried height and width but it does not increases the box size

moose	dancer
using moose and dancer for this project has had the added benefit that my small demo application shrank from about 5 000 lines to less than 1 000 lines

3166446
vim	emacs
better to use vim or emacs imo or better yet emacs in viper-mode

3166478
equals	tostring
calling object method on value types like tostring or equals is always correct but not with references as they can be null

3166485
pull	push
using access vba you can loop through your clients open a template excel file import the data pull instead of push with your client as a criteria and save it with a unique name for each client

dumpsys	adb
fwiw you can use adb shell dumpsys to find out about outstanding wakelocks among other things

3166541
int	chars
the inputs it expects are the input data passed as byte the size of the input data passed as int a pointer to the variable in which to store the compressed size passed as int and a string in which error messages can be stored if needed passed as chars

but wouldn t it be faster to have the year as a literal number field especially since i m going to be filtering and sorting

3166762
maven	pom.xml
mixins - for pom.xml composition in maven 3.1 afaik

3166762

3166879
degrafa	flex
btw i found one wary bacic made by erno aapa with degrafa but i would really love to see something much more flex 4 - mxml oriented and frienfdly

3166959
hide	show
2 show hide logic of previous next buttons at the beginning end of the process respectively

3167021
hide	show
this may not be exactly what you re looking for but what if you use jquery to hide and show div tags

3167031
fadein	fadeout
the blur effect is not possible with js except in ie but you can make something similar with fadein fadeout to change the transparency

3167033

not checking in the bin directory makes sense to me but i do check in the gen folder and don t have any problems

3167067
serializable	deserialization
if using custom xml serializable ixmlserialiable on a complex object that contains properties with constituent complex objects which do not use custom ixmlserializable interface how do you specify in the ixmlserializable.readxml xmlreader reader method that you want the deserializer to use the ordinary deserialization on those child properties

3167092
post	get
when implementing edit action i add two methods for get and post edit string id

3167099
client-side	server-side
i take user input for the new node and if everything passes validation client-side first server-side second a new node is added to my mysql database and then i update the jstree on the fly with some javascript by adding a new node to it s parent on initial page load php correctly builds an html tree with unordered lists and list items

3167177
put	get
i think its more an issue of what you do with it since curl can be used to do a lot of things that may toe the line as far as legality such as bots some things done with curl are best not put into applications that are distributed sold to 3rd parties but if you re just doing stuff thats plainly allowed such as connecting to an api i don t see why it would be an issue and i don t think apple would get involved either way other than disapproving your app if they thought you stepped over the lines but they wouldn t be directly affected by it so its unlikely they would do anything more than that

3167202
public	protected
remember that abstract methods must be implemented by the subclasses but you can also provide your own code within the class itself via normal private public protected etc

3167227
subclass	abstract-class
an abstract-class is for when you want to partially implement certain functionality but delegate important parts to a subclass

3167228
inline	inlining
methods that contain exception-handling blocks are not inline though methods that throw exceptions are still candidates for inlining

3167228
getter	setter
since the c# compiler creates separate getter and setter methods from the property declaration they would obvious be treated independently of one another

3167228
accessor	properties
based on the rules above i would say most of the time properties accessor are inlined

3167238
put	get
i have had to put in a fix where an iframe needs to get a packet of json back to a parent.document

3167277
post	get

for example most mmo games use both tcp and udp connections

3167283
udp	tcp
tcp only for critical data and udp for any other data

3167321

stdout	fflush
how often does python fflush to stdout

3167494
stdout	fflush
as for 2 i believe python fflush to stdout after every new line

3167494
stdout	fflush
but if you overload stdout to be to a file does it fflush as often

3167562
illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
i usually use an illegalargumentexception to show that an argument has been passed in that does not fit the contract of the method call and an illegalstateexception to show that the object is not in the state to handle the method call at this time

3167595
folder	directory

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
with inherited you get the image of the superclass in your subclassing object image as soon as the subclassing is created and it remains part of the subclassing object throughout the lifetime of the subclassing

3167834
hide	show
when the search box is clicked bring the artistsearchcontroller to the front as modal to hide artists or add transparency if you still want to show artists in the background

that is make all the fields on it readonly and provide only property getter not setter

3167880
peer	p2p
in my master s project i have used minimum spanning tree to visualize connections of peer inside a cluster of a p2p network

3168090
hash	md5
i m taking the output of an md5 hash and would like to xor every four bytes together so that i can get a 32 bit int out of it

3168090
hash	md5
if i need a int would i be better off with a different hash function or should i just take the first 4 bytes of the md5 because xor ing them all wouldn t help any

3168106
ant	maven
i ve only done a little bit of android development with vim but i d very much suggest getting your head around ant which the sdk uses to build projects from the command line and perhaps maven if you re daring

width	height
in essence ie in its infinite wisdom decided to be different from the rest of the browser world and include any padding and or border to the width or height in this case specified in the css

3168246
portrait	landscape
if you re just changing the layout you should really think about putting your portrait layouts in res layout and your landscape layouts in res layout-land with the same names and android will select the correct layout automatically

instead it must construct the object streams in the same way that your client does by using new objectinputstream and new objectoutputstream

3168289
content-disposition	content-type
set content-type to application vnd.ms-excel and response header for content-disposition

3168298

the z represents an integer of length same as size_t and the priu32 macro defined in the c99 header inttypes.h represents an unsigned 32-bit integer

3168300
hash	md5
to address the off topic part i d suggest just lopping off the first 32 bits of the md5 hash

3168300
hash	md5
like other cryptographic hash md5 is supposed to appear as random as possible so xor ing other bytes won t really make a difference imo

3168307
viewdidload	viewwillappear
or instead of using viewdidload use viewwillappear animated.

3168316
ffmpeg	libavformat
here is a tutorial on using libavformat and libavcodec both part of ffmpeg to get video stream info

you might be able to use a cashapelayer as a mask for a cagradientlayer by setting it to the cagradientlayer s mask property

3168435
ienumerable	ienumerator
it s because the c# compiler does not generate code to box stuff to ienumerable or ienumerator in a foreach loop if it can avoid it

3168452
pyquery	lxml
there is another complementary module that relies on lxml called pyquery that might be just what you re looking for

3168504
pthreads	fcntl
this works great in pthreads using fcntl locking

3168504
pthreads	fcntl
when i do it in that order in pthreads i lose the write lock by taking the read lock because fcntl replaces the existing lock instead of adding locks as windows does

3168509
hash	salt
the 2nd vulenrablity is much more important it is cwe-760 use of a one-way hash with a predictable salt

3168509
hash	salt
a password hash cannot be broken until the salt is retrieved

3168509
hash	salt
a salt must be a secret ideally this secret is stored separately from the password hash

3168509
hash	salt
if the salt is stored in the database along side the password hash then sql injeciton can be used to obtain both values and then a simple dictionary attack can be used to break the hash

3168509
hash	salt
to improve the secuirty provided by a salt it should be stored separately from the password hash such that both must be compromised before the any hash can be broken

3168517
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works correctly in firefox but not in google-chrome or safari

i ve been reviewing the prism toolkit and i find many examples where they declare a public property with empty getter setter yet they can still set the property of the instantiated class

3168664
des	aes
these are algorithms such as des aes blowfish etc

3168666
pop-up	dialog
then you can just link the the handle url passing in the pertinent data to pull correct file or perform authentication and the dialog will pop-up regardless

3168677

to save this with bash use to write to the same place as stdout you need the parentheses so you get the stderr of time and not just the stderr of myprog

3168679
spaces	delimiter	punctuation	words
yes you can use punctuation white spaces international characters and sql reserved words if you use delimiter identifiers

3168683

then when the select choosen option changes hide all the stuff and show the selected

3168962
inherited	properties
change the class declaration to match the inherited properties in your page directive be a partial and inherited from webforms page base class

3169018
awt	swing
android does not support swing or awt

3169077
int	double
i m having trouble multiplying an int with a double

3169143
dictionary	map
as an aside you should use a map dictionary when it s the best data structure choice not just because it s easy and fast although programmer time is expensive proper structure choice will help create a better overall design

3169159
portrait	landscape
i have a textfield in a table view cell when i try to edit the textfield the keyboard appears and when i rotate the device from landscape to portrait this is what i get

g++	gcc
edit i found that these errors can be caused by accidentaly using gcc instead of g++

3169242
width	height
set the contentsize property of your uiscrollview properly basically the width height of the content that can be displayed in the scroll view without scrolling set the pagingenabled property of the scroll view to yes and then add your view that you want to scroll as a subview of the uiscrollview

3169249

now i wanted to be able to support both landscape and portrait mode in the game

3169415
portrait	landscape
i hope this helps someone i know i had a very tough time with it especially the keyboard going from landscape to portrait

3169431
children	parent
there is nothing wrong in exposing properties in case of storng composition-like relation between parent and its children

3169438
google-chrome	firefox
however i tested with google-chrome and firefox and it did not

3169471
post	get
it is also recommended that actions modifying the model should not be done on a get request meaning that you should call your delete url using post or delete

3169510
rss	feed
the source of an rss feed is xml

3169527
pop-up	dialog
however if you re talking about pop-up as in modal dialog or small information windows in an application those are usually fine

3169533
accessor	properties
if you want to write them from outside you need to declare them as readwrite properties and either synthesize or manually implement the corresponding setxxx accessor method

3169603
int	chars
again i don t know the difference between the i l or i l format chars but since they all represent 32-bit int then their binary representation should be the same for all values between 0 and 2147483647 inclusive

3169627
inherited	properties
but wouldn t it just be easier to set the inherited properties via the constructor in the inherited class

3169638
firefox	safari
will trigger an onbeforeunload event on ie but not on safari or firefox

3169639
post	get
so you would include httpservletrequest request in method parameters for both methods ie get and post and retrieve the object via request.getattribute binding

3169640
versioning	upgrade
motorola milestone after upgrade to 2.1 - update1 firmware versioning

3169644

3169666
ubuntu	linux
i m on linux ubuntu 9.10

3169674
x86	64bit
did you install the vc_redist x86 or 64bit that come with the compiler you used to build your dll

3169697
int	chars
therefor i changed my implementation to generate a random int with 60 bits so longer than 42 chars instead

3169705
thin	webrick
make sure you run thin on your localhost - there are certain instances where code will work in webrick but not in thin

3169707
google-chrome	safari
inspector in safari google-chrome shows the existence and proper id of the element

3169712
accessor	properties
depending on how you define the properties but usually any instance of the class will have that properties s accessor available to other classes

3169761
x86	64bit
try setting the platform target to x64 to make sure your app is running 64bit and not as a x86 app

3169766
mp3	flac	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	flac	wav	ogg	flac	ogg
i don t have direct experience with the vast majority of these tools and library but at least from the list it seems that many claim to support at least mp3 and ogg fewer explicitly mention wav or flac

3169772
portrait	landscape
when you rotate to landscape mode the table cells look like they are still set up for portrait mode

3169772
portrait	landscape
when you rotate back to portrait the table cells are set up for landscape mode

you ll probably need a cron job to clear out entries where jobs crashed

3169838
getter	setter
property declares the getter and the setter methods for the public property you want to implement

3169858
uilabel	uibutton
you can use a uibutton make it transparent custom type without an image and add a uilabel on it centered

for your fade functions you would need to use scriptaculous or jquery

3169874
width	height
width and h is the height

3169888
flac	ogg
i m interested in writing a decoder for flac audio and possibly ogg audio as these seem to be some of the most widely used open source audio formats

3169917
flac	ogg
i suspect the computational demands of flac decoding are probably considerably less than ogg and if dsp gets you excited taking the time to figure all this stuff out is 100 worth it even if the flash route possibly leads to disappointment

3169918
put	get
at any rate you ll have to put some work to get it working and i don t mean this to discourage you but i m not sure actionscript is fast enough for real time audio decoding

3169926
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
then i m wrapping this view controller in a uinavigationcontroller which has a toolbar property and according to the docs i m supposed to use the settoolbaritems method of uiviewcontroller to add items to the toolbar then presenting it in a popover

3169932
postgresql	mysql
it supports all the oses that you ve mentioned and has also database connectors for postgresql but also for mysql sqlite etc

3169965
folder	directory
my attempt at using separate user accounts in the hope they would use their own temp folder in their user directory failed

3169983
getter	setter
whenever you replace that delegate with a new one your synthesized setter and getter will handle the release retain for you every time you set it like so

3169983
getter	setter
you can do very powerful things in your own setter and getter synthesize is for those that happen over and over like retained properties etc

3170039
datalist	repeater
the image is in a datalist repeater which has been binded to a folder containing images files

3170046
jquery	simplemodal
if you only need something really simple you can also use the jquery simplemodal plugin available here the examples from this plugin will give you a nice looking confirmation dialog or any other informational window even embedded iframes

3170062
single-quotes	backslash
since you re using single-quotes you shouldn t need to escape your backslash

3170100
getter	setter
yes use getter and setter which provide field-like semantics but allow you to execute custom logic when assignment is used

3170112
margin	height
eg float-problems height and margin problems etc

3170118
getter	setter
when you declare property and then synthesize you are instructing the compiler to create the instructions and corresponding symbols for getter and setter for you

3170118
getter	setter
prior to objective-c 2.0 all of the getter and setter methods had to be coded by the developer for every attribute which for most cases was copy paste code

3170150
datediff	difference
write your own datediff -equivalent for each rdbms and abstract away the difference

3170183
turkish	polish
the supported codepages are dos usa dos multilingual windows ansi standard macintosh ee ms-dos nordic ms-dos russian ms-dos icelandic ms-dos kamenicky czech ms-dos mazovia polish ms-dos greek ms-dos 437g turkish ms-dos russian macintosh eastern european macintosh greek macintosh windows ee russian windows turkish windows greek windows

3170186
nsstring	nsobject
you will probably end up using the nsstring and nsobject categories when doing your parsing

3170192
hash	md5
until now i ve been considering asking for a valid md5 hash for every api call but i realized that it wouldn t be a difficult task to hijack such a system

3170265
post	get
additionally firebug is reporting an aborted post request to test_multiple but a successful get request to test_multiple

3170316
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
so when i execute them through cron jobs will they run through the cli interface or some other daemon if thats the right word to use

3170358
post	get
the aborted post is probably because the xhr request did not get a chance to finish before the server received the normal http get request and starting sending output

3170396
versioning	upgrade
you should probably upgrade to the latest versioning of the sdk versioning 4.0

3170404
gridview	radgrid
to a gridview exactly a telerik s one radgrid

3170487
folder	directory
you can make your own folder and put files into them without cakephp caring where they are as long as they are in the overall correct directory controller if its a controller so if you have a bunch of controllers that say are for doing an action that you think of as updating user profile information then you just create a folder for this and put all those in there and you can do the same for components that relate to this within the component directory .

3170520
set	bag
a set doesn t have an inherent order and cannot contain duplicates it s a bag in which elements are not ordered

3170538
int	chars
you can convert a chars to a hex string by first converting it to an int and then using the x format specifier like this

3170542
integer	unsigned
using enums for representing bit patterns masks and flags is not always a good idea because enums generally promote to signed integer type while for bit-based operation unsigned types are almost always preferable

3170545
superclass	subclassing
we re writing a superclass and we want to make sure its subclassing implement a given method

3170545
subclass	abstract-class
objective-c doesn t have abstract-class and it lacks a mechanism to force a subclass to implement a given method

3170548
folder	directory
copy changed files and svn folder of their parent directory to the wokplace location working folder and commit

3170567
folder	directory
if you want to search your entire directory structure rather than just the folder you are currently in then add xyz.txt

3170620
int	chars
ex your chars hello world and you attempt to cast it into a int

3170656
system.io.compression	sharpziplib
with .net s system.io.compression classes you can apply similar compression as used in zip files deflate gzip to any stream you like but if you want to work with actual zip format files you ll need a third party library like this one sharpziplib

3170716
children	parent
parent li is active and all the children too even when the current is parent li

3170736
mouseover	mouseout
there are some gotchas with mouseover mouseout on elements too the events bubble and you may get them twice unless you do some filtering

3170765
inherited	properties
very often i face the same problem with flex when i create a skin for spark component or create new spark component based on another spark component i have inherited properties that i don t need

3170774
width	margin
when you have specified a width on the object that you have applied margin 0 auto to the object will sit centrally within it s parent container

3170790

3170842
spaces	linefeed
linefeed characters within a block element must be converted into a spaces

3170874
post	get
thing is - the php script starts running once the webserver receives the post or get message from the client

3170916
public	protected
instead a better way would be to make the method protected and create a dummy class in your test assembly by inheriting from the class under test and then creating a public method which calls the protected method

3170925
hash	salt
i store the password in the db hash salt and use pdo to prevent against injection

3170961
hide	show
you could initially hide your details links and only show it on mouse hover by hooking an event handler to hover event

3170961
hide	show
that way you can explicitly show hide the anchor based on the corresponding event

3170968
versioning	upgrade
in addition we needed to be able to prove that the upgrade scripts would work no matter which versioning of the application was being upgrade we had no control of the deployment environment or upgrade schedules so it was possible that a given site might need to upgrade from 1.1 to 1.3 skipping 1.2

3170968
versioning	upgrade
my regression test for the database would involve restoring a database dump running the installer to upgrade the database and the dumping the result and splitting the dump into fragments and then comparing the fragments against the committed versioning

3170968
installation	upgrade
if there were any differences then that pointed to problems in the upgrade or installation fragments

3170968
installation	upgrade
during development the developers would run the installation tool to initialize really upgrade their development databases then make their changes

3170968
pull	push
the same scripts could be used bidirectionally so that they could be used to pull data to test from live or push site changes from test to live

3170978
uniq	grep
shell grep tr grep sort uniq sort head perl

mouse	keyboard
this will cause any calls that attempt to communicate with a screen keyboard mouse etc to fail but also means that you won t need an x server on unix or access to the console on windows

3171045
mouse	keyboard
what i would like to do is make an on-screen keyboard to be used with the mouse -- but in a t9 phone-keypad style to hopefully minimize the number of clicks and amount of moving the mouse around missing targets

3171061
client-side	server-side
i would have suggested but this doesn t help with your code finding out if javascript is supported perhaps with an additional form only outputted in there but this would complicate your client-side and server-side logic

3171066
stdout	stderr
it sends stdout to a pipe and makes stderr goto the same place

3171066
stdout	stderr
combining stdout and stderr like this is generally acceptable for interactive use since they were probably going to the same tty device anyway but it may not be a good idea for use in automated contexts e.g scripts

3171068
extjs	gxt
there is a similar question to this for extjs but not for gxt

3171083
children	parent
or does the parent view controller have to tell it s children when changes are occurring

3171193
fgets	splfileobject
splfileobject fgets example

3171218
put	get
i have altered it so the search terms get put into a table variable that is then joined on

3171232
portrait	landscape
i have an application in which all viewcontrollers are portrait only 9typical tabbar navigation app but i would like to play a move in fullscreen landscape mode

3171237

so you want to open a pop-up dialog box and at the same time disable the rest of the page until the user closes the dialog box

3171241
int	double
no i am not looking for the answer an int and a double

3171246
int	chars
variations of the bar lengths of one chars compared to other solutions is due to powershell using rounding instead of truncation when converting floating-point numbers into int

3171269
width	height
then change the skin styles width height and padding of image containers according to your image dimensions

3171269
width	height
for example if your images are of size 100x100 then change the image container s width and height as 100px and 100px and add some padding like 10px so that only one image will appear at a time

3171270
versioning	upgrade
i mean errors which will not create any problem on future upgrade of browser css and html versioning

post	get
i wanted to post it as a comment but i can figure out how to get the code correct there

post	get
apparently i can only post one link until i get more reputation so the link below contains the three links i referenced above

3171346
int	double
fundamental types built-in value types such as int and double and

3171392
rsa	aes
the first will will be symmetric aes and will encrypt the license data and the second will be a asymmetric rsa an will encrypt the symmetric key

3171446
salt	md5
same as #1 but rolling your own really elaborate key-generation system run the machine sid or a hardware id through md5 using a randomly-generated salt and then using the result to encrypt the login credentials

3171448
width	height
and it could be set to width height 100

3171455
width	height
dont give height and width attribute to the tag like

3171462
opera	firefox
it works in ie and firefox not opera but opera does not support onbeforeunload in general afaik

3171472
rsa	aes
if your rsa modulus is 1024 bits there is no need for aes key larger than 128 bits

3171488

width	height
one way is to refactor for example instead of passing in 4 primitive variables top left width and height just pass in one compound variable rectangle

3171605
stringstream	fstream	istream	ostringstream	ostream	ostringstream	ostream	istream
you should overload the operator for ostream then you can use it naturally for an instance of any class which derives from that - ofstream fstream inherits from iostream which inherits from both istream and ostream ostringstream and stringstream inherits iostream too

3171615
std	ostream
it would make more sense to overload for std ostream

3171646
google-chrome	safari
it may not be the best way to do this but if you can find a js file responsible for dev tools for my google-chrome installation the file is devtools.js for safari 5 - injectedscript.js open it in a text editor look for the function injectedscript._describe

3171653
src	attr
lastly i assume attr src was a typo in your code but if it wasn t then you need to brush up on your javascript so that you know the difference between a variable and a string literal

3171684
getter	setter
it is not uncommon in the flex framework to find code that excludes a property and then overrides the getter and setter to do nothing

3171702
width	height
if you simply want to scale the rectangle around the center of the rectangle then you need to increase the width and height of the rectangle and subtract half the increase from the location

3171806
wxpython	pyqt
for your gui if using python you probably want to use pyqt or wxpython

3171821
automake	autotools
using autotools like automake autoconf etc

3171824
super	self
for the record it s super type self

3171907
folder	directory
along with the css file i ve put them all in a new folder in the themes directory

3172139
shadowing	named
you re unlikely to be bitten in any given case by the iffy practice of shadowing built-ins named with your own but eventually it will happen as you happen to need the normal meaning of the shadowed named during some later ordinary maintenance operation and you may be in for a confusing debugging situation then

3172139

3173908
min	max
swap min and max in above solution for overlapping rectangle ro

3173920

i m not sure that one way or the other enumerate or xrange will be significantly faster or better since i think lists store their length in a variable so it can be quickly accessed without counting through the list elements

3173966
min	max
several of the math methods do support decimal abs ceiling floor max min round sign and truncate

3174018
getelementsbyname	each
the above code assumes that there is only one of each tbox and tarea or at least that they appear first in the dom as it targets the first element in the array returned by getelementsbyname

3174023
post	get
you get the value the user has submitted by looking at assuming the form method was post not get

3174110
getter	setter
you can use getter and setter with primitives

3174142
post	get
varybyparam only work with query string when http method is get and parameters values in the form and query string when http method is post

3174153
public	protected
on a side note for best practices it would be a good idea to not access the object member directly but instead make it protected and set it get it through public methods instead something like this

3174161
mouseover	mouseup
1 identify using mouseover mouseup etc

3174212
serializable	deserialization
obviously you can rename the output file afterwards. it s possible that by looking at the serializable format yourself you could avoid some of the processing required by repeated deserialization serializable but i d go for the simple route to start with

3174248
accessor	properties
you can have objective-c properties that are primitive types using either properties or normal accessor

3174305
rss	feed
i ve tried every method that i knows but didn t got the solution on how to create an rss feed and sitemap for a dynamic site that get updated automatically

dynamic_cast respect the access specifications public protected and private inheritance

3174538
getter	setter
first of all you are not following the beans naming conventions for the getter setter and the fields naming

3174547
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
apparently the source of the problem is that abstract-class can t free up methods in their superclass from the need for the abstract-class s subclassing to include the override modifier

3174550
iboutlet	ibaction
i have coded basic functionality where a keyboard pops up on the textview and when you enter text and hit done i am able to capture the text using iboutlet ibaction etc. in a method which shows an alert with the text entered

3174612
opera	google-chrome
for example google-chrome and opera would save your file as .htm probably

3174645
post	get
i am beginner in php and i read in manual that is a associative array consisting of cookies get and post arrays

3174653
post	get
the variables in _request are provided to the script via the get post and cookie input mechanisms and therefore could be modified by the remote user and cannot be trusted

3174663
post	get
this directive describes the order in which php registers get post and cookie variables into the _request array

3174668
post	get
except from get post and cookie values php can also associate environment e and server s variables

3174673
post	get
so if you use the same key on post get and cookie there will only be one value in the array and so you can t get the other values out of the _request array

3174676
bmp	png
are there any predefined functions in qt which save a qimage object to a jpg png bmp file

3174694
super	self
the expected behavior would be self.qa attribute vote_down_count is incremented by one but if any exception occurs in the super self save method the transaction rollbacks that means the self.qa.vote_down_count + 1 is not committed in the database

3174694
super	self
the actual behavior is self.qa.vote_down_count + 1 is committed to database even if an integrityerror exception raises from super self save

3174699
rss	feed
i want to have a simple extension that shows the number of new items in a rss feed since the extension was clicked

i assume you have all the setter getter in the beans if not add them

3174751
setinterval	settimeout
this works fine but some of these dynamically loaded pages have events hooked to them for settimeout setinterval events etc

3174765
width	height
i ve been using gridlayout but the problem is that it makes all cells of the same width and height which is fine when all components have the same size but when i for example have a textfield and a bordered panel with multiple fields either the textfield gets stretched out or the panel is squeezed

3174789
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval instead of settimeout

3174817
children	parent
handle wm_setcursor the parent window usually gets the chance to set the cursor for its children if the child window has special handling you would have to subclass it and handle wm_setcursor there

3174866

3174962
x86	64bit
i ve tried copying both the x86 and the 64bit version of the system.data.sqlite.dll to the output dir as well as referencing them and setting them to copy local but to no avail

3174962
x86	64bit
the vs solution has been set to compile to any x86 64bit but i m still getting the exception

3174994
getter	setter
additionally several smaller features were introduced partial types static classes properties with different access modifiers for getter and setter namespace aliases pragma directives and fixed-sized buffers

3175256
post	get
both get and post requests can be easily exploited for doing a brute force attack

3175261
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
while this would result in two separate taxonomy fields on the node entry form it fits the semantic difference and would give more flexibility for filtering sorting and grouping the nodes down the road

3175280
boxlayout	miglayout
miglayout has a lot of appeal but boxlayout is an alternative

3175310
public	protected
however the above still applies to both kinds both can easily point to public protected or private members of the class

3175320

3175588
width	height
remove width and height from

3175631
folder	directory
if you really want to use an app_code folder it might be better to mark the build action of any of the files as content to ensure they are copied to the output directory when publishing your site

3175652
width	height
for example if the original image width is 200 and the image height is 400 it will be scaled to w 50px h 100px thumbnail

3175656
pascal	delphi	division	multiplication
i ve started programming as a kid somewhere between 10 or 13 years ago with programmable calculator moved to basic then onto non-x86 assembly reimlementing multiplication and division and writing self-modifying mouse driver was fun pascal delphi now i m using c++ almost exclusively

3175656
maya	3dsmax
as far as i know this language is not really widely used as a result there probably is less libraries it can interface with as it was with delphi programming - you can do directx programming in delphi if you really want but you can t write 3dsmax maya plugin with it well it is probably theoretically possible but it certainly won t be easy

3175657
post	get
you ll have to develop an api between the two a very simple one will work using post get as you first thought is a right way to go here

3175658
maven	pom.xml
practically spoken i d create a maven artifact for this driver just a basic pom.xml file and place it on the build servers maven repository or the nexus if you use it for the projects

3175697
public	protected
â¹ all public protected internal private protected internal

3175709
width	height
plus a ton more code namespaces etc that is unnecessary to this situation but the problem i have is that i need to somehow alter that width and height from 256px to arbitrary size using javascript

3175716
haskell	scheme
my mind was blown when i noticed what i was thinking - i would never have missed it if i didn t know what it was and i wouldn t known what it was if i didn t take a look at scheme haskell ruby

3175731
width	height
how about putting an tag inside the div and setting the width and the height on that

3175743
super	self
super a self looks in self.__class__.__mro__ for the next class after a

3175743
super	self
so super a self returns a super object which behaves like b as far as attribute lookup is concerned

3175743
super	self
super a self .check thus calls b.check

3175785
range	minimum
so that k bits are encoded in n bits. in this range first a random code is likely to have very good minimum distance

3175785
range	minimum
concerning upper bounds for the minimum hamming distance in the range n â k you should start with the hamming bound also known as the volume bound or the sphere packing bound

3175823
oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause
in the view where the name and email are entered i looked to see if onstart oncreate onpause onresume .

3175834

for text-editor-like capabilities like you d find in wordpad or html the component to use is the jeditorpane or its descendant jtextpane

3175863
awt	swing
minimum size in awt and swing is usually pointless

3175873
portrait	landscape
if i load the subview in portrait mode then rotate the iphone it rotates to landscape no problem

3175904

3175913
int	double
it doesn t matter if what s stored there is an int or a double or a struct or anything

3175961

3175975
pascal	delphi
extpascal is an object pascal delphi

implements	extends
let s say that in the framework i have a shape interface and the users are free to implements and extends adding new functions the shape interface to create their own figures square and circle

3176011
width	height
the problem with this is that a clutter ignores the new size and only draws into the old width height and b the rgba vs argb32 thing kind of causes a colour meltdown

3176042
int	double
this includes all .net basic primitive types like int double string datetime and any classes built from those

3176049
apache	nginx
btw nginx or apache

3176090
width	height

i have noticed that this setting works well on mytouch for both portrait and landscape

3176090
portrait	landscape
and this works on droid for both portrait and landscape

3176093
tcpclient	networkstream
as far as i m aware the tcpclient makes the connection and i can then use the networkstream instance to read and write to that connection

3176188
int	double
the storage is as a double with the int part indicating the day since 12 30 1899 and the decimal part the time portion within the day

3176217
width	height
if the sub-images do fit in the larger image you should be able to avoid scaling by choosing your width and height such that they are the same as that of the subimage of course in this case you are better of using g.drawimage image img int x int y imageobserver observer

3176264
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
i tried using both svcutil.exe and xsd.exe to create the classes and they both give the main elements caseno activity etc. but neither seems to handle the xs any of datafields .

3176358
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it seems that using line-height can push it down through trial and error with different values but the result isn t consistent across browsers i can get them flush in safari and google-chrome but then firefox looks different

put	get
even worse when i try to put this same code into an xpcom component because that s where i actually need it after i try sending a message via telnet i get

3176457
actionscript	mxml
you won t get mxml code hinting for them but you ll have no problems using addeventlistener in actionscript

3176461
codeigniter	yii
i ve used both codeigniter and yii on my own projects if that makes any difference

3176461
codeigniter	yii
when i needed to add a few new features to the old codeigniter sites it was faster to rewrite the entire sites on yii than to code up the extra features in codeigniter

3176483
put	get
the best way would be to write a wrapper around localstorage much like what jquery does to dom nodes and use that wrapper to get and put items in local storage

3176507
submit	submission
using your example of numbers dashes and letters as being acceptable subdomains you could do something similar to the following probably run when the submit button on the form is clicked and if the match fails then cancel the submission

3176517
unix	bsd
on unix based systems linux bsd os x etc. you can set sendmail_path to something like

3176536
post	get
i m doing a post request to a rest service made with django and piston uploading a file but when i do the request i get this strange

3176573
put	get
that will probably help you get the big picture for your application right and show you more easily how to put together the pieces like do x when this value changes and put the value for that in a text field than trying to learn only the pieces you think you need as you think you need them

3176574
width	height
one thing you can do is measure the height and width of the fonts in system.drawing.text and create a sort of pre-renderer in code to figure out if the text will cause the table to flow off-screen

3176574
width	margin
there would be a bit to keep track of like at what width will the fonts wrap and create a new line and then space between the lines and the margin of the cells

3176577
portrait	landscape
i ve managed to default the application s orientation to landscape however in the ipad simulator when i do command- arrow the application rotates to portrait

3176635
min	max
i suppose that it was left out because you already have min and max so you can accomplish it using them

3176646
min	max
i like guffa s answer but i am surprised that no one has yet posted a solution using min max

3176663
post	get	urllib	httplib
i ve been using httplib and urllib urllib2 to connect to the website and post my login details and things like that but i really don t know how to get that value from the page

3176695
x86	64bit
i ve managed to get mysql mysqldb pil and python 2.65 installed on snow leopard using x86 64bit builds but i m curious as to whether or not there is a definitive answer to this question at the moment and if so why

3176728
width	height
2 store the absolute position top left and the width and height of each item in an array generate a position randomly

3176738
debian	linux
it prints the same output on mac os x and on linux debian testing

3176759
min	max
this might lead to subtle bugs later which are difficult to debug especially when min max values are determined at run time

3176774
hide	show
i derive from the grid an add an icommand called hideshowcolumncommand that takes as its parameter a datagridcolumn the one i want to hide or show and hide the column if it is visible and show it if it is not

3176864
activemq	rabbitmq
compare this to queue software such as rabbitmq and activemq with persistent queues

3176940
int	chars
it has one drawback but i believe it s ok with the question as it compute an int divider to make line shorter than 80 chars the longest line is shorter than 80 chars not exactly 80 chars

3176957
free	malloc
in this example i ve used malloc and free to do all the allocating you could use new std nothrow and delete just as easily

put	get
i like to put together a cheat sheet of libraries and select methods examples for the students so they get a sense of the python universe and how much is available

3177347
put	get
the idea being you can copy an image then copy text and they both get put in the clipboard so you can then go to an image program hit paste and it will paste the image then go to a text program hit paste and it will paste the text

3177491
folder	directory
my recommendation as css image url s are relative to the css file itself is to have an images folder in the same directory as the css file itself

i used to write this code for motion control but the when i run it the graphs are not correct because they should be something linke sin or cos graph

3177664
getter	setter

3177691
google-chrome	firefox
i have been testing this code for the last two days it works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

3177705
versioning	upgrade
the copy module is unfortunately not written to be customized so the alternative ares either copy-paste-edit or a subtle sigh monkey-patch hinging on double-sigh the private module variable _deepcopy_dispatch which means your patched versioning might not survive a python versioning upgrade say from 2.6 to 2.7 hypothetically

3177716
gif	png
all image formats like jpg png and gif also

3177730
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the sdk versioning to 4.0

maven	m2e
if you re using m2e don t use the maven eclipse plugin eclipse eclipse import your project as an existing maven projects

3178037

3178391
ceil	math.h
you use the standard ceil and ceilf functions available i math.h

3178406
int	double
if your data is in int in the first place then you ll either have to find a clever trick or convert your int to double first

3178419
pull	push
so before you push your code to the parent repository you first pull the latest changes merge on your side and try to push

3178430
pull	push
whenever i would bring one branch to a stable state say - finish a refactoring i would pull from the server merge that branch into the pulled changes then push it back to the server and let anyone know that if they made any changes to the affected files they should pull first from the server

3178462
width	height
the solution i came up with was to use gettextbounds to work out the width of the text and ascent descent from fontmetricsint to work out the height

3179100
pdfbox	itext
as far as i know there are two most popular libraries like itext and apache s pdfbox

3179111
spaces	delimiter
i assume spaces is a delimiter for words so the following code should find the first 2000 words in a string or break out if there are fewer words

3179155
children	parent
any item can be parent of another item and can have multiple children

3179171

when using greenhopper with jira it is clear that greenhopper is using the fixed in version field in the jira issues to represent which scrum sprint the issue is being worked on

3179242
greenhopper	sprint
and making three different sprint in greenhopper would really dilute the value of greenhopper

3179246

3179457
range	minimum
after that use numerical methods to find minimum and maximum of the function - this should give you the resulting range

3179457

there you will find width which defaults to 8.5 and height which defaults to 11

3179565
tolower	toupper
the easiest way to do this is when they register change both un and pw to either toupper or tolower and then when you are authenticating do the same to whatever they enter

nsstring	nsdata
so how can i know whether i data that i have received is a nsstring object converted into nsdata or it s uiimage data converted into nsdata

3179934
post	get
you will get this error when you re trying to obtain a non-cached post request from the browser history

3179934
post	get
to fix this problem you need to either turn the cache on or to replace post by get

3179934
post	get
the enduser will then only get a warning dialog that the post data will be resent to the server which in case of fully non-idempotent requests like placing an order or deleting an item is really not desirable

3179934
post	get
replacing post by get is then a better solution

3179934
post	get
replacing post by get isn t easy in jsf prior to version 2.0

3179975
put	get
1+ log10 of num calculates the number of digits a number is we floor it to remove any decimal values put it as the exponent so for a 1 digit number we get 10 0 1 or a 8 digit number we get 10 8

3179981
vlookup	countif
this may sound a bit complicated but especially in large tables vlookup countif s etc can be very time consuming

3180044
ssl	https
in both scenarios data with https is encrypted from both the server to the client and client to the server using a session key once the ssl handshake has been completed

3180067
children	parent
children always inherit attributes from the parent

3180077
width	height
i store x and y in the object directly because it is used by several components but width and height are only known to the rendering component which holds the object s bitmap

3180077
width	height
so an object has a width and a height which are 0 or -1 by default but a rendering component can set them to the correct values in its update loop

3180087
inherited	subclassing
one tell-tale sign of inherited being used improperly is when you have a lot of base functions which are not applicable to your subclassing

3180202
jstl	taglib
the use of scriptlets those things in jsp is indeed highly discouraged since the birth of taglib like jstl and el expression language those things over a decade ago

3180202
jsf	wicket
or just adopt a mvc framework like jsf spring mvc wicket etc so that you end up with just a jsp facelets page and a javabean class without the need for a custom servlet

3180202
jstl	taglib
if you want to invoke some java code to control the flow inside a jsp page then you need to grab an existing flow control taglib like jstl core

3180202
jstl	taglib
there s a standard functions taglib in jstl but you can also easily create functions yourself

3180215
int	double

3180292
free	malloc
if the library isn t too badly optimized specifically function inlining you could disassemble it and locate the malloc and free functions

3180311
width	height
you need to specify the units for your width and height

3180317
width	height
the definition of height and width should be in pixels em s or percentages e.g

3180329
width	height
you haven t specified the units of measure for the height and width attributes in your css

3180389
hash	md5
md5 hash of a 0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661

3180488
mouse	keyboard
the trouble is i ve discovered that if i m moving the mouse at the same time i push a button on the keyboard my keyboard function doesn t get called

3180538
filtering	grouping
the db records will be queried sorted filtering grouping summaried and possibly updated by the end users

3180565
interpreted-language	compiled-language
java seeks to find a compromise between a purely compiled-language with no portability and a purely interpreted-language that is significantly slower

3180565
interpreted-language	compiled-language
by operating this way java gets some of the benefits of compiled-language while also getting some of the benefits of interpreted-language

3180604
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship-model	datamodel
i have had good results by using an entity-relationship entity-relationship-model and diagram for data analysis and an rdm relational datamodel model and diagram to reflect database design

3180604
entity-relationship	diagram
the entity-relationship diagram is useful for communicating the requirements discovered so far back to the clients and making sure they are complete and correct

3180604
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram are easy to understand even if the client has no background in database theory

3180604
entity-relationship	diagram
its easy to derive an rdm model from an entity-relationship model although you have to throw in some design decisions that are intentionally omitted from the entity-relationship diagram

3180615
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
if you re not looking to protect with with authentication via django you can serve it up with your http server nginx lighttpd apache etc - this reduces server impact

all this works perfect when i had my database use myisam but when i changed over to innodb i now have to account for my foreign key or the mysql_queries won t successfully execute

3180658
ienumerable	ilist
should my return type be ienumerable or ilist

3180666
accessor	properties
i have used properties and synthesize to declare and define its accessor methods

3180672
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable is less specific than an ilist that is ilist has functions that ienumerable does not

3180680
sequence	permutation
the function permutation takes a generic sequence e as well as a generic comparison function and lazily yields immutable permutation lexicographically

3180683
post	get
hope that helps please post more information so we can get the details worked out

3180696
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
an ilist has the methods for changing the items like add maybe you want to select between icollection and ienumerable

3180696
ienumerable	icollection
the icollection extends ienumerable and has the count property available that can be useful

3180792
versioning	upgrade
uhm just out of curiosity if you don t have xampp installed why did you get the upgrade versioning instead of the final one

3180825
int	double
getvalue should be used for retrieving int double bool and string values which works great in c# by using convert.changetype ...

3180826
expression-blend	silverlight
so if you decide to write a silverlight application you will have to use xaml files and use expression-blend to design your ui

note tested in firefox and google-chrome only

3181040
try-catch	exception-handling
early today i discovered function try-catch blocks from here in fact and then went on a bit of a research spree - apparently they re main use is it catch exception-handling throw in by a constructor initialiser list

3181072
inherited	subclassing
one table representing objects in the entire inherited hierarchy with all the columns you d need for the entire hierarchy plus a type column to tell you which subclassing a particular object is

3181072
inherited	subclassing
one table for each class in your inherited hierarchy â you now have an animal table and subclassing have foreign keys that point to the common set of data in animal

3181093
feof	fread
you should not use feof to loop on - instead use the return value of fread - loop until it returns zero

3181114
versioning	upgrade
i d strongly urge you to upgrade your weblogic as soon as possible especially if you re still using the versioning of jdk that it was certified for

3181145
icns	ico
i want to add an icon icns ico to a file within my iphone app and i m not quite sure where to start looking

3181165
dictionary	map
i suppose you could find out how the csidl map to paths using something like shgetknownfolderpath build a reverse dictionary of them then check whether the beginning of the path you want to store matches any of the keys in the dictionary and then remove the beginning and store the csidl that matched

3181203
for-loop	arrays
iterate through an arrays with a regular for-loop not a for...in otherwise it enumerates through the arrays s properties since its still an object and has other properties in addition to the elements inside

3181224
post	put
looks like you might be able to test the raw xml put and post data without too much trouble

3181224
post	put
if a post or put request has an xml content-type then the input is taken and passed to an instance of cake s xml object which is assigned to the data property of the controller

3181261
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
see here - substitute the uitabbarcontroller for a uinavigationcontroller

3181278
superclass	subclassing
also if the class has a superclass you could alter the behavior of program startup by changing a superclass since superclass constructors must be called before subclassing perhaps unintentionally

3181312
portrait	landscape
in this case there is 1 view that is best suited to landscape view and 1 view that is best suited to portrait view

3181312
portrait	landscape
from a user perspective you wouldn t need to be switching back and forth much you tend to use the landscape view to change location if you need to and then work mainly in the portrait view - so i don t think it would be frustrating and dropping the tabs seems to make more sense to me

3181321
rss	feed
i m sharing models and some utility code that fetches data from rss feed and evernote

3181370
post	get
run a server side script in php perl .net or anything that takes inputs like from to subject body from get post arguments and send the mail

a bit decent ide eclipse netbeans etc can just autogenerate equals hashcode and also tostring getter and setter for you

3181428
listview	gridview
it is not possible with the toolkit datagrid or gridview for a listview no

3181429
memcached	apc
i suggest either memcached or apc for that purpose

rss	feed
twitter feed from twitter through rss feed on that person s twitter

3181446
rss	feed
take a look at the actual twitter api not just rss feed

put	get
it seems only if i put the class taskpool2 in a separate assembly i get the compile error

3181583
openssl	crypto++
i want to be able to base64 decode data and since boost.asio links to openssl i want to use it s functions to do so and not add an extra dependency eg crypto++

3181591
bitconverter	binaryreader
you can use bitconverter to convert integers into bytes - or just use binarywriter for writing and binaryreader for reading

3181604
firefox	safari
i notice the problem mostly with firefox 3.6.6 on os 10.5.8 and it happens occasionally with safari get your surprised face ready - ie actually works fine everytime - what

3181671
folder	directory
this project would simply be a pom file at the root directory of your project the same level as all the sub-modules folder which references the sub-projects and has the shade plugin configuration

3181692
rss	feed
i ve written a simple extension for safari that captures clicks on the rss button in the address bar calls to the feed protocol and redirects to google reader instead of safari s feed reader

3181694
int	double
decimal is an int scaled by a power of 10 while the float and double types are scaled by powers of 2

3181696
memcached	apc
look into apc if you re using a single server or memcached if you have multiple servers

3181699
children	parent
if so i suggest to pass the interface orientation messages from the parent to the children viewcontrollers as you suggested

3181701
mouseleave	mouseenter
create your own component derived from the tcustompanel or tpanel since delphi 6 doesn t have the mouseenter and mouseleave events on by default you can add them yourself

3181701
mouseleave	mouseenter
afterwards it is all about handling the mouseenter and mouseleave events

3181760
children	parent
i need to set up a ui to add items children to a list parent from the list create edit form

3181806
integer	fractions
another is to use a fractions type which stores an integer numerator and denominator

3181807
feedback	review
if this is an api that s going to be used by many then perhaps opening it up to some review might give you valuable feedback since they presumably know the api domain quite well

3181886
scrollable	panels
i am not looking into the screen capture because the panels is within the scrollable control devx controls so at times it may not be fully visible and i need its visual representation whether visible or not

3181888
children	parent
i do fine getting the program to calculate fitness values select parent produce children then mutate the children

3181890
width	height
so i created a rectanglestyle that uses bindings to set the width height x translation and y translation for a rectangle

3181890
width	height
the width and height bindings are working fine but i m getting the following error for the translatetransform bindings

3181926
subtract	add
note you can t just add subtract hours due to daylight savings

3181928
mouse	keyboard
while it s certainly possible to implement controls using the keyboard i m also wondering if it s possible to make relative mouse movement work in html5

3181936
put	get
but when i take the exact same code and pull it from my previous work and put it into visual studio 2010 express i get a connection error

3181963
rss	feed
what are the best rss feed for programmers developers

3181977
iboutlet	ibaction
i am able to enter text to the textview and capture the value through an iboutlet and ibaction

3182084
punctuation	words
if you surround the words with them it will match only that words whether it s followed by or prefixed with a punctuation character or whitespace

3182139
folder	directory
what seems easiest is to just have a directory on my site in which there is a folder for every user

3182179
google-chrome	safari
regardless best what you can do as quick test is to try a different webbrowser msie8 google-chrome or safari and play surf the website

3182191
post	put
the visual studio project upgrade wizard takes care of most things but it did lose a few pre post build steps which we had to manually put back in place

3182274
short	base
it will certainly be easier in the short run but as you said will become a nightmare very quickly trying to maintain almost-identical code base

3182325
awt	swing
have a look at the awt swing event model in java for example

3182371
post	get
this post from the visual studio blog may also get you started with dealing with the in memory code file

3182486
int	chars
it s theoretically possible that an has a smaller sizeof than a for example if int has stricter alignment requirements than chars this could be a reasonable thing to do

3182505
iboutlet	ibaction
you then connect the ibaction to the button in interface builder and your iboutlet to your textfield

3182510
put	get
i think we are just trying to figure out why you need to put the php session id in your get request

3182510
put	get
there s no need to put it in your get request

3182532
equals	gethashcode
depending on your error class you may also need to override equals and gethashcode to use value semantics

3182542
googletest	gmock
i d like to have the files compiled into the test application i m using gmock + googletest

3182618
post	put
it s simple enough to manage post delete and put requests since these won t differ at all from a traditional approach

3182618
post	put
post delete and put are semantically incorrect for this sort of task

3182618
put	get
yet another alternative is just to prepare all the relevant data for each get query like you would in a regular non-ajax page and put it all together leaving figuring out what s significant new to the client possibly through a last-modified item in each json array

3182635
apache	lighttpd
finding out the list of files that the server is delivering to one specific client or all clients simultaneously would depend on both the web or ftp server software apache iis lighttpd etc. and the os linux windows mac os x server etc.

3182653
public	protected
now if you read the naming conventions in the msdn for c# you will notice that it states that properties are always preferred over public and protected fields

3182653
public	protected
i have even been told by some people that you should never use public or protected fields

3182653
public	protected
now i will agree i have yet to find a reason in which i need to have a public field but are protected fields really that bad

3182653
accessor	properties
why should i take the overhead of both creating the properties c# or accessor methods and the performance hit i would occur if i do this for every single field in an application i am sure that it would adds up at less a little especially in certain languages like php or certain applications with performance is critical like games

3182669
public	protected
properties i can think of two reasons for prefering properties in the public interface protected is also public in the sense that someone else than just your class can see it

3182669
getter	setter
if the getter setter is the usual one line piece of code that simply reads sets the value of a field then the jit should be able to inline the call so there is no performance overhad

3182669
public	protected
in fact this allows you to make for example set protected and get public very easily so this can be even more elegant than using fields

3182671
public	protected
public and or protected fields are bad because they can be manipulated from outside the declaring class without validation

3182673
hide	show
also one little trick i figured out is whenever you do these show hide style popover menus oftentimes you don t really get to much opportunity to clean up after all the dismissals

3182722
switching	screens
it will be very bad ui if you block the screens and don t switching to next image until it is fetched

3182724
equals	gethashcode
i ve read that in order to get caching and push performance when using an interceptor selector when using castle dynamic proxy that i need to override gettype gethashcode and equals

3182728
post	get
i can t post images inline till i get 10 points - sorry for link

3182749
uidatepicker	uipickerview
uidatepicker doesn t inherit from uipickerview so they don t have api

3182749
uidatepicker	uipickerview
however the documentation does state that uidatepicker manages a custom picker-view object as a subview which means you could traverse a uidatepicker s subviews until you found a uipickerview

3182809
cvs	svn
this question would apply to any version control system mercurial subversion svn cvs etc

3182839
hide	show
i want to create a view menuitem with a checkable menuitem for each of my dockablecontents that will show hide each item

3182840
opera	firefox
and although the element is removed the styles are still applied to the current page in both opera and firefox

3182877
ant	maven
we use gradle and chose it over maven and ant

3182877
ant	maven
ant gave us total flexibility and ivy gives better dependency management than maven but there isn t great support for multi-project builds

3182877
ant	maven
with gradle you can have the flexibility of ant and build by convention of maven

3182877
gradle	ivy
finally gradle uses ivy so it has excellent dependency management

3182897
hide	show
swing does not auto-dispose the frames windows in case you want to reuse them show hide multiple times

3182913
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
this has always worked perfectly until i wrote and called a c# dll that in turn called an openfiledialog and a savefiledialog

3182930
emacs	aquamacs
i m a newbie with emacs so be explicit i use aquamacs on mac os x 10.6 if that makes any difference

3182937
put	get
i kind of get that i have to insert it into the content resolver but do i have to just put the song id in or do i have to put all of the song s data in

3182940
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
if not then i think the best you can do is to start up your own thread in which you can control the apartment it runs in via coinitializeex null coinit_apartmentthreaded and then call openfiledialog savefiledialog from there

3182943
put	get
if i can get hibernate to put them into some kind of non-entity value object that d be great

bazaar	git
what are the relative strengths and weaknesses of git mercurial and bazaar

3183086
pull	push
every copy is created equal and they can push and pull using that terminology changes from each other on an ad-hoc basis

3183098
pull	push
you need not set up a server at all you can push pull changes through ssh or even email patches to each other this can be done directly from the vcs but is sort of a hassle

3183140
postgresql	mysql
i have used mongodb redis more than key-value pair supports list set and sorted set tokyo tyrant memcached and mysql postgresql

3183140
jobs	cron
if you use nosql take occasional backup or schedule cron jobs for db backup

3183152
min	max
i know the names of all fields their types int string date etc and maybe also min max

3183194
packets	multicast
send the udp packets to the multicast address for the group in use

3183194
packets	multicast
further info i have is that i may need to bind to several interfaces and tell the socket using setsockopt that it should also receive multicast packets

3183205
put	get
the other option is to put the tab name in the url hash the part that starts with a # instead of the actual url itself - so you d get something like this

3183280
super	extends	super	abstract
create child class that extends your new abstract class and call super in your constructor

3183313
ada	pascal
at first it looks like a simple limited-range integer type like you find in pascal and ada

3183350
filtering	grouping
i now want to add a email grouping link at the top along side the filtering drop down

3183350
filtering	grouping
for example if a filtering a is chosen and 2 people are displayed as having that tag the email grouping link should include the email address of those 2 people - pretty simple

3183357
ciimage	nsimage
i start by receiving a ciimage and eventually save an nsimage

3183373
width	height
in fact you can make a game simply by setting up one big canvas 100 width and height and then program your entire system in that javascript file ignoring the fact that you are on the web if you please

3183377
min	max	minimum	max
the tally at the bottom shows exactly 6 workers per day respecting the need to cover 3 shifts with 2 workers each the max and min columns on the right show that the maximum consecutive work and minimum consecutive rest requirements are respected

3183476
ant	maven
what are the pros and cons of using the ide s command-line interface to do a headless build as opposed to maintaining a build script that is completely independent of the ide using ant or maven in the case of a java project

3183476
maven	m2e
i ask this question because i am experimenting with maven and was a bit surprised to find that even when using the m2e plugin it s not really feasible to turn off eclipse s java builder and delegate the whole build process to maven while working on the project

3183481
put	get
if i understand this correctly you could simply put all this information in two tables user and friends because as far as i know it is a lot more efficient to get larger chunks of data with few queries than smaller chunks of data with many queries

3183492
ubuntu	linux
however one of the os s is ubuntu linux and from this post it looks like its not going to work

3183505
google-chrome	firefox
tested with firefox ie google-chrome

3183512
cashapelayer	calayer
the easiest way to mask a view to an arbitrary shape is to set the mask property of calayer to a new cashapelayer

3183548
queue	fifo
overall there are fifo fifo buffers also known as queue

3183548

3183759
maven	pom.xml
you can extend maven through the pom.xml and inject some additional mechanisms if you want to

3183759
maven	pom.xml
if you get a little more complex it s often most effective to start using multi-module pom.xml and maven setups to get functional tests integrated and running with the rest of the code

3183797

if you want to achieve the event firing mechanism with the arrow keys then you will have to use the keyup keydown event there is no other way as far as i know

i am developing a universal app in which each view displays a different image depending on whether the device is in portrait or landscape orientation

3183847

if the app is running on the device and a portrait view is rotated to landscape my image switching takes place

3183868
hash	salt
the passwords to the accounts are hash and salt but the rest can only be encrypted not hash to allow editing

free	malloc
although new might be implemented through malloc and delete might be implemented through free there s no guarantee that they are really implemented that way and also the user can overload new and delete at his discretion

3184129
free	malloc
other than that don t forget that when you call malloc you get raw memory - no constructor is invoked - and when you call free no destructor is invoked

3184155
qobject	qpointer

that is it looks like we cannot have a thread waiting in the put method as well as the get method because for that to be true then the following would have to be true

3186640
realloc	calloc
at the moment it s possible that there is some space after stringarray into which you are storing the wordlength-arraylength extra pointers when you calloc them and realloc doesn t move stringarray

for 1920x1080 the aspect ratio becomes 1.77 meaning that any image displayed at a specific pixel width and height will be a different size in inches due to the scaling effect of the aspect ratio

3187269
serializable	deserialization
so before saving to db all data collected during the process are kept in memory as model s properties using serializable deserialization

3187276
int	chars
main has two parameters int argc and chars argv which you can use to access to the command line parameters

3187276
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv ..

3187321
equals	gethashcode
are you remembering to override your equals and gethashcode

3187337
draggable	droppable
i have a list of tasks that are all draggable and droppable

3187337
move	drag
when i start dragging one task the other tasks don t light up as expected except when the mouse is not actually above the draggable helper this is possible because i have specified axis y so that i can move the cursor left and right of the helper without breaking the drag session

3187337
draggable	droppable
so why does having a draggable helper over a droppable target not trigger the over event while having the cursor over the droppable target does trigger that event

3187367
hide	show
why not create a disabled submit button that is hidden and an active submit button and onclick show the disabled and hide the active

3187378
children	parent
i need a solution for this how to intercept iset.add method so i don t need to do children.parent parent but jus parent.children.add children

3187416
children	parent
the save command saves any changes since the last save whether it be creation modification or deletion of parent children or a mix

3187416
children	parent
delete deletes whatever is currently selected â one or more parent one or more children or even selected text within an attribute text box contents

3187416
children	parent
you donâ t want them thinking theyâ re deleting a child when they are in fact deleting the parent along with all its children

3187416
children	parent
look at file managers such as windows explorer where the folders are the parent and the files are the children for other ideas for distinguishing active from selected

3187417
actionscript	mxml
the invalidate commitproperties model used by mxml components is very useful in my experience and i d like to be able to make use of it in domain model objects in my actionscript applications

3187466
actionscript	mxml
everytime i feel the need to use an interface i always wind up making an actionscript and not an mxml file because i don t know if how you can

3187496
virtualenv	yolk
when i use yolk from within a virtualenv i get the following

3187506
post	get
like danben says you need to post the error to get meaningful help

3187517
free	malloc
it s invalid to access the malloc d memory after you free it therefore it s invalid to try to print

3187524
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the solution below was tested on ie 8.0.6 firefox 3.6.6 opera 10.53 and safari 4 on an ms windows xp machine

3187528
free	malloc
when you are done with stringiwanttokeep you free it as though it was originally malloc d

3187532
clang	llvm
phoronix did some benchmarks about this but it is about a snapshot version of clang llvm from a few months back

3187566
actionscript	mxml
for the sake of completeness an mxml component can implement an interface just like an actionscript component ca

3187569
daemons	launchd
i cannot assume that the user building the application has installed the mongodb dameon as a service and therefore need to launchd the daemons prior to the execution of the related unit tests

3187569
folder	directory	daemons	launchd
my first thought was to store the binaries in the resources folder of the test directory src test resources and launchd the daemons using runtime.exec

3187579
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you supply this software to customers or even remote sites within your organization and the installation and upgrading happens in the field then it s reasonable that each new versioning of your software should upgrade the database by itself

3187628
actionscript	mxml
you are correct there is no way to implement a true interface using mxml edit i stand corrected you can use the implements keyword as described in the other answers. another approach to consider is to use a code behind actionscript file for each of your 4 mxml files

3187646
inherited	properties
first thing let s understand how static properties are inherited

3187646
superclass	subclassing
inherit_static_prop is called for each one of the superclass static properties so that can be copied to the subclassing

3187646
superclass	subclassing
the implementation of inherit_static_prop ensures that the static properties of the subclassing will be php references whether or not the zval of the parent is shared in particular if the superclass has a reference the child will share the zval if it doesn t the zval will be copied and new zval will be made a reference

3187646
superclass	subclassing
this is because the property will not be copied to the subclassing from the superclass if it s redeclared see the condition in inherit_static_prop

3187667
min	max
the thing is it is incredibly slow as it uses a while loop to figure out the min max based on approximated error

3187667
min	max
question my question is what is the best and most efficient method algorithm to finding the min max points on a curve using c# that is also very accurate

3187667
cos	sin
the curve is always in the shape of one segment of a sin cos curve but not always the same curve and will always be less that one period

3187701
min	max
i m unsure currently how many points are needed to precisely calculate what a would be which would give the min and max of the curve

3187720
decoder	encoder
here small example for using base64 encoder decoder

3187720
decoder	encoder
using base64 encoder decoder in appache commons is better

3187729
fseek	ftell
ftell and fseek are only going to work as byte offsets if you open the file in binary mode rb instead of r

3187729
fseek	ftell
otherwise you can only fseek to things that have previously be returned by ftell

3187734
cos	sin
edit if you know that the curve will always be shaped like a portion of sin cos curve then if you know the smallest period that might be represented you can do some optimizations by using binary search algorithm to look for the inflection points where the slope change in y to the left and to the right are of different signs

3187818
hash	md5
additionally you could create a one time hash using md5 or better sha256 that is generated by the php script and stored in a database in relation to the file

3187901
post	get
i am stuck with my rails application where i use jquery to post get ajax requests and i have this following error found by using firebug

3187909

3187912
explode	implode
1. explode on php side implode js routine in your page

3187919
packets	multicast
and i can t even capture my multicast packets

3187929
mechanize	hpricot
there are certain gems he just can t use properly or at all json gitjour mechanize hpricot which means there are features to which he can t contribute

3187969
uisearchbar	uisegmentedcontrol
usually uisearchbar covers left half of uitoolbar so that only uisegmentedcontrol is visible.

3188058
multiplying	transpose
my idea is to arrange the array in 3x5 matrix and multiplying by its transpose which is 5x3

3188058
multiplying	transpose
and multiplying by its transpose i am not sure how to do that and the result will be 3x3 matrix that corresponded to docno by docno

3188059
apk	dex
i tried passing the apk file and also the dex file inside the apx but proguard doesn t accept them as an input

3188060
freebsd	linux
for example on linux and freebsd it is possible to compile a kernel which doesn t support multicast

3188114
moq	moles
i have used moq before and i have read that some people use both moles and insert other mocking framework in tandem but i was thinking it would be more convenient to stick with just one

3188130
draggable	droppable
what i want to do is trigger the drop event handler on the droppable without actually dragging and dropping the draggable

3188147
nsurl	nsdata
and a second question does it make sense to use the strings nsurl and nsdata as i did

3188166
mouseover	mouseout
i m wondering how i can make a flash start playing a video on mouseover and stop playing on mouseout

3188205
sharepoint	splist
the reason is that spweb.getlist is getting one splist object from sharepoint

3188251
postgresql	mysql
wide database support oracle ms sql firebird mysql postgresql sysbase

3188263
ada	pascal
my own guess is that it s mostly because the languages that have included coroutines concurrent pascal concurrent c which actually supported the c++ of the time and ada tasks are sort of similar as well have never become particularly popular

3188333
google-chrome	firefox
with all this code it works perfectly fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie it doesn t do anything

3188391
textarea	textbox
the multi-line textbox renders as an html textarea element and the value of a textarea respects line breaks

3188423
put	get
i can make a uiview do some of these things and animate the with a block but i get confused about where to put the pieces of code

3188442
pop-up	dialog
when they hit the button in excel it should be the same as hitting another button in my winforms app which pop-up a dialog box

3188504
java.util.date	simpledateformat
simpledateformat can convert strings to java.util.date objects

3188507
width	height
doing that you should be able to get some sort of height width offset value from the contents and adjust the size of the iframe appropriately

3188558
innodb	myisam
another way is to switch from myisam to innodb

3188563
webrat	cucumber
but for tests i have found several episodes some using rails unit test classes others use cucumber rspec zentest autotests webrat selenium etc

3188584
qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel
one would be to start with an authoritative model subclassed from qabstractitemmodel link it to a subclass of qabstractitemview and from there generate and update qgraphicsitems in the scene

3188584
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
the other way i can think to do it is to treat the qgraphicsscene as the authoritative data source storing the data object in each qgraphicsitem s .data property

3188584
qgraphicsscene	qabstractitemmodel
so which approach would you choose qabstractitemmodel authoritative - qabstractitemview- qgraphicsscene or alternatively qgraphicsscene authoritative - qabstractitemmodel- other views

3188591
glut	sdl
if you want to stay away from objective-c cocoa and glut you can try sdl which is a cross platform gaming library windows 2d graphics sound input etc.

3188605
redhat	fedora
redhat fedora centos

3188615
jar	war
afaik there is no way to set file permissions within a war jar this is however possible when using the maven assembly plugin to create a binary distribution archive of your project but this is another story

3188716
free	malloc	free	memcpy	memcpy	malloc
looking at the dependencies it is requiring some basic functions like memcpy free malloc though i thought those were standard c runtime functions

3188725
fast-forward	merge
and a merge from master to saved_feature won t be trivial either certainly not a fast-forward one

3188790
entity-relationship	diagram
i have a small preference of continuing to use a database such as mysql because i spent some time designing the entity-relationship diagram and schema but if i have to store in a flat file i can do that too

3188825
serializable	deserialization
from this i would use the xml serializable and deserialization to read and write the file except that this isn t going to a file i need to encrypt it and store it in the registry

3188842
websphere	ibm
for operations i use use the linear log rotation ibm websphere mq supportpac

3188848
min	max
min max std max std min std partition std min_element std max_element

3188893
queue	fifo
to solve the problem of pushing up lots of updates i d suggest creating a queue fifo that you add your updates to

3188912
disk	ram
i have a wpf monitor widget that displays cpu ram and disk performance as small percentage bars

3188934
range	max	range	min	min	max
if max and min are independent variables the extra subtraction for max-min will waste time but if that expression can be precomputed at compile time or if it can be computed once at run-time to test many numbers against the same range the above expression may be computed efficiently even in the case where the value is within range if a large fraction of values will be below the valid range it may be faster to use because it will exit early if value is less than min

3188943
google-chrome	firefox
i would use firefox or google-chrome but the application i am testing is only compatible with ie

3188946
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you have control of the client you can use pretty much any other browser firefox safari google-chrome opera ... or wait for ie9

3189003
google-chrome	firefox
atleast firefox ie google-chrome would be good

3189026
google-chrome	safari
though he mentions on his compatibility that safari and google-chrome do not expose this functionality in their api

3189027
int	double
my question is can i check whether a variable string or int double type or an array string or int double type is initialized in c#

reformat a harddisk and install ubuntu boot from a flash disk run as a vm through virtual box or the like there are many ways to run linux in your situation and it will be an easier development solution for you

3189116
caliburn	prism	mef	caliburn	mef	prism
i have read quite a few posts on so and around the web of the benefits and features of various wpf frameworks caliburn prism and module frameworks mef unity and combining them

3189159
google-chrome	firefox
finally to try debugging your problem use a tool like firebug for google-chrome firefox to ensure you re submitting post data as expected

3189180
uiview	calayer
the best solution i could come up with so far was to overlay the calayer on top of the uiview and capture the current view state using

3189205
prerequisites	uninstaller
well wouldn t you know management has got it in their head that everything including prerequisites but not .net that s installed by the application must now be uninstaller by the uninstaller

3189212
regasm	gacutil
to set up the dll to be used on my developer machine i use regasm and gacutil like so

3189212
regasm	gacutil
note this script is intended only for my developer machine where regasm and gacutil are both readily available

3189283
integer	unsigned
for example i have this one 64-bit unsigned integer as follows

3189341
hide	show
when one of those links is clicked i d like to hide the div with the link that was clicked and show another div

3189353
emacs	aquamacs
however i m not sure how or if hi-lock-mode and font-lock mode work together - it might be that this won t work for a highlighted source file and i don t have a copy of emacs on this machine in order to determine the whether this works and i don t use aquamacs at all but this should at least give you something to try

3189377
int	boolean
you also have a method int.tryparse which populates a supplied by-reference argument with the int value and returns a boolean status code

3189413
post	get
ayende has a good post about get vs

3189418
versioning	upgrade
the great news is that if you have expression studio 3 then studio 4 is a free upgrade but whether or not blend is included will depend on what versioning you had previously

3189421
i2c	spi
it packs a 1 ghz cpu i2c spi for extra peripherals pwm for servos a d for your accelerometer and sharp ir rangefingers usb host signals for your cheapo webcams and a mini-pci slot to fit your wlan card into

hide	show
create the two visual states you want and use something like width 0 to hide the listbox or grid that you don t want to show in the given state

3189478
google-chrome	firefox
you can use addeventlistener in firefox google-chrome etc

3189479
rss	feed
if the site offers an rss feed you should try that

3189479
rss	feed
if the site does not offer an rss feed or if the rss feed doesn t include the information you re looking for then you have to scrape and compare

3189548
google-chrome	firefox
the code works on firefox google-chrome ie6 and ie7

3189556
width	height
make sure that that border is not coming from the image itself background of the image set the accurate width and height also try setting the padding to 0 like slaks said

3189578
x86	64bit
initially we added the dependency from the location in program files xxx but ran into build problems on 64bit machines where that same dependency was in the program files x86 xxx folder even though vs is smart enough to handle this problem when picking up references

3189580
versioning	upgrade
once we upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery i started getting javascript errors as follows

3189581

3-tier	n-tier
i m fairly new to the whole n-tier architecture thing and i had some questions about using mvvm with a 3-tier application

3189721
submit	submission
ok not sure how much this will help but try removing the submit input and submission the form via javascript

3189750
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable.getenumerator can call the same underlying code as ienumerable it s just not as strongly typed returns object instead of a strongly typed ienumerator

3189763
aggregate-functions	sum
anyone know how the google example in the link was able to maintain the null values even through the aggregate-functions sum

3189819
ienumerable	ienumerator
however if you want to the ienumerable getenumerator method is the one that will return an ienumerator object to a client calling foreach this ienumerator object is the object that keeps track of which element in the collection is the next one one to be returned when the foreach iterates

3189820
free	malloc
with 2-dimensional matrixes using malloc and then free or would you use 1-dimensional matrixes with both malloc and free

3189834
innodb	myisam
during the analysis the table is locked with a read lock for myisam bdb and innodb

3189836
width	height
i have to set the attributes width and height for a canvas element depending on the available screen resolution

3189861
ienumerable	iequalitycomparer	ienumerable	icomparer	icomparer	iequalitycomparer
i happened to have seen some code where this guy passed a lambda expression to a arraylist.sort icomparer here or a ienumerable.sequenceequal ienumerable list iequalitycomparer here where an icomparer or an iequalitycomparer was expected

3189865
post	put
put s and post s can use an xml payload to better represent the underlying data structure and prevent long confusing query strings

3189886
hide	show
i have a datagrid in which i would like to show the details when a row is clicked and hide it when the user clicks again

3189895
maven	cargo
try the maven cargo plugin

3189898
maven	cobertura
unfortunately the logic called has a not compatible license and i have to fork a separate process as it is done for cobertura maven plugin

3189913
fgets	fgetc
actually i find many reading functions fgetc fgets etc.

put	get
how do i get rid of the brackets and put them in some form of an array so another function can access it

3189969
lxml	elementtree
if lxml is not available you can alternatively use the elementtree api in the standard library

3189974
qgraphicsscene	qabstractitemmodel
qabstractitemmodel authoritative - qabstractitemview- qgraphicsscene

3189974
qgraphicsscene	qabstractitemview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicsscene	qhash	qabstractitemview	qgraphicsitem	qhash	qabstractitemview
my best advice would be to store a qhash of qpersistantmodelindex to qgraphicsitem and a qgraphicsscene in the qabstractitemview you create

3189978
bcel	cglib
if you want to create a class and write it back to disk bcel and cglib is good

3189979
put	get
so i looked in the client classes to sort out if i could get the request url and put all the parts needed for request signing in myself

3189986
multiplication	dot-product
adding two vectors makes sense - it s pretty unambiguous although multiplication of vectors isn t do you mean per-element dot-product or cross-product

3189986
division	addition
the problem is when people just learn this and start overloading addition for database records or division for strings - to have their own meaning

3190000
pop-up	dialog
that is when the code-completion dialog pop-up eclipse crashes when i try to

3190010
put	get
i ve put the test app up on github but just can t get the client-side storage working

3190027
post	get
having the classic post table and comments table with foreign key to post table scenario what s the most efficient way to get the ids of the last 20 post ordered by the time of their last comment and the actual comment itself

3190042
public	protected
also the event should be marked as protected public

3190080
opera	firefox
both opera and firefox offer a possibility to add a site to bookmarks that will be opened in the sidebar and that is a huge difference

3190080
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome also don t expose any api for this task

3190089
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
not sure if you re tied to the repeater at this point but a gridview or listview could be worth looking into

3190133
listadapter	listactivity
you can always use getcontext on the view to get a reference to the containing activity which you can cast to a listactivity assuming you re using that and call the usual methods to get the data at that position in the listadapter

3190139
google-chrome	firefox
i advise non-techies to stay away from it and to use firefox or google-chrome

3190141
subnet	packets
what sql enumeration does it broadcasts an udp packets port 1434 on the entire lan segment subnet mask

3190173
x86	64bit
32 bit instruction set of x86 can be used for 64bit arithmetic see extended precision multiplication

3190175
subtract	add
they use the carry bit for add and subtract

3190175
subtract	addition	subtract	add	subtraction	addition	subtraction	add
the assembler ops for add with carry and subtract with carry or borrow can be used for arbitrary bit length extended precision addition and subtraction

3190175
16-bit	64bit	multiplying	add
for multiplying if you only have a 32-bit result from multiplying you can break it into 16-bit value pairs and multiplying and then shift and add with carry to get a full 64bit result from 32-bit multiplying

3190175
16-bit	64bit
fwiw the intel 32-bit asm mul instruction can put a 64bit result in edx eax so you can actually do multiplies in 32-bit chunks with 64bit values to add rather than 16-bit chunks with 32-bit values to shift and add

3190194
octal	decimal
that s because a leading 0 means that the constant is octal base 8 instead of decimal base 10

3190203
hash	md5
i have a legacy schema that contains tables with composite keys where some of the keys are of type binary 16 -- its a md5 hash of the other columns

filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
i am wondering if it is possible to compile a list of deleted files on a windows filesystems fat or ntfs

3190239
pop-up	dialog
if you create the same dialog as a modal pop-up dialog then you should get the behaviour you have described

3190371
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in google-chrome for osx windows and interestingly enough safari 3

3190396
superclass	subclassing
in which case yes you can define a clean method on the subclassing that cleans fields defined on the superclass

3190429
typedef	struct
for struct and unions the second form maybe combined with the typedef in one declaration is needed for recursive types

3190507
maven	cargo
both the tomcat maven plugin and the maven2 cargo plugin support remote tomcat deployments assuming the manager application is available

3190511
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is working for me under google-chrome safari firefox opera and ie 6-8

3190541
google-chrome	firefox
this runs fast on firefox and google-chrome but the find method takes a long time to execute in ie8 and ie7

3190592
public	protected
...call up from c++ to java when wrapping c++ virtual methods. the ...call up... leads me to believe you re calling protected or public members of an inherited interface and ...when wrapping c++ virtual methods leads me to conclude you can only do so when you re overriding an inherited interface

3190630
implements	extends
this forces aspectj to use cglib for doing aspects instead of dynamic proxies - cglib doesn t lose the annotation since it extends the class whereas dynamic proxies just expose the implements interface

3190654
min	max
the standard sql group by clause must include all columns specified in the select clause that are not wrapped in aggregate functions like count max min etc to be specified in the group by clause

3190662
openssl	crypto++
although not nearly as easy to use as crypto++ openssl has support for pkcs#7 based standards

3190679
folder	dir
.ssh folder appeared in current working dir and rsync stopped annoying with rsa fingerprints

3190681
typedef	struct
for example one could have a header file define a type userconsole using typedef struct _userconsole userconsole

3190684
superclass	subclassing
in this case nsarray is the public superclass and there are private subclassing that are the actual array implementations

3190684
many-to-many	one-to-many
as to answer your question i ve found that when i have this sort of set up where i need to maintain one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many relationships automatically there s nothing that beats using coredata

3190697
realloc	malloc
you should use realloc instead of malloc when reallocating

3190701
button	checkbox
the main window contains a notebook with three tabs each tab having a random ui element a button a calendar and a checkbox

3190720
min	max
7 6 4 00 pm another idea i thought about was comparing all the points before a min max point

hash	md5
i think it will solve the extra empty spaces problems and then generate md5 hash or compare them or some other way you like

3195570

the problem why you are using a dictionary is cause you want to explicitly tell what the key is the regnum property of your car but you could also use a if your car object would correctly implement equals and gethashcode but this is a little more complex than you might think

folder	directory
the cgi script will be inside cgi-bin directory and the php function will be outside this folder

free	malloc
the substrings stored in for i other than 0 1 and 5 were allocated inside the substr function with malloc so you can and should deallocate them with free

3196616
free	malloc
similarly each temp_struct element was allocated with malloc and so can and should be deallocated with free

3196651
free	malloc
yes given that your substr is allocating the memory for the substring with malloc it s reasonable necessary really to free that memory when you re done with it

3196664
free	malloc
so if you want to have your code set up this way such that prod can point to either dynamic memory that you got from malloc or to a constant string literal you need to also keep track of which one it is and only free the dynamic memory

3198385
hide	show
i need to show hide multiple elements with the same name when another element is clicked like

3198414
nsscanner	nsstring
if you are intent on parsing the nsstring take a look a nsscanner otherwise check out parsing using the nsxmldocument

3198416
hide	show
on page load first add an event to all the elements with that name to toggle hide show

3198429
swt	swing
debate over the merits of swing and swt is irrelevant

3198500
folder	directory
i noticed my iron python home directory does not even have a scripts folder

3198525
hide	show
hide the div s and show them with javascript when onload fires

3198538
int	double
for example suppose i have a list double from which i want to remove all items where the int part is even

3198538
int	double
i already have a function double int that gives me the int part and a predicate int that tells me if it is even

3198542
getter	setter
when your code point to a field and you change it to point to a property of the same name the c# itself doesn t change but the resulting il does - it generates a method call to the getter or setter as appropriate

3198560
put	get
if i put the following section in i can get to the login screen but will always be sent back to it even after i login and can never see any other pages

3198584
pull	push
what you re describing can easily be handled by a multiple repository scenario in which lesser developers push to a development repository and the senior developers pull changes from that merge test etc.

3198585
matplotlib	scipy
as far as other languages go i d check out numpy and scipy in combination with matplotlib matplotlib.sf.net

3198598
codeigniter	kohana
in my spare time i ve coded in codeigniter and dabbled a bit in kohana

3198697
hide	show
essentially this is just a show hide that is applied to multiple elements on a page all using the same template and naming conventions

3198702
int	chars
the function needs to be able to handle different kinds of types of variables like chars int and longs

3198740
width	height
if you do know the size of front somehow then you can pretty safely assume up front that width height 4 550 mb is not going to work in a 32-bit program

3198741
mouseover	mouseout
in this case even though .homelink .poptext is returning a collection of objects each one is individually associated with a mouseover and mouseout handler by hover

3198743
getter	setter
addition i actually have the binding partially there the property getter gets called and the property setter gets called once when the combobox is first loaded selected and never called again upon later selection changes

3198770
width	height
have you tried setting the img tag height width

3198782
viewdidload	viewdidappear
try using the method viewdidappear shown below instead of viewdidload

it is only idea actually datagrid uses icollectionview interface to implement sorting as described in at grouping sorting and filtering section

3198909
ant	maven
after that trigger a script or maven goal or ant task that does the unzipping etc

3198944
google-chrome	firefox
these features in sharepoint only work in ie so i dont want to open up firefox or google-chrome if that is the default browser

3198970

3199043
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups for screens mockups

3199052
width	height
test the width or height of the splitter to see if your treeview is hidden

3199059
gridview	detailsview
disclaimer i ve used this on a gridview not a detailsview but the concept is the same

3199085
integer	unsigned	integer	radix
in your example 32 bit unsigned integer keys which strongly cluster are assigned sequentially you can use radix based approach

3199090
for-loop	loops
you just break out of for-loop -- not while loops

3199092
for-loop	loops
you break out of the for-loop only so you never leave the while loops and restart iterating over the proxylist over and over again

3199094
for-loop	loops
break is breaking the innermost loops which is the for-loop in your case

3199118
firefox	safari
this time the alert does not fire at least in firefox and safari

basically i have a datalist with a bunch of stuff in it and when you mouseover items in the datalist i want jquery to hide show stuff

3199130
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
the problem is that after i databind my gridview repeater datalist jquery quits working if the gridview repeater datalist is in an update panel

3199133
post	get
keep in mind that my solution will work if the web site is using post or get but some sites use javascript

3199137
getter	setter
i would have an array or vector in one of files with a getter and setter

3199143
put	get
however its breaking a rule because a get request to this same resource will not return the equivalent of what the client just put but would rather return all people objects since there would be no filters on the query

3199143
post	put
while i hesitated to use post because it seems to be the least-common-denominator catch-all for restful operations and more can be said about this operation specifically that it is idempotent put cannot be used because its requirements are too narrow

3199143
put	get
in addition to the accepted answer darrel miller had an excellent suggestion if the operation absolutely had to be a put and that was to append a uuid onto the end of the resource path so an equivalent get request will return the equivalent resource

3199166
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
i would need to understand the basics of addition subtraction multiplication division and remainder

3199166
integer	radix
i know that a fixed point can be made by separating a 4 byte integer by a signal flag a radix and a mantissa

3199176
viewdidload	viewdidappear
maybe you invoke viewdidappear in viewdidload or some other stuff is going on there since it s invoked only once during loading the view from the memory

3199217
superclass	subclassing
is not of type a but an anonymous subclassing of a which is not a superclass of b

3199330
nstextview	nsimage

it requires a bit of work to get your program to work well with message passing but the end result is that you can easily launchd your executable across a cluster of machines that are running a mpi daemons

3199526
children	parent
i have a page where i am trying to add children to a parent object

3199545
width	height
if you don t set width and height then the window will get a default size from the os

3199555
post	get
note when automatically redirecting a post request after receiving a 301 status code some existing http 1.0 user agents will erroneously change it into a get request

3199577
hash	salt
i have a field hashedx that is a hash salt value and the salt is saved in the same row in the mysql database as is common practice

3199577
hash	salt
so typically i would take my input hash salt it and compare it to the values of hashedx

3199577
hash	salt
i could go through the database rows one by one try that salt on my input then check if the input as hash salt with this salt matches hashedx of that same row

3199577
hash	salt
is there a better way to do this than selecting all rows looping through them using that row s salt to hash input then comparing again to the hash value in the db

3199640
post	get
is there a way without using a server proxy to perform a cross domain get or post request

3199654
min	max
the group by clause is where you define grouping but sql standard is that if you specify columns in the select clause without being wrapped in aggregate functions ie count max min etc then those columns need to be specified in the group by

3199691
width	height
it seems like it s always one step behind the first load it can t tell what the width height is of the file being loaded then on a subsequent load of the same file it s positioned perfectly

3199711
squash	merge
if you want to push a number of local commits as a single commit you can squash those commits with git merge or git rebase -i interactive

3199719
hash	md5
mysql supports md5 and sha1 hash algorithms as builtin functions

3199720
width	height
after zooming twice the canvas only uses a fraction of the available canvas height width even though i m adjusting for the zoom level

3199720
width	height
if i were to multiply the height width by 2 when drawing the grid for the last time it ll draw out the entire canvas size but i can t figure out why that would be required

3199720
width	height
is there a way to query a canvas context to find out what the scale value or the calculated height width is

3199724
post	get
i rather wish they d bring back a way to define get post at least together

3199727
addition	multiplication
so far i ve got addition and multiplication done using any-length arrays of bytes so each byte is like a base-256 digit

3199727
division	modulo
i m just trying to get started on implementing division modulo and i want to know where to start

3199735
terminate	timeout
i m thinking that the best solution if possible is a timeout on the getline but in the event that it s not possible or a good option i m open to any option which will allow the thread to terminate neatly

3199781
put	get
n.b if you are worried about the screen jerk when the dialog resizes then you could put the ajax response into a div that is positioned off screen then get the dimensions then nicely animate the resize of the dialog whilst fading in the new content

3199786
min	max
i m not sure if i remember this right but i seem to recall that mixing manual min max settings with bound value or vice-versa can cause this

3199805
pull	push
also is it good to clone 2 or 3 repos from the central repo to our hard drives so if we are working on a feature using local repo 1 and need to make a quick bug fix then we can go to local repo 2 do an hg pull hg up and make the bug fix and hg push and be done with the bug fix without affecting local repo 1

3199827
post	put
use ajax to post the data to your php file echo the html for the new dropdown back to the javascript and then use jquery to put in the new contents

3199870
inherited	properties
dtob is inherited from dtoa and thus should include all the properties from dtoa

3199874
irc	torrent
i plan on only offering site wide licenses so i just need to detect the evil little bit torrent irc people

3199880
gwt	cssresource
i have already tried replacing interface style extends cssresource with interface style extends defines hoping that inheriting from the defines stylesheet would give me access to the constants in the child style stylesheet but then the gwt compiler complains with errors like

3199893
bash	zsh
for other shells that share common syntax with bash for example sh zsh ksh i d like to report a warning

3199907
inherited	properties

javassript is active on safari or firefox but it haven t do on these

3199975
firefox	safari
to help you debug both safari and firefox has javascript error output logs

3200003
put	get
note that you will actually have to put the uiwebview in an uiscrollview in order to get the scrolling support

3200024
google-chrome	firefox
this works for firefox and google-chrome but i m just presented with a blank screen in internet explorer

3200027
scrollable	panels
put the items in a scrollable panels instead of right on the form

3200027
min	max
set form s min max size - to allow reasonable sizing allow any height 100

3200033
processors	hyperthreading
additionally - how should i interpret processors utilization percentages from top when hyperthreading is enabled

3200037
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython ironruby console requires powerconsole

3200060
udp	tcp
if you want such boundaries you need to either implement yourself using an application-layer protocol within the tcp stream or use a datagram-oriented protocol like udp

3200065
google-chrome	firefox
it s working on firefox and google-chrome but on internet explorer it only works in some ways

3200065
pop-up	dialog
shows a pop-up blocked dialog in ie8

3200065
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox and google-chrome the parent frame is modified from no hash to #xdm-success to #handshake-complete

3200066
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
if you use bufferedreader and bufferedwriter there is no advantage to reading and processing 100 lines at a time

3200136
stdout	stderr
and yes the screen output is a stream or file handle but that s generally only because stdout cout and stderr cerr are connected to your screen by default

3200149
stdout	stderr
but there are actually two streams that write to the screen by default stdout cout is for normal output and stderr cerr is for error messages

3200155
post	get
you get the post from the database etc

3200162
fflush	gets
when your program s output is being redirected such as to a file or to the input of another program like in this case then it only gets fflush periodically when the output buffer usually 4â 64 kb or so fills up

3200162
stdout	fflush
to fflush stdout just call fflush 3

3200162
fflush	gets
note that when the output is going to a terminal if you just ran your program normally then by default it is line-buffered every time you print a newline the output gets fflush

3200172
post	put
the fundamental difference between the post and put requests is reflected in the different meaning of the request-uri

3200172
post	put
just be cause put is required to be idempotent and post is not does not mean that post cannot be idempotent

3200177
pull	push
remote-master -- clone pull -- local-never-modified-clone -- clone pull -- local-modified-clones -- push -- remote-master

3200186
hash	salt
it s not critical that it remains private however hence the extra effort to hash and salt etc it is not really neccessary

3200218
nunit	moles
all i have is done have installed the moles installer and i am using vs2008 with nunit

3200235
post	get
if i get time i ll post what i did

3200252
folder	dir
i want to list the current folder in the same dir and display it to the user asking them to enter a number to select the correct folder

3200266
google-chrome	firefox
moreover in firefox and google-chrome setting list-style-type to none in conjunction appears to be ignored

3200305
width	height
if the square is rectangle width height

3200307
min	max
even better if the max and min dimension of the smaller rectangles can be controlled by a parameter

3200314
inherited	properties
card has a few integer properties on top of the inherited uiview ones and deck has an nsmutablearray for holding some cards

3200370
range	max	range	min	min	max
when i get a point gps coordinate and a range calculate the max and min lat and long values to query for and then sort based on a distance function within these to order

3200431
width	height
don t do this for cells which have already been traversed and the merged structure should have a width and height so that expanding a 2x1-cell grid will expand to 2x2 or 3x1 to ensure you constantly keep a 4-sided rectangle shape for the merged node

3200431
min	max	width	height
if you want a fancier approach you can approach this like a kd-tree and build it top-down but you d need to be merging whole sub-trees as you re splitting based on random conditions and the min max width height parameter

3200470
pop-up	dialog
but what i would like to do is call this form from vba and instead of having the input dialog pop-up go ahead and tell the form what id is so the dialog never pop-up and the form opens just as if id where replaced by a value in the query

3200487
post	put	post	get	put	get
post indicates a generic action other than get put and delete the generic hashtable actions

3200489
portrait	landscape
in portrait all works fine in landscape it s fscked

3200557
width	height
also i need that every li conatins some fixed width and height and the image centered and alignet to top

3200570
getter	setter
each class would support delete and save and have getter and setter for specific aspects of the resource

3200598
post	put
in my case my model is always built from scratch so this was necessary to trick rails into treating it as an existing object and thus doing a put rather than a post

3200607
put	get
i also like to use setuptools automatic script creation so that my console scripts get put wherever they should be usr bin for example and are named appropriately automatically

3200627
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to upload files and i have it working in firefox google-chrome webkit but safari 5 doesn t have filereader

3200633
min	max
this will give you the point s of min max

3200638
innodb	myisam
in order to create a foreign key between two tables with mysql both tables need to be innodb tables with the default myisam table type you can define a foreign key but they do not actually do anything

3200661
hex	binary
in binary it s 0b 11111111 11111111 10000000 00000000 or 0xffffffff80000000 in hex

3200675
getter	setter
hiding the field behind a property getter setter allows you to perform additional actions like triggering when the value changes updating other internal state or changing the implementation entirely so it s just a wrapping call to a child object

3200680
for-loop	loops
the for-loop could perhaps be written better too in terms of begin and end or dernier instead of loops variable i

3200689
abc	isinstance
the fact that checking with isinstance the membership in a concrete type is not so good while checking the membership in an abc is more often useful lies in a principle that the gang of 4 expressed clearly and intensely in the first part of their wonderful book design patterns in a mostly c++ context but it really applies much more widely than that

3200689
abc	isinstance	abc	subclassing
with an abc you re basically checking an interface so many issues just aren t big problems any more abcs are more than just interfaces -- they can also offer implementation help to their concrete subclassing -- but when we re talking about isinstance thinking of them as interfaces is probably the most helpful stance

3200733
accessor	properties
if it is a dependency properties then as dk observes binding will update the properties value by calling setvalue and will bypass the clr properties accessor

3200767
unix	aix
if you are on linux some variant of unix aix try using ldd

3200783
implements	modifiers
as interface does not has an access modifiers if you still want your method private in the class which is implements that interface you can implements that interface explicitly

3200835
for-loop	loops
you need to do this either in a subroutine or a for-loop as the following syntax is specific to loops variables or parameters

3200836
folder	directory
to avoid over-writing your customized theme when an upgrade comes out you could save the customized one to a different folder in the themes directory with a different name like twenty ten customized

3200838
submit	submission
when enter key is pressed the cancel button submit the form instead of the save button submission the form

3200851
submit	submission
first make sure that you aren t submission your form using an actual submit button

3200854
ubuntu	linux
is this script not compatible with linux ubuntu 9 because on other windows xp pc this data can show

3200874
put	get
the windows cmd.exe batch language is horrible but you should be able to put this in a batch file and get it working

3200885
gif	png
xna by default knows what to do with png gif and jp e g image types

3200925
firefox	safari
when we popup a browser window with the sharing url that uses prompt_feed.php it causes safari and in some cases also firefox to resize themselves to strange dimensions

3200963
free	malloc
you could possibly implement your own allocator using malloc free to get around this problem

3200972
boost	stl
it is possible to solve this without doing so and still use stl boost algorithms

3200988
google-chrome	firefox
what happens when i click exporttopdf button in firefox it opens the save as dialogbox but google-chrome and ie just opens the pdf file in browser the save as doesn t seem to open it.

3201009
backgrounding	multitasking
unfortunately you can t fetch data in the backgrounding periodically with the current multitasking apis if you were interested in doing so

3201124
executable	upx
use upx - compress or expand executable files

3201151
kerberos	ldap
if i were doing this which i actually have at several points in the past i would use a combination of kerberos and ldap

3201220
width	height
note i know i could use width and height attributes with object tag but the users who will be inserting flash animations into html won t know their dimensions so they won t be able to insert these parameters

3201230
width	height
does anyone here know why the original size of the img matters for dimensioning the width it does not affect the height

3201259
width	height
so i go height 50 say and width auto to maintain ar

3201273
implements	extends

returns the largest closest to positive infinity double value that is less than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical int

3201322
int	double
or if you need to manipulate int not double then simply assign to int

3201346
int	double
casting to int removes decimals in case value is a double

3201356
setinterval	settimeout
i tried the old methods like settimeout or setinterval but not working not found any web references as well anyone know

3201366
width	height
if you specify the image s width or height as a percentage that percentage is calculated in proportion to the size of the parent block

3201366
width	height
thus there will always be extra space around the image as long as you specify the width or height as a percentage

3201395
width	height
this will produce a new image with the specified width and height integers

3201408
int	double
the expression is first evaluated as int and only the result is cast to a double value

3201409
xfs	ntfs
any file-system-dependent mode of storing metadata is out as i need to support ntfs xfs and ext3

3201418

3201791
midi	osc
i know a little bit about midi but i ve recently heard about osc

3201791
midi	osc
obviously midi is supported by almost all dj software applications but does osc have a critical advantage that makes it compelling

3201791
midi	osc
if i m forced to go through a server application installed on the host machine i ve read about bonjour and tcp sockets to communicate between ios and my host proxy but how can my host proxy send midi or osc signals to dj applications

dtb s answer is an even better way actually it has to copy the data as well no gain there but i just wanted to point out that to extract ushort values from a byte array you should be using bitconverter not binaryreader

3206560
getter	setter
how should conditions exceptions thrown in getter setter like this be handled

3206560
getter	setter
catching all exceptions in the getter setter and quietly handling them also sounds like a bad idea since the caller will not know the getter setter failed

3206583
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to run a webstart demo which ran on my friend s windows machine but throws an access error on my ubuntu linux box

3206639

it sounds like you might be getting tcp and udp mixed up

3206644
udp	tcp
i made a udp tcp package in java that has a specific bytes for example 8192 bytes

3206648
disk	ram
technical because you have to balance several different components including disk ram and cpu and it s not always easy to know where your bottlenecks are

3206656
hide	show
you could do it with ajax - multiple divs and hide show the appropriate ones

3206657
post	get
chromatic has a great post on how to even get a newer and multiple version s of perl onto a restricted system

3206658
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
adding clear left clear right or clear both to an element would create an extra carriage return in firefox but not in google-chrome and safari it is very frustrating anyone know how to fix this

3206678
multiplying	add
divide rand by the maximum random numer multiplying it by the range and add the starting number

3206679
width	height
the other basic concept is using jquery s animate function that can make you animate the change in width and height

3206681
put	get
i put the cfx jars in maven dependencies and installed the eclipse plugin but this deoesnt get you any closer to actually running a webservice with out the mystery configuration glue

3206695
range	minimum
incidentally if you are using doubles then the minimum for a range should be the maximum of the lower range not the maximum plus one

3206697
bazaar	git
you could import into a local temporary git repository and then import into bazaar from there

3206714

folder	directory
is there a way through xcode to define a library caches folder that will copy into the library caches folder found in the application home directory on the iphone - so i can build them in at build time

3206735
google-chrome	firefox
the practice solution that works perfectly in ie google-chrome and firefox looks like this

3206742
jar	war
btw - you don t need groovy or groovy_home with grails - it comes with the version of the groovy jar that it works with and that gets deployed in your war

3206778
min	max
looking at flotila source i bet that xaxis min max options are not converted correctly

3206819
width	height
the div is 200x100 you position it 50 from the top and 50 from the left but to have it centered fully you need to substract from that 50 values the half of the width and height the way to do this is to use negative margins hence margin-top should be the negative value of the height 2 and margin-left should be the negative value of the width 2

3206826
cassini	iis
i generally avoid using cassini and configure my projects to use iis 7 instead

3206885
width	margin
div.centerbox-outer is 100 width so putting margin 0 auto

3206901
operands	decrement
anytime you see an operands like 3 5 etc you check the top tuple of the count stack and decrement the number of operands left to be seen in that tuple

3206901
operands	decrement
this new operands push causes you to take another look at the top of the count stack and you do the same thing we just did decrement the operands seen compare with zero etc

3206904
maven	pom.xml
even if those tools can be more java-oriented nexus can store anything and maven is only there to read the pom.xml of each artifact and compute the right dependencies

3206912
hide	show
i have a page with a logical edit section which i show when the user selects something to edit and hide when the user is done editing save or cancel

alejandro to make this worth your while since you have been such an amazing help you should put your response in a new answer and when i try it and get it to work i will up-vote and accept that answer

3207059
post	get
while trying to find how to get this working i came across a blog post that said neither description nor watermark are usable with the present incarnation of the dataannotations framework

3207089
mousemove	mousedown	keyup	mousedown
keypress keyup mousedown mousemove

3207089

3207094
integer	unsigned
so suppose i want to have an inline c++ factorial function which uses inline assembly with a 32 bit or 64 bit unsigned integer expected as a result

3207103
mp3	flv
if it s working without supplied extension then a wild guess is whatever is parsing the querystring has logic to attempt the get using an assortment of supported extensions swf flv mp3 if one isn t seen

3207165
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend firefox with the firebug addon for debugging ajax issues even though i use google-chrome for regular browsing

3207184
mouse	keyboard
before removing a mouse or keyboard event from the system message queue

3207206
int	boolean
instead of making a boolean column per level i would suggest an enum or int column for level and either a category table and a join between the two using foreign keys to allow questions to be linked to one or more category or a category column which also uses enums or int

3207211
rss	feed
apparently the most common 2 words on my site are rss and feed because i use text for links like comments rss post feed etc

3207226
versioning	upgrade
problem is i have no control over which versioning to install and upgrade to in feature

3207246
folder	directory
how can you find the most recently modified folder not a file in a directory using ruby

3207256
min	max
this degrades to 1 sqrt x when min and max are both 1 and steepness is 0.5

3207298

clojure has transient analogs for some of its persistent data structures vectors maps and sets

3207304
jobs	cron
i do not have access to cron jobs as i am on a shared server

3207318
calloc	malloc
and if you are filling memory with zeroes check for implementation speed differences between malloc and setting things to 0 vs just calloc

3207318
memcpy	memmove
also beware memcpy vs memmove - determine which is necessary

3207328
cout	cin
you should also use different names for input and output streams -- there are already cin and cout in the std namespace

3207330
put	get
the static keyword before it s declaration suggests to me the code snippet is in a header file and you had to put the static there to get it to compile without redefined symbol errors

3207335
post	put
this assembly was put in the xap file manually by a post build step in which i just add the dll to zip xap file

3207476
hash	salt
whilst we re on the subject of hashing you might even want to consider adding a salt to the password before it is hash

3207476
hash	salt
a salt is a random string for example the user s email address that will help to improve the uniqueness of the hash generated different users that have the same password will generate the same hash without the salt

3207523
range	max	range	min	min	max
i m trying to figure out how to calculate a min max lat long bound on the specific given range of a gps coordinate

3207523
min	max
this gives 4 unique lat long pairs and i want need a max min lat and a max min long

3207546
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the code below works in firefox and google-chrome but the check is omitted on ie and opera

3207563
min	max
i was also thinking that i could sum min max rows of data by minute hour day week month etc for even faster calculations

3207591
folder	directory
if your making a ff plug-in then don t forget to add the mozilla directory to the search path for depends and when you make changes don t forget you have to reset the firefox plugin cache to try and load the plug-in again change the folder name start ff then change the name back

3207704
cout	cin
i ask a code snippet which cin a unicode text concatenates another unicode one to the first unicode text and the cout the result

3207705
gson	jackson
there are several json libraries in java available which you can implement in your webapp the popular ones being under each json.org jackson and google gson

3207728
pull	push
my hope was that i would then be able to push web content from our dev server to github pull it to our production server and spend the rest of the day at the pool

3207751
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested this solution in webkit google-chrome safari firefox and ie and it seems to work

3207765
csplit	grep
if this is on unix would split csplit grep suffice

3207773
min	max
there are already macros min and max defined in foundation nsobjcruntime.h

3207773
min	max
why not use std max and std min

3207816
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in firefox google-chrome safari but ie 8 is throwing several invalid argument errors when i run it

3207825

an oddity i ve noticed are that in test there is an negotiate challenge put out and responded to with a kerberos ticket while in production no challenge response occurs although one does occur on the opening page and the response is ntlm

3207850
width	height
how do i get these subplots such that the height of the y-axis equals the width of the x-axis for both subplots

3207882
ienumerable	ilist
i am wondering if it is better to return an ilist or ienumerable instead of an observablecollection from my repository since my viewmodel may end up putting it in either an observablecollection or list depending on my need

3207897
post	put	post	get	put	get
when developers talk about implementing or using a rest api they usually mean something along the lines of documenting uri templates for all their resources and use get to retrieve something put to modify something delete to delete something and post to do anything else like create or accept or modify something like the twitter api to update ones status or stackoverflow s own api or facebook s api

3207897
post	put	post	get	put	get
use the uniform interface get put post delete on these uris to work with

3207987
google-chrome	safari
in both safari and google-chrome on windows 7 i am getting some very strange behavior when trying to select existing values in these fields

3207987
google-chrome	safari
this problem occurs at all input fields and textareas of my application but only in safari and google-chrome

3207991
ibatis	mybatis
have a look at ibatis mybatis - it s a bit simpler to learn that hibernate

3208005
post	get
i can do a get easily but a browser redirect is always a get as per my understanding and i am unable to invoke the target site s post action

3208005
post	get
in the resultcontroller the get version of the signin action gets invoked but i need the post version to be invoked as i need to pass in parameters in the post header

3208006
mouse	keyboard
expression blend 4 is changing the horizontalalignment and or verticalalignment when moving textblock objects with the keyboard or mouse

3208026
toolbar	tabs
the toolbar and tabs are just too wide there s lot of empty space above and below text or images on them so i wish to make them narrower

3208058
cakephp	lithium
the end game i have in mind for those familiar with lithium or cakephp is to avoid having to define a whole bunch of classes for each different database table

3208074
concave	convex
i just had this exact problem bullet has shapes for doing this but collisions did not work properly for me with those shapes so i broke up my concave shape into lots of convex ones did it using a btcompoundshape with lots of btconvexhullshape as children

3208081
g++	gcc
for your example use g++ instead of gcc its a c++ program

3208122
innodb	myisam
i want to migrate one of my database from myisam to innodb

3208166
subtract	add
for intersection subtract the intersecting interval from tree1 and for union add the intersecting interval

3208166
subtract	add
for each subtract add operation you ll get a new set of intervals to add to your new tree3 which will end up being the result of your operation

3208169
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
it supports addition subtraction equality inequality and multiplication

3208191
chunked	transfer-encoding
if so then the content-length header is omitted when a transfer-encoding header indicates that a chunked transfer is being used which means the data is sent in small sequential chunks thus the full size cannot be reported in the content-length header ahead of time

3208216
opera	safari
for safari opera and actually the only cross-browser method is to re-constitute the containing boxes for text nodes and then use the pixel position inside the containing box to infer the character position

3208224
min	max
for this you use aggregates like min and max

3208253
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but ie sucks so bad and display total height of the images two states together

3208318
multiplying	add
then to transform that to have mean mu and standard deviation sigma multiplying your samples by sigma and add mu

3208327
getter	setter
also as to what to do with properties you can have your unsupported property getter setter throw exceptions just like methods

3208334
awt	swing	swt	swing
for java you have awt and swing which are part of the default java distribution and then there is swt which is used by eclipse for example

3208341
folder	directory
took two seconds to fix by just finding fps_images.png in the cocos2d directory and adding it to the resources folder of my project

3208357
multiplying	add
then you are free to transform this sample to normal distribution with given parameters multiplying by std deviation and then add mean

3208432
apache-poi	excellibrary
after you get the data you can store it in excel-compatible format csv or using java excellibrary for that like apache-poi or using jdbc to write data into excel sheet see this example

3208440
firefox	safari
on firefox and safari i have no problems at all...shows up fine

3208443
post	get
not entirely sure about that but you can avoid this restriction by using post instead of get

3208445
switching	screens
i am working on an android app that has multiple screens the user will need to navigate between and i am curious what the best practices are when switching between those screens

3208445
switching	screens
to display the help screens as opposed to switching to a help activity

3208447
post	get
how do i get the formatted post data the html form was supposed to submit

3208461
prop	each	prop	classname
each time you call a non-existing property your class would check if the property name exists in an array uses and if so assumes prop is classname and instaniates it

3208464
menhir	ocamlyacc
another possibility worth investigating is switching from ocamlyacc to menhir which is an ocamlyacc replacement with little to no porting required as the syntax is the same with some nice features that could help you such as support for parametrized parser modules functors

3208479
post	put	post	get	put	get
the limit is applied to any request get put post delete and so on

3208482
cvs	svn
i ve occasionally used cvs and svn

3208515
concave	convex
i have a method using the crossproduct to determine whether the geometry is convex i was assuming that i could just return back a list of points that make it concave when it s false and remove those points to fill the polygon but it s not working quite right

3208515
concave	convex
ultimately i d like to be able to make my concave geometry into a convex one like this

3208538
mongodb	bson
in mongodb using it is possible to filter a search based on if the field matches a bson data type see docs

3208571
getter	setter
in other words is it possible to write something in javascript that behaves like getter and or setter

3208587
point-in-polygon	convex
i d compute the convex hull also nts and remove any vertexes on the interior of the resulting convex hull polygon using a point-in-polygon test

3208591
versioning	upgrade
note incremental versioning upgrade of the ide cannot be performed at this time

3208591
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade to the most recent versioning you must download the latest installer

3208645
swt	swing
i ve worked with qt swing and swt and typically used both c++ and java code with all of these toolkits

3208683
jobs	cron
one of the most important things is to tune your mysql indexes to ensure that your regular scheduled jobs run quickly minimising the regular cpu hits that occur when the cron s run

3208696
post	get
then have a send button to send the user input to the command line then get the charlie s response and post it in the nstextfield

3208702
submit	submission
unless you re preventing the enter key from submission the form you may want to the handle the event using the submit handler

3208731
mouse	keyboard
if so you could start a timer when the gui comes up and then have keyboard and mouse callbacks at the top level

3208731
mouse	keyboard
every time the keyboard or mouse callback is triggered reset the timer

3208734
jar	war
one is that the war file is a jar file so you can use the jar command to expand it

3208737
union	distinct
then i take that collection then do a multiset union distinct with an empty collection of the same type

3208742
int	chars
why are you even trying to cast from chars to unsigned chars and assigning that to an int

3208742
int	chars
that way you take the chars cast it to an int and use it

3208753
jar	war
the ant task unzip unjar will also do the trick as the war file is jar zip

3208762
automake	autotools
this isn t the answer you re looking for but have you considered using the autotools suite automake autoconf etc.

3208763
put	get
from there just upload those files and call it an archive maybe put them in a separate directory point the server to it so wordpress doesn t get totally wiped out just in case

3208821
datamodel	relational-model
now here comes my question i was wondering if someone could seriously consider using both rdbms and non-relational db in a new project the complex but not performance critical datamodel would still be implemented using a relational-model and db while all performance critical yet simple models would be implemented with a non-relational db

3208837
bash	zsh
i m getting the same effect from ksh 93s+ but not from bash ash pdksh zsh or ksh 93t+

3208841
getter	setter
the ecmascript 5 spec adds standardized getter and setter

3208841
getter	setter
there has also been a proprietary implementation of getter and setter in mozilla for a long time that was also later adopted by webkit and opera but this is not available in ie

3208853
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the table was rendering flawlessly in ie 7 8 google-chrome safari firefox 3.6 but not in firefox on ubuntu

3208854
post	get
edit also i believe most browsers won t cache pages unless the get and post parameters remain the same

3208854
post	get
try adding a unique get or post parameter to the end of the url of each download

3208955
width	height
width height position

3208956
int	chars
are you trying to get the int 0 or the chars 0 into it

3208956
int	chars
the chars 0 on most implementations namely is just the int 48 but put into 8 bits

3208956
int	chars
the only difference between a chars and an int is that chars must be smaller or equal to short int

3208956
int	chars
and int must be larger or equal than short int accordingly this usually makes chars 8 bits short in 16 and in 32 nowadays

3208998
sorting	grouping
my bad didn t notice that you were sorting grouping totaling

3209001
for-loop	arrays
you don t need the nibobjects arrays or your for-loop

i had to move the taskbar to the side of the screen so that i could drag the find box back into the usable window space

3209085
boost	stl
using this example code it s the same for boost and the c++0x stl version

3209108
ant	maven
maven isn t procedural like ant maven has conventions maven is declarative maven has a lifecycle

3209108
ant	maven
maven calling ant to build .war

3209108
ant	maven
also maven will not magically be aware of things built by ant

3209108
maven	cargo
maven has plugins cargo that can help at doing this but you have to tell him to

3209108
ant	maven
my global feeling is that you are thinking too much ant oriented and maybe expecting too much from maven

3209108
ant	maven
maven is different it doesn t really work the way you described it doesn t work like ant

3209108
ant	maven
my recommendation would be to either fully migrate to maven and adopt its philosophy or to stick with your current ant solution and maybe consider using the maven ant tasks or ivy to leverage things such as dependency management artifact deployment

3209108
ant	maven
how to convert from ant to maven ...

3209108
ant	maven
differences between ant and maven

3209109

3209217
onmouseup	mousedown	onmousedown	onmouseup
i m using a pair of bools one for each button with the onmousedown and onmouseup events but if the 2 buttons are clicked at the exact same time or really close then only one mousedown event goes off and the other does not.

3209232
listview	gridview
look into using a gridview or listview or one of the other databound controls

3209239
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
whether you re using the maven eclipse plugin or m2e eclipse s project configuration is derived from the pom.xml so you need to configure the maven compiler plugin for 1.6 it defaults to 1.4

3209239
maven	pom.xml
add the following to your project s pom.xml save then go to your eclipse project and select properties maven update project configuration

3209269
bash	zsh
1 place the folowing line at the end of your shell s loading files .bashrc or .bash_profile for bash and .zshrc for zsh after all path variable settings

3209292
put	get
probably first put an alert on json.tosource and status and see what you get

3209295
ssl	https
force https for the submission of cc information from users pretty much all payment processing gateways force the use of ssl when communicating with their gateway

3209305
maven	pom.xml
eliminate maven pom.xml redundancy

3209313
addition	multiplication
at the time this was faster because addition was a lot faster than multiplication but that s no longer the case

3209332
google-chrome	safari
i m sure webkit safari google-chrome is probably the same way

3209337
subtract	add
i understand i can subtract 1200 and add the pm but how do i add the between hour and minute and also remove the leading zero if it is before 10 00am

3209426

i am upgrading gridview to radgrid

3209426
sorting	filtering
am getting this error foreveryaction like sorting filtering editing row selecting scrolling

in vb.net you will need to get the html first so use the webclient class or httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse classes

3209546
uitableview	uisearchbar
thank you for your answer jared what i need is to show all the streets in a uitableview and let the user filter the search in a uisearchbar or just let him select it from the list

3209622
opera	firefox
tested on ie 6 ie 8 firefox 3.6.6 opera 10.60 and iron 5.0.380

3209635
put	get
in order to get it to resize properly you can put the grid in a viewbox instead of setting stretch on the path

3209641
mef	prism
i was watching some tutorials for mef or prism with silverlight but was also doing some maf work system.addin on the side and thought that might work also

3209641
mef	prism
i see that prism and mef are pretty much the same thing but prism having the event aggregator

3209647
put	get
ojdbc6.jar if pl sql returns a variable of type date and i try to put that in a java.sql.date variable then i get an exception

3209655
google-chrome	safari
i found that adding display block to the input field fixes it in google-chrome but not safari

3209717
folder	directory
you need to copy mapi32.dll located in the windows system32 folder from another computer probably one of your local computers that does not have an exchange server set up an outlook configured to receive mail from an exchange server is okay just as long as an exchange server itself isn t configured on that computer and paste it into your myob directory c premier19

3209767
folder	directory
first we â git cloneâ the working directory to another folder

3209770
stdout	stderr
i would assume that you could look at the exit status of the program ps.exitvalue or you could read the stdout stderr ps.getinputstream ps.geterrorstream respectively

3209779
min	max
this approach works very well for some python system functions - check min max sort

3209808
fadein	fadeout
i m using jquery to fadein and fadeout the canvas

3209836
gentoo	linux
i could just check whether the executable file exists but it s not reliable at all for instance on my desktop i use gentoo linux and the zip command lives on usr bin

3209838
post	get
you can learn how to do get and post on apple web site

3209843
width	height
i have other information like the coordinates of where the picture appears on a canvas it s width height etc

3209847
min	max
there are many accumulators which have the effect of consuming the whole iterable they re given such as min or max -- but even they don t ignore entirely the results yielded in the process min and max for example will raise an exception if some of the results are complex numbers

getter	setter
well although javabeans spec asks you to declare getter and setter i usually will not declare them unless it s absolutely necessary as in case of many mvc frameworks

3211240
getter	setter
one of the reasons that getter and setter methods are often written in java is because of the use of javabeans conventions

3211240
getter	setter
java doesn t support the uniform access principle so you have to write getter and setter methods to access properties

3211242

telerik	radcombobox
i m using the telerik radcombobox control

3211838
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
rather than going for a shared boolean variable between ui and worker class a more clearer approach would be to use reset events autoresetevent manualresetevent

3211839
getter	setter
well i think instead of using any external library you can do it yourself just add getter and setter in your javabeans and override to string method of it and then you can form the string as you want.then only task remaining is to write that string into one file thats it

3211872
folder	directory
during compilation your app.config file is copied automatically from the root directory to the bin folder

3211886
int	chars
memory is memory if you use 1 byte as int or chars it is still one byte

3211928
getter	setter
i personally don t use getter and setter whenever it s possible meaning i don t use any framework who needs it like struts for instance

3211936
processors	hyperthreading
say if i have a processors like this which says # cores 4 # threads 4 and without hyperthreading support

3211938
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
practically most normal browsers firefox google-chrome opera safari can handle whatever you throw at them

3211947
disk	ram
as the amount of stuff increases you have to load more of it into memory - using up ram but also taking more and more time to read it off the disk and pass it over the memory bus

3211947
disk	ram
and as the ram gets used parts of the data read from disk is swapped out meaning even more time writing and then even more time reading when you want it back

3211947
disk	ram
so although its not a big deal individually the idea that disk space ram is cheap so use as much as you like is not good you should worry about the bloat in your apps and try to make your apps more efficient and therefore more responsive

nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
for loading the image from a url i m using nsoperationqueue nsinvocationoperation

3211969
user-controls	tabcontrol
now when one item there is selected not sure yet what the best selection method would be perhaps doubleclick i need to capture the event in the tabcontrol that holds my user-controls

3211969
user-controls	tabcontrol
thankfully as my user-controls is put into the xaml visualtree the bubbling event flows up and events can reach the tabcontrol

3211969
tabcontrol	tabitem
my solution was to create a tabitem collection as a source for the tabcontrol

3211969
tabcontrol	tabitem
this works while i don t like the idea of defining the company list tabitem seperatly i can t define it under the tabcontrol because i can only have defined items or sourced not both

3211969
tabcontrol	tabitem
i ve tried this idea by putting a button on the list datatemplate that bubbles the id of the company selected up to the tabcontrol handling it there and adding a new tabitem with the companymodel

3211984
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is a cpu vendor term that means a single core that can multiplex its attention between two computations

3211987
jboss	glassfish
if you need the servlet api sources javadoc you can add the following to your pom.xml works at least for jboss glassfish

3211989
disk	ram
i m sure there are other holes like that too - but the code above will work on any system which supports paging and where disk access is much more expensive than ram access

3212052
updatepanel	scriptmanager
with an updatepanel you need to use scriptmanager like this

3212073
notepad++	textpad

memcached	apc
a new one is minify which offers a lot of features including general caching solution depending on the server s capabilities apc memcached file cache

3212119
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so you need a uinavigationcontroller above the uiviewcontroller or uitableview controller that controls your table

3212127
getter	setter
what does get matter when we live in a day and age where any ide that s worth having will generate getter and setter for your private variables and lets you fold them up if you d rather not read them

3212127
getter	setter
if your objects have nothing but getter and setter are you suffering from an anemic domain model

3212172
mouseover	mouseout
try this this should provide you with the event handling you need on mouseover and mouseout

serializable	deserialization
i ve started to look at protobuf-net and want to used it with async sockets without having to write serializable deserialization myself

you could try using a set list - and if you implements your own list or extends arraylist os that the equals acts the way you expect

3212272
int	double
consider you have a int foo variable which you printf in a number of places later during development you realize you need foo to be a double instead

3212284
qstring	qbytearray
bat the truth is that any king of string manipulation using qt qbytearray std or mem is going to stop when findind the first 0 char qt qstring can do it without problems but when converting it to c string char the data will be again trimmed with the first 0

3212290
subtraction	addition
since the auto calculated fields require only addition or subtraction operations is it possible to make such pdf files

3212297
hide	show
in order to hide the label and the activity indicator together just put the inside an additional view it might be full-screen half transparent view and show hide this view instead of label and indicator view separately

3212310

i m afraid i haven t put in any tests yet but you can try it out i m using ruby 1.9.1 so let me know if you get any problems in the comments or on github

iboutlet	ibaction
the view is attached to a class that provides an iboutlet and an ibaction for the button

3212471

how i prevent duplicate entries in database at the time of form submit and display an alert box and stop form submission if entry is duplicate

3212484
notepad++	scite
obvious typo errors can be seen with a good text editor like pspad notepad++ scite and so on

3212493
bash	zsh
you can not accomplish the same thing with a normal parameter but using a slightly different syntax it can be done with an array variable parameter in bash ksh zsh

3212503
subtraction	addition
now i want to convert it to integer so that i can perform addition subtraction etc

3212506
ant	pom.xml
i could hack up something with ant to switch in whatever pom.xml i want by renaming it copy pom.xml.development pom.xml

3212506
maven	pom.xml
failing that perhaps a way to include a section of pom.xml from within a main pom.xml so i could have my prod and dev snippets and have maven include whichever one was appropriate based on a property or env var or command line arg or something

3212554
width	height
probably a new templated control based on childwindow with a new fullscreen visual state in a new state group that hides the chrome and causes the content grid to stretch with auto width and height

3212608
many-to-many	one-to-many
you need to understand one-to-many and many-to-many relations and apply then when appropriate

3212617
rss	feed
rss and feed readers

3212635
inline	inlining
it serves as a hint to the compiler to perform the inlining optimization this is basically useless on modern compilers which inline aggressively with or without the keyword

3212685
post	get
make sure you are creating the control every page request regardless of get post

3212722
wan	lan
if they are part of your corporate lan wan they should be able to get access just like a local user

3212768
mouseout	mouseleave
instead of mouseout you can use mouseleave for this

3212768
mouseout	mouseleave
where mouseout fires when entering a child mouseleave doesn t it only fires when leaving the parent element that the event is bound to

3212768
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

3212836
put	get
anyway as i ve got the address i need to get the locations and put them on the map

3212884
internationalization	localization
the usual convention is that it used for localization and internationalization

3212921
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade indy to th latest versioning 10.5.7 i was using the openssl dlls in versioning 0.9.8.13

3212921
versioning	upgrade
is it good to use the latest versioning 1.0.0a or since the versioning i have 0.9.8.13 works fine it is a risk to upgrade since there can be bugs in it

3212944
config	ini
for advanced users they can edit the config using a text editor if it s stored in a text file ini file config file etc.. or you can make an api

3212994
put	get
the second time i put that same string in which fires -toggletag rather than -createtag but ends up in the same rendering method i get the console message

3212994
next	except
i m not going to deal with this button again except to tell it to remove itself next time i render my tag list so it seems like the view controller ought to release it

3212996
jquery	scriptaculous
and then in your javascript i am using jquery but you could use prototype scriptaculous or you favorite js flavor

3213046
rss	feed
in my table cell i am displaying images which i retrive from imge link in rss feed and title

3213059
pop-up	dialog
to make it a pop-up window use something like jquery ui dialog

3213077
post	get
what you need to do is use the post method - you can t get around this if your url is going to be over the limit although you can delay the inevitable by abbreviating names and values

3213077
post	get
take the post and then redirect the client to a get to keep things addressable you can either store the search server side against a key and retrieve it on the get from memory or a database or you could encode the keys into a single querystring key or a smaller number of keys which capture the behaviour

3213105
multiplying	transpose
instead i got valueerror shape mismatch objects cannot be broadcast to a single shape when multiplying testmatrix with its transpose

3213183
width	height
the fact that the value in prefs.bounds have x y width and height properties doesn t make it a rectangle object - it is just an object with those four properties

3213217
put	get
every datastore get put or query is a round-trip to an external server

3213217
put	get
save all of your entities using one datastore put and you will get much faster results

3213293
apache	nginx
typically apache or nginx

3213297
children	parent
i want to be able to create a parent object with children and let the parent handle the update saves and deletes

3213297
children	parent
after the postback i create a new parent with children

3213298
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
you need to know that when you use a sqldatareader it is necessary to close it separately from your sqlconnection

3213322
translation	localization
if you are working by yourself i would be wary of actually doing your own localization unless you are a native speaker or are fluent in the languages you want to translation your pages to

3213343
folder	directory
rather than iterate over all images in the directory you could iterate over all products in the database and for each product copy the image to a new folder but it s pretty much the same thing

3213357
accessor	properties
for this scenario you can even go one step further and specify a public static properties with only the get accessor which in turns uses the private static readonly field

3213417
versioning	upgrade
actually i suggest to upgrade to versioning 1.2.138 because there was a bug fixed related to this feature in earlier versioning

3213449
kindle	nook
the nook and the kindle have this capability i believe but you ll need to use their protections schemes to take advantage of it

3213456
decoder	encoder
while i can sling a them at the encoder decoder directly it would be nice to have a human readable source the base64 equivalent of the quick brown dog

3213479
integer	fractions
integer and fractions parts both

3213480
int	chars
the first reason is that when you read pass a chars to a function it s actually automatically promoted to an int so is stored into the va_arg as an int

3213480
int	chars
so when you read a chars you re reading an int s worth of memory not a chars s - so you re not actually reading a byte at a time

3213480
128bit	64bit
a further reason has to do with alignment - on some architectures one example would be very recent arm processors a double must be aligned to a 64bit or sometimes even 128bit boundary

3213533
public	protected
these log-methods would be protected and only get invoked through one log-method which is public to use for the programmer

3213538
accessor	ivar
if it s defined as retain you should use the accessor instead of releasing the ivar and setting it manually.

3213574
put	get
what i now want to do is get the value of that registery key and put it in the url

3213611
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout this alternative is very similar to setinterval except that it doesn t ensures a given interval between repetition rather focuses on how long the browser should wait until repeating the action

3213628
formview	detailsview
i would rather use a formview detailsview if both the view and edit page is on the same

3213628
formview	detailsview
you can store a variable in session regarding the user level then on each page load you can check the level depending on that open the formview detailsview in either normal or edit mode

3213648
pop-up	dialog
so why then you want that confirmation dialog pop-up functionality

3213732
appfuse	grails
anthony- i don t know a great deal about appfuse but i can comment on porting to grails

3213741
width	height
i tried to swap height width for the camera parameters but not much of a difference

3213765
integer	unsigned
for the sake of being closer to portable you should use unsigned integer types for this purpose uint32_t etc.

3213816
range	max	range	min	min	max
sweetspotsimilarity lets you define a sweet spot for the length of a field in terms of a range defined by min and max

3213829
qfile	qdatastream
if you are using qt to implement this kind of solution you need two sets of qfile and qdatastream instances one for writing and one for reading

3213842
rss	feed
django-way of specifying channel image in rss feed

3213860
versioning	upgrade
of course this is very simplified since if you need to upgrade the versioning and the then you re in trouble

3213885
portrait	landscape
when this is run on the iphone simulator and device if you rotate to landscape on view c and then tap the back button to return to view b it does the right thing and shifts view b back to portrait mode

3213967
subtract	add
and always store the time in utc.and when you want to display that information to particular user then just access this user s timezone which is stored for this user and add or subtract that amount of time from the time stored in utc and display this.that will be in the timezone of the user who is viewing the information

3213979
public	protected
short answer start your thread by calling not run and make sure you thread s run method is protected not public

3214027
put	get
inside the loop you can get the first element and put the rest into an array

3214049
getter	setter
in your experience it s easier to read mantain use as api a class with a constructor with no params and a lot of setter getter method or a code like this one with all the params in the constructor

3214091
folder	directory
in a console application assuming you copy the file to the output folder copy to output directory copy always in the properties of the file at the same place as the executable you could use a relative path

3214094
nsobject	nsautoreleasepool
however that is irrelevant to the question but actually you are allowed to send -retain to any objective-c object derived from nsobject except nsautoreleasepool

3214097
inline-functions	inlining
this is necessary if you want it to be considered for inlining most compilers can only inline-functions defined in the current compilation unit

3214099
getter	setter
favoring constructor over getter setter instantiation also helps immutability that is creating an object thorough its constructor and not letting anyone modify its properties later on

3214105
vb6	vba
vba shares the same code base as vb6 and in 1996 was available to be licensed to developers to include in their own applications

3214105
vb.net	vb6
vb.net was a radical departure from vb6

3214105
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
though subsequent iterations of vb.net have been referred to in sequence vb7 vb8 etc. by many developers vb.net shares very little with vb6 and vba other than the basic syntax

3214105
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
because it s entirely different from vba and vb6 you cannot not use vb.net code directly in vba

3214105
vb.net	vb6
because vb.net code compiles down to the same managed intermediate language code as c# and shares the same .net apis you may feel more commonality between c# and vb.net than vb6 and vb.net from a programming perspective

3214144
pop-up	dialog
to generate the pop-up use the jquery dialog widget documented here

3214152

the openfiledialog appears to be defaulting to the last directory used but this is useless to me since it is almost always the wrong folder and i end up alternating between the two folder

3214262
mef	prism
the june 1 drop of prism 4 supports mef instead of unity as a di container

a double is never equals to an int

3214469
int	chars
the integral types are byte short int and long and chars

3214472
put	get
you get b and the range in charactersetwithrange is the range of the unicode to be put in the set of characters

3214483
inherited	properties
while i understand that this annotation has been introduced to map an association properties to different types of entities that don t have a common ancestor entity i think it would be better to introduce a base type the other entities would inherited from for bidirectional relations

3214537
int	double
a double representing 2.0 and an int representing 2 are definitely different objects and certainly not interchangeable in a general sense

3214572
getter	setter
the binding is partially there because the view model s property getter and setter each get called once when a row is selected and thus causes the details view to expand

3214573
vsto	add-in
i created a office add-in in vs 2008 c# .net 3.5 and vsto

3214665
codeigniter	cakephp
just use a framework codeigniter cakephp zend framework and many others all have session classes that were written and edited by people smarter than you or me

3214707
post	get
you may get some extra data that asp.net puts into your forms but otherwise there s no reason you can t post to any web address you want

3214738
nsurl	nsfilemanager
checked with spotlight-metadata nsurl and nsfilemanager no result

3214738

3214781
unix	solaris
three flavors of unix linux solaris irix.

3214797
folder	directory
you would be able to take your webservice code as a set of php files or however you organized them and they can be dropped into the appropriate folder in the app directory according to which version of cake is being used

3214801
pascal	delphi
wolfgang ehrhardt has done the pascal delphi port for isaac and is available at

3214801
pascal	delphi
i know his site for many years and he has been updating with the pascal delphi routines since then

3214834
width	height
ask it for the -cellsizeforbounds passing in a rect of the desired width for the column with a large height flt_max

3214845
hide	show
you have to animate both the hide and the show to get it to work tho

3214865
free	malloc
retain release and malloc free

3214892
google-chrome	safari
thought my coding was quite typical though can only get it to work in google-chrome and safari

3214947
move	drag
by setting the formborderstyle of your form to none you take the drag handle away from the user so they cannot move it via the mouse

3214953
atoi	atof
according to the standard the functions atof atoi atol and atoll need not affect the value of the integer expression errno on an error

3214979
sorting	filtering
i would like their column sizes sorting filtering etc to stay in sync

3215013
superclass	subclassing
i d like that those queries start returning concrete subclassing instead of the superclass

3215028
getter	setter
i ve created a private field in the usercontrol to hold the object with a getter and setter

3215069
hide	show
the reason for doing this is to be able to hide show controls depending on whether or not the user is adding or editing records eg

3215074
multiplying	subtract
you can either do this by pulling apart the bits to read the mantissa directly or you can write a messy floating point loop that first multiplies the value by a power of two to put it in the range 1 x 10 then pulls off a digit at a time by casting to int subtract and multiplying by 10

3215082
queue	fifo
fifo would be a queue

3215108
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
hunky dory in firefox ie8 google-chrome and opera

3215177
width	height
and specify the height and width

3215187
width	height
you need to explicitly state the width and height in your css declaration for .plus

3215194
width	height
your image has a height and width of 0 so it won t show up in ie7 at all

3215196
implements	extends
the way to extends natives is to use the implements method

3215235
multiplying	subtract
you can either do this by pulling apart the bits to read the mantissa directly or you can write a messy floating point loop that first multiplies the value by a power of two to put it in the range 1 x 10 then pulls off a digit at a time by casting to int subtract and multiplying by 10

3215237
for-loop	loops
have you tried translating that while loops to a for-loop

3215238
inline	inlining
anyway as a result of this and if you know that the - is the original one when the library is loaded some compilers will detect this and see that the - call is always going to be the actual subtraction function and therefore they will inline calls to it and inlining a call to - can eventually result in assembly code for subtracting two numbers so this is a big speed boost

3215249
accessor	properties
i imagine your thing properties is not getting retained because you re not using your accessor to set it

3215306
width	height
my math was correct in calculating the effective scale value 1 0.5 0.5 then scaling it by 0.5 again does 0.25 but what i was doing was calculating the effective width height by the original width height not the updated width height

3215306
width	height
scaling it further by 0.5 the effective scale is 0.25 but the new width height should be 4000x4000 found by scaling 1000 by 0.25 and not 500 by 0.25

3215356
pull	push
however it does have the benefit that if you want to pull changes from a mercurial user you can pull them into the hg repo and push them out to github

3215359
filtering	grouping
the two named_scope s are located in the account model and are used to filtering accounts by a user and by a grouping

3215427
cpu	processors
macro processors insert special directives into processed source that allow compiler to map compiled sequences of cpu instructions to source code lines

3215428
scheme	racket	lisp	scheme	lisp	racket
on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations

3215428
lisp	scheme
some scheme and lisp implementations will implement a limited for of this using the identity of subforms as dmitry-vk mentioned

3215450
post	get
i will post it up when i get it working

3215487
fadein	fadeout
2 the fadein and fadeout animations don t keep stacking up

3215537
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have built a dropdown menu on a site that works perfectly in ie8 and the usual firefox google-chrome and safari

3215550
client-side	server-side
all of the code on our website is currently run server-side and is split up in multiple pages but i would like to get all the client-side features like transition animations and iphone-like buttons that jqtouch offers

3215553
width	height
is there any way to get a div to fill an entire table cell s width and height using css

3215553
width	height
i don t know what the width and or height of the cell will be ahead of time and setting the div s width and height to 100 does not work

3215555
multiplication	exponent
points out in the comments 128-bit floating point numbers already allow large enough exponent to call into question both lookup tables and standard long multiplication

3215555
integer	radix
actually the big integer package gmp already has ã n time radix conversion as well as good heuristics for which choice of multiplication algorithm

3215555
division	multiplication
in this solution they also need fast division but that can be obtained from fast multiplication in any of several ways

3215557
geocoding	geocode
the google geocoding api provides a direct way to access a geocode via an http request

3215558
post	put
i think a smart solution is to use post to create an initially empty short lived holding area for a resource to which you can put clients need to post to create the guid resource instead of discovering it via a link

3215574
factors	matrix
a transformation matrix is a factors of scaling matrix ss transition matrix st and rotation matrix sr

3215574
cos	sin
replace cos th with a and sin th with b and solve the equations

3215586
width	height
the jlabels i am creating inside of the jpanel are being sized using the setbounds method to which i provide x y height and width

3215586
width	height
furthermore the height width parameters were being pulled dynamically from the label using getminimumheight etc so the label gets sized according to how much text is in it

3215611
libs	buildpath
it works in eclipse because it s smart enough to include the necessary libs in the classpath based on the configured project s buildpath

3215625
cvs	svn
we re not only supporting svn in addition to git and mercurial but also cvs

3215639
textarea	textbox
if not what benefit we have out of using textarea instead of textbox

3215643
client-side	server-side
i ve seen some examples that use server-side scripts such as remy sharp s solution but i just need strictly a client-side jquery solution

3215659
fadein	fadeout
you may also be getting continuous blinking long after typing stops because multiple fadein fadeout animations are queued

3215659
fadein	fadeout
to reduce the number of ajax calls thus the number of fadein fadeout as well put a short delay on the keyup function so the ajax call is made after a short delay and if a user types quickly only one call is made

3215692
getter	setter
i would stick with the first version until you need to add code to the getter or setter method like validating a new value for the property.

3215769
textarea	textbox
textbox is single line editor and textarea is multi line editor there is no default implementation of rich text editing in html so far

3215839
width	height
you said in your original question that setting width and height to 100 didn t work though which makes me suspect that there is some other rule overriding it

3215839
width	height
did you check the computed style in chrome or firebug to see if the width height rules were really being applied

3215889
move	drag
so what happens if both fingers hit the screen nearly simultaneously is that the 2nd finger should be pointer 1 gets a move action before pointer down is called making the code think it s a drag not a pinch zoom

3215898
next	except
works beautifully except for one thing when the page loads the slideshow isn t automatically scrolling it requires the user to click prev next

3215908
getter	setter
boiler plate code ide s are great for doing all the crap you don t want to do like generating getter setter for a field comments skeleton classes etc

3215955
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml is faster than beautifulsoup i think and has much better functionality while remaining relatively easy to use

3215958
mouse	keyboard
traditionally serial and printer ports as well as keyboard mouse temperature sensors and so forth were i o devices

3215960
width	height
there are 2 divs they both expand the full width of the browser window they are both 450px in height

3216032
put	get
there are put and get calls for servletcontext that allow you treat it essentially as a map

3216081
ubuntu	linux
i have cua-mode t in my .emacs so that c-c is copy and c-v is paste just like most other programs on my desktop ubuntu gnome linux

3216088
submit	submission
i can do it without any issues as long as i capture the submit using submit but i would have to run my own validation on the data because it operates independently of the regular submission

3216091
int	chars
hint a chars can be cast as an int

3216155
gif	png
it would be desirable if you could convert that on-the-fly into a smaller format gif jpg png depending on the content color of the image data and then serve that up to the user

3216169
next	except
everything is working fine except with the problem that when i am using the soft keyboard and switched to numeric key entry and move from first field to next field the keyboard layout automatically changed to alphanumeric

3216286
width	height
i tried to make it with changing width and height separately

3216318
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you can fix this by setting this in your viewdidload method or even the viewwillappear

3216351
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i m trying to generate a few markers and to save code i ve put the marker generation into a for-loop which loops through an arrays of markers there are actual values instead of long lat x x x in the real arrays

3216411
viewdidload	viewwillappear
this won t work in viewdidload or viewwillappear since the table most likely haven t been populated by then at least it wasn t in my case

3216413
post	put
2 either put data in body of your request post put delete request

3216433
vbscript	jscript
the sample is in vbscript but it shouldn t be too tricky to change it to jscript

3216440
nltk	opennlp
i ve looked at a few libaries like nltk and opennlp and while they have decent tools to handle symbolic logic and parse natural language neither seems to have any kind of proabablilstic framework for converting one to the other

3216446
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
the view supports grouping filtering sorting and currency and the icollectionview interface is from system.componentmodel so you wouldn t have to add a gui reference to your viewmodel project

3216462
put	get
when it s the matter of initializing a char array is there a macro or something that allows us to put our initializing text between two double quotation marks but where the array doesn t get an extra null terminating character

3216496
int	chars
or chars by casting the product of an int calculation to string

3216520
hide	show
basically it s using classes on the trs to show and hide them and using a larger number of hidden selects to show groups of subcategories

3216530
switching	screens
you can switching out which form is in the main context so you can load up your splash screens in an initial application context and then swap it out once it s loaded

3216567
post	put
while shifting to another page you just put the values of first page variable in sessions then you can access the value of previous page at any page then post the value to the database query

3216586
getter	setter
i ve found a way that is specifying a getter and setter for every date field however i want do it in a more convenient way 1 setter + 1 getter for every date field in every table is a lot

3216590
vb.net	vb6
you could to take a look into this article it s worth reading as a warm up converting vb6 to vb.net part i

3216595
vb.net	vb6
just a blog post with some pointers regarding migration from vb6 to vb.net and c#

3216595
vb.net	vb6
vb6 to vb.net upgraded upgrade help â yes you are not alone in your vb6â ness â

3216629
subtraction	addition
this is nice because addition and subtraction are trivial

3216629
division	multiplication
the rounding after the multiplication and division including corner cases for very large or very small numbers are left as an exercise to you

udp	tcp
what the code does is sends a message through udp socket and requests for a tcp port

3216749
children	parent
i am having a problem saving the parent object which contains multiple children

3216768
versioning	upgrade
it was in the end clearly a versioning bug as the upgrade solved the import problem with no further contortions

3216802
pop-up	dialog
however when i try to pop-up a dialog that contains the drop target i get an error

3216803
opera	firefox
firefox 3.6.6 iron 5.0.380 and opera 10.60 had no problems but ie is oblivious

3216928
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 google-chrome and firefox don t seem to mind it though

3216933
imperative	declarative
i like over because they feel more in the vein of xsl being declarative and are just a little bit more uncomfortable for me coming from an imperative scripting and programming background

3216951
icollectionview	ieditableobject
also i made the objects that are in my icollectionview derive from ieditableobject so when they are updated the grid will refresh itself

3216956
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems transactions do exist on windows vista and higher ntfs only

3216961
put	get
and use that to get the folder path regardless of where they put it

3217045
xstream	jackson
i would use jackson json processor but there are many alternatives to choose from guice or xstream if you prefer xml

3217105
hash	md5
the sso works with an iframe the user s details are given in the querystring and one of the details has to be hash md5

3217132
nsurl	nsstring
it looks like you can use an nsstring or an nsurl but either way the url you specify must conform to the standards outlined in rfc 2396 etc.

3217142
put	get
i want to write a tfs task which will get the code of the project being built and put it into a directory on the build agent for burning to a cd

3217142
put	get
how could i get the code and put it into a directory

3217190
memset	calloc
however it is probably just a memset or calloc or something like that which is fast to complete

3217209
db4o	eloquera
for the last 2 years i ve been using db4o and i m now switching to eloquera

3217218
temp	tmp
when the form submits it has in the variables that are passed to the controller its temp name var tmp name and then its name as the name of the file

3217245
ssl	https
https as in rfc2818 uses ssl tls to open a secure tunnel that traverses the proxy

3217268
thin	webrick
it would be nice if your service supported all n of the popular and some of the not-so-popular servers thin webrick

3217268
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails is the 500-lb gorilla but there are other frameworks such as merb and sinatra

3217268
thin	webrick
you don t need a converter from merb to webrick and another from sinata to thin

3217278
centroid	convex
find the centroid of the convex hull

3217372
passenger	thin	passenger	unicorn	passenger	webrick	thin	unicorn	thin	webrick	unicorn	webrick
rack middleware is everything between application servers webrick thin unicorn passenger ... and the actual application such as your rails application

3217376
fast-forward	merge
you can only do this if the merge is a fast-forward

3217387
perl	tcl
if you want something concrete take a look at which showcases the tk toolkit running on multiple platforms and with multiple languages tcl ruby perl python

3217394
division	subtraction
a different way is to form your operation a subtraction and a division in two steps like this

3217425
goto	break
also there s no room for comparison with goto because break cannot arbitrarily change program s flow from one point to the other lie goto does

3217438
post	get
post some specific error messages exceptions caught and you ll get more help.

3217445
goto	break
break is a language feature used to abort a loop - you could use goto but then you incur the appropriate wrath of the xkcd comic below

3217445
goto	break
this applies to break goto c++ exceptions etc

3217451
daemons	launchd
note the launchd facility is he preferred mechanism for launchd daemons in mac os x v10.4 and higher

3217465
goto	break
not only is there no problem with break it s also ok to use goto when break is insufficient

3217495
pull	push
then you can use normal push pull in and out hg commands on both hg and svn repos

3217553
folder	directory
i ve had red exclamation points before that were a symptom of subversion errors caused by copying a folder on the filesystem and inadvertently copying the invisible .svn directory

3217553
folder	directory
to fix it i found the .svn directory in the folder it was something like projectname src main java com package name .svn then deleted it and performed an update followed by a commit and it was all back to normal

3217554
int	chars
as you have discovered the chars value of the int 0 and the chars literal 0 are different

3217582
int	chars
see a chars datatype is really an int value which conventionally denotes a codepoint the numeric value assignated to a textual chars in unicode

3217582
int	chars
so is sort of a shortcut to say assign c1 the int value that corresponds to the codepoint of the chars a

3217594
youtube	vimeo

3217762
hex	binary
hex to decimal probably isn t as important unless of course you need to change the value from a decimal first but that s a simple conversion formula but hex to binary will be important seeing as each hex character 0-9 a-f corresponds to a specific binary output

3217762
hex	binary
i would recommend if the buffer wouldn t be too large to take the entire hex dump and replace whatever you re searching for in there to avoid overwriting a duplicate binary sequence

3219147
bazaar	git
at the moment they only implement mercurial but git bazaar and darcs are planned as well

3219147
bazaar	git
however amp is designed so that you use the mercurial commands on a git repository or darcs commands with bazaar semantics on a mercurial repository so there is a very clear separation between those layers

3219171
folder	directory
i put it in a self-made lib folder in my project folder also the working directory for the executable

3219199
lisp	scheme

i think you need to just copy an inputstream to an outputstream

3219207

i m trying to achieve the following thing have different types of markers on my map for example schools libraries bus stops and i want to be able to show hide each group of markers

3219443
width	height
for an actual popup you want window.open and be sure to include some specific width and height otherwise some browsers will still put the new window in a new tab

3219583
hide	show
you basically just need to store references to marker objects in an array set their type school bus stop etc. and then on some event loop through and hide show as appropriate

3219611
dictionary	map
how can i pass map into py to be a dictionary with api

3219614

read about the data controls data sources gridview listview repeater etc

3219791
fadein	fadeout
problem is the fadein is happening before the fadeout completes which is causing the cards to stack for a moment which looks horrible versus the current card fading out and the new card fading in

3219792
implements	extends
of course the key idea is that you ll implements item setting and getting as well as iteration by simply delegating to your chosen std map and performing the needed type conversion and low-level fiddling object allocation reference counting -- the latter is the part that higher-level frameworks for extends python save you from having to do essentially but the wrap and delegate underlying architecture won t change by much

3219825
unix	bsd
it is expensive say on a bsd system to set up a cross-compilation environment that accurately simulates gnu headers. in the days when most varieties of unix were proprietary and vendors had to support them all this problem was very serious

3219829
subclass	abstract-class
datasetobserver is an abstract-class so it s up to the subclass to decide what to do on oninvalidated

3219832
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout
you can manually set the duration then use a timeout for the fadein calling hide and killing the fadeout effect

3219891
post	get
at the time they definitely worked on get data rather than post if it s changed to post you might need to look into curl

i wouldn t even mind converting the nsdata to an nsstring first if dictionarywithstring existed

3219918
int	double
double getanything int flag

3219919
implements	extends
today most applications are using some kinds of underlying frameworks and with the frameworks come requirements on the objects that will integrate with the framework - the object must implements an interface or extends a class

3219919
getter	setter
such objects are often mandated by certain frameworks which use reflection to find out the properties accessible through getter setter of the object and manipulate them beans exposed to jsps spring beans etc

3219925
backgrounding	multitasking
i m really sad because i think that multitasking of apple is not real multitasking in fact they only keep the state of the app but they don t allow it to run in backgrounding

int	chars
the type of pointer refers to the type of memory it is pointing to normally e.g a chars chars pointer points to a memory with chars in it also this type of pointer has a lot to do with the pointer arithmetic like e.g how many bytes of jump the address will make if you add an int to the pointer s name

3220105
metaphone	soundex
metaphone and soundex are phonetic algorithms for indexing strings by their english pronunciation

3220105
metaphone	soundex
have you ever used functions metaphone or soundex that are present in the standard php library

3220108
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the subclassing as they inherited from the base class can respond to sayhello but in case they are not implementing this method themselves the call gets dispatched to the superclass sayhello

3220156
post	get
this resolution was obscure enough that i decided to go ahead create the post and answer it myself so any other newbies like myself won t get hung up

3220209
opera	firefox
for some reason firefox is messing up the following websites layout it works fine in ie and opera though.

3220211
metaphone	soundex
more generally soundex and metaphone can be used to find strings that sound similar when pronounced out loud

3220211
metaphone	soundex
when they type it in and it doesn t find me in the database soundex or metaphone might be used to say there s no nicolas knight but there is a nicholas knight

3220233
g++	gcc
when i grepped nm .o for the name of my method i found that the object files emitted by gcc had unmangled names while the .cu files which were compiled by g++ expected mangled names

3220235
daemons	launchd
i am writing a daemons in c++ on linux which would launchd

3220235
daemons	launchd
other processes launchd by this daemons

3220247
folder	directory
in the end i realized that i was making a full path call to rsync.exe which meant my current directory was no picking up the etc folder i just created

3220264
getter	setter
to oversimplify a lot the business objects should have getter setter methods and the dto should just have properties

3220304
fast-forward	merge
you do that by avoiding any kind of merge other than fast-forward

3220304
fast-forward	merge
this will be a fast-forward merge

flexunit	puremvc
i have a flex application written using puremvc framework.now i want to write tests.we are using flashbuilder 4.is flexunit sufficient for testing

3220332
integer	fractions
now b is an integer and 0 log a 1 so log a is really just the fractions part of log x

3220366
int	double
i ve assumed int as a base type but you could use others ex double or float or even be polymorphic

3220374
ssl	https
apparently apache was sourcing the .htaccess in the parent folder of the https ssl webroot folder

3220417
width	height
and when changing width and height of svg element both to 100 it looks like this which is not correct

3220418
folder	directory
now you should see .svn folder in every directory of your local project you donâ t see them if you use the â œ export â function of the scm panel from xcode

3220536
width	height
have the height to be 240 and the width variable

3220541
google-chrome	firefox
with firefox google-chrome it works

3220566

note i am not sure if the workbook based on a given template will inherited the properties defined using customdocumentproperties in the template

3220662
portrait	landscape
when the app rotates from portrait to landscape or back the font weight appears to slightly change

3220662
portrait	landscape
both bold text and regular text get slightly bolder in landscape and slightly thinner in portrait

3220693
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

3220700

the metaphor is pretty similar fork malloc wait free at a certain level

3220702
ggplot2	lattice

3220723
dictionary	map
i would just create a dictionary or map from abbreviation to full description

3220802
client-side	server-side
cookies are primarily for reading server-side local storage can only be read by the client-side

3220811
accessor	properties
it sounds like the properties is set to copy which means the synthesized accessor makes an immutable copy of the array

3220820
jsf	seam
nevertheless i m looking for a way to insert either number partially in a page of a jsf facelets seam application

3220835
ubuntu	linux
regarding python it is a very nice language and there is high usage mostly on linux platforms a lot of redhat ubuntu tools are written in python

3220835
unix	solaris
while this is not the case on unix platforms solaris hpux - python is not even installed by default on these which still lean more towards perl

3220860
button	checkbox
when the user wants to add another selection he she clicks a button checkbox radio..whatever

3220902
post	get
if you would post some real-world examples you probably would get a lot of suggestions here on so how to improve your code

3220908
operands	scalar
if either operands of scalar

3220909
datatrigger	eventtrigger
maybe datatrigger actiontrigger eventtrigger maybe by code xaml i don t care i just need a solution

3220948
g++	gcc
this compiles fine i m using g++ my gcc version is 4 4.4.1-1ubuntu2 but when i run the program it skips right over the return statement

3220955
cos	sin
going through the tutorial again today i noticed in chapter 5 of the tutorial not only a clear statement that llvm uses the abi application binary interface of the platform but also that the tutorial compiler depends on this to allow access to external functions such as sin and cos

3220961
hide	show
i would like to show a loading gif that does the following basically ajax_load_comments and pics are divs with animated gif backgrounds in comments and pics container respectively that show up on ajaxstart and hide on ajacstop

3220981
ibatis	mybatis
mybatis formerly ibatis has a schema migration tool for use on the command line

3220989

i ve been reworking this for the ipad and if you are holding the device in portrait or landscape modes everything works as intended the correct default image is used the correct image that is used to animate this off is used all orientations work fine

3221015
accessor	properties
if you have transient properties custom accessor non-entity properties etc in the game entity i would look there

3221016
ddms	adb
you can get the full stack trace via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse

3221038
width	height
first thing is first how can i get the height and width from an image

3221054
width	height
outside wpf you can use system.drawing.bitmap class width and height properties to get the size of an image

3221059
hex	binary
i think i ve figured the conversion part out but i can t edit the binary with the data because it seems that writebyte can only write hex values like 0xcd and there seems to be no way to store the hex value and still write it

3221072
mvp	presenter
i think you would lose a lot of those benefits with mvp as the view and presenter are more tightly coupled

3221077
hex	binary
you seem to be confused about hex vs decimal vs binary vs ascii

3221082
png	ico	icns	ico
check out - iconvert allows you to easily convert windows ico to mac os x icns svg to windows icons png ico to mac os x ico jpg images to windows icons and much more

3221088
gdk	cairo
to draw you can use either plain gdk which is more basic or use cairo which is more flexible drawing library nb

3221088
gtk	cairo
cairo is used by gtk anyway so it s not additional dependency

3221130
backgrounding	multitasking
look at multitasking under receiving location events in the backgrounding

3221167
pop-up	dialog
if this string is not empty then a pop-up confirmation dialog containing this string and some other boilerplate text provided from the browser

3221167
post	get
as a general rule any action that changes the state of the data on the server should be done through a post request rather than a get

3221190
post	get
the second and more robust way would be to implement the post redirect get pattern which when used prevents the data from being posted again when a user refreshes the page

3221193
int	chars
note that c must be an int or long or some other int type not a chars

3221193
int	chars
if it is a chars or unsigned chars the wrong overload will be called and individual chars will be extracted from the string not hexadecimal int strings

3221272
google-chrome	firefox
i don t want the automatic gray-out in firefox google-chrome

3221293
post	get
should i use in this case method post or method get for ajax form submission

3221293
post	get
when should be used post and when get in case of ajax form submission

3221355
post	get
modalbox obviously is managing the get post itself and unfortunately is losing 99 of the validations that the typical constraints block gives you

3221364
pascal	delphi
first of all i must state that i m a complete newb when it comes to delphi although i did some turbo pascal programming in school some fourteen years ago.

3221364
bde	dbase
i have a commercial delphi program which uses dbase database and bde for accessing them

3221364
bde	dbase
unfortunately using oledb against dbase results in broken indexes only native bde apps seem to be able to safely access the data

3221394
switching	screens
this isn t a deal-breaker as you can just avoid full screens mode but then you also lose the ability to use your own icon in the app switching tray

3221400

i m on a project where i was asked to take a quick peek at some reporting sql in a sql server 2k5 environment and was surprised at what i found 4 to 5 levels of subquerys distinct clauses union and nolock hints which were needed because the sql was running so long it was blocking standard processing - all in the same set

3221740
cpu	hyperthreading
now the jit produces native code for the cpu using various optimization algorithms which tend to be more aggressive than the default c++ optimizer that comes with visual studio and the instruction set used by the .net jit compiler are a closer reflection of the actual cpu on the machine so certain substitutions in the machine code could be made to reduce clock cycles and improve the hit rate in the cpu pipeline cache and produce further hyperthreading optimizations such us instruction reordering and improvements relating to branch prediction

3221745
post	get
in the former post bennett provides some reasons why he switched to using foreignkey instead of onetoonefield but i don t quite get it especially when i see other post that recommend the opposite

hash	salt
when you have confirmed that the passwords match and they are acceptable update the database store only a salt hash of my password not the password itself

3221877

3222082
put	get
if i write this bellow syntax get same out put but here i can not set table and column name

3222095
portrait	landscape
without more detail it s hard to say why your approach doesn t work but my guess is that you are seeing the sprite positioning you describe as a result of the fact that if you don t change orientation the lower left in portrait is the lower right in landscape when rotated left it s the same point in gl space 0 0

3222103
xna	spritebatch
i have looked into the layerdepth of spritebatch draw method calls but they appear to be unrelated to the xna framework draw order between the game and drawablegamecomponent classes

3223648
client-side	server-side
for performance issues you really want to study steve souders site and books etc -- steve was a server-side guru until measurement showed him the bottleneck was really client-side and then he turned himself into the client-side performance wizard

width	height
my first step when diagnosing layout problems is to remove every explicit height or width i can find

3224059
cvs	svn
however there are some commonly accepted facts for instance git is the fastest cvs is stable and tested svn is simple and mercurial seems more windows friendly

3224074
typedef	struct
you need to use the struct as the parameter to dealloc not the typedef

3224074
typedef	struct
also in c++ your struct name and typedef must not collide

3224114
cvs	svn
my opinion is that git and mercurial are superior in nearly every way to svn cvs - i think almost every developer who has used both systems in any meaningful way would agree

3224115
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop goes through each of the arrays element and checks to see if any element with such id is checked and if yes it alerts about that

3224133
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately the answer here is not straight forward given that this is working in firefox google-chrome and not ie

3224628
zlib	libjpeg
i ve cleared out every trace of libjpeg pil zlib from fink tried various compiler options etc

3233444
width	height
i am sending in the specific width and height for each image but when i view the individual images they load at a slightly oversized size they are a bit pixelated and then they focus down to the correct size ratio

3233444
width	height
most of the images are 300 x 400 and i am sending in 300 x 400 and the width and height so when i view in landscape mode i would expect the images to appear smaller than the overall screen or to size-up to fill the screen

you d have to recreate nodes above the current node i guess but not below assuming we have children pointers and not parent pointers

3233566
public	protected
get_name must be a protected or public function for classc or classb to access it

3233605
ant	maven
there s a page on the maven site that describes how to build for different environments that seems like it should meet your needs essentially it uses the maven antrun plugin to duplicate what you were doing previously with ant

3233626
width	height
i was under the impression that if i specified width height attributes for the img tag that i would get such placeholders for free without having to resort to some complex dhtml javascript wizardry but it doesn t seem to work

3233640

unlike the the sql union operator this implementation does not winnow duplicates we can use multiset union distinct for that

3233651

ubuntu	linux
however now i m compiling the same library with g++ on ubuntu linux 10.04 and i m seeing similar behavior and i wonder if it might have a similar root cause

3234060
folder	directory
if your goal is to build a different copy of your jar file for each environment where the only difference is what is in the resources folder then you can take advantage of the maven-resources-plugin and have it copy your configuration files from the predefined directory

3234075
16-bit	64bit
if intermediate results are kept in the registers without writing back to memory you effectively get 16-bit of extra precision in your calculations making them more precise but possibly divergent from results generated with write read of intermediate values to memory or from calculations on architectures that only have 64bit fp registers

3234089
min	max
min max will always return exactly 1 row containing requested number or null

3234124

3234342
ienumerable	iqueryable
t.posts.where is actually an extension on ienumerable rather than iqueryable so it seems like this might not be a good idea

3234352
google-chrome	safari
safari 5 allows to create extensions in a similar way of what google-chrome allows

3234383
for-loop	loops

integer	unsigned
if you are worried you can include and use types with defined lengths such as uint16_t for a 16-bit unsigned integer

3234602
ienumerable	iqueryable
you re exactly right - t.posts is an entitycollection in linq-to-sql it would be an entityset and as such implements ienumerable and not iqueryable

3234644
for-loop	loops
or just do a reverse for-loop where you start at the end and decrement on each loops

3234658
post	get
i want to load just one part of my document i had to use load function bcause of this so i tried this function.but i have a problem i want to set method of this function to post.i read in jquery manual that this function is using get method by default but if your data is an object it will use post method.i dont know how to do that

disk	ram
most unzip libraries will buffer the zip output in small sections and write to disk many times so shouldn t take up too much in way of ram

3234848
tostring	string.format

3234850
width	height
do you explicitly give the div tags a width a height in your css

3234850
width	height
i would suggest giving them each a width and height in your css if you didn t specify that in your external sheet already

ddms	adb
you need to learn how to debug in eclipse and how to use the adb and ddms tools

3234984
hide	show
i realise i could use ajax to pull the server code in although how do i refer to the server url.content won t work but this code is to handle page permissions ie the server data details what functions the user can access and the javascript functions are then used to show hide buttons based on that

post	get
the structure is the same even if ajax is used instead of http get post

3235170
put	get
edit another thought occurs to me if the fortran subroutine is huge in its execution time you should think about integrating it with java by having java put some input data into a file and modifying the fortran to get its inputs from the file

3235204
ienumerable	idictionary
i am using a idictionary but it allows one key for one value is there any way or ienumerable list that i can use to add value with teo keys

3235217
pull	push
ssis will pull data from one source transform it and push it to a target

3235242
superclass	subclassing
i ve got a number of subclassing inheriting extends from my superclass an android activity extension called superactivity

3235242
superclass	subclassing
as i mentioned i m subclassing that superclass that defines the anonymous inner class

3235242
superclass	subclassing
further if i take that mconnection variable holding the anonymous inner class and call getclass .getname on it or tostring on it it shows itself to be an inner class of my superclass and not of the subclassing

3235248
getter	setter
my question is the following one given that my jpa entity model and the model i want to use in the views are most of the time exactly the same is there a way of avoiding to have to create a batch of getter setter in the pagebean

3235394
post	get
the problem is that i dont have an svcfile and according to this post you must add a reference from a web-application to get it

3235397
jquery	simplemodal
i m using the simplemodal jquery plugin and it works great

3235397
width	height
however there are times that the width and height of the modal div need to be changed so i need the modal to automatically re-position itself in the center of the page

3235425
inherited	properties
if the html page uses quirks mode the style properties are not correctly inherited by the table

3235504
qgridlayout	qframe
the easiest way is to put a qframe to each of your qgridlayout s cell and move your content to these qframes

3235535
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

3235535
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values.

3235535
equals	gethashcode
so if i write an object and create a gethashcode method that does calculate a value only once and stores it inside the object to return it on later calls then i must again absolutely must create a equals method that will use stored values for the comparison so that a.equals b will never change from false to true as well

3235585
children	parent
parent application will initially create a global mutex with the name known by children

3235605
memcached	apc
apc stores values inmemory as memcached does but is way easier to install because it s not an extra daemon running but a php extension

3235625
fpc	dcu
1 and if delphi is like fpc .dcu s contain a crc of the interface section of all dcu s it depends on

3235689
versioning	upgrade
i want both apps to be able to access the same files for example a user of the free app gets some high scores then upgrade to the paid app - the high scores saved by the free versioning should be loaded into the paid app

3235701
min	max
my aim was to get the min max and avg value of the fields and render the result in another input field

3235701
min	max
this won t work because jquery library hasn t any min or max like js does

3235701
min	max
question how do i render the min and max values of some input-fields in one input-field

3235701
min	max
well it s just the avg and max min is deriveable

3235730
pull	push
what i want is to deny pull access for some files like i can do when i tried push comand

3235738
postgresql	mysql
bonus is that it teaches you sql not mysql not t-sql not postgresql not sql server just plain sql

3235872
getter	setter
if after all this you still want to not to write the getter and setter you can do

3235893
terminate	timeout
this function resets the timeout for a script after which it should be terminate

3235895
subtract	add
of the original length until this add subtract value is less than 1

3235940
for-loop	loops
is there a performance difference between a for-loop and a for-each loops

3235943
hash	salt
edit to prevent brute force attack you should add salt to your string and then apply hash function

3236010
typedef	struct
note that in c++ you don t need typedef to declare struct

3236053
hash	md5
in order to keep leading zeroes here is a small variation on what has paul suggested eg md5 hash

3236093
rss	feed
we have recently introduced version control in subversion in our development cycle and a team mate asked me today if it was possible to get all commit comments in an rss feed

3236111
put	get
i have defined campaignimages delete method and put some debugging code there but it does not get executed when campaign delete is called

3236127
rss	feed
as a roundabout way you can set up viewvc and it provides an rss feed

3236167
rss	feed
to generate an rss feed with subversion commits you will need to use a server side application the simplest one i ve come across is pyrss2gen a simple perl application

3236189
hash	md5
if size is an issue you ll find that md5 hash are also 128-bit long and that sha-1 hash are 160-bit long

3236216
postgis	hibernate-spatial
postgres postgis integration with hibernate-spatial

3236270
post	put
i never try with that many fonts but may be u can post fonts or something so that we can also try that bcoz it would be very difficult to download fonts and then put into plist

3236286
getter	setter
and i noticed that unfortunately it is not possible to declare a property with several getter setter that have different visibility modifiers - it would have been nice to have a private setter as well as a public one.

3236318
rss	feed
for example you might want to generate an atom or rss feed which are xml for the recent articles on a website

3236319
post	get
i need to get the forum name thread name and post message with the post id 32

3236323
min	max
interpret every two sequent intersection points as the min and max vectors of a axis aligned rectangle and mark all grid cells that lie inside this rectangle this is very easy intersection of two axis aligned rects especially considering that the rectangle has a width of 1 and therefore occupies only 1 column of your grid

3236337
client-side	server-side
there s an analogy with the local storage apis here now that the browsers have local storage apis you can use sql in the browser to store things in the local database - but just because you are writing sql in the client-side code and in the server-side code doesn t mean they are operating on the same data.

3236358
getter	setter
it s probably not worth setting up private getter setter for those unless you re managing setter side-effects or getter calculations

3236395
inherited	properties
the controllercontext properties is not assigned to in any of the base constructors in your inherited hierachy

3236411
rss	feed
as a non programmer i ve broken my app down into smaller projects a project for each main function of my app twitter rss feed 3rd party api etc etc

3236445
inherited	subclassing
in my case the class hasn t got any subclassing so no need to take inherited into account

3236550
doc	rtf
perhaps a cleaner approach to the code of the report generation will make it easier for the fr converter to create the rtf doc output.

3236551
content-disposition	content-type
for headers that use parameters such as content-type or content-disposition the encoding defined in rfc 2231 can be an alternative

3236563
hide	show
i am building a .net c# web application in which i have a tabbed panel layout and when the user clicks on each of the tabs the display panel is updated using javascript to hide and show some divs

3236563
hide	show
using a function like this to show and hide tabs

3236608
getter	setter
... given that my jpa entity model and the model i want to use in the views are most of the time exactly the same is there a way of avoiding to have to create a batch of getter setter in the pagebean

3236612
poe	anyevent
there are many good event based frameworks in perl e.g poe and anyevent poe is a specific event loop with lots of modules and features and anyevent is an abstraction layer that lets you use multiple event loops in the same code

3236635
actualheight	actualwidth
i have a problem in getting actualheight and actualwidth of image control in wpf

3236650
put	get
for folder put a get parameter in the link

3236650
folder	dir
note that you must keep in mind that if you let anyone use the script they will be able to open any folder by changing the dir parameter

3236656
folder	directory
for example if i knew you just used the code above i could enter the folder path to the default password directory and view the files

3236683
mouse	keyboard
given that android has no mouse a keyboard that would allow as much as possible of the vim shortcuts would be awesome

3236737
button	checkbox
are you trying to implement the functionality of checkbox using a button

3236752
getter	setter
that sounds like a lot of work just to generate getter and setter methods

3236752
getter	setter
why not just use eclipses getter and setter generator

3236761
getter	setter
practically spoken i usually use approach 3 - i just code the fields and use eclipse ide to autogenerate getter and setter methods

3236761
getter	setter
with the ide s autogeneration tools you can even define the visibility of the generated getter setter methods you might want to limit the setter visibility to private or edit the template if you need additional code the the method bodies

3236765
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am getting expected behaviour in firefox safari and google-chrome

3236796
getter	setter
it s do-able but now your code isn t strictly java in the sense that if someone takes it and runs javac on it they ll get a class without getter and setter

3236796
getter	setter
this will make debugging difficult as all the line numbers will be messed up and unless you re very sure you ve done the right thing with your annotation processor you won t even be able to see the source of the getter and setter to correct mistakes

3236797
width	height
parameters height width left screenx screeny etc

3236865
width	height
i have to set my width and height on the

3236874

if it s a different machine you need to use curl or another solution to do a put or post

3236893
division	logarithm
otherwise you could think of it mathematically using the laws on logarithm and thus take division out of the equation altogther

3236903
google-chrome	firefox
firefox in ubuntu is usr lib firefox-addons plugins and google-chrome is opt google-chrome plugins

3236951
int	chars
also having nothing to do with the index issue a column like this a code flag value is better as a fixed width value chars 1 tiny int etc where a alert or 1 alert

3236975
lua	scheme
i haven t embedded cl before but i ve done it with both lua and two particular scheme implementations gambit-c and gnu guile

3236975
lua	scheme
lua has closures but you won t get continuations like in scheme and you also won t get the macros

3236982
libs	buildpath
this way eclipse will automatically add the server-specific libs to the project s buildpath

3237021
quicksort	mergesort
the two most popular fast sort algorithms are mergesort and quicksort

mac platform browsers firefox safari even after validatemytext returns false onclick event is triggered which submits the form

3237035
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
now it has to be enhanced to work on all the browsers firefox safari google-chrome ie on windows and firefox safari on mac

3237048
width	height
but this basic thing is really confusing me changing the width height of a sprite does not affect it s visual contents - either graphics drawn within it or any children it may have

3237048
width	height
my code below doesn t affect the visual display at all - but it does set the width height at least according to the trace output

3237055

its all working fine except when the post gets too lengthy it doesnt get tweeted because twitter has just 140 character limit my baby nephew can handle more characters than that

so what is the best way to shorten the url like bit.ly or tinyurl

3237076
post	get
its not working for get or post both

3237081
google-chrome	firefox
i think this is better than trying to hash compress these real parameter values because this way browsers like firefox or google-chrome will enable the user to search on these strings while typing in the address bar

3237088
tinyurl	bit.ly
so i d go with using a service like bit.ly or tinyurl as you suggested

3237135
google-chrome	firefox

i see that no one has mentioned introsort which solves quicksort s o n 2 worst case by switching to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a certain threshold

3237246
gauge	progress
i want to set gauge object in alert to show the progress but it is giving java.lang.illegalargumentexception

3237265
width	height
but just looking at your code i wonder why you translate on the z-axis using what i understand to be x and y values width and height

3237306
awt	swing
you basically only need to replace the applet controller by a servlet based one and the swing awt based view by a jsp html css js based one

3237323
lan	localhost
to make your gae accessible on your lan you have to configure the launcher to use the address 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost

3237447
cos	sin
i know that sin is opposite hypotenuse in a right angled triangle and cos is adjacent hypotenuse

and why does it use cos on one line and sin on other

3237455
post	get
i m sorry it took me so long to get back to this post

3237457
ant	maven
there are eclipse plugins for each along with ant tasks maven plugins etc

the cos and sin values represent the sine and cosine of that angle

3237495
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
although you may think of sine and cosine as something you would need to know the length of three sides of a triangle to calculate there are methods to calculate them using ordinary arithmetic addition subtraction multiplication division

submit	submission
when a captivate sco running on firefox submit a status update to one of the js functions captivate does not wait for a success or fail response before submission the next status update

you are changing the width height of the sprite

3237568

3237568
children	parent
and changing the parent will not automatically resize the parent s children

3237574
google-chrome	firefox
obviously it s an issue with firefox 3.6 since google-chrome and ie both underline the button-text

post	get
it is difficult to say without a backtrace and code from your post model but if you were to run the same code in your console do you get the same error

google-chrome	firefox
i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb

3237607
javassist	cglib
because persistence providers make proxies of objects using some library like cglib or javassist

i am currently developing an rss feed reader and i am wondering which xml parsing api would be the best fit for that

3237629
children	parent

jaxp	stax
it can be a java standard dom sax stax jaxp or an implementation-specific api

put	get
totally new to objective-c and core data coming from a .net background i really want to put all of my fetch requests into some sort of class that i can call preferably statically to get my objects something like

3237697
width	height
i would continue to use graphics.measurestring but you need to add logic that will simulate a word wrap by dividing the resulting string width with the control width ie you calculate how textbox widths fit in your string width to get your rows and then multply the string height by this

3237754
kde	kubuntu
i am using kubuntu the kde desktop

in the past three years i ve used prototype scriptaculous and jquery

3238985
folder	directory
first i created a directory in the root folder of the solution called scripteddevdellregistration

3239027
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve worked with jquery scriptaculous and mootools and i would highly recommend jquery which seems to trump a lot of the other frameworks in its ease of use

3239105
hide	show
its a simple show hide but with lots of things to show and hide

3239120
implements	extends
there is an abstract class role which also implements the person interface for decorator substitution equivalence and a roleimpl class that extends it

3239174
put	get
to get the first row of info and i could put my title and content where i want them on my page

3239251
post	get
doing a 302 will typically cause clients to convert a post to a get request

3239270
firefox	safari
this works great in firefox and safari but it fails in mobile safari

3239286
width	margin
i ve seen css techniques where people will use a negative margin to reverse the added pixels created from the box model but it still won t reduce the width

3239286
width	margin
so basically what i want is a technique that will allow me to keep a 10 width but 10px of that 10 be padding or margin or what not

3239288
width	height
set the image as the background of your h1 set the width height so it fits then set your text-indent to something crazy like -9999px

3239297
m2e	pom.xml
i don t work with rad so i m not sure my answer will be totally accurate but when working with eclipse m2e takes care of the .classpath and the .project files and everything is derived from the pom.xml not the other way around

3239297
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
i don t think so m2e won t translate a random dependency that may not be available in any repo into a maven artifact and add the coordinates to the pom.xml

3239329
rss	feed
more specifically large xml webpages rss feed

3239351
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
case all child view controllers in your uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller do not agree on a common orientation set

3239456
mp3	wav
i ve also looked a bit at silverlight 4 since it supports recording wav audio but i m not clear on how to tackle the uploading and encoding to mp3 bit

3239470
mouse	keyboard
it allows you to keep your hands on the keyboard longer rather than switching back and forth between keyboard and mouse

3239470
for-loop	loops
pesky things like type declarations optimizing an old-style for-loop to use the new jdk-5 type of loops removing redundant value assignments or unused variables

3239481
feof	fread
so is it incorrect to call feof before an fread in php

3239485
unix	solaris
get all git dependencies as listed in this solaris package site but this works for any unix platform

3239504
qgraphicsitem	qobject
eventfilter has a param that gives you a qobject but since qgraphicsitem isn t derived from qobject then how would it work

3239514
onfocus	onblur
note best practices advise you should avoid those global vars and that you attach event listeners for the onblur and onfocus events rather than inlining them

3239541
awt	swing
android development is primarily gui development which like swing awt in java consists of lots of anonymous inner classes reacting to gui events

3239567
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on ie firefox google-chrome all latest

3239573
onfocus	onblur
alternatively you could as suggested add remove a specific class to the element onfocus onblur

3239580
hide	show
there are lots of ways to hide and show page content but a common approach is to wrap it in a block marked hidden using css and then use some javascript jquery to toggle it hidden or unhidden

3239580
hide	show
see the documentation for show hide and toggle for more usage examples

3239591
qgraphicsitem	qobject
you can not install an event filter to qgraphicsitem directly since it s not a qobject

3239591
qgraphicsitem	qobject
if you are deriving your own qgraphicsitem inherit from qgraphicsobject so it will gain qobject functions

3239593
qgraphicsitem	qobject
create a new class derived from both qgraphicsitem and qobject since these are unrelated as far as a glance at the docs tells me you should have what you wanted

3239603
regression	least-squares
because the data can represent a line that is vertical as i understand it the usual least-squares regression line won t work for this data set

3239603
regression	least-squares
a perpendicular least-squares regression line might work but i ve had little luck finding an implementation of one

3239631
width	margin
another option is to manually calculate the width margin padding

3239652
hide	show
is there a way to do a string comparison with touppercase between a given string value and the link text as show above in the span collection and if it doesn t match hide the span

3239704
google-chrome	safari
however in the webkit browsers safari and google-chrome the poster is dumped in favor of the first frame from the video as soon as the video metadata is fetched

3239733
subtraction	addition
2 when certain colors are given limegreen wierd results are seen in the image returned from the function i beleive this is due to overflow of the byte type in the addition or subtraction case

3239763
width	height
i tried using the basic twitter widget with different width height but the font sizes are frankly quite small and it doesn t let you edit any of it

3239791
twitter	myspace
authlogicconnect looks like it works for many sites twitter facebook linkedin myspace google yahoo

3239834
firefox	safari
all of these work on firefox and safari on the pc but not on the ipad

3239856
subtraction	addition
if you want to support better than just addition and subtraction you could do it as an eval if you are careful about how data gets into #number

3239864
versioning	upgrade
first and foremost upgrade to the newest versioning and see what happens with the bought and built modules

3239866
maven	m2e
are you using a maven plugin for eclipse such as m2e

3239918
min	max
the basic rule is that if you re using aggregate functions min max avg etc. then all of the columns in the select statement must be in an aggregate function or a part of the group by clause

3239924
getter	setter
private field + getter setter

3239979
post	get
you can build off zachary s answer and take it a step further by creating a wcf service and switching your .ajax call to be a get instead of a post

3239985
try-catch	exception-handling
if however the intent is to handle an exception-handling and continue executing place the code in separate try-catch blocks

3239987
microchip	avr	avr	microcontroller
many small microcontroller microchip pic avr intel 8051 cypress psoc etc. have a harvard architecture

3240005
getter	setter
this is done for easy scripting later on instead of having 20+ getter setter

3240018
superclass	subclassing
what s the proper way to cast the subclassing back to the superclass

3240019
google-chrome	safari
this works in almost all browser ie7 8 mozilla safari google-chrome except ie6

3240038
pop-up	dialog
on-click it will pop-up with a jquery dialog box which all works great and dandy

3240052
superclass	subclassing
matlab does not allow you to create arrays containing a mix of superclass and subclassing objects because an array can be of only one class

3240089
post	get
if you can post some code of your actual fetcher maybe you will get some tips on how you could use mocks

3240091
hide	show
i was thinking i could just use multiple select fields and use javascript to hide show the appropriate subfields when the selected frequency indicated i didn t need them

3240168
post	get
accept post only no get to prevent csrf

3240217
jar	manifest.mf
the database driver usually resides in a different jar file and if the classpath entry in your manifest.mf file is blank then the driver can t be loaded

3240222
x509certificate	bouncycastle
however i have decided to use bouncycastle and its instance of x509certificate only has a getpublickey

3240250
google-chrome	safari
so far i have discovered that this is because safari and google-chrome do not accept the focus blur events for check box or radio buttons

3240260
put	get
so typically if you want to get rid of the movieplayer s view you need to put in the didexitfullscreen notification handler

3240278
x86	64bit
i m on a 64bit machine and am running c program files x86 microsoft sdks windows v7.0a bin netfx 4.0 tools x64 fuslogvw.exe

3240286
jar	war
although i would probably just use a properties file located in a directory on the classpath outside of the ear war jar deployment structure

3240288
hash	md5
a helper class for cache reads writes cleanups methods for saving restoring bitmapdrawable s as pngs creating a md5 hash for cached file name

3240292
children	parent
this is advantageous since when a parent is deleted it will delete any children is has automatically removing the need for much of the memory management that comes with c++

3240315
qgraphicsscene	qobject	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicsitem	qobject
qgraphicsitem s are not qobject but they still receive events managed by their qgraphicsscene

3240315
qgraphicsview	qmouseevent
also note that some event classes change in qgraphicsview context qmouseevent becomes qgraphicsscenemouseevent so make sure to filter for the right thing

3240343
put	get
personally i prefer to either use the oledb way which is a bit clunky at best at times or you can use a third party library that has put in the time effort energy to get access to the data

3240365
post	get
in my opinion if the way in which you retrieve the title property in the create get method is good enough for those requests it s equally good enough to re-create it in the same way in the post requests

3240378
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
it works well for addition and subtraction but how can it support multiplication

3240379
ready	each
on document ready grab the height of each div and then force the shorter one to a height equal to the taller one

3240384
jquery	scriptaculous
the combination of no database code generated html no templates and javascript scriptaculous jquery raphaeljs works out really well

3240386
jquery	jqmodal
for instance if i open an ajax modal on the page perform some actions and close and then go open one of the inline modals on the page perform some actions and then attempt to close i am getting wierd jquery jqmodal javascript errors such as the following

3240391
google-chrome	firefox
t return data in ie but does in firefox and google-chrome

3240420
hash	salt
you can re-use the salt of the hash password in the database for this if you like

3240421
hgrc	hgignore
the hgrc man page says you can link a user specific ignore file hgignore by including something like this in your .hgrc

3240425
int	chars
bufferedreader.read returns the chars read as an int in the range 0 to 65535

3240434
content-length	content-type
the audio files mp3 i am working with are stored in mysql and pulled into the browser by a php script that sends the content-length and content-type headers ahead of the data

3240434
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox opera google-chrome ie 6 7 8

3240457
equals	gethashcode
did you override the equals and gethashcode methods for your accountviewmodel class

3240479
octal	hex
you can do the conversion with any type hex octal ..

3240517
hash	md5
if you want this kind of security you probably be better out if you save the passwords as a md5 hash

3240534
int	double
the other thing you can do is to recompile perl with -duse64bitint -duselongdouble which will force perl to internally use 64 bit int and long double floating point numbers

3240596
sequence	permutation
of course for a document with more than a few sequence there are too many different possible segmentation permutation to brute-force evaluate all of their costs

3240613
firefox	safari
safari was fine with me using text as a variable name sloppy of me i know but it gave an error in firefox

3240616
gesturedetector	motionevent
what you do is create an instance of gesturedetector override the ontouchevent method of the view you are interested in detecting gestures for and pass the motionevent to the gesturedetector

3240630
superclass	subclassing
natural and juridico are subclassing of the superclass cliente

3240640
uiview	calayer
uiview are backed by core animation layers and even opengl es renders into a calayer which can be placed in a view

3240685
pop-up	dialog
an installation dialog pop-up out of the blue

3240714
next	except
and i want to use a batch to periodically move all these files to another folder except the newest one in01_acct_20100709001.r because this file is sometimes still being written on and moving it might lead file override in the destination folder in the next run of the batch and causes file content lost

3240766
wordpress	joomla	teamsite	interwoven
why would i chose something like interwoven teamsite as opposed to joomla django wordpress etc

3240780
getter	setter
the basic idea is to have a builder class that has setter but usually not getter for the different constructor parameters

3240827
subtract	add
right now i m accomplishing this by simply querying all places and then subtract visited and planned from the results but i want to add in pagination and i m worried this could complicate that

3240850
for-loop	loops
nevermind i figured it out...for loops variables have to have double percentage signs while the command line versions only use single percentage sign for-loop variables...i added another to each variable in my for-loop and now it works perfectly

3240858
post	get
if you re looking for how to get your database structure not data in source control since it was mentioned in the title then you should check out this coding horror post get your database under version control

3240880
ssms	sqlcmd
to execute such a thing in an environment outside ssms or sqlcmd you will need to execute them separately implement your own batch separator

3240907
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox safari and google-chrome

3240912
post	get
if i could say if i call this via http get show the form if i call this via http post process then redirect to the default

3240927
webrat	cucumber
my cucumber step fails but only in webrat

3240927
webrat	cucumber
rails cucumber webrat redirect_to flash notice not working

3240928
postgresql	mysql
the database systems that i am interested in are sql server 2008 mysql and postgresql 9.0

3240951
hash	salt
in the first comment raise suggest using a salt hash of the id instead of the id itself

3240951
hash	salt
you ll need a new fields in your users table for the hash the salt need not be stored the id won t change and your url will look like miembros hash slug

3240975
width	height
the problem is that shopify doesn t add width and height attributes to images that are in the blog posts

3240975
width	height
when i load these into flash the width and height of the image is ignored and the height of the textfield is incorrectl which screws up my scrollbar among other things

3240975
width	height
is there any way to read the width and height of the images as they are loaded

3240999
int	chars
fahad pointer arithmetic goes by the size of the datatype it points.so when ur pointer is of type int you should expect pointer arithmetic in the size of int 4 bytes .likewise for a chars pointer all operations on the pointer will be in terms of 1 byte

3241003
opera	google-chrome
tested on ie5.5+ ff2+ google-chrome opera 9.6+

3241027
put	get
but it will also put pressure on java developers to up their game and produce better stuff - or get buried in the flood

3241030
lift	wicket
lift has strengths that wicket doesn t

3241030
lift	wicket
lift s ajax support is far less verbose than wicket s

3241053
getter	setter
i disagree with user no when he says that business objects require setter and getter methods

3241061
feedback	review
the software specification which can often be an appendix to a contract should most certainly be seen by developers but actual review sign off and or providing feedback prior to the contract being signed is often limited to architects product managers project managers technical leads and similar more senior roles

3241075
x86	64bit
on an x86 32bit kernel this works fine but when i recompile my program on an x86_64 64bit kernel i get runtime errors like this

3241075
put	get
is there some flag i can put in my makefile.am to get this to work on x86_64

3241076
google-chrome	firefox
if i type in a password like test1234 it passes in google-chrome and firefox but the message that my password should contain a minimum of 7 characters with at least one numeric character is shown in internet explorer

3241081
getter	setter
i don t know why another obvious choice hasn t been suggested but i would consider another approach where you just define interfaces and use a library that implements specified setter getter and internal fields needed

3241081
javassist	cglib
i would expect such libraries to exist but if not writing general-purpose one should be quite doable using byte code generation libs asm cglib janino javassist whatever

3241092
treemap	treeset
treemap and treeset and all these should throw a runtimeexception if the object you put in does not implement comparable

3241092
comparator	comparable
to use comparator it does a cast to comparable which is the source of the exceptions

3241100
client-side	server-side
the login form posts to a server-side script on clients domain to perform authentication sets up a server-side session and sets a client-side session cookie

3241100
client-side	server-side
this login form then redirects to a script on the third-party vendors domain posting the username and password and setting up a server-side session and client-side session cookie on the third-party vendors domain

3241120
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie 8 google-chrome works fine

3241150
width	height
if you use the bitmapdata class you can get access to the width and height of images along with other useful properties and methods

3241166
google-chrome	firefox
also turn on your console in google-chrome or firefox to see a potential javascript error

3241178
git-rebase	undo
bottom line if you really don t want a branchy history use git-rebase -- don t update into uncommitted changes as it s hard to undo

3241195
stdout	stderr
i believe the prompt is going to stderr not stdout so you ll have to open a stream connected to that and read there

3241226
portrait	landscape
to answer that question they are still often used as the master view controller the left pane in landscape or the popover in portrait

3241273
button	checkbox
is there a method to uncheck a checkbox in a wx.checklistbox as i need to implement an uncheck all button can t seem to find anything.

3241280
comparator	comparable
i think if a class has a natural ordering it is more usual in java for it to implement comparable rather than have a comparator implementation for each class

3241280
comparator	comparable
thus if the objects in question have a natural ordering defined they must implement comparable and have the comparator method defined

3241280
comparator	comparable
so long story short implement comparable whenever you want to impose a natural ordering on a class only use a comparator when you want something other than the natural ordering

3241300
globalization	localization
.net has localization and globalization support throughout intended for just this kind of thing

3241314
internationalization	localization
in this case i would say yes it is bad practice -- because you likely want internationalization and localization expansion

3241352
postgresql	mysql
in mysql this is valid but apparently not in postgresql

3241417
width	margin
the first one means what you probably think it means any html element with the class class-name will have a margin of 0 width for each side ie

3241421
google-chrome	firefox
and it works great on firefox google-chrome and internet explorer as far as i can see

3241495
sorting	filtering
is it possible to grab the data used by the radgrid to populate the grid after all filtering and sorting has been applied

3241505
hide	show
the cursor is on the button to hide show the console

3241519
uiview	cashapelayer
initial investigation also brought me across references to the cashapelayer class though i m guessing this might be much the same as implementing the uiview subclassing technique

3241531
sorting	filtering
in the end care needs to be taken to handle paging sorting and filtering at the data access level so that you only retrieve the rows you want to actually show the user

3241554
hash	salt
it s probably i don t know generating a salt hash

3241559
fadein	fadeout
depending on your requirements you might also be able to use fadein and fadeout respectively

3241561
postgresql	mysql
i m mainly only considering the following systems sql server 2008 mysql and postgresql 9.0

3241567
int	chars
the types should be the same in other words if your datatable has int chars int then your output parameters should be int chars int

3241576
children	parent
when you create the mdi children forms from the mdi parent you should subscribe the mdi parent form to the mdi child form s gotfocus event

3241607
post	put	post	get	put	get
you could represent each row as an object and use an http get request to retrieve it an http post to update it and an http put or http post to insert new entries

3241627
gif	png
does anyone have any ideas on excluding files like gif png jpg and other files that don t require searching

3241628
websphere	ibm
you might want to look at ibm s retail integration framework and ibm websphere remote server as the software bundle

3241638
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu at least activating a network interface runs the scripts in etc network if-up.d and there is a symmetric if-down.d directory for deactivation

3241643
width	height
they are likely changing the css attributes for width height and font size

3241654
groovy	gsp
i m having trouble with groovy server pages gsp where utf-8 chars are not showing propertly and instead displaying as

3241654
versioning	upgrade
thinking that was versioning problem i upgrade to 1.3.3 and the problem still happens but now on localhost too

3241675
haskell	ocaml
my target languages are python and clojure but i certainly wouldn t mind seeing any ocaml or haskell implementations

3241702
subtract	add
when they click the button either subtract or add to the cell value have a low and high number of zeros

3241731
mouse	keyboard
it contains a bunch of classes and units that greatly simplify the interface to the multimedia components on a computer such as directx opengl keyboard mouse and other inputs sound and music etc

3241765
client-side	server-side
in gwt you use java language on both the server-side and the client-side compiled to javascript and will handle all the implementation details on the asynchronous communication under the hood

3241808
stdout	stderr
the other reason is that subprocess provides better handling of errors and better redirection of stdin stdout and stderr

3241830
qtableview	qcombobox
i have some embedded qcombobox in a qtableview

3241852
opera	google-chrome	mouse	trackpad
i ve also had this happen on some other websites they work fine with normal mice or on google-chrome or opera with a trackpad or magic mouse

3241868
ggplot2	gridextra
i am trying to put multiple ggplot2 time series plots on a page using the gridextra package s arrange function

3241907
google-chrome	firefox
if you don t set a z-index value firefox and google-chrome will display auto and ie 0

3241976
put	get
i don t use tags at all we leave released versions on the trunk and put a log comment on them that way we never modify a released version we have to release a new version of the latest code but that fits our product suite we d get bogged down in hundreds of tags otherwise and customers never want an older version - they always get the latest

3242028
width	height
i know the width and height of the

3242062
awt	swing
i m fairly new to swing awt et al and hence the question

3242068
min	max
also you can establish upper and lower limits to the amount of memory buffer pool used by the sql server database engine with the min server memory and max server memory configuration options

3242089
put	get
if you actually want to get a cheap board the current trend from micro developers is to put a dev kit on a usb thumb stick

3242124
googletest	cppunit
googletest s api is a bit more modern than boost.test but boost test has done an amazing job of adding new features and ditching the crufty cppunit paradigm

3242153
google-chrome	firefox
when i try this test code below on page load i get different figures for firefox + google-chrome

3242156
children	parent
i think your best bet would be to use a formview control for your parent and then bind your children to a grid inside of it

3242164
rsa	dsa
obviously this assumes that the certificate includes a rsa key but the same result can be achieved for dsa with dsacryptoserviceprovider and dsaparameters

3242175
inherited	properties
basically i would like a simple easy one-file way to parse an ini file with advanced features like section inherited and properties nesting like zend_config_ini

3242203
multiplying	modulo
so if you had to take the square root of a -ve number then it is same as multiplying the square root of its modulo by the imaginary number i

3242229
google-chrome	safari
tested in google-chrome safari ie8 ie7 ie6 add the filename to end of url

3242230
children	parent
if you will only every need to do breadth-first search bfs that is select only immediate parent or children of a single forum code like you wrote it and django orm will be great

3242253
keydown	keyup
so just change the keyup to keydown and you should be good to go

3242256
integer	unsigned
i was also wondering if there is a way of storing an integer unsigned it s easier on an arbitrary number of bytes

3242309
pull	push
when either of us pull push to the server

3242318
setinterval	settimeout
when you pass a string to setinterval or settimeout it s executed in a global context

3242354
for-loop	loops
a for-loop in python is really like a foreach loops in c# i think visual c++ has it too

3242370
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and inkscape opens those files perfectly

3242385
client-side	server-side
since silverlight is client-side and asp.net is server-side you will need to use serialization in order to pass objects between the two

3242393
post	put
if you want to post back you can use __dopostback that asp.net put into the

3242407
firefox	safari
the php is on a remote server so i need to load a web browser instance safari or firefox and instruct it to load the url ie

3242427
hide	show
the tab bar is its own window handle and the tpagecontrol is responsible for listening to tab changes and making the corresponding hide show of pages

3242427
hide	show
so when you click on a tab and the tab jumps to the front of the pack the tpagecontrol is supposed to hide the current page window and show the page window corresponding to the selected tab

3242457
width	height
i think scale should be converted to height and width instead of using scale as a variable in these formulas since your original image could be any size assuming they re not always going to be 100x150 per your sample

3242493
gif	png
to answer your update sprites are ideal for many small images where the overhead of a new http request outweighs the few bytes being sent for a small png or gif 16x16 icons etc

3247526
maven	m2e
m2e provides support for it assuming you have maven integration for wtp installed and your project should be recognized as a dynamic web project runnable on a server

3247526
maven	cargo
there are other options like using the tomcat maven plugin or the generic cargo maven plugin but i wouldn t use them for development and since you are a maven beginner i don t recommend them at all

3247549
inherited	properties
casting the user control this way may create many problems .my approach is to create a class say control class put all the properties and method you need for casting in it and inherited this class from system.web.ui.usercontrol .then in your user cotrol code file instead of system.web.ui.usercontrol user this control class

3247551

the code to calculate the distance between two polygons should be easy enough

3247584
jsf	wicket	vaadin	wicket	vaadin	jsf
i think you chose wisely either wicket or gwt are what are you looking for event mentioned vaadin jsf etc.

3247612
jsf	wicket
keep in mind the features you get from it are going to be bare minimum and you are obviously not going to get all the bells and whistles like what s provided by jsf wicket etc

3247662
jar	war
for the war file in the generated web service i use a axis2 1.4 ws engine whose jar files are inserted by eclipse galileo into the project s web-inf lib directory when creating the webservice from the given worker class in the dynamic web project

3247671
public	protected
i though that when you use public inheritance the protected variables are still visible to the derived class

3247696
getter	setter
i m not sure to understand why you have several getter and setter on the same field

3247702
width	height
your scalewidth and scaleheight should be scale factors so not very big numbers but your code seems to pass in the actual width and height you re looking for

3247702
width	height
for one thing your code always has either scalewidth width or scaleheight height and changes only one of them so you re going to be distorting the aspect ratio of your image as well

3247702
width	height
shouldn t you be checking for width maxwidth or height maxheight

3247744
folder	directory
nservicebus does not relocate anything it runs entirely in the bin debug folder when in visual studio or the installed directory when run directly

3247751

once you ve got your post then use the appropriate attachment function s to get the information on the attachment size you re after

3247793
post	get
jquery ajax post then get to update the page

3247802
opera	firefox
in fact the only time you re really benefited by switching to flash is in ie firefox and opera when you ve got an mp4 to play and in all browsers when you ve got an flv

3247805
ostringstream	std
i have come across a situation on win32 where the std ostringstream object continues to consume process memory even when it is ostensibly cleared out after a series of append-type operations

3247856
decoder	encoder
let me provide an example i used a local class in my jpeg decoder encoder when i read configurations from the file which will determine further decoding process

3247946
gridview	detailsview
basically this is the behaviour we would get from the combination of a gridview and detailsview in web forms

3247976
width	height
you should be able to just set the width and height of your loader

it renders two input fields to define the min and max values for a query

3247981

3247988
opera	safari
what calendar control do you recommend that will work on nokia safari opera

3247994
wordpress	phpbb	wordpress	joomla	joomla	phpbb
not knowing details i d bet that somewhere on the account you have a piece of open source software such as joomla phpbb wordpress or similar

3247999
stdio	puts
well stdio s puts returns a non-negative number on success or eof on error

3248030
next	except
since the coroutine switcher won t ever switch things except at yield calls either routine can freely alter shared state so long as it ensures that everything in in order before the next yield and is prepared for the other routine to alter state during the yield

3248120
pop-up	dialog
if you are using basic server authentication which i think you are based on the pop-up dialog i would recommend using asihttprequest

3248201
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i have a uitableview with custom cells that were defined in the xib file and am experiencing poor scrolling performance choppy on my device when the cells have a uisegmentedcontrol on them

qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i have used qgraphicsview qgraphicsscene classes in order to show a picture in a widget like this

3248257

after much wailing and gnashing of teeth i found the excellent open source imagetools library for silverlight which provides encoders and decoders for jpg bmp gif and png

3248279
express	node.js
the problem is i m completely new to node.js and express its sinatra-like web framework and i have no idea how to cache the friends array so i only need to load it once ideally into memory

3248304
put	get
i can put carstestsuite.class.getname but i d like to use the method to get the class name so that i never have to edit it

3248357
haskell	ocaml
the code is ocaml but it s useful and not too difficult to be able to translate ocaml to haskell in your head when working through papers like this

3248372
decltype	auto
yes vc10 provide some c++0x featrues auto decltype r-value reference etc and std tr1 inside std namespace and it s not optional afaik

3248382
udp	tcp
from you pov tcp connections will always somehow work whereas with udp you ll have to take care of packet sequencing packets missings etc

3248405
hide	show
what s happening is that when i click the link once everything s fine the textbox show and hide

3248405
hide	show
but if i keep clicking the edit link the textbox will show and hide the number of times that the link has been clicked ie

3248450
pull	push
however here is a much more xsl-esque version that stores the mappings in a variable to dispense with the mapping template and uses push processing apply-templates instead of pull processing

3248511
postgresql	mysql
for example in postgresql i think mysql is similar

3248654
put	get
generally unscoped variables get put into the variables scope so you can use struct bracket notation to refer to them

3248686
google-chrome	safari
the sprite menu works with every browser i ve tested ff3.6 ie8 7 6 google-chrome safari

3248702
free	malloc
and any malloc that isn t free is free at program termination

3248734
width	height
i have a div with border-radius set to some value let s say 10px and a nested div that is the full width and height of its parent

3248761
hide	show
if the user selects another country different than united states or canada the state select menu should hide and a regular text field should show see html structure below

3248808
post	get
although this is acceptable for a post form it is not particularly ideal in a get url because we end up with urls resembling

3248841
folder	directory
i don t care if it s the main stkgui folder or the scripts folder--as long as it s within the application s directory structure i can work with it

3248924
matlab	simulink
in my simulink model are some embedded matlab functions

3248997
width	height
nothing else is changed but the only way to do that is to change the whole frame and in the animation instead of the height growing the object just snaps to the top of the screen with the proper width and height and just moves downward into place instead of staying in place and just simply growing

3249031
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in the 2nd view put the code that loads the data in the viewwillappear method not the viewdidload method

3249043
width	height
in general the current position width and height are stored in

3249049
getter	setter
updated this will happen despite having the mapping getter and setter

3249090
uitableview	reloaddata
checkout nstimer and uitableview reloaddata

3249123
subtract	add
thats right except at the start you need to subtract 50 to bring the polygon center back to 0 then at the end add 50 to bring the polygon back to its orignal position

3249129
subtract	add
you should subtract 50 from each component this causes 50 50 to be the center do the rotation and then add 50 to each component

3249133
filewriter	printwriter
i am using filewriter printwriter to write to the file flush it close it but i get am getting an exception thrown

3249136
hide	show
if so you can use .ajaxstart and .ajaxcomplete methods to show and hide animation

3249153
filewriter	bufferedwriter
maybe you re closing the wrong writer handle you should be closing the outermost writer if you wrapped a filewriter in a bufferedwriter you should close bufferedwriter instead or doing it too late calling desktop#open inside try while you re doing close in finally

3249186
width	text-align
i ve used a bit of jquery to vertically align the images but i thought the text-align center and 100 width would be enough to keep them in place

3249222
min	max
first one to get count min max and avg

3249233
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested to work on firefox but not in google-chrome or most importantly safari

3249243
rss	feed
there are many libraries that work with rss atom feed in general depending on your language of choice

3249243
gdal	ogr
two libraries that handle georss are ogr gdal and if you re using django geodjango which supports geographic feeds

3249248
sorting	filtering
there you will find a section on sorting and filtering which gives an example of how to use a text field to search for rows containing the specified text

3249278
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
every uiviewcontroller on the uinavigationcontroller s stack will return the uinavigationcontroller object when calling navigationcontroller on it

3249278
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
poptorootviewcontrolleranimated will take the user to the root uiviewcontroller for the uinavigationcontroller and you can use to just pop off the top uiviewcontroller

3249280
subtract	add
scale each point to the ratio of original new and use the edge that isn t moving as your zero point subtract that value from each coordinate before scaling and add it back after scaling

3249288
width	height
i m a fanatic for giving people with wide screens something to look at you mention static height but there really is no such thing as static width so for me i would make the brick left right into an image that can be repeated nicely and have a repeat-x applied to it so that wide screen visitors saw more wall

3249394
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout	hide	show
you could always replace the show and hide for fadein and fadeout too

3249394
hide	show
edit another method is to show the div when the button is clicked then make the ajax call and use the success function to hide it again

3249460
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the issue is further compounded by the fact that it renders and animates absolutely perfectly in firefox google-chrome and safari

3249499
post	get
i thought you might get some value from a blog post i did on some of the option available in .net to achieve this

3249535
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it appears to work in firefox google-chrome safari but not amazingly in ie

3249542
superclass	subclassing
it appears as if it finds the superclass of the exception before looking for the subclassing

3249547
allocator	stl
that s going to be wayyyy slower than the default stl container sgi uses deque because you ll lose cache locality and require dynamic allocator for each element new delete - whereas a deque will dynamically allocate chunks of the stack at a time

3249549
hide	show
essentially when a user chooses a filter you would move all the filtered items from the content ul to a hidden ul using the appendto and remove functions on the set of elements that you want to hide show

3249552
spaces	delimiter
not sure how the python syntax would fit but using java you would tokenize the string on the spaces delimiter then use a random index less than the length of the token array and access that element of the token array pop it print it and repeat until the token array was empty

3249591
webkit	gecko
work in ie webkit as well as gecko

3249626
hash	md5
you can use an md5 hash of your dll but even that s not terribly foolproof because anyone who wants to break your app will just use a reflector and find out what you re really doing and probably just modify your program straight-up

3249659
filesystems	fat
i ve found out that fat16 12 and elm-petit fat filesystems module are suites well to my needs

3249730
width	height
1 3 7 9 would be fixed width height with non-repeating background and a higher z-index than 2 4 6 8

3249730
width	height
2 8 would be fixed height 100 width background-repeat repeat-x

3249730
width	height
4 6 would be fixed width 100 height background-repeat repeat-y

3249757
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it in google-chrome ie and firefox

3249773
gif	png
you can use many other output formats like gif png and many many others

3249787
post	get
calling render from an action will mean that the url will remain unchanged from whatever was get d or post d

3249793
getter	setter
all of them are jpa entity s with relevant getter and setter for relations

3249793
jsf	seam
how can i do this with jsf facelets seam

3249809
mouseover	mousemove
i know mousemove isn t triggered without moving the mouse but is there anyway to get the button to check for mouseover when an animation is moving the buttons under the mouse cursor

3249821
width	font-size	width	height
the other thing to do would be to send the full text to the user s browser then append it into a div of the appropriate width with the font-size which could be modified by the users s personal css they will actually have and then measure the height of the resulting div

3249833
dlsym	dlopen
i don t think this behaviour is intuitive and it is more work to use dlopen dlsym but it does resolve my problem

3249855
inherited	subclassing
you could simply subclassing your listactivity and define the arraylist on that level and inherited from your custom listactivity for those other two classes and they will use the same arraylist

3249879
put	get
i can t just put in closes_in as i get an error

3249929
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox safari google-chrome

3249950
getter	setter
you d also likely want setter methods for all the info that a card represents and of course getter methods in order to retrieve that info

3250062
post	get
you will retrieve from it get and post values uploaded files cookies and header information and more

3250068
express	node.js
i know very little about node.js or express

3250125
iframe	prettyphoto
since it s in an iframe it doesn t have access to the same scope that your prettyphoto plugin is running in

3250150
strsplit	substr
it may be possible to do this with strsplit but i d just use substr like this

3250183
getter	setter
you should have a managed bean from which you get and set the booleans for the different checkboxes different fields with getter and setter for each checkbox value

3250201
disk	ram
processor clock rates l1 and l2 cache sizes ram sizes and disk speeds are all factors as well as the number of other programs tasks running concurrently

3250288
sudo	passwd
you can even allow a user to execute a predefined command with root permissions without asking a passwd at all - which is still more secure because an attacker that could read your variant of the script has access to the root passwd and thus can do anything he wants while using the sudo variant only allows him to execute the predefined command as root

3250299
inherited	properties
the basedon attribute will make it easy to inherited the entire treeviewitem style and only change the isexpanded properties

3250300
button	checkbox
missing sketchflow controls button checkbox and many others

3250304
memcached	apc
apc memcached etc

3250359
put	get
if it s any consolation if someone did get the key you decide to use the worst they could do is put your site into m-m

3250454
readdirectorychangesw	filesystemwatcher
the filesystemwatcher is using the windows api function readdirectorychangesw underneath which has this limit

3250454
post	get
if you want to get a deeper understanding on the cost of modifying the buffer size you should have a look at the post of walter wang of microsoft here

3250457
avr	microcontroller
i don t know about the avr but other microcontroller can go into a low power state when they re done with their job and waiting for a reset

3250479
fileinputstream	audioinputstream
create a new instance of audioinputstream giving it a fileinputstream to the input file the audioformat and sourcedataline dot getlongframeposition.

3250481

3250701
getter	setter
defining simple getter and setter is easy using asm and fortunately it is even explained in their faq

3250722
disk	ram
if the problem is ram or hard disk memory you may encounter the same problems no matter how you load the data

3250739
awt	swing
you can even embed your processing app inside another swing or awt application

3250834
gmail	hotmail
this message is not working in major emails like gmail hotmail yahoo.

3250847
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
they set a height and width and overflow hidden on the h1 tag and set a negative margin on the a tag inside of the h1 tag to keep the text from showing

3250877

and then in the touchesbegan and touchesmoved add to your path

3250884
google-chrome	firefox
i can only get it to work for firefox not google-chrome or ie i haven t tested it on other browsers

3250884
mouseleave	mouseenter
firefox also allows mouseenter and mouseleave but this is not reported on the w3schools page

3250934
minimum	max
this is great because it will give you loader code that only does the bare minimum due to space constraints max 512 bytes

3250943
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
problem bold italic underline all work but using justifycenter or any justify doesn t work in firefox but works in google-chrome and safari

3250943
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari don t seem to like my justifyright but works just fine with justifyleft and justifycenter

3250957
multiplying	add
first off since these are two three digit numbers multiplying together to determine the size a char would need to be to hold that value i went to a calculator and multiplied 999 999 and it ended up being 6 then i need to add one because i found out from one the questions i posted earlier that sprintf puts a 0 character at the end

3250957
int	chars
ok now that i have a chars and all i copied result which in int main and put it in

3251048
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works on safari firefox and google-chrome on macos x

3251048
opera	google-chrome
the problem is in google-chrome on windows the animation doesn t start and in opera on os x the animation behaves erratically

3251055
next	except
produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge happened except for the merge information but do not actually make a commit or move the head nor record to cause the next git commit command to create a merge commit

3251078
cpu	processors
you re wasting huge resources and speed if you re running more threads than you have processors cores for a cpu intensive process such as doing quicksort so try to not run more threads than you have cores

3251093
put	get
strictly you need to get the class loaded again so you don t need to restart the app but in practice this is likely the most straightforward option available to you unless you ve previously put hooks into the classloaders

3251151
int	chars
it s possible that you could re-work your data to make your rows more efficient chars instead of varchars in some cases tinyints instead of int etc. but you re really not going to see much of a speed difference with that kind of micro-optimization

3251190
getter	setter
this has a major problem if the class changes in certain ways eg a field getter setter name is renamed i won t be able to deserialize the object anymore

3251224
oncreate	ondestroy
the activity goes through ondestroy and its oncreate method gets called

3251228

appfuse	spring
appfuse is a great webapp template project that uses struts2 spring

3251279
opera	firefox
van kesteren tested firefox 3 opera 9.5 and internet explorer 7 a mix of pre-release and releases

3251279
post	get
get and post worked as expected and all supported the standard set of http methods from rfc 2616

3251279
opera	firefox
trace and options are edge cases with problems found in firefox and opera respectively

3251279
post	get
i think the whole confusion over browsers not supporting other than get and post stems from the fact that the html specification lists only these two in the html element

3251279
post	get
this is the reason why browsers only support get and post natively in html

3251279
post	put	post	get	put	get
if method is a case-insensitive match for connect delete get head options post put trace or track subtract 0x20 from each byte in the range 0x61 ascii a to 0x7a ascii z

put	get
normally you would put the calls inside of the xmlhttprequest s response handler such that it returns immediately and when it does get that page it then executes the required code

3257960
post	get
the way it works is whenever one of those variables are changed i have jquery use post ajax to get the table data from the server passing the vars so my server can get the data correctly

3257973
width	height
the hack is to add a 1x1 pixel img with width height set to 0 and use that for an onload event to execute the script and that works but it seems like there has to be a cleaner way to do this

notably safari and google-chrome do not place a dashed border under abbr by default while firefox and ie do

3258244
hide	show
the only solution close is to just have content in 4 cells of a table that slides into view according to the direction of the arrow you used within a div and have the overflow property set to hide so you can mask out the other cells and show one cell at a time

3258251
poe	anyevent
my preferred solution is to use an event-based framework like poe or anyevent i use poe and break out any tasks that can t be made nonblocking into subprocesses using poe wheel run or fork_call for anyevent

3258251
waitpid	fork
from time to time i ve also written code that simply uses fork and pipe or open -| and io select and waitpid directly within its own event loop but you should probably consider that a symptom of my having learned c before perl and not a recommendation

3258535
post	put	post	get	put	get
there are good explanations around but you can largely identify it by the style you use a small set of verbs usually http get post put delete or part of them to achieve actions you want on resources

3258535
post	put	post	get	put	get
addresses denote resources so rather than having actions like sale authorisation and order being sent as part of the request you will deal with different addresses looking like and which you can access using get or delete using delete or modify using put or post as appropriate

3258547
folder	directory
put your content in folder dedicated to supporting the site do not make your entire c drive a virtual directory

3258553

3258557
min	max
i want to ignore the errors for data type min max length and required fields

3258571
folder	directory
the most ideal solution is to add c images as a virtual directory to your document root imagecentral - this way you can have images that are central to multiple websites stored in this directory it can then be referenced by clients for any of the websites just by adding virtual directory to each of them pointing at the central images folder

3258957
post	get
changing from a get to a post whilst more secure as well cuts down on the size - it still happens

3258959
packets	multicast
do i need to create a socket on the client and listen to incoming packets once i send my multicast message in case server replies back

3259271
stdout	stderr

3259275
min	max
it is defined to be the integer that can hold a pointer value so the min max values of intptr_t should work

3259275
min	max
but from your explanation of a class that just needs min max values i don t believe that you need complete accuracy

3259295

integer	unsigned
why did the language designers decide to make the signed and unsigned integer types not implicitly castable

3260005
freebsd	linux
this remap often fails on freebsd but hardly ever on linux

3260013
integer	unsigned
why did the language designers decide to make the signed and unsigned integer types not

3260040
stdout	stderr
also there are ways to read the stdout and stderr streams of your command try looking at subprocess.popen arguments at

3260049
integer	unsigned
because implicitly converting an unsigned integer of 3b into an signed integer is going to blow up

3260177
pull	push
for that last one the changegroup hook runs whenever one or more changesets arrive via push or pull and you can have it do some interesting things such as

3260179
integer	unsigned
the unsigned int type of c and c++ is not an always positive integer no matter what the name of the type looks like

3260179
int	chars
if you really understand and want the wrapping behavior of unsigned int then they re the right choice for example i almost always use unsigned chars when i m handling bytes

3260192
profiling	debugging
once you tell the jvm to listen on a port just point your netbeans debugging profiling to the machine ip and port

3260215
google-chrome	firefox
this is true on ie 7 and 8 but ok on google-chrome and firefox

3260239
integer	unsigned
some cases where you should use unsigned integer types are

3260239
put	get
because you can put a negative value in an unsigned it s just that it will become a really large value when you go to get it out

3260239
int	chars
you need a way to hold out-of-band values so you can test for them this is the same sort of logic behind getchar returning an int and not chars .

3260240
lisp	scheme
some lisp scheme dialects make #

3260272
post	get
by default the .dialog moves the content to just before which most importantly is outside the so elements within it won t be included in the post or get to the server

the types valid are your regular c++ types like int and chars

3260818
mongoid	mongomapper
if someone has any mongoid or mongomapper code examples of a many-to-many relationship working could you please share

3260823
multiplying	subtract
on a beast like this if you can implement your algorithms in fixed point operations primarily multiplying adds and subtract and take advantage of both wide parallelism and pipelined parallelism you can eat most pcs alive in terms of both power and processing

3260823
subtract	add
if your algorithms can be expressed as in terms of add and subtract operations then the general purpose logic in these can be used to implement gazillion adders

3260886

the practice of creating a dialog was the root window of the application has been common since 16-bit windows and even today s 64bit windows maintains compatibility with that practice

3261091
appendto	createelement
so i rewrote my loadpickerfromobject function to use the createelement add and remove functions instead of jquery s appendto and empty functions

3261091
google-chrome	firefox
my code now works properly in google-chrome firefox and ie

3261107
folder	directory
this filter runs once the file has been uploaded to a temporary directory on your server but before it is resized if applicable and saved to your uploads folder

3261176

use modal dialog instead of pop-up windows

3261180
user-controls	elementhost
inside of this user-controls put your elementhost with the documentviewer

3261210
google-chrome	firefox
it took me a while to figure out why ie was constantly hitting 50 cpu while google-chrome and firefox barely broke a sweat -- i figured i had a rogue greedy loop somewhere until i scanned across my interval

3261210
google-chrome	firefox
running the same test in firefox or google-chrome doesn t even break 10 usage for me

3261222
min	max
if the window is smaller than max width the content fills 100 of the page unless it s smaller than min width which would make the horizontal scrollbar appear

3261222
min	max
i m willing to use some minor javascript to handle the min max width for browsers which don t support those properties i m looking at you ie6 but i m just as willing to let that part of the layout degrade

3261227
boost	stl
i am almost trying boost but if there is how to do it with stl i d like to learn

3261300
trie	dawg
first preprocess the whole document into a trie or a dawg

3261300
trie	dawg
trie dawg has the following property

3261300
trie	dawg
given a trie dawg and a search term of length k you can in o k time lookup the data associated with the word or tell if there is no match

3261300
trie	dawg
using a dawg could save you more space as compared to a trie

3261302
min	max
and then just append min max width to the container

3261408
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome but this app will be used across versions of ie 7 as well as firefox

post	get
anyone know of any techniques to handle the redirect to a resource on server x that i get from this post for a client hosted on y

3261705
pull	push
any array method you intended to pull into your custom implementation would have to be implemented manually though you could probably just be clever and use loops since what happens inside our custom push is pretty generic

3261714
emacs	aquamacs
is it normal that emacs and aquamacs can t share the same elpa

3261714
emacs	aquamacs
is it possible to use elpa to install conjure on emacs aquamacs

put	get
does it means when i put a var with type a in the node the function will not output a node with type a so it get an error

3261871
accessor	properties
he explores various alternatives like the dean edwards iframe borrowing technique direct object extension prototype extension and the usage of ecmascript 5 accessor properties

3261891
post	get
one suggestion i got was to use post instead of get or to base 64 encode the string but base64 itself does not contain url safe characters...e.g + gets converted to blank in php

3261918
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
if i don t properly implement my dispose i could have an uncommitted sqltransaction or dangling sqlconnection

3261920
int	double
in most cases the compiler won t require this hint though because floating point literals default to double indeed the ide typically deletes the # symbol unless the value was an int 9#

3261949
g++	gcc
assuming gcc g++

3261959
portrait	landscape
it rotates that div 90 degrees in landscape mode - back to portrait

3262048
inherited	subclassing
the subclassing inherited all of the

3262048
public	protected
public and protected methods from the

3262048
public	protected
protected or public but not private

3262054
width	height
you put this state in a class because all the state in the class is related.you have function to managed this state so that invalid permutations of state can t be set the infamous square that has members width and height but if width doesn t equal height it s not really a square .

3262059
int	double
now when you have a numeric literal like 3 it is inferred to be of type until you actually commit it to a particular data type like int or double

3262065
jobs	cron
your best bet is probably quartz which provides a way to define jobs and a number of triggers including cron like expressions

3262105
dbml	edmx
the only one i know about for now is the huagati dbml edmx tools

3262125
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
in this case i am looking at class1 inheriting from nsobject and class2 inheriting from nsmanagedobject

3262126
google-chrome	firefox
i know i could write an activex object or native plugin into some browser but this is not ideal does anyone know if google-chrome extensions in javascript or firefox jetpack would support this kind of functionality

3262131
udp	tcp
registered stream socket transports tcp udp

3262176
firefox	safari
this is supported in most modern browsers firefox 3.5 ie 8 safari 4 and seems to work very nicely for jquery applications hosted at domain foo.com that make ajax calls to bar.com

3262183

3262293
spaces	delimiter
of course this gives you spaces delimiter output

3262311
range	minimum
a couple of other answers have correctly quoted the c standard which places minimum range on the types

3262311
range	minimum
however as you can see those minimum range are identical for short int and int - so the question remains why are short int and int distinct

3262311
range	minimum
the reason that int is provided is to provide a type that is intended to match the most efficient integer type on the hardware in question that still meets the minimum required range

3262311
int	chars
if you are storing a large number of small int such that space efficiency is more important than calculation efficiency then you can instead choose short or even signed chars if you know that your values will fit into the -127 to 127 range

3262321
width	height
if you want scrolling within an element create a container that has a fixed width and height that contains whatever content within it that is larger than the container

3262332
postgresql	mysql
you should use intersection tables and many-to-many relationship for cases like this in every rdbms mysql oracle mssql postgresql etc

3262343
submit	submission
if you insist on using a disabled field you can enable it during form submission by handling the form onsubmit event where you will enable the field and submit the form

3262391
width	height
each ellipse is set with width auto height auto which for an ellipse means zero size

3262391
width	height
also the grid is set with width auto height auto which means to squeeze its contents into the tiniest space possible

3262391
width	height
remove both places where you say width auto and height auto and instead leave the height and width unset

3262391
width	height
the margins on your second ellipse are so large that even if the width 40 height 40 in your c# code were honored because the auto problem was fixed the ellipse would still have no size

3262461
google-chrome	safari
latest safari safari v4 and latest google-chrome google-chrome v3 supported but not previous versions

3262461
google-chrome	safari
safari 4 safari 5 and google-chrome 5

3262473
post	get
how do i check if the page has pending ajax or http get post requests

3262475
width	height
if you need to divide the available width by three and you know that all of your items are exactly the same height or if you are ok with all your rows being the max height of any item there is a very simple solution using uniformgrid with no height specified

3262483
filtering	grouping
when you say groupby followed by non-aggregated access of the grouping elements that s a repeated query with the grouping key as a filtering

3262528
portrait	landscape
i want show per page pdf in portrait mode and display two pages when rotate to landscape mode on ipad

3262561

you could use a post request instead of a get request so the id won t show up in the url but it ll still be visible in the html and the request body if you know where to look

3262581
width	height
i developed one flex application to which we want to set the flex application width and height by using javascript

accessor	properties
you can however make 3dname a readonly properties and relay the get accessor to the interface

3262838
getter	setter
to access it from another class it must be an instance variable of the class declared in the class but outside any method and accessible public or package aka default or private with getter setter methods

you have to get up and turn them off or put the computer to sleep or something

3263342
put	get
never put get params into string without some check

3263357
rss	feed
that page has an rss feed which i d like to use ideally but a it browser-sniffs meaning i need to fake the user-agent from a script to fetch it - and that feels really brittle b the quality of the data returned is really poor

3263370
istream	getline
read the lines into a std string using std getline then assign the string to a std istringstream object and extract the data from that rather than directly from istream

3263440
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the latest versioning if you didn t

3263445
hide	show
the idea is to filter through the images using jquery and css classes to show hide etc but even if all images are hidden they will still have to be loaded once the page is opened

3263459
ubuntu	linux
linux web server ubuntu

3263475
post	get
in java i have a httpclient which use headers in a post method with a website to send a request and get a answer

3263482
mouse	keyboard
normally you could use a windows hook to do something like this but the only hooks supported in the .net framework are mouse and keyboard events

3263490
calloc	malloc
that text could then be in a chunk of memory malloc d or calloc d to whatever size you need

3263500
hide	show
using jquery css isn t really going to speed anything up using a naive show hide implementation but you should be able to get a way with using ajax to load sets of images in on the fly when the user presses the filter button

3263503
min	max
rrd consolidates time periods disregarding details by averaging summing up or choosing max min values in given task the detail that is lost is information on low frequency items which can introduce errors

3263530
getter	setter
that binder is being invoked because the name of a form parameter query argument or routing parameter matches the name of a public property on your model that exposes a getter and setter that returns a timezoneinfo object

3263573
gprof	callgrind	profiler	gprof	profiler	callgrind
i come from a matlab background so i am used to a profiler which profiles every single line and not just every function like gprof or callgrind

3263595
hide	show
and if you don t want to show that link text you just hide it in css

3263617
int	chars
the simple example of const int arg is cute but i ve also seen - a constant pointer to constant pointers to non-constant chars

3263626
hide	show
note i also added in stuff to make it work on non-js browsers by having css hide the button and not the edits and then teh javascript hide the edits and show the buttons

3263634

but for firefox and safari cross browser example i have created this

3263678
punctuation	words
they are used because they allow otherwise illegal characters spaces punctuation characters etc. and sql reserved words to appear within or as the entirety of the object name

3263689
inherited	subclassing
personally i recommend adding the inherited typedef to every subclassing

3263704
setinterval	settimeout
you could check this using settimeout or setinterval to make sure that any requests triggered on page load have completed if that s what you re looking to do

3263716
background-image	background-color
background-color background-image etc

3263717
installation	upgrade
but you need to make sure that you have a bomb-proof mechanism for backing up the customer s current installation and data and if necessary restoring it when your automated upgrade procedure fails

3263737
cos	sin
suppose we have expression like eq1 sin t cos t 2-sin t cos t 4.we want to simplify this expression by simple command of matlab.we get different forms in the matlab prompt

3263799
width	height
i must know their width height before laying them down so i am using the onload event handler

3263803
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
qooxdoo inspector ie firefox opera safari and google-chrome

3263817
getter	setter
however it seems that string i only has a getter and has no setter

3263819
gif	png
i want a regex what allows only al urls beginning with media and ending with one of the next extentions js css png gif or jpg

3263854
boost	stl
how can i make it a more standard way using stl or boost

3263906
typedef	struct
you re using some very c-style syntax typedef struct class in front of declarations using a new function instead of a constructor using a free function instead of a destructor but you tagged this c++ and clearly you are using some c++ features

3263913
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it returns json data in firefox google-chrome ie safari but it doesn t return anything on iphone

3263940
folder	directory
also in eclipse when i changed target name as android 1.5 it gave me error in res folder tellin invalid resources directory

3263956
children	parent
you can do a join to get the children of parent that satisfy a particular condition with a query like

3263960
stdout	stderr
with system both stdout and stderr will go the same place as the script s stdout and stderr unless the system command redirects them

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stdout but discard its stderr

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stderr but discard its stdout

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a program s stderr and let its stdout go to our own stderr

3263960
stdout	stderr
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately you can redirect them to temp files let the command run then read the temp files

3263960
stdout	stderr
you can also use file-descriptor redirection to make stderr a duplicate of stdout

3263960
stdout	stderr
note that you cannot simply open stderr to be a dup of stdout in your perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection

3263960
stdout	stderr
this fails because the open makes stderr go to where stdout was going at the time of the open

3263960
stdout	stderr
the backticks then make stdout go to a string but don t change stderr which still goes to the old stdout

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr and stdout together

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stdout but discard its stderr

3263960
stdout	stderr
to capture a command s stderr but discard its stdout

3263960
stdout	stderr
to exchange a command s stdout and stderr in order to capture the stderr but leave its stdout to come out our old stderr

3263960
stdout	stderr
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately it s easiest to redirect them separately to files and then read from those files when the program is done

3263972
int	chars
it says can not convert int to const chars

3263973
implements	extends
they can also be usefull when you want to extends some classes that implements one or more interfaces but you cannot make them all derive from a base class

3263976
children	parent
the macro uses umbraco.content.instance.xmlcontent.selectsinglenode to select a parent node and then loops through the children and adds these to the dropdownlist

3264002
wsdl.exe	gsoap
instead of adding web reference use wsdl.exe in verbose mode to generate code using thee gsoap wsdl and xsd file

3264113
width	height
so you need to subtract the half of the character s width and height from the mouse coordinates

3264197
int	double
since matrices are stored in mode of numeric type of int double and storage mode int double assuming that matrix holds numerical values you can use simple square bracket indexing to address specific values in them

3264208
hide	show
difference between two sections is that ones with uiswitches show and hide rows by activating deactivating the switch others by selecting rows didselectrow....

3264225
portrait	landscape
i have a uilabel that i need to shift up by about 50 pixels on application start because it starts out in portrait and i designed it in landscape and then once again whenever it is put back in portrait

3264232
button	checkbox
button it should go to other frame and it should display 4 checkbox

3264271
ord	chr
i suppose i can use ord and chr looping over and over this is simple to get for a to z eg

3264278
superclass	subclassing
i d rather duplicate the superclass initialisation stuff into the subclassing which seems bad and then examine the object at each of the points where a superclass is created and then call the appropriate constructor

3264278
superclass	subclassing
is this sort of thing possible and if so how would i go about calling the subclassing constructor from superclass constructor

3264278
superclass	subclassing
i ve tried making a call to subclassing object but i run into issues with both superclass and subclassing needing to be defined before the other

3264304
rss	feed
uikit is fully capable of handling unicode characters so the problem is most likely in your parsing of the rss content - and particular the way you convert the feed data to an nsstring

3264323
post	get
what i wanna do is to get only 1 post newest from each of those sub categories including category title post title attachment image

3264340
getter	setter
i think cattr_reader does this to avoid uninitialized class variable errors if you try to use the getter before the setter

3264363
post	get
can you post an example url that doesn t get properly urlencode d

3264386
hide	show
when i hover over a link in the first ul i want to hide all the descriptions in the second ul and just show the relevant one

3264444
matplotlib	scipy	matplotlib	chaco
using the numpy scipy libraries together with a nice plotting lib chaco or matplotlib for instance makes the workflow of working with the data and algorithms easy and you can lab around with the code in the live interpreter in an almost matlab-like manner

3264462
lisp	scheme
understand first what scope mean and how the different implementation behave in particular try to figure out what is the difference between lisp and scheme

3264466

how can i retain the show hide states

3264471
google-chrome	firefox
this example page works for me in firefox and google-chrome

3264473
inherited	properties
i expected every child that does not set the isbubblesource properties itself to inherited it from its parent grid

3264486
inherited	properties
by default attached properties are not inherited

3264534
cprofile	timeit
if after timing your code with timeit or cprofile you feel this may be your situation then you could try pre-evaluating c d k j and testing

3264534
cprofile	timeit
then time this with timeit or cprofile as well

3264555
division	modulo
that is the modulo which finds the remainder of division of one number by another

3264582
int	boolean
when you defined the checkboxes as an int the framework couldn t covert the boolean to an int

3264625
put	get
note that if this is a shared host then you probably won t have access to put files in usr lib php or usr local lib php - so your only option is to use a relative path - which is going to get very messy -

3264629
put	get
now i want to be also able to put an arbitrary number of parameters into the message text that get inserted into the placeholders in the i18n-property in my message.properties

3264676
ncover	dotcover
you can use tools like ncover and dotcover to check that you haven t missed any code paths

3264696
inherited	properties
an ambient properties is one that if it s not set in the control will be inherited from the container

3264698
inherited	properties
there are some properties however backcolor and forecolor being two of them i believe that are inherited from the parent if not set explicitly so you should be able to use those as well

3264700
dictionary	map
for instance a distributed hash-table would be a good choice if you can make do with the limited api of the dictionary map interface

3264708
qobject	qsharedpointer
if you don t want to pass a parent for some reason because there is no qobject where it makes sense to own the socket object you can also use a qsharedpointer to manage the lifetime

3264750
outputstream	inputstream
you can read the file using an inputstream and write its data to the outputstream of a socket

3264790
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
try using the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover mouseout

3264815
typedef	struct
don t know much about blitz array but you should be able to put the typedef inside a templated struct

3264816
google-chrome	firefox
i need to create plug-ins add-ons for ie firefox and google-chrome browsers for the following requirement

3264875
accessor	properties
this translation step also involves optimizations like inlining of trivial methods such as simple properties accessor

3264879
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately ie s addon development is still very arcane compared to firefox and google-chrome for the behavior you re trying to accomplish

3264879
google-chrome	firefox
you ll have to develop a bho for ie whereas both firefox and google-chrome use javascript as their addon platform

3264903
cassini	iis
when i run the app through the cassini web server f5 everything runs fine however when hosted in iis 7 i get the following exception

3264904
ubuntu	debian

3264917
google-chrome	firefox
hello everyone the drag and drop app that i have built functions perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but when i try it on ie i get object required as an error

3264927
for-loop	arrays
if you want only one for-loop you can first create an arrays or a list containing names1 names2 and names3

3264946
hex	binary
however when i save it it looks fine in notepad but when opened with a binary hex editor it shows these 3 characters at the start of the xml

3264998
post	get
i will try to get more and i will add it to this post

3265053
keystore	jks
one problem i ve encountered is that android does not accept jks keystore keystore.getdefaulttype returns bks java.security.keystoreexception keystore jks implementation not found

3265056
division	modulo
you have a constructor for biginteger that takes byte array and you can then manually run loops of division and modulo to get the representation in other non-standard bases

3265063
put	get
if you want to call the second method you can either cast to the type subofparent or you can instead put those methods into the classes and then call it to get polymorphism

3265081
uidatepicker	uipickerview
use uipickerview with uidatepickerdelegate and uidatepickerdatasource not uidatepicker

3265174
addition	multiplication
ratio-of-uniforms is my favorite only a few addition multiplication and a log 1 50th of the time eg

3265221
getter	setter
you can see that the usage is similar to property except there s only a getter and no setter or deleter

3265246
width	height
i say specify width and height inside your tag

3265246
width	height
like this would restrict your image size to 100 width and 200 height

3265290
width	height
what s the best way to change width height of a widget i mean a ui widget subclass of android.view.view programmatically

3265299
ant	cruisecontrol
we modify cruisecontrol s config by copypasting project and changing ant targets in it

3265323
int	boolean
where it is much more obvious that we re trying to give an int variable a value of type boolean

3265357
interpreted-language	compiled-language
oftentimes i hear people arguing that interpreted-language can be used interactively but i believe that compiled-language can have interactive implementations as well correct

3265370
getter	setter
but it is specifically designed for getter setter

3265377
accessor	properties
yes the jitter is that good at inlining properties accessor

3265409
mouseup	mousedown
the rectangle has event handlers for mousedown mouse move and mouseup

3265435
post	get
the client uses the facebook javascript api to log the user in and get their details then post these to my server

3265475
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it s possible to build an interpreter for every compiled-language but it s not possible to build an compiler for every interpreted-language

3265567
client-side	server-side
you need to secure this server-side you can t protect it on the client-side nor should you

3265592
getter	setter
i have defined getter and setter tp_getset so that i can access and modify the static variable of acpp from python

3265602
interpreted-language	compiled-language
you can do anything that you can do in an interpreted-language in a compiled-language and vice-versa - they are both turing complete

pop-up	dialog
i ve been searching about using ajax modal pop-up in asp.net mvc and i ve only seen uses where there s a simple dialog box for input

3265680
haskell	ocaml
other languages which are compiled as well as interpreted are scala haskell or ocaml

3265710
getter	setter
in fact that s what i typically do unless there s logic within the property getter setter that i always want to leverage

3265732
sorting	filtering
it provides sorting and filtering functionality which can be used for display purposes without affecting the underlying data

3265732
sorting	filtering
by using a collection class it is also easy to switch between data formats such as to an xmllistcollection without having to re-write all of your sorting and filtering code

3265746
rss	feed
so i have rss feed of 10 000 records in file.xml i collected them from 10 feed in 1 hour time so there timestamps will not help btw i used yahoo pipes

3265801
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
update infact you can get this to working using an objectdatasource control instead of the linqdatasource control - see this article and download the sample

3265801
ienumerable	iqueryable	linqdatasource	objectdatasource
while using an objectdatasource isn t nearly as simple as using a linqdatasource control it s uses less magic linq stuff instead it uses heaps of magic strings that map to business data layer methods and allows the exposure of ienumerable for your data access method instead of iqueryable

3265891
post	put
i m planning to put together a post that explains this a little more in-depth but for now i hope this is enough

3266014
instances	transient
and here comes the problem when i am trying to save user then deep in the debugger the nhibernate checks the lastupdated value of role object and throws nhibernate.transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing telling that i need to save role first

3266020
google-chrome	safari
i tried different browsers google-chrome safari elinks from different machines to see if that would help but the problem persists

3266030
linefeed	delimiter
often happens that in svn repository text files have different text file line delimiter cr crlf linefeed

3266045
inherited	properties
from the documentation it would seem that this behaviour should be disabled by default as it is inherited from the uielement.allowdrop properties

3266080
classname	inherited
also constructors are usually called from expressions like new classname args which are defined in most languages as creating an instance of classname and not of a class that inherited from classname

3266104
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
in addition to being an interaction environment the shell be it the original bourne shell bin sh or one of the many alternatives ksh csh bash zsh tcsh ... with different or extended syntax provides programming language like features looping conditionals functions variables...

3266130
jcl	dcl
other examples of programming languages primarily intended for shell scripting include dcl and jcl

3266136
set	bag
i have mapped a bag property on the header object to the line class and also put a header property on the line class to set the two way relationship

3266142
integer	unsigned
you data type is the set of unsigned integer arrays

3266154
int	chars
if one of the operands is of type t where t is byte short or chars and the other operand is a constant expression of type int whose value is representible in type t the type of the conditional expression is t

3266194
urllib	httplib
i have tried using curl and python s libraries httplib urllib urllib2 and a third party library called urllib2_file

3266194
post	get
each method works fine with simple text post but each one of them doesn t seem to get the photo uploading done properly

3266206
inherited	subclassing
obviously subclassing student through inherited can also allow you to achieve the same thing but extension method clearly offer a very flexible alternative

3266227
post	get
i m having a hard time wrapping my head around converting the post into a get

3266231
gmail	hotmail
it s not hard to fix any specific instance but each client hotmail gmail outlook etc seems to handle things just a bit differently

3266235
int	double
object required is raised when you have a statement like where x is not an object type but is instead an simple type int double date etc

3266243
client-side	server-side
javascript is primarily for client-side browser python is primarily used for server-side - so they serve different needs disregarding the python to js converters and all

3266250
post	get
if i go straight to the page no post or get requests link_to works properly and the links and images render correctly which is to say that they actually do render

3266250
post	get
however the way that i would like to get to the page is by form post request in a previous page whose action is the results page i m trying to get to

3266250
post	get
edit i m not sure exactly what the problem was but i solved it by changing the form s method to get instead of post

3266280
int	chars
for the punctuation marks value chars for numbers the values would be int corresponding to the numeric value of the number and for variables it would be a reference to a variable object where that variable would be sitting in a list of objects having a name

3266289
int	chars
iirc the type in opencv mat corresponds to the image type ie number of channels not the data type float int chars etc

3266289
int	chars	int	double
if you want a templated image class that can transparently work with chars int bool double etc - take a look at cimg

3266320
post	get
the standard pattern is to have a controller method to handle the get and which shows the form or whatever to the user and one to handle the post which is the form submission

3266320
post	get
the post method sends a redirect after it has finished processing the submission which comes back in to the get method

3266335
submit	submission
maybe i m missing the point here but either just don t submit that value or set it to null prior to submission the form

3266372
punctuation	words
cons the standard analyzers throw out words like if and for and punctuation marks like which are important in source code searching

3266373
puts	gets
i ve got a script which gets data from a mysql database through an http request puts it into a json array then puts each item into an itemized overlay array so that each item can be put onto a map

3266403
put	get
i m not going to put an example of the code up here as that s just general knowledge and all i m trying to do is get the concept through here

3266486
int	double
and because it can not compare int and double it generates type mismatch

3266489
scons	autotools
there are several tools able to perform this task like autotools scons or cmake

3266501
post	get
i am working on creating a new controller route to only allow an http get and http post

3266511
strlen	substr
get date representation using substr and strlen

3266512
getter	setter
synthesize creates a getter and a setter for the variable

3266512
getter	setter
this lets you specify some attributes for your variables and when you synthesize that property to the variable you generate the getter and setter for the variable

3266514
getter	setter
you use the synthesize keyword to tell the compiler that it should synthesize the setter and or getter methods for the property if you do not supply them within the implementation block

3266537
getter	setter
it creates getter and setter for your object

3266537
getter	setter
mapview1 is the name of the ivar in the class mapview is the name for the getter setter method s

3266549
button	checkbox
ensure the include labels checkbox is checked and click then ok button

3266579
int	double
now c already has a weak type system in which you can do a reinterpret cast of a double into an int if you really want to so it should not be a surprise that it has a weak type system with respect to const as well

3266627
typedef	struct
typedef struct _cl_mem cl_mem

3266640
boost	stl
2 yes its used and boost also which is kinda the preview of the next stl

3266647
cucumber	autotest
so i can pass args options for rspec like bundle exec autotest -c -f specdoc but if i pass cucumber options like --tags wip --format pretty it blows out

3266674
int	double
d is for int use f for double

3266699
directx	gdi
if an the target app is running in windowed mode hooking directx still work but you could also just use gdi instead

3266716
allocator	stl
the stl can be used but you normally have to write your own allocator to avoid fragging memory see

3266736
ibatis	mybatis
is mybatis formerly ibatis a better choice as the people i am handing off too are more comfortable with sql

3266748
post	get
a response to a particular url based on get post

3266764
vsto	add-in
i built an excel add-in with vsto 2005 se which i deployed to a user base that is predominantly office 2003-based but also with several workstations that have office 2007 installed on them

3266764
vsto	add-in
now because this add-in was created with the version of vsto for office 2003 the add-in does not have a ribbon and should show up under the add-in tab when excel 2007 is opened

3266780
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome because the onload event seems not work correctly in firefox

3266781
client-side	server-side
along with python generally being server-side and javascript client-side python was designed to not only be easy to learn but also easy to read and to encourage a more productive environment

3266835
int	chars
for instance aligning chars vs int

3266836
shadowbox	lightbox
it should be a lightbox or shadowbox something that s not a popup

3266867
range	max	range	min	min	max
currently the range slider outputs min max values into single text field

3266901
implements	extends
you will also have to use the fact that the linw2sql tables are created as partial classes to extends them so all the relevent table implements iplantable

3266922
ubuntu	linux
os ubuntu linux 2.6.24-24-server #1 smp x86_64 gnu linux

i m trying to get a put request from python into a servlet in tomcat

3266997
post	put
the same code is happily working for post requests but not for put

3267019
rss	feed
pipes to merge them for you can create a merged rss feed for you

3267019
post	get
if you use pipes be sure to filter by date so you can get a feed with all the post in chronological order

3267027
width	height
i m trying to create a relatively simple page with a that is on the left side taking up the whole height of the browsers window with a fixed width say 200px and then an that uses the rest of the window width and also the whole windows height

3267078
post	get
i understand that it may not be as simple as this and that i may need to do some other processing but can anyone post a code snippet that shows how i can get at the byte array that was sent

3267097
powerpc	i386
32 64-bit universal -- i386 x86_64 powerpc

3267097
powerpc	i386
32-bit universal -- i386 powerpc

3267102
powerpc	i386
unless you have a reason to compile for x86_64 i recommend just compiling for i386 and powerpc if you support that

3267184
dependencyobject	uielement
you only derive from dependencyobject not from uielement

3267203
pull	push
what you re doing is turning a push sequence occurrences of an event into a pull one calls into ienumerable

3267203
pull	push
turning a push sequence into a pull sequence is difficult and the root of my problems here

3267203
pull	push
but the reverse turning a pull sequence into a push sequence is trivial and this insight gave me the solution

3267221
ssms	sqlcmd
i would install sql server client tools - you would at least then get ssms and sqlcmd

3267221
bids	ssis
no need for sql server itself or even ssis - you can still use bids to write packages but you have to run them interactively

3267233
kde	gnome
directly accessing the network share works in the gnome and kde file managers because they apply some magic themselves

3267243
width	height
i am drawing several shapes such as circles that are keyed off of the window height width

3267305
instances	transient
having it match two transient instances by equality is not technically possible

3267335
bazaar	git
it might seem silly or a solution for the desperate... but i think that bazaar has good support for both hg and git repositories and it works well on windows

3267344
getter	setter
then the getter setter for each field should be created appropriately based on what the structure is

3267350
width	height
can i use jquery or pure css to create a list menu that is set height width and use scrollbar.

3267351
r5rs	r6rs
i m using sisc 1.16.6 claims r5rs compliance and chez petite scheme v8 claims r6rs compliance

zipalign	jarsigner
4 use the jarsigner and zipalign with your new keystore

3267431
pop-up	dialog
browser knows what it means and pop-up a dialog box to the user with user pass fields

3267455
stateless	stateful
in reality http isn t really ideal for this kind of thing http is a stateless request response based protocol and what you need is a stateful persistent protocol such as xmpp

3267519
config	ini
you can drop an ini or other config file in some folder outside of program files or you can store it in the registry which is probably the best option

3267520
getter	setter
i need to declare an enum variable as a class member and need to define a setter and getter for that like a java bean

3267526
folder	directory
if you want to reach a folder in the parent directory you can do something like cd .. foldername

3267586
hide	show
you can use this script to show hide check box in particular column

3267586
hide	show
please give specific column index in eq index where you wanna click to show hide checkbox

3267603
accessor	properties
without making the language any more complex they could write the rule so that it applies to all properties with set accessor instead of to default properties with set accessor

3267620
persistent	transient
the documentation mentions returning non-managed entities but it also work with an entity there is no reason it wouldn t work and i could persistent the transient entity successfully

3267745
free	malloc
i suppose if you know what the malloc guard blocks look like you could write a function that backs up from the pointer you pass it until it finds a best guess of the original memory address and then calls free

3267807
post	put
whether or not your web framework should be expected to automagically parse out application x-www-form-urlencoded parameters in put requests like it does with post requests is debatable

3267885
dictionary	map
the object type is the closest you ll get to a map dictionary

3267892
setinterval	settimeout
first off you shouldn t be using settimeout you should be using setinterval

3267892
setinterval	settimeout
also it is faster to use anonymous functions inside of settimeout and setinterval

3267949
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
you can also just tear down the stack releasing the nsmanagedobjectcontext nspersistentstore and nsmanagedobjectmodel and delete the file

3267971
equals	gethashcode
but it seems lots of places in the framework ignore equals and use gethashcode and the documentation is not clear on that at all

3267975
jstl	taglib
that is right you didn t import the jstl taglib in top of jsp as per the jstl core taglib documentation

3267975
jstl	taglib
if that doesn t fix the problem and you get compilation errors of unrecognized taglib then it means that the servletcontainer in question doesn t ship with jstl and that you ll have to install jstl yourself

3267988
integer	fractions	division	multiplication
the reason i used it is because integer math and multiplication are faster than fractions math and division

3268000
ssl	https
https is specifically designed so that you can t do this - not only is one of the core points of ssl tls that the conversation be encrypted it also ensures that you really are talking to who you think you are that you haven t been redirected to a fake site via dns

3268043
equals	gethashcode
if you are using the items in a hashtable then their gethashcode method will be used initially to test for equality and if their hashes are found to be equals a call to their equals method will be made to establish whether they are equals

3268067
free	malloc
e.g. sometimes i used new delete instead of malloc free to invoke the constructor or used a std vector or std set for convenience

3268073
children	parent
qobject cannot create children for a parent that is in a different thread

3268073
qthread	qnetworkaccessmanager
parent is qnetworkaccessmanager 0x22fe58 parent s thread is qthread 0x9284190 current thread is resultthread 0x22fe48

3268098
equals	gethashcode
the only rule for gethashcode is that a.gethashcode must equals b.gethashcode if a b

3268116
width	height
you might have to change the height and width properties but this worked for me

3268121
boost	stl
just use c++ and all its advantages stl boost all that jazz.

3268123
hide	show
let s extend the code above to actually hide and show that other div depending on which item was clicked

3268123
hide	show
the functions we ll be using are .slideup which hide an element and .slidedown which show it

3268125
postgresql	mysql
if you re thinking about using mysql postgresql or such then you should look into something like rsyslog for buffering writes and avoiding the performance penalty with heavy logging

3268134
width	height
if you re using something like gluperspective just use the window width height ratio

3268173
width	height
so height and width is the only thing that echos in the first example in the second the view is loaded

3268191
children	parent
in other words if you look at an account you could tell that it had a parent but you would have no idead if it had any children

3268206
button	checkbox
i would like the checkbox list appears only when the user selects the second radio button is checked

3268238
single-quotes	double-quotes
also i recommend using single-quotes for string literals not double-quotes

3268264
atoi	atof
use atoi and atof in the std library

3268272
dependencyobject	uielement
so as heinz points out you would need to have derived from uielement order to be able to cast to uielement and dependencyobject

3268274
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
it can do anything a regular uiviewcontroller can do and will inherited all the same properties such as a view but since it only subclassing it you are able to add extra information that is specific to your own object

3268351
google-chrome	firefox
ie says its out of memory google-chrome lags for a second and then behaves well and in firefox the animation is sticky

3268378
email	dkim
the only issue i have is figuring out a way to sign the email with a private key for dkim

3268386
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
the new listview is an update to the old datalist and repeater controls displaying multiple records and providing functionality like gridview but allowing for a more flexible layout through the use of templates

3268424
int	chars
what you can do is to use a .substring int start int length and then format the string to be 2 chars long but unless you specify the language our hands are a bit tied

3268428
folder	directory
if i have a folder called temp located in the website s root directory and run the following code

3268428
folder	directory
how do i get the code to save the file to the temp folder inside my website s root directory

3268428
folder	directory
i shouldn t have to use alias if the temp folder is within the root directory correct

3268488
getter	setter
scala does provide a couple of workarounds for this annotations which force the creation of javabeans setter getter as well as native scala ones but that requires annotating every component that i wish to inject

3268488
getter	setter
much more convenient would be to override the beanwrapper used by spring with one which knew how to handle scala-style getter and setter

3268490
starttls	smtps
that will start a new smtps session and you will have to issue the starttls command all over again

3268518
set	bag
all collection mappings except those with set and bag semantics need an index column in the collection table

3268589
cassini	iis
this might not necessarily be an option if you ve already deployed the service but if you add the website as a local project rather than as an iis project it ll use the built-in debug web server cassini which vs seems to have less trouble attaching to

3268600
width	height
therefore i need the coordinates and width and height of them

3268684
children	parent
assuming your accounts are all coming in the same xml file you can use xpath to find the parent and children

3268716
cassini	iis
to do this i usually check the hosting process to see if it is iis or cassini - the gotcha with that approach is having to worry about updating the library when new os versions or new versions of vs come out

3268740
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i need either the os ids or the browser s ids i .e firefox google-chrome ie opera

3268809
cpu	processors
it benefits from multiple processors if multiple tabs are using cpu resources at the same time

3268809
google-chrome	firefox
example firefox and google-chrome on linux

3268824
post	get
although this question has already been answered here is an additional tip that may be of relevance there is an easy way to post both the html and the markdown by posting via javascript and using the preview component to get the html and the textarea to get the markdown source

3268861
cpu	hyperthreading
of course nobody could ever prove they didn t need to test on a particular platform but i would think there are bigger causes of platform difference to worry about than cpu brand all the various multi-core hyperthreading permutations for example which might expose all your multithreaded code bugs in different ways

3268883
for-loop	arrays
in my case i wrapped this is a for-loop so it would go through an arrays but it just depends on the need

3268893
post	get
one thing though in theory if your rooms.php script is modifying some data like saving something to database you should use http post and not http get

3268900
stdout	stderr
that way you can basically open file handles for stdin stdout and stderr and monitor everything from the parent

3268905
vim	emacs
i prefer using emacs and vim for writing c++ code

3269004
google-chrome	firefox
i am working on an app that is only used by a few people in-house so i feel comfortable telling them to only use firefox or google-chrome so i can use html5

3269006
instances	transient
caused by org.hibernate.transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing manager

3269044
short	base
the short answer is that the asp.net mvc framework code that retrievs the list of filters for each action removes duplicates action filters of the same type in such a way that it prefers actionfilters defined on the action method over ones defined on the controller or its base class

3269045
put	get
to put files into subversion or to get them out of subversion you need a client program

3269057
post	get
you will say that you can write hql but as i have seen in a lot of post that explains that hql is not so powerful than sql and a lot of programmers get headache and several hours of tuning you like all your organs in your body to work ideally don t you

3269082
haskell	ocaml
f# is the closest thing though be aware it is based on ocaml and as such isn t based on referential transparency by-default as haskell is

3269098
versioning	upgrade
you set report server project properties to specify the versioning of the report server to deploy reports to and how to handle warnings and errors which might occur when up either upgrade a report from sql server 2008 to sql server 2008 r2 or revert a report from sql server 2008 r2 to sql server 2008

3269098
versioning	upgrade
the result is that with 2008r2 tools installed you have no choice but to upgrade the project file to 2008r2 however within the project you specify the target sql server versioning

3269103
int	boolean
int bit boolean dataetimes decimals types if there stored in the database as this way

3269117
fullcalendar	daypilot
unfortunately both daypilot and dhtmlxscheduler lack the clean and clear interface that fullcalendar achieves so well and web2cal just looks and feels unfinished and is still in beta

3269126
hide	show
i have two radio buttons to which i have assigned change handlers to show hide certain divs based on the selection

3269127
mouse	trackpad
os x is not really designed for touchscreens and has just recently gotten the most rudimentary support for touch-y interaction thanks to the magic mouse and the macbooks trackpad

3269142
put	get	treemap	treeset
saying you opted for the treeset while i don t have the source handy the javadoc says that it is based on a treemap providing o log n for get put containskey remove

3269151
nunit	mstest
i assume this is the nunit type of failure exception while the mstest version is assertfailedexception

3269151
nunit	mstest
since the nunit version obviously does not inherit from the mstest version the test runner in vs doesn t catch the exception and give me a nice message

3269151
nunit	moq
this problem appears with most mocking frameworks too so now i don t only want to do this with the assertionexception from nunit but also with verificationexception from moq and possibly others.

3269188
firefox	safari
my script works fine in ie7 firefox and safari but it doesn t seem to work in ie8 running on windows7 and i m getting desperate

3269202
min	max
i just want to find a straightforward c# class that takes in a starting latitude and longitude and a distance and finds the bounding box max lat min lat max lon min lon

3269209
put	get
i would like to create an interactive graph that would allow a user to click on a point and get information on the the value of the point eg if the value jumped a reason so i would like to be able to put this interactive graph on a web page

3269250
int	chars
you re trying to read an int but you re reading it as a chars string

3269267
folder	directory
for this the root folder has all of the core files that don t change and then there is a directory for each platform with the files that change

3269287
button	checkbox
not quite a checkbox but a radio group allows you to click on the radio button from the list and keep track of which one was selected

3269330
contentplaceholder	loginview
the other thing i noticed was that if your contentplaceholder for a child page is nested inside a loggedintemplate inside a loginview on a masterpage then you can forget about using findcontrol to grab the handle on a control inside the child page

3269337
doc	rtf
here s a great open-source example here parsing doc docx odt rtf etc

3269339
ubuntu	debian
if not wich is the best iron-python ide for ubuntu or debian

3269362
post	get
for example i m trying to send notification or post in news feed but get errors like undefined method however i do everything just like in tutorial

3269369
jar	war
the ear has a war and the war has numerous jar files

3269385
uilabel	uibutton
i have a bunch of uilabel that i add through code and i want to perform a specific action for each if the user s finger touches up inside much like uibutton s touchupinside in ib

3269418
client-side	server-side
you could generate your url server-side with a bogus title something that would never be used as a real title like bogus_title and when the client-side code execute replace it with the actual dynamic value

3269426
uilabel	uibutton
the easiest way is probably to use uibutton instead of uilabel

3269446
width	height
inside your user control set the clip property of the container for example grid to the size width height of user control

3269456
hide	show
the following code should allow to hide show the ckeditor form

3269456
google-chrome	firefox	hide	show
however this code works fine on google-chrome but on firefox once i have toggled once the editor one hide click followed by one show click it becomes not editable

3269461
folder	directory
iâ ve downloaded the project from the trunk and run the go.bat file which succeeded i then took the dll files from the â buildâ directory and overwritten the dll files in my projects â libâ folder

3269477
int	boolean
of course in any meaningful and sane function the input is parsed down to blocks of int decimals and boolean but the combinations of the bits in those values is still determining the output of your function

3269478
int	chars
i ve always considered it to be a primitive type like int or chars or long

3269478
int	chars
from a practical standpoint disregarding the above it would also seem proper to define a bool as a typedef to an int chars or have it #define d

3269489
int	chars
since you want to know the details bool is probably either a byte chars or an int

3269494
put	get
in my opinion the easiest way to get rid of all those burdens is to create a user control then put a

3269498
int	chars
bool is a well-defined primitive integral type just like int chars etc

3269511
hide	show
and make the hide show on the div

3269513
post	get
the api requires number message username and password and can be sent using post or get

3269530
folder	dir
they collapse the folder structure so you still can t have the same names as your root dir but you can still separate them into a folder

3269535
width	height
eclipse redlines width height width height in the dosomething arg list in the callback

3269547
post	get
i know there have been other post similar but i want to get the facts because i am going to be moving in a while and i want to have all the books with me so i can learn while i have no internet for a few days

3269586
put	get	width	height
put the final keyword on the width and height parameters of the surfacechanged ... method to make them accessible to the run method in the painter runnable and get rid of the compiler error

3269586
width	height
this is avoidable in java 8 because it would consider width and height to be effectively final

3269636
getter	setter
this line tells the compiler to create a setter and getter for mapview and that they should use the ivar called mapview1

3269676
width	margin
although li.textmenu has width 140px padding 5px and div.textmenu has width 150px the one list item i ve made so far has a big left margin and extends beyond the right edge of the div by a good 30px

3269684
postgresql	mysql
database type oracle mysql postgresql

3269690
free	malloc
malloc and c++ s new allocate the memory on the heap which means you have to free or if you allocated with new delete the buffer or the memory will never be reclaimed leak

3269690
realloc	malloc
lastly don t use malloc in c++ unless you have a really good reason i.e realloc

3269706
google-chrome	firefox
i have this test html page i tried it in both google-chrome and firefox

3269715
width	margin
only the padding affects the width but you ll probably want to take off the margin too

3269742
client-side	server-side
the maddening part is that the server-side code contains the jaxb annotations that are used by wsimport to create the client-side code which works great yet i can t marshal server-side sensors due to the cycle

3269742
client-side	server-side
i tried copying all of the extra annotations jaxb adds to the client-side code onto the server-side classes thinking perhaps there was a runtime bug in jaxb that was preventing it from properly applying the xmlidref annotation

3269780
std	ostream
you can use the std ostream write member function

3269826
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 3.3.6 google-chrome 5.0.375.99 beta ie 8 and safari 5 it alerts 0 for me

3269831
width	height
i would like to build an image attributes editor so that once an image is inserted into the editable region the user would select it and then a modal window or properties panel would appear allowing the user to edit the width height etc

3269832
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
if you save your html as page.xhtml instead of page.html the browser firefox google-chrome or opera should find the un-closed tags for you without the need for a validator

3269836
for-loop	loops
in an optimized release build the second for-loop is optimized out entirely the call to is likely inlined and the optimizer can see that loops does nothing and can remove the whole loops

3269845
put	get
however if you re willing to put up with a cheesy workaround you might be able to get this to look how you want just by continuing to change the rotation angle in the same direction each time rather than setting it to a constant 0 or 180

3269904
int	chars
primitive type like int or chars or

3269912
qsort	bsearch
if you want to stick to standard c library functions there s also bsearch which is good for constant lookup dictionaries or dynamic dictionaries in conjunction with qsort

3269926
button	checkbox
it s easy to handle text inputs with the readonly property but radio button checkbox and dropdown menus don t use it

3269934
gzipstream	networkstream
some streams will never be seekable for instance networkstream gzipstream ... so if you re working on those types of stream there is no way to force them to seek

3269936
width	height
that unfortunately means you ll have to pre-calculate how wide your page needs to be the content won t dynamically stretch the width the way it does height

3269939
min	max
the closest i have got is select a concat min b - max b from test group by a

3269980
kerberos	ntlm
turns out that iis 7 reverse proxies do not support kerberos authentication so you have to disable it on your backend servers so they use ntlm

3270021
udp	tcp
tcp ip and udp ip make up the backbone of internet communication

3270021
udp	tcp
if you built a custom server then you will need construct the required message protocol on the iphone and send it to the server using either tcp or udp whatever your custom server expects

3270064
cpu	processors
on full smp systems where multiple threads could be active in the kernel at the same time and interrupts could be delivered to pretty much any cpu it s no longer enough to only disable interrupts on single processors or only grab a single lock

3270064
cpu	irq
both are required disabling interrupts protects from irq handler on the same cpu holding a lock protects from other threads entering the same critical sections on different cpu

3270101
post	get
in your post action method read the file bytes from the request and store them in the database this post can get you started

3270108
min	max
the idea is if you assign a value to group sequencial values then you can use min max to get the appropriate vlalues

3270120
post	get
that s why i am using jsonp and get as opposed to proper ajax with post

3270120
post	get
if b is the culprit would it behave differently for post vs get

3270162
awt	swing
it s better to stick with the swing components and not the awt gui components

3270168
folder	directory
in order to have the files in a folder listed out in html format when you browse to that folder with a web browser you ll have to turn on directory browsing in your apache configuration and make sure you don t have a default page eg

3270193

post	put	post	get	put	get
this answer may or may not help you much but like i said before - put some more specific details into your question and you will get more specific answers either add comments under your question or post a new more specific question if you cannot edit your current one

3270336
post	get
sounds simple enough and i can get the multi-part post to gae happening but storing to the blob store requires the servlet return an http redirect 302

3270340
emacs	jedit
i saw lots of options tried emacs jedit and dozens of others but i didn t find anything satisfying this 5 points

3270343
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
is there any reason that you can t just have it on the page and hide show it via slideup slidedown

3270368
versioning	upgrade
you can even upgrade your php versioning there

3270428
getter	setter
unless the object has escaped during construction see below the assignment happens before any access to the getter setter

3270465
folder	directory
you could try say creating blank text files inside the mail admin directory and in a completely new folder in the root directory and see if you can access those without any problems - might narrow down where the problem is

3270480
google-chrome	firefox
the normal browser control is ie based but there are projects underway to create google-chrome and firefox embeddible controls

the .net framework implements xslt 1.0 only and the new functions such as replace are in the xpath 2.0 and xquery 1.0 functions and operators spec which is not supported

3270498
daemon	cron
typically you take the additional task you are doing after returning the page and hand it over to some other process normally that means placing the task in a job queue and having a cli daemon or a cron job pick it up and do what s needed

with a good api swing and swt are not bad but they are not really good either.

3270771
swt	swing
which feels responsive still a problem today with swing and swt despite the claims that this is solved.

3270771
swt	swing
to clarify if i have to start a new software project on the jvm there are several existing options like using swt or swing using swing with third-party libraries like swingx jide jgoodies flamingo or using application frameworks like netbeans platform or eclipse rcp

each fibonacci number can be calculated directly as floor pow phi n + 0.5 see computation by rounding in

3271019
floor	sqrt
conversely the index of the biggest fibonacci number less than i is given by floor log i sqrt 5 log phi

3271029
subtraction	addition
compound-assignment versions of iterator addition and subtraction

3271031
jpa	javax.persistence

i have an rss parser which downloads a link to each item from an rss feed

3271092
nsstring	nsdata	writetofile	nsdata
whenever you fail to send details - write content of the array to a file using nsarray writetofile you can use serialization if array contain any data which is custom defined if your array contain standard cocoa objects nsstring nsdata etc they already implemented with serialization

3271181
post	get
now when i click the button the form is submited but it sends it using the get method because i can see it in the adress bar but it never gets sent to the php file and i checked to see if the names are correct and if i specify the post method it still doesnt go to the php file

3271205
public	protected
the private protected public access modifiers gives you either full read write access or no access

3271232
pascal	delphi
delphi object pascal

3271260
rvm	bundler
p.s put bundler aside and use rvm instead

3271264
accessor	properties
not to mention objective-c 2.0 properties read-only accessor

3271281
hash	md5
the other benefit of this is that md5 assures hash strings that are 32 characters numbers long

3271331
width	height
the only reason i can imagine why you would need the image width and height is if you don t want to scale the image

3271331
width	height
this way you will have a clean layout preserving the aspect ratio of your images while not having to use scripts to modify their width and height

3271358
hash	md5
for passwords a good solution is to use a oneway encryption like a md5 hash or sha1

3271358
hash	salt
to increase the security of using a one way hash you can apply a salt this help restrict the effectiveness of certain types of attackes like a dictionary attack etc

3271360
hash	md5
a md5 hash is always 32 characters long

3271374
try-catch	exception-handling
something like this is done sometimes when the creation of the initial value may throw a checked exception-handling and therefore needs to be put in a try-catch block

3271420
prepare	execute
1 - if you want to execute a query in a loop more than 1 time prepare statement can be faster because of optimization that you mentioned

3271422
width	height
getpixel is unbelievably slow and accessing the width and height properties of a bitmap inside a loop is also slow

3271448
jwindow	jdialog
i have tried many styles of jframe jwindow jdialog .

3271567
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
should display 5 jcheckbox for each jradiobutton in the same jframe

3271567
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
jradiobutton is displaying now but if i click that jradiobutton jcheckbox is not

3271603
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
create and add all objects that you need for testing jradiobutton jcheckbox and make sure that they are both displayed check using layout managers and a visual guide to layout managers if you add both but do not see both

3271630
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
by the way tested and works perfectly on ie6 ie7 ie 8 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 5 opera 10.60 safari 4.0.5

apache	nginx
however when using apache nginx etc it s your responsibility to make sure that your server makes the files available at that url using rewrite rules symlinks etc

3271848
firefox	safari
can anybody explain why the resizable no does not work in safari or firefox haven t tested any other browsers

3271850
try-catch	exception-handling
typically it would this affects how exception-handling handling happens in a try-catch

3271850
try-catch	exception-handling
under c++ use wrappers and with try-catch to catch soft exception-handling

3271899
awt	swing	swt	swing
see this article for explanation on how swt awt and swing relate to each other

3271945
width	height
without knowing what specifically you need to achieve some suggestions would be to use some kind of placeholder css on the offending elements setting a width height colour whatever it is you need to try to mitigate the effect

3271975
swt	nebula
since swt gives you only the basics you need miglayout and nebula widgets to survive

3271975
swt	swing
actually i would have liked to include another option besides swt and swing for you qt jambi

3271975
swt	swing
i can t really compare swt to swing since my experience with swing is limitted

3271975
swt	swing
obviously there are more 3rd party extensions for swing than for swt - just do a google search

3271975
swt	swing
if you plan for long term i don t see more options than swt or swing for gui development in java

3272006
haskell	ocaml
in haskell you can use typeclasses in ml ocaml people would use dictionary of functions or maybe

3272030
folder	directory
a better way to do it is to download the folder to your documents directory

3272068
jtable	jtextpane
now the problem is that i want to show jtable containing my course info on left side along with jtextpane in a single frame on right side so that user can select item from jtable and paste it in right side jtextpane in java..........

3272071
width	height
i am working on iframes and i need to show a certain portion of the page say the top right in an iframe with about 300px width and 150px height

3272088
width	height
set the iframe to the appropriate width and height and set the scrolling attribute to no

3272112
opencv	emgucv
since you are on c# you should look at emgucv .net wrapper for opencv

3272120
firefox	safari
in firefox safari all is good

3272130
disk	ram
if the arrays are larger than can be stored in your computer s ram then obviously you should store part of the array or its entirety on disk

3272189
hide	show
in the below image i am trying to achieve the following.i have a table and lots of labels embossed over table cells.the height of the labels is always equal to the cell height.so if two labels come in the same point one hide the another as show in the longer rectangles with red rect over blue.alternatively what i want is to make the height as half and there by show both the rectangles showing starting and end points of the rectangle since height is of no use i can half the height of the rectangle to accomodate one more in the same cell.

3272191
google-chrome	firefox
as you said firefox and google-chrome will open a new tab

3272203
children	parent
it s not really polymorphism if the children are just calling their parent implementation

3272213
gridview	formview
but in visual studio 2008 controls asp.net c# i have seen that when the page is displayed in the browser the controls namely gridview formview and linkbutton

3272264
irc	icq
this libpurple php binding which defines a set of internal classes gives a possibility to use aol and icq oscar yahoo msn jabber irc and much more protocols directly from php

3272284
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if the byte-code is translated into machine-code and not just jit i mean if you execute the program and if your program uses many allocations deallocations it could be faster because the gc algorithm just need one pass theoretically through the whole memory once but normal malloc realloc free c c++ calls causes an overhead on every call call-overhead data-structure overhead cache misses

3272293
post	get
if you wanted to use something else like an existing http service in php then you would use the requestbuilder to build your get or post and send it to the server

3272295
google-chrome	safari
wkhtmltopdf for example uses the webkit rendering engine the one that safari and google-chrome use to create pdfs

3272345
width	height
the problem is that when the image is of a certain width and height the image is cropped but a 1px column of black pixels is added to the right of the image

3272345
width	height
maybe when the division of the height and the width gives a decimal number then the square is not perfect and the black pixels are added.

3272358
client-side	server-side
server-side frameworks use this approach to allow server-side guys to generate all the client-side code

3272416
folder	directory
there are only two real alternatives put the dll in the same folder as the exe or put it in the working directory for the exe

3272419
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
e.g. many more functions than algebraic datatypes or many more methods than oo constructors. in an object-oriented language if you leave a method out of a subclassing the compiler can t tell whether that s a mistake or whether you intended to inherited the superclass method unchanged

3272430
maven	pom.xml
i m not a j2me expert but what you get when using the j2me-simple archetype is a maven project using the j2me-maven-plugin with default preconfigured settings that you can tweak in various ways there are lots of commented part in the generated pom.xml

3272456
maven	pom.xml
run maven install from the plugin directory you checked out and then add the following in your plugins section of your projects pom.xml

3272467
qsort	bsearch
this particular pattern is useful in other situations generally where extensibility is needed at runtime and is frequently seen in c with function pointers in place of blocks qsort and bsearch . for just updating a field however the usual way is to just call from the simpler method to the more complex one

3272477
put	get
this resource would be located at a uri like airports jfk which would be retrieved with a get method updated with a put method and deleted with a delete method

3272477
post	put
finally adding a new resource could either be a put method on the airport s full uri or a post method on airports

3272477
post	put
the difference between the methods is who gets to decide the final uri for the airport the client decides for put and the service decides for post

3272477
post	put	post	get	put	get
i would go ahead and set up a restful design as i ve described then describe my resources as complex types using xsd and a soap service with actions that duplicate the get put delete and post operations of the restful service

3272484
nsexception	nserror
however be advised that the pool will eat up any nserror or nsexception objects created within its scope so you ll have to make sure those objects survive past the end of your code with additional retains and releases

3272537
django	turbogears
mvc in guis isn t quite the same as it is in django or turbogears

3272547
move	drag

width	height
that will be either the width or height of the selection all the lines depending on which one is larger width vs height

3272600
int	chars
this works fine for basic data types such as int chars float etc

3272620
move	drag
are there any tools firefox plugins that will allow you to drag elements divs images etc about on the page and tell you the amount x y that you have move it

3272631
versioning	upgrade
and if you want to upgrade to a newer versioning you d have to do it on all installs

3272670

3272672
salt	md5
they are appending and prepending salt to the password before they run it through md5

3272672
hash	salt
now they hash the salt password

3272683
hash	md5
are you storing the md5 hash of the user password

3272683
hash	md5
as an side an md5 hash is not a cryptographically secure way to hash a password

3272684
folder	directory
this works as we do as the common folder so no extra configuration is needed for the different directory structures

3272735
int	chars
as far as my understanding of languages goes a buffer is any portion of memory in which a data is stored like an int float variables chars arrays etc

3272852
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in my experience what people usually consider bad about inherited as implemented by most oo languages is not the idea of inherited itself but the idea of subclassing modifying the behavior of methods defined in the superclass method overriding specifically in the presence of mutable state

3272852
superclass	subclassing
so problems arise when for example a superclass expects a certain method to modify a private variable but a subclassing overrides the method to do something completely different

3272853
post	get
is there a web service or any other method where i can post some identifier city name zip code etc and get back the time

3272909
post	get
is there a web service or any other method where i can post some identifier city name zip code etc and get back the time

3272966
getter	setter
don t forget that properties are simply shorthand syntax for generating getter and setter methods

3272982
distance	altitude
altitude however is usually measured in above sealevel which means that you could determine the distance from the ground by substracting the ground evaluation from your actual evaluation ev ground - alt distance fromground

3273029
post	put
i need a query that for each user concatenates the text column of all post of that user and put them in the text column of the user

3273035
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
you use nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller to manage a window or a view because you should only need to create subclasses of nswindow or nsview for new kinds of window or view

3273052
apache	nginx
i doubt very much that at_exit handlers would be called if your rails instance was hosted inside passenger and the associated apache or nginx server crashed for some reason although i ve not actually tested this

3273056
vim	textmate
i know that textmate does this figured someone has ported it by now to vim also

3273068
addition	multiplication
it states that for any given proof system there are true statements of arithmetic the logic of addition and multiplication of natural numbers that cannot be proved in the proof system

3273074
apache	nginx
i m currently using nginx as a transparent proxy for apache

3273094
rss	feed
you could make a php script to parse the rss feed and email that contents

3273094
post	get
depending on whether how many post get done in a week you could either create a function for it to fire after the post is posted

3273108
mouseup	mousedown
you need a mousedown or mouseup event to determine which mouse button was actually clicked

3273108
mouseup	mousedown
the which property within a mousedown mouseup event handler will contain a number which indicates which mousebutton was clicked

3273141

3273211
metaphone	soundex
commons codec has an implementation of soundex and metaphone

3273221
for-loop	loops
even if it s declared outside of the for-loop each of the anonymous functions will still be referring to the same variable so after loops they ll all still point to the final value of item

3273240
single-quotes	backslash
also since the pattern contains single-quotes those would also have to be escaped by preceding with backslash

3273249
post	get
a post and a get are two different things

3273258
post	get
it seems you have mixed up get and post requests

3273265
uilabel	uitextview
from my limited testing text in a uitextview or uitextfield that is being edited has keyboard focus is smoother than a plain uilabel hanging out in a view

3273293
hash	salt
what i haven t found here or maybe it s my lack of understanding is how to retrieve a salt hash in my database and separate the salt from the hash password especially with unique salt to each password while maintaining the salt+password in a single column

3273316
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems is ntfs

3273317

3273346
metaphone	soundex
gunslinger47 mentions levenshtein soundex and metaphone

3273346
metaphone	soundex
soundex and metaphone compute a short string intended to encode the sound of the string when spoken by a human.

3273354
typedef	struct
please note as i have written it above using the struct method as opposed to the typedef does not provide any protection against using another related sequences members to construct a sequence object it is needed i think however for the last example to work

3273358
folder	directory
from there you should be able to continue the path through your folder structure to the class directory

3273369
post	put	post	get	put	get
i have a script php+html full of forms and inputs after the form is submited via post i can give the user a code like was a get form q test t 3 u 9 q2 test t2 3 u2 9 q3 test t3 3 3u 9 then the user can put this code in a textarea for editing what he previously submitted

3273392
hash	salt
if you want to store salt and hash in the same column you need to concatenate them

3273414
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it appears fine in firefox ie7 but not google-chrome safari ie8 - it temporarily is fine in ie8 b c i set the compatibility mode to ie7 in the head.

3273422
multiplying	add
the formula is easy you add one to the exponent of every prime divisor and multiplying them

3273449
hash	md5
how about using a hash md5 or sha1 etc of the file contents to determine if the file has been modified

3273477
x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
for an x86 bootloader you need to have a c++ compiler that can emit x86 assembly or at the very least you need to write your own preamble in 16-bit assembly that will put the cpu into 32-bit protected or 64bit long mode before you can call your c++ functions

3273479
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in dreamweaver the plugin works perfectly yet in safari firefox and google-chrome it does not

google-chrome	safari
your code works for me on google-chrome 5.0.375 and safari 5.0

3273627
queue	fifo
if your implementing fifo or last in last out queue like a stack you are better off using a linked-list since you can always use the same accessor to access the front or back-end of your list

3273653
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari google-chrome and firefox all understand this property and when set enable advanced kerning and ligatures

this allows you to right-click on a folder in nautilus and open a terminal window with that directory as its working directory

3273697
folder	directory
this will paste the path of the folder into the command line and you then type return to change to that directory

3273702
folder	directory
if the folder has a complicated path ie not just myfolder you could create a symlink to it in your home directory so you can get to it quickly

3273773
children	parent
it s parent originally had 3 children the left most and the right most became new seperate nodes

3273810
des	aes
there is no best cipher but i would recommend using an encryption algorithm that has been used a lot like tripple des or aes

3273835
getter	setter
in java or .net it consists of so-called setter and getter methods that set or get those properies

3273842
implements	extends
unfortunately i think you may need to implements this as a vs package which is a much more powerful way to extends visual studio

3273850
children	parent
you have two parent nodes and four children

3273850
children	parent
each parent must have two children because it has a single key

3273866

basics about hash salt public key encryption and how https works

3273867
quicksort	heapsort
even seasoned programmers get quicksort heapsort and merge sort wrong

3273887
google-chrome	safari
this works in ie6-9 ff3.6 safari 5 and google-chrome 5

3273894
vmware	virtualbox
i ve played around with virtualbox and vmware personal editions and found them both very useable for standalone work but am looking for something more centralised

3273924
hash	salt
always use well known well tested modules and algorithms such as openssl blowfish encryption and salt password hash

3273979
client-side	server-side
asp.net is a server-side technology which renders client-side browsable code

3273986
outputstream	inputstream
inputstream and outputstream are instance variables that probably should not be shared across threads

3274000
post	get
for creating editing deleting data use a with method post for reading data usually use a link or a with method get

3274098
width	height
in inspector the window template size tab had the maximum size box checked but a 0 for both width and height

3274098
width	height
when i rechecked the box inspector automatically filled in the width and height parameters with valid values of 480 and 270

3274107
accessor	properties
does cocoa provide a built-in method to convert a key string into a properly-formatted set properties accessor

3274119
width	height
assuming that you already have your image loaded into a bufferedimage which seems to be the case this code will crop the image from x y to width height

3274123
opera	firefox
render nicely on non-web toolkit browsers desktop browsers such as ie firefox opera

3274124
coalesce	isnull
most if not all sql dialects have an isnull or coalesce function which allows you to specify an alternative value when underlying column is null

3274137
google-chrome	safari
i have found both safari and google-chrome to be somewhat buggy with the way they handle js as well so you re definitely not alone

3274146
cpu	processors
if it turns out that your application is cpu bound then you ll obviously want to consider splurging on a high-end processors

3274149
getter	setter
note that getter like myproperty and setter like setmyproperty are called â œkey-value-coding-compliantâ for this reason

3274164
nsnull	nsstring
the cast is bad because nsnull is not an nsstring

3274167
maven	pom.xml
on the other hand if you use maven as your build framework then the dependencies are explicitly declared in the project pom.xml files

3274184
accessor	properties
investigate the existing apis you re using before you go off and do this which i might add will not work correctly if the accessor of a properties is set to something different

3274185
dlsym	dlopen
use dlopen then dlsym to load the function into memory and get its address

3274194
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using mouseenter and mouseleave

3274198
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
if you are using jquery 1.4 then you should replace mouseover mouseout with mouseenter mouseleave

3274216
getter	setter
do you know about getter and setter

background i m trying to create a convenience method that converts an nsimage instance to ciimage

3274401
bash	subshell
the bash script runs in a separate subshell

3274413
int	boolean
the rationale for this is that php is fairly loosely typed and tries to allow int strings floats and boolean values to be interchangeable

3274428

3283768
stateless	stateful
kind of an open question that i run into once in a while -- if you have an ejb stateful or stateless bean or possibly a direct servlet process that may with the wrong parameters start running long on a production system how could you effectively add in a manual kill switch for an administrator person to specifically kill that thread process

apache	nginx
however since nginx does the same thing as apache if you run x copies of rails after the never-returning route is hit x times you ll hit the same problem you re currently seeing

3284200
apache	nginx
you likely could use nginx or apache and configure it to only keep connections alive for 60 seconds - maybe this will restore connections from the never-returns-route and still allow that computation to go though unimpeded that is not send a connection reset to rails

rss	feed
i have got an rss feed working but would prefer to use a cleaner email subscription

3284207
hide	show
but it will only show icon in the taskbar for a brief period of time before windows will hide it automatically

paintevent on an object won t be called unless the object has a non-zero width and height

hash	md5
i need to send to a server in post an email string and a password md5 hash in byte

3284791
hash	md5
below how i get my md5 hash where password is a string what the user enter

3284791
hash	md5
so passmd5 should be an md5 hash in bytes of my string value password right

3284791
hash	md5
where urltemplate is a string like enc 1 email a string and password the md5 hash in bytes

3284791
hash	md5
i think because of this i don t send the good md5 hash and it makes a problem

3284791
hash	md5
so when i ask this url enc 0 and give the password as is so a string not a byte and not md5 hash and do

3284791
hash	md5
i just have either a problem with creating my md5 hash or with the http post or both..

serializable	deserialization
the puts the onus of serial deserialization completely upon the class being serializable

3284848
hash	salt
in my experience api keys are actually used as salt to hash and the key itself is not actually passed

3284848
hash	salt
if the hash doesn t match it means that client making requests to the server doesn t know 1 the steps to create the hash and more importantly 2 the api key used as the salt to create the hash

it sounds to me like you re looking for a while loops - not a for-loop

3285007

3285552
client-side	server-side

i build a new viewmodelbase class inheriting from mvvm light s viewmodelbase class where i implementment a domaincontext list of possibly pending operations current operation isbusy properties a savecommand and a protected method to log any operations created by viewmodels that inherited from this class

3285700
stdout	stderr
that is if you don t care about stdout and still want to log stderr do you

3285700
stdout	stderr
if you don t even care about stderr just redirect it to stdout

3285700

3285756
mergesort	in-place
the problem really seems to be asking how to do the merge step of mergesort but in-place

3285769
hide	show
if you want to show hide the links from the status details of your view model use a property which you bind to and update in the view model

3285769
hide	show
you can use a userinfo property then a converter class such as this to show hide based upon the userinfo property being a null value or a class result

3285841
onresume	onpause
set this variable to true when your activity resumes invokes onresume and set the variable to false when your activity pauses onpause

3285853
nullreferenceexception	invalidoperationexception
just about the biggest one is that explicit cast might throw an invalidoperationexception and not nullreferenceexception

3285908
int	chars
in fact a better way to think about it is that you can only match constructors and it so happens that int chars string co

3285957
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.date and java.util.calendar

3286114
inherited	subclassing
by way of disclaimer i was generating the subclassing on the fly and inherited was a bit of a cheat to keep my code generation simple as always my first instinct is to try to remove the extends relationship altogether

3286137
children	parent
one way for the parent to know what to make is to keep a dict of the children

3286137
children	parent
there are ways that the parent class doesn t need to enumerate its children by searching for all of its subclasses but it s a bit more complex to implement

3286292
multiplication	modulo
the result of the multiplication will be reduced modulo size_max + 1 which means it ll only try and allocate around 2gb

3286325
valgrind	gprof
as bobah said gprof and valgrind are useful

3286353
width	height
i figure an easy way to load the saved values such as the width and height for a div would be to have cakephp echo a variable as their width height in the css file much the same way it would do this in the view file

3286355
filesystems	fat
you can probably disable paging and disable caching for the store using the fat filesystems registry entries

3286363
clang	llvm
what features of the language are the clang llvm projects the parts of gcc that are being written in c++ chromium and any others all taking advantage of

3286405
width	height
the docs state the first pane of a split view controller has a fixed width of 320 points and a height that matches the visible window height

3286408
folder	directory
so the extdiff extension is working fine except that even when one side of the comparison is my working directory as in the case where i only give one revision argument hg bcomp -r 25 to get a diff between rev25 and the working directory it causes my diff tool in this case bc3 to open up a folder comparison session comparing a snapshot of rev25 to a snapshot of the working directory such as.

3286437
mouse	keyboard
apparently the latter is in effect that is the event is fired when the popup is closed either by mouse or by the keyboard like pressing esc

3286464

better yet it is compiled and its speed is competitive with java and c++ though you have to put forth extra effort to get this speed in some cases

3286471
folder	directory
i want git to ignore the build directory which is in the root folder of the xcode project

3286483
accessor	properties
however it does require that the properties be read write public properties because it s going to go through these properties accessor to get and set the serialized data

3286533
hide	show
i would argue that you should set the .visible property for each control you want to show hide

3286590
put	get
...use two indexes 1 hashed for searching value by key 2 sequential for tracking last recently used items get function put item as last item in sequesnce

3286802
int	chars
phone numbers - int or varchar or maybe chars depends on if you want to store formatting

3286802
innodb	myisam
also innodb uses row level locking whereas myisam only uses table level locking

3286802
innodb	myisam
therefore innodb can handle higher levels of concurrency better than myisam

3286802
innodb	myisam
myisam versus innodb

3286802
innodb	myisam
however you have to use the myisam engine to use full-text index because innodb doesn t support it

3286802
innodb	myisam
however if you absolutely need posts to use innodb for transactions then set up a trigger to update the myisam copy of your posts table and use the myisam copy for all your full-text searches

3286808
width	height
i think that the modal doesn t count them in it s height or width calculation or something

3286852
cgpoint	cgrect
so apple includes a cgrectintersectsrect method which checks if two rectangles are intersecting each other but do they have a method that i can use the checks if a cgpoint intersects a cgrect

mouse	keyboard
and just like any language or car or keyboard or mouse the more you use it the more efficient you get at using it

3286867
multiplying	add
some instruction sets make it that much easier and some programmers might swap the multiplying for a shift or a shift plus add

3286867
memcpy	memset
bootup code often calls memcpy for .data and memset for .bss

3286881
next	except
next is similar to the continue keyword in the c family of languages except in ruby it makes an iterator move to the next iteration

3286898
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties	superclass	subclassing
you may want to restore the constructor properties of the subclass.prototype object after the above line because if you don t do it the instances created with subclassing like sub in your example will have an inherited constructor properties wrongly pointing to superclass

width	height
cfimage action captcha width 250 height 80 text railo

3286957
hash	md5
if the pages don t have any dynamic content the easiest way to do that is to generate hash for the files using a md5 or sha1 commands and check then against the new server

3287025
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
believe me for some projects pixel perfection is possible across at least safari ie firefox and google-chrome because i ve sat there for hours days

servlet on the other hand is a class conforming to the servlet api to process http requests such as get post etc

3287234
getter	setter
use synthesize and keep the synthesized setter and getter or

3287234
getter	setter
provide a manual implementation of both the setter and the getter without using one of the above directives

3287234
getter	setter
if you declare the property with nonatomic then you can mix manual and synthesized implementations of getter and setter

3287234
clang	llvm
as of llvm 4.0 clang provides auto-synthesis for declared properties that are not dynamic

3287234
getter	setter
by default even if you leave out the synthesize the compiler will provide getter and setter methods for you

3287234
getter	setter
however the rule for atomic properties is still the same either let the compiler provide both the getter and the setter or implement them both yourself

3287237
division	modulo
a simple division will not work and tried modulo but cannot get it to give me the right answer

once the view is rendered you will have a form and you should put everything you need to get back in this form visible input fields that the user will manipulate and hidden fields that will contain any context you would like to get in the action you are posting to

3291601
vbscript	jscript
if you use scripts vbscript jscript you can continue using your scripts or instead use ahadmin which is our new underlying com configuration api

3291618
unix	bsd
i found a reference to the relevant article in the bsd mac os x man page for cat rob pike unix style or cat -v considered harmful usenix summer conference proceedings 1983

3291637
implements	extends
unfortunately this prevents one from generating a dynamic proxy that extends a specific abstract class rather than implements specific interfaces

3291686
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in ie7 firefox google-chrome safari and seems like ie 7 just will not want to work

3291752
jboss	geronimo
at least it works under tomcat jboss and geronimo and it works today

3291768
serializable	deserialization
given that the error implies that there is a failure to cast objects of type java.lang.object to the enum class i believe there is a failure in the serializable and deserialization process when the response from the ejb is received at the client

3291811
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you use a linq provider based on iqueryable like linq to sql as opposed to linq to objects which is based on ienumerable you could parse the expression tree find the expression based on some index and add the corresponding orderby method call

3291838
width	height
fixed height liquid width

3291851
uipangesturerecognizer	uipinchgesturerecognizer
i have a uiimageview that i am able to transfrom using uipangesturerecognizer uirotationgesturerecognizer and uipinchgesturerecognizer all that works great

3291858
eigenvalue	diagonal
you just have to find the index of the largest eigenvalue in d which can easily be done using the function diag to extract the main diagonal and the function max to get the maximum eigenvalue and the index where it occurs

3291936
memcpy	strcpy
i read many articles about unsafe functions like strcpy memcpy etc

3291938
profiling	debugging
i have seen with the debugging flag that my production profiling is used but development profiling is used too because it is activebydefault

3291947
for-loop	loops
similarly i would like to change all the old-skool loops to the simplified for-loop introduced in java 5

3291956
google-chrome	safari
it could support other browsers in the future such as google-chrome or safari

3291961
screens	tablet
the problem is that with new devices on the horizon eg rumored tablet - with much bigger display it won t necessarily be practical to target a specific screens size

3291978
width	height
i ve specified the width and height of the tag initially.when the content appends dynamically the content may be large and it overflows to the tag

3292107
ostringstream	std
when would i use std istringstream std ostringstream and std stringstream and why shouldn t i just use std stringstream in every scenario are there any runtime performance issues

3292135
google-chrome	firefox
the script is working perfectly in firefox google-chrome but not it ie6

3292179
post	get
i just would like to know if it is possible sending get and post ajax requests at the same time and if it is how to do it using the xmlhttprequest object

3292198
ostringstream	std
in most cases you won t find yourself needing both input and output on the same stringstream so using std ostringstream and std istringstream explicitly makes your intention clear

3292206
crypt	md5
it s just a wrapper around some one-way hashing functions i believe so if your current php site s using crypt s md5 or sha256 or whatever i d expect that you could find those equivalent hashing classes functions in java

3292208
javassist	cglib
it can be done using javassist see proxyfactory or cglib

3292221
crypt	md5
you have to know what implementation of php crypt has been used md5

3292229
src	attr
caution attr src blah will set the src to blah.

3292268
gmail	hotmail
i tried this way with gmail and hotmail and both are working perfectly

3292314
entity-relationship	diagram
this can lead to maintenance nightmares when you have hundreds of tables and no ability to generate an entity-relationship diagram between them because the geniuses who designed the system 20 years ago didn t understand the severe limitations of the core dbms

3292316
sorting	filtering	hide	show
related to this i can t say enough about jquery datatables for the functionality it brings to plain tabular data such as sorting filtering paging show hide detail etc

3292324
post	get
if you post to you ll still be able to access foo as a get parameter

3292327
away3d	papervision3d
either papervision3d or away3d will do

3292349
udp	tcp
using tcp instead of udp will make the thing much simpler since completeness and receiving order are guaranteed

3292352
updatepanel	ascx
i have a user control ascx that has an updatepanel

3292355
nsstring	nsdata
objects include nsdata nsstring

3292386
ilist	iqueryable
working with interfaces we commonly have a var or an iqueryable that is going to return a set of data objects that we will then cast to the interface and return as a list or ilist like this

3292390
post	put
according to the post i put this in the mailsender bean configuration

3292403
polymorphism	specialization
the specialization are a form of compile time polymorphism

3292403
polymorphism	specialization
now you can combine it with runtime polymorphism -- implement the specialization in terms of an implementation class that is type agnostic

3292444
mouse	keyboard
i want to know how to walk around using mouse and keyboard like first person shooting game

3292470
factors	matrix
the mitigating factors in your case may well be the size of your matrix

3292474
ubuntu	debian
as someone else mentioned the ubuntu debian multiverse repositories have additional java packages

3292501
stdout	stderr
i ve built a grammar and for the most part it does what i expect but i need it to be able to run silently no output to stdout or stderr

3292532
crypt	hash
php s crypt supports multiple hash functions

3292532
hash	md5
if you use the md5 version hash starts with 1 you can find a java implementation here

3292537
pthreads	fork
someone suggested using fork however i need a solution for both windows and pthreads

3292539
innodb	myisam
will it help if the table is myisam instead of innodb

3292582
equals	gethashcode
note that is irrelevant with this question your equals implementation is really bad as it doesn t take into account types and depends only on gethashcode value

3292589
inherited	properties
a propertyinfo p representing a properties belonging to 1 an interface i that t implements 2 a base class b that t inherited from or 3 the class t itself

3292589
inherited	properties
i need to get the attributes defined on or inherited by the properties in t even if p s declaringtype is an interface that t implements or a class that t inherited from

3292617
accessor	properties
i m having a bit of confusion with properties accessor

3292617
accessor	properties
i d like to have an internal properties with its set accessor only accessible to derived classes

3292622
folder	directory
what do i need to do to save or retrieve the file in a folder that is a child of project directory

3292623
disk	ram
another alternative if you re passing around a lot of data would be to write read to from a file on disk better a ram disk and communicate that way but unless you re talking a lot of data that s overkill

3292631
inherited	subclassing
something like an svnrevision and an hgrevision and a gitrevision are very closely semantically linked and i want them to be able to do the same things so that i can have code elsewhere that acts on any kind of repository object and is agnostic of the subclassing which is why i want them to inherited from an abstract-class

3292634
pop-up	dialog
the excel 2003 api has a getsaveasfilename method that pop-up the save as dialog

3292639
getter	setter
both would let derived types from a different assembly access the setter but not the getter

3292651
children	parent
every parent has 0 or more children

3292651
children	parent
in the web page i don t want to put all the children information i only whant to have a text field for the parent name

3292651
children	parent
when the control return to me i d like to create a new parent object with the brand new name and to merge with the entitymanger without worrying about the children

3292671
ready	each
if you are loading multiple gwt modules within the same page each module s entrypoint will be called as soon as both that module and the outer document is ready

3292694
folder	directory
ios applocation programming guide a few important application directory talks about which folder are backed up and which aren t

3292694
folder	directory
iphone application programming guide getting paths to application directory shows how to get the path to that folder by using nssearchpathfordirectoriesindomains with nscachesdirectory parameter

3292741
accessor	properties
if you intend for this properties to be used only within your assembly then make the properties accessor internal

3292741
accessor	properties
unfortunately this means you have to give up protected on the accessor of internal properties

3292745
ienumerable	iqueryable
calling asenumerable will cause cast to be evaluated on a ienumerable not iqueryable so the cast will be done on the actual object returned from the db rather than directly in the db

3292752
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to the most recent versioning of sqlalchemy and some of my code no longer works

3292765
accessor	properties
it isn t the lack of encapsulation that removes the need for accessor it s the fact that by changing from a direct attribute to a properties you can add an accessor at a later time without changing the published interface in any way

3292773
int	double
there is no overload for int so you need to cast to a double or a decimal

3292784
google-chrome	firefox
if you don t have firefox then i am pretty sure google-chrome also has something similar to firebug built in

3292813
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
including an anchor tag in an asp.net asp.net-mvc html.actionlink

3292862
post	put
i recently read this post floating point vs integer calculations on modern hardware and was curious as to the performance of my own processor on this quasi-benchmark so i put together two versions of the code one in c# and one in c++ visual studio 2010 express and compiled them both with optimizations to see what falls out

3292862
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

3292867
google-chrome	safari
the unescaping of the url is a safari bug since the same problem does not occur in google-chrome or any other browser

3292891
int	chars
you do not need to specify a chars count for int columns

3292891
int	chars	tinyint	varchar
don t worry about tinyint vs smallint vs int vs bigint or chars vs varchar vs text vs bigtext

3292895
iasyncresult	idisposable
had they followed their own advice iasyncresult would have derived from idisposable since the implication is that it holds idisposable resources

3292912
inherited	properties
i think you re missing a case it is possible that t just inherited the properties from b without overriding it unless you know for sure this won t happen in your specific scenario

3292912
inherited	properties
however you need to watch out for the case where t hides the properties inherited from b using the new modifier

3292912
inherited	properties
to handle that case you can check the attributes of the properties s getter method obtained with getgetmethod if the newslot flag is present it hides the inherited getter

3292917
children	parent
consider the following example and assume that child1 child2 child3 are all children of parent -

3292934
ienumerable	iqueryable
cast will take an ienumerable already but you can create an overload that accepts an iqueryable something like this untested

3292939
disk	ram
ideally this file should be on a ram disk of course

3292953
int	double
is there any function in c++ which converts all data types double int short etc to string

3292954
gmail	hotmail
i want a php code to load contact list from hotmail yahoo and gmail something like a friend referral scripts

3292982
min	max
i have a table with the following data that i need a query to get col1 max col2 min col3

3292982
min	max
so that s for each distinct col1 i want to get the max col2 and min col3

3292987
mongoid	mongomapper
did some testing with mongomapper last week it was stable but i found the query interface a little limited also some of the ar logic was quirky switched to mongoid today and it feels much better to use - and more intuitive if you are used to ar

3292997
ienumerable	ilist
on my property so i think to expose a simple property of ienumerable and encapsulate an ilist like a private field

3293016
post	get
you will have to pass some sort of information along with your image to identiy it probably via url params or post params but i don t really want to get into that

3293027
post	get
aside from that the only ways that i ve found to get multi-project mvc to work has been using portable areas or mef blog.maartenballiauw.be post 2009 04 21 aspnet-mvc-and-the-managed-extensibility-framework- 28mef 29.aspx and

3293050
int	double
as rick mentions in his comment the reason for casting the int to a double decimal probably works too is that the function does not have an overload for int

3293112
folder	directory
i have removed the temporary asp.net files folder in question and have also removed and re-added the references in question and deleted the contents of my bin directory

3293130
width	height
it looks like you just have to add the image s height and width attributes

3293135
exponent	modulo
create a class that contains just a modulo and an exponent

3293189
range	max
the argument does not indicate a max length or max range of values it s only a hint for display

3293224
hide	show
i do not want to use the show or hide commands i prefer to use detach but i think there should be a nice way to deal with it

3293255
sorting	filtering
offloading sorting and filtering logic to the server even at the expense of additional entities loaded in memory so that your client can remain fast pays dividends in my experience

3293266
integer	fractions
since your function couldn t use an integer in its operation it needs a type in the fractions class it makes that very complaint there s no instance of integer in the fractions class

3293285
width	height
set a min-width and min-height on the tags instead of height and width

3293285
width	height
earlier versions of ie will helpfully ignore these properties...so you ll need to continue setting height and width in an ie only style sheet

3293292
ant	maven
tomcat is used for deployment and there are also maven and ant versions in case you prefer one to another option for organizing project builds

3293328
nswindow	nsscrollview	nstextview	nsscrollview
my window is structured like so nswindow - nsview - nstabview - nsscrollview - nstextview

3293330
arpack	lapack
lapack does not have special support built in for sparse matrices but arpack does

3293341
division	addition
i think it is a few cycles slower than addition but yes division is very slow compared to the others

3293348
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
note this was a modified form of touchesbegan touchesmoved

3293354
cloudant	couchdb
mongodb support is in beta partnering with mongohq and couchdb is roadmapped for later this year in conjunction with cloudant

3293364
innodb	myisam
i think you are confused about two different issues when to use innodb instead of myisam and when to use foreign key fk constraints

3293364
innodb	myisam
as for the first issue there have been many answers that do a great job of explaining the differences between myisam and innodb

3293364
innodb	myisam
this is because it uses table level locking instead of row level like innodb so myisam can t handle high concurrency as well plus it s missing features that help with data integrity such as transactions and foreign keys again already mentioned by others

3293387
division	multiplication
it s possible that c# optimized the division by vx to multiplication by 1 vx since it knows those values aren t modified during the loop and it can compute the inverses just once up front

3293392
disk	ram
so if you have a few nonclustered indices on your table then you re definitely a wasting a lot of space and not just on disk - also in your server s ram

3293411
post	get
my options are basically to figure out how to get merge calls to send the data along with the request do a delete followed by a post delete and recreate the record on every update or figure out how to modify the odata service to accept puts for updates

3293427
spaces	delimiter
another here doc syntax doesn t require you to use the dash but it does require that the end of here doc delimiter is in column 1 or there are no spaces that precede it

3293428
firefox	safari
mozilla firefox tested with 3.6.6 doesn t support border-radius neither does safari 4.0

3293536
put	get
note bundles have get and put methods for all the primitive types parcelables and serializables

3293548
folder	directory
i think it s not so much a problem of virtual directory as the fact that the explorer tries to hide system files from users to protect them from doing destructive things like wiping out their windows system32 folder

3293581
next	except
it works i can pinch-and-zoom and drag except that the image goes off the screen and i can t scroll to the next image in the gallery

3293626
jax-ws	jax-rs
standard xml binding technology for jax-ws jax-rs and sca

3293631
sorting	filtering
if you want to take explicit control over sorting behavior there is a rich client-side api that allows you to specify sort and filtering directly

3293633
public	protected
i don t give constructors their own section like most people do except that they are the first entry of their category so public constructors come just after protected methods for example

3293650
mouse	keyboard
i want to know if it is possible to hide the scrollbar while scrolling is still enabled with mouse keyboard

3293708
inherited	properties
edit mygroupbox.cs modify to inherited from contentcontrol and add title dependency properties

3293749
post	get
when i don t have the file in the file input i get the post data but when i do the post data is empty

3293749
post	get
how can i deal with a large file upload and still get the post data

3293772
width	height
i think you just need to also set its width height properties

3293789
dictionary	map
build a dupe map which is essentially a dictionary with a key of the letter and a value of the occurrence count

3293791
many-to-many	one-to-many
i understand that the nature of the relationship probably matters one-to-one one-to-many many-to-many uni-directional bi-directional and probably access patterns matter too

3293809
tarfile	zipfile
by looking at tarfile and zipfile module i don t see any existing function that allow me to get a table of content of a zipfile within a tar.gz file

3293811
udp	mtu
also it is quite likely to loose big udp packets along the way because the wrapping ip packet might be fragmented due to mtu limitations

3293838
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you have a many-to-many relationship you ll need to re-work the tables so you end up with two one-to-many relationships and an intermediate resolution table

3293845
google-chrome	firefox
i don t get this behaviour with firefox ie or google-chrome

3293891
mouse	keyboard
when i am working on a project and compiling all the time it gets very annoying having to select the code window with the mouse each time after compiling is there a keyboard shortcut in visual studio to select the code window

3293918
gridview	objectdatasource
i have an asp.net web forms page with a gridview control bound to an objectdatasource

3293918
gridview	objectdatasource
the methods on the data access class have sorting paging parameters so i can use the built-in capabilities of the gridview objectdatasource controls

3293971
public	protected
use inheritance and make sure that the elements from the master form your are trying to access are declared as protected or public

3294005
nsstring	nsdata
what i ve done thus far and it works but isn t pretty is to read the nsdata into an nsstring the data seems to be ascii encoded

3294021
client-side	server-side
this is often used when doing javascript programming with asp.net to get the client-side html id of server-side controls because asp.net can dynamically adjusts html ids at runtime

3294024
sqldatasource	formview
i ve written a page outside of visual web developer 2010 that uses a sqldatasource object along with a formview object that works perfect

3294046
google-chrome	firefox
i notice this in firefox not so much in ie or google-chrome

3294048
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari google-chrome and firefox all render this correctly

3294085
cifs	smb
cifs smb

3294096
bazaar	git
this script allows you to add bazaar repositories as git branches in your git repository

3294117
getdate	dateadd
delete from tbl_cancel where cdate dateadd d -2 getdate

3294157
ubuntu	linux
well after a nightmare trying to solve the issue finally i update ubuntu from 9 to 10 this solve the problem i think some update of linux break php if it happend me again probably i ll begin rebooting the vps

3294165
hash	md5
i suppose it s something to do with md5 hash

3294176
xna	spritebatch
is there a way in the xna framework to render your 2d scene using the typical spritebatch method and then after that frame is rendered apply effect to the whole image

3294178
integer	fractions
the binary representation of a decimal value consists of a 1-bit sign a 96-bit integer number and a scaling factor used to divide the 96-bit integer and specify what portion of it is a decimal fractions

3294237
versioning	upgrade
okay i had just upgrade to the latest versioning of views and cck

3294248
ant	maven
i m in the process of moving them from ant to maven but i m having some difficulty figuring out the best way to do it in maven

3294248
ant	maven
this is how i have it set up in ant but there may not be an appropriate parallel in maven

3294275
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	ironruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
pretty much all implementations of ruby have their own private extension api and extensions that are for example written for mri don t necessarily work on yarv ree or rubinius and they certainly don t work on jruby or ironruby

3294275
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	ironruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
right now there are five ruby execution engines that are generally considered to be of production-ready quality ironruby 1.1 jruby 1.5.1 rubinius 1.0.1 yarv 1.9.1-p429 and also i personally consider yarv 1.9.2-rc2 to be production-ready and mri 1.8.7-p299

3294275
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	ironruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
the difference becomes really dramatic when running multithreaded code on a multicore machine such as for example azul systems 864-core java appliance because mri yarv ree and rubinius cannot actually run multiple threads in parallel and thus are only ever going to use at most one core whereas jruby and ironruby will happily use all available cores

3294305
implements	extends
im trying to implements a listadapter that supports integer arraylists by extends the baseadapter when initialize the activity my app crashes

3294361
pull	push
of course this is an pull service compared to the streaming push services provided by thomson reuters bloomberg activ financial etc so there are definitely types of financial apps high-frequency trading systems etc that this sort of data feed is not appropriate for

3294370
uilabel	uibutton
how can i apply this code to uilabel uibutton etc without multiple inheritance

3294408
uilabel	uibutton
for your specific problem i might approach it by designing movableview as a container class that was just an object that has a child view uilabel uibutton etc that you want to move as its subview

3294412
puts	gets
he will then have to do some searching and possible keep track of what he is discovering so that he can use the uris again efficiently in future to do gets posts puts and deletes

3294436
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
a case-insensitive wildcard search will definitely be a more expensive db query than a case-sensitive exact match

3294436
postgresql	mysql
database engine mysql postgresql sqlite etc.

3294471
inherited	properties
another approach can be to bind a method to its instance within the constructor keep in mind that the method will be defined as an own properties on each object instance you create it will not be inherited for example

3294501
uiview	subviews
what i would do is make a movableview class that inherits from uiview and simply add whatever you want movable as a subviews of that view which i think might be slightly different than what quixoto was saying my apologies if not

3294525
filtering	grouping
grouping on dates i could get then get the sum of quantity on that day however the final result set can t be aggregate due to user provided filtering that may exclude some of these records down the road

3294528
for-loop	loops
another subtle difference is that any variable you declare within a for-loop will be available outside loops whereas those within an iterator block are effectively private

3294541
post	put
415 is returned by the server when the entity sent in a request content in a post or put has an unsupported mediatype they sent xml

3294575
int	double
mostly for number types such as int double etc.

3294575
icomparable	compareto
the problem is if i do the following i get an error but according to msdn icomparable s compareto is supposed to be able to handle null values

3294583
typedef	struct
typedef struct _foo

3294583
typedef	struct
_foo x.c typedef struct _foo

3294651
rel	alt
i think if you properly use tag attributes like alt title longdesc rel rev etc

3294685
innodb	myisam
myisam has table-locks instead of the innodb row-locks

3294694
google-chrome	firefox
firefox or google-chrome doesn t wait for that but display the content right away

3294726
outputstream	inputstream
then rather than writing to an outputstream you provide the user could provide whatever kind of inputstream they wanted and your framework would just copy that to the servlet outputstream

3294729
vxworks	ecos	vxworks	rtos	vxworks	qnx	rtos	ecos	rtos	qnx	qnx	ecos
a middle ground can probably be achieved with a more fully featured rtos such ecos vxworks neucleus or qnx neutrino

3294749
rss	feed
i m looking for a list the bigger the better of rss feed to test a feed reader i m writing

3294764
hide	show
how do you hide such variables you don t want to show outside your object

3294766
post	get
when we look at the iis logs on the remote server we see that the productservice proxy is making an http get request when the method call is initiated from the page but it is making an http post request when the method is called from the wcf service

3294766
post	get
bottom line the wcf client proxy tries to do a post instead of a get when used from within another wcf rest service but works correctly when used from a page or pretty much anywhere else

3294771
maven	pom.xml
i also used stringutils you can get that by including this in your pom.xml if you re using maven

3294773
post	get
the current stable version shows you the http headers get and post variables and the response text

3294786
int	double
this isn t an issue for the int tests and would crop up much later for the double tests
