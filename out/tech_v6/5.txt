postgresql	mysql
for example if you are writing an open source web application chances are that you need to support mysql and postgresql at least if not mssql and oracle

40034
dbml	edmx
i haven t tried it myself but huagati dbml edmx tools is recommended by other people

40034
dbml	edmx
huagati dbml edmx tools is an add-in

40063
gendarme	fxcop
gendarme is an open source rules based static analyzer similar to fxcop but finds a lot of different problems

40117
httphandler	httpcontext
httpcontext exposes the current instance for the request under the httpcontext.current property however the current context can also be passed in httphandler in the processrequest method

40119
jhat	jprofiler
ok i ve read the answers so far but let s just say i am a cheap bastard meaning i am more interested in learning how to use jhat than to pay for jprofiler

40141
jobs	cron
there is a --batch parameter missing gpg tries to read from dev tty that doesn t exist for cron jobs

40143
client-side	server-side
personally i use a set of methods i have developed for bridging the server-side asp.net magic i have yet to use the ms mvc stuff yet and my client-side code because of the munging of the ids that happens

40146
jrockit	yourkit
there are tools that should help you find your leak like jprobe yourkit ad4j or jrockit mission control

40259
gtk	ncurses
is there any ui library that can be to build both a text user interface ncurses and graphical user interface gtk

40277
pop-up	dialog
the designer even included detailed explanation of some subtle behavior in pop-up dialog that would appear when hovering over mock links

40289
getter	setter
then make getter and setter functions for each property so that the default values could be changed

40344
sorting	filtering
however this is slow for very large tables and sorting and filtering is cumbersome

40344
sorting	filtering
opening a large table is much faster this way and access has easy-to-use right-click filtering and sorting

40346
rss	feed
so we have coding books coding rss feed and music to code by

40548
dictionary	map
also note that hashtable extends the dictionary class which as the javadocs state is obsolete and has been replaced by the map interface

40630
int	double	int	chars
in general java has primitive types int bool chars double etc that are passed directly by value

40669
children	parent
one gotcha i have found is where two objects contain references to each other one example being a parent child relationship with a convenience method on the parent to get all children

40678
domparser	saxparser
instead of using a domparser use a saxparser

40728
post	get
that should be enough to get you started i will try and post more later

40934
lisp	scheme
i recall there being a scheme or lisp too

40985
ldf	dbcc
you can create an empty log file if the ldf is missing or corrupt or run dbcc checkdb and if there are still errors run it again with repair_allow_data_loss which obviously may lose data - but if you had a good backup you probably wouldn t be asking this

41003
google-chrome	firefox
perhaps a bit anecdotal but comparing runs between firefox and google-chrome showed a significant difference in benchmarks

41029
google-chrome	firefox
212ms in google-chrome 341ms in firefox 3 and 2188ms for internet explorer 7

41069
folder	directory
here the first argument is the window that owns the dialog box the second is the title of the window and the third is the default path to start at you need the at the end otherwise it ll start a directory higher with the user s home folder selected

41176
opera	firefox
can t say that for firefox or opera

41228
3des	aes
later edit note that standard encryption algorithms from the same category for example 3des and aes - both being symmetric block cyphers are of comparable strength

41241
powerpc	i386
sqlite jdbc driver for mysaifu jvm sqlite jdbc driver for mysaifu jvm and sqlite jni library for windows x86 and linux i386 powerpc

41283
folder	directory
if you absolutely can t rename the folder because other software depends on it another technique is to go ahead and rename the directory to end in .noindex but then create a symlink in the same location pointing to the real location using the original name

41357
ilist	icollection
actually it uses icollection instead of ilist but the result is the same

41446
versioning	upgrade
i already created a first versioning of the client in javascript but i m parsing the soap envelope by hand and i doubt that my code can survive a service upgrade for example seeing how complex the soap envelope specification is

41447
submit	submission
you can submit your site to search engines using their site submission forms - this will get you into their system

41479
int	double
there is a real concern about type safety here - for example if we were to place the results of that query into an overloaded method that accepted ienumerable int and ienumerable double the caller might inadvertently pass in the wrong type

41502
pull	push
considering just parsers and ignoring the question of whether they perform validation there are two main flavors tree-basedâ think domâ and streaming event-basedâ think sax push and stax pull

41521
button	checkbox
one is the usual click button and the other is a toggle button that acts similar to a checkbox

41541
bmp	png
however i m not entirely sure that the bmp file format supports transparency - so you would have to save the file as perhaps a png file instead

41545
vim	emacs
there are quite a few vi clones vim and also various emacs implementations gnu emacs vs

41589
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
in .net threadpool threads won t return without setting up manualresetevent s or autoresetevent s

41634
int	double
that isn t quite true - if a method is overloaded to both ienumerable int and ienumerable double then it may silently pass the unexpected inferred type due to some other change in the program to the wrong overload hence causing incorrect behaviour

41660
min	max
there are often already many binary functions like + min max concatenation and in my case make_and and make_or

41665
bmp	png
is there any way to convert a bmp image to jpg png without losing the quality in c#

41668
imagemagick	magick++
imagemagick can manipulate about anything and has interfaces for a dozen of languages including the magick++ api for c++

41805
yacc	bison
re lex yacc bison

41847
isnull	nvl
nvl replaces isnull

41847
getdate	sysdate
sysdate replaces getdate

41931
put	get
i ve used simple sine wave generators mixed together with some phase and amplitude noise thrown in to get signals that sound and look interesting to humans when put through speakers or lights but i don t know what you mean by interesting

41932
google-chrome	firefox
i have compared mozilla firefox 3.0.1 and google-chrome 0.2.149.27 on sunspider javascript benchmark with the following results

41969
kde	gnome
is there a standard way to do this or do i have to special case gnome kde etc and manually run the appropriate application nautilus konqueror etc

41986
put	get
don t be put off by the in java part if you don t know java as the concepts and their implementation are well enough explained that you get the gist without needing a detailed understanding of java

41999
kde	gnome
there might be an function that launches the defaults for kde or gnome in their respective toolkits but i haven t had reason to look for them

42039
kde	gnome
i know gnome does and it s important to do this in kde since there are two possible file managers konqueror dolphin that may be in use

42047
metaphone	soundex
i would suggest using metaphone not soundex

42068
google-chrome	firefox
with json.parse data i see similar error messages unexpected token â µ in google-chrome and unterminated string literal in firefox and ie

42089
spaces	delimiter
bush is because the bourne shell is spaces delimiter

42105
disk	ram
setup a multi-gigabyte ram disk and then

42105
disk	ram
i d guess the ram disk part is where all the problem would be since the size of the ram disk would be os and file system dependent

42105
disk	ram
you might have to create multiple ram disk and have your code jump between them

42105
disk	ram
or maybe you could setup a raid-0 stripe set over multiple ram disk

42246
put	get
the question is how to get just the updated files out of subversion so that they can be physically transported through the firewall and put on the deployment server

42314
margin	height
you will then need to add a padding or margin to the bottom of your #sidebar and #content to match the height of #footer or when they overlap the #footer will cover them

42315
put	get
you could use position absolute following to put the footer at the bottom of the page but then make sure your 2 columns have the appropriate margin-bottom so that they never get occluded by the footer

42333
post	put
i found this blog post that shows how to do it with a regular video object but i d much prefer to use videodisplay or something else that can be put directly in the mxml

42377
sfx	setup.exe
i suggest using something like sfx compiler to package the two together into one self-extracting .exe and then launch the extracted setup.exe

42470
outputstream	inputstream
i d just use commons io then you could just do an ioutils.copy inputstream outputstream

42513
g++	gcc
if you have access to gcc g++ then the -m option will output the dependency list

42536
public	protected
i d also add a protected constructor to myclass to prevent the compiler from generating a public default constructor

42583
stdout	stderr
if your exe happens to be a console app you might be interested in reading the stdout and stderr -- for that i ll humbly refer you to this example

42698
fadein	fadeout
while john sheehan s approach works you run into the jquery fadein fadeout cleartype glitch in ie7

42702
ironruby	ironpython
without getting into the relative merits of the languages which would be an entire pissing contest in itself ironpython stable 1.1.1 beta 2.0 is further along in development than ironruby alpha

42747
teamcity	nant	teamcity	ncover	ncover	nant
i would recommend you take a look at nant + nunit + ncover + teamcity with svn for your build system

42790
jobs	cron
skinp cron jobs are executed by sh whereas most modern unixes use bash or ksh for interactive logins

42793
pop-up	dialog
non-blocking notifications floating dialog like in firefox3 or vista s pop-up messages in tray area

42801
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie8 seems to me to be more of the same from microsoft who just can t seem to grasp the ui goodness and overall speed of safari firefox and now google-chrome

42835
jobs	cron
scheduled tasks or cron jobs

42843
subtract	add
to do this i try to find layers of usefulness and add subtract from the layers until it seems clean

42848
jobs	cron
the problem with scheduled tasks or cron jobs is that they don t share memory space with the web server

42854
onresize	onload
you can then set this function as a handler for onload and onresize events

42902
postgresql	mysql
you can use sqlite mysql postgresql or any other dbms with a c language binding

42908
google-chrome	firefox
while browsing with google-chrome i noticed that it responds extremely fast in comparison with ie and firefox on my laptop in terms of rendering pages including javascript heavy sites like gmail

42918
openbsd	freebsd
editor s note the above works with gnu readlink and freebsd pc-bsd openbsd readlink but not on os x as of 10.11

42936
disk	ram
i was wondering if there s any way that data could be loaded into ram so that it doesn t have to be accessed from disk

42957
pull	push
for example if you design a door well you should never have to add labels that say push and pull. if you want them to pull put a handle

42960
disk	ram
this may seem dirty but in the real world i find it gives a lot of flexibility you aren t doing a lot of processing in asp.net process space and you could easily adapt this style to farm processing out to cheap linux servers running the agent process on mono for when you start needing more ram cpu disk

43043
scheme	prolog
hell i d rather code in scheme or prolog than php

43122
temp	tmp
you might want to look into using tmp in nix or c users username local settings temp in vista or c documents and settings username local settings temp in 2k xp

43135
disk	ram
if you have enough ram sql will do an outstanding job determining what to load into ram and what to seek on disk

43157
outputstream	inputstream
i was surprised to find today that i couldn t track down any simple way to write the contents of an inputstream to an outputstream in java

43157
outputstream	inputstream
so given an inputstream in and an outputstream out is there a simpler way to write the following

43213
matlab	s-function
i think i am going to have to take the xpcserial c code that comes with matlab take the code that sets the rs-232 speed and wrap it in my own s-function

43221
opera	firefox
the biggest chink i ve found is its lousy proxy support compared to ie firefox and opera

43267
vim	emacs
i m interested in making console apps like vim or emacs

43267
vim	emacs
well not exactly like vim or emacs but one that takes over the entire command prompt while it is in use and then after you exit it leaves no trace behind

43308
int	chars
in php it is seen as binary data usually chars if you tried to convert it to an int it would take the first 32 bits of data platform dependent and push that into the variable

43321
bash	zsh
give two good reasons to respectively stick to bash and switch to zsh

43324
post	get
i know i can get the session id through session.sessionid and i know how to use yui to post it to the next page

43331
swift	objective-c
that said objective-c and swift really are not too scary.

43360
stdout	stderr
you could chuck file redirection onto either the command shown or the actual command in the crontab for both stdout and stderr - like

43368
django	turbogears	django	web2py	turbogears	web2py
with web application framework i mean products project such as pyhons django turbogears web2py etc

43394
jobs	cron
use mailto in cron and redirect the email to any other single address for all your cron jobs

43472
hide	show
if you append a span containing ellipses to the end of each query a simple logical test in javascript with a bit of css manipulation could be used to hide show them as needed

43497
pascal	delphi
there is turbo delphi pascal based or turbo c++ both free editions

43525
google-chrome	safari
for some strange bizarre reason my images in my website just will not display on webkit based languages such as safari and google-chrome

43542
margin	height
yeah i ve found manually layout out controls incrementing their top property by the height of the control plus a margin as i go to be reasonably effective

43571
onchange	onblur
for a cross-browser solution you will just have to use an onchange or onblur handler to check the length and handle it however you want truncate the value silently notify the user etc.

43590
postgresql	mysql
linux web hosted - mysql postgresql maybe

43647
codeigniter	cakephp
for php i ve used zend framework codeigniter and cakephp only maintenance of an existing cakephp project briefly

43702
put	get
.net and java put more information about the original program in the executables method names variable names etc. so you get more of your original information back

43709
django	web.py
and a huge lot of stuff in between like web.py pyroxide and django

43733
freebsd	linux
once i got it installed currently slightly difficult on os x but it s trivial on linux freebsd i had written a plugin in a few minutes and it worked first time

43733
munin	cacti
munin mrtg and cacti are basically all far-nicer-to-use systems based around this graphing tool

43780
subtract	add
one stupid way of calculating a modulus is to subtract or add the modulus until the resulting value is between 0 and modulus âˆ 1

43782
division	modulo
in modular arithmetic a modulo is simply the remainder of a division and the remainder of -2 divided by 5 is 3

43794
division	modulo
however the most agreed-upon mathematical definition states that the modulo of a and b is the strictly positive rest r of the division of a b

43825
hide	show
you can add a beginrequest listener and endrequest listener to show and hide the element you want to display inline

43838
nofollow	noindex
you could accomplish this by puting a noindex nofollow meta tag in the html every page but the home page

43873
post	get
could you maybe time some operations and post them so we get an idea what you mean by slow

43874
onclick	onfocus	onclick	onmousedown	onmousedown	onfocus
i ve tried using onmousedown onfocus onclick and setting each to blur or return false but with no success

43966
jquery	scriptaculous
easy to use a custom dialog from prototype scriptaculous yui jquery .

44005
websphere	ibm
we are not planning on using a traditional java ee server for example ibm websphere which may have support for propagation not that i can find any definitive documentation

44012
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
the design is neat intuitive well documented and avoids a lot of the clumsiness of the original java.util.date java.util.calendar classes

44072
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
mdn s browser compatibility table says essentially all of the current popular browsers google-chrome ie firefox safari on both desktop and mobile are compatible

44130
getter	setter
there are only 2 places where you could mess up typing mykey in the getter and setter and this would be very easy to spot

44165
post	get
post 4.5 you can now use the callermembernameattribute as part of the method parameters to get a string of the method name - this may help in some scenarios but really in say the example above

44196
union	distinct
in oracle at least there is union and union all union all will return all results from both sets even if there are duplicates where as union will return the distinct results from both sets

44229
for-loop	loops
unless performance is critical i prefer the foreach loops over the for-loop

44278
folder	directory
in addition to the other answers there s a nice powertoy for xp called open command window here. it adds an option to your right-click context menu when you click inside a folder to open a command window using that directory as the starting path

44289
cvs	svn
as someone who is in the middle of switching between cvs and svn initially we switched all of our projects with cvs2svn and then decided that we would transition by only using svn on new projects here are some of the problems we have had

44322
uninstall	upgrade
thanks to the wspbuilder menu deploy upgrade uninstall of a solution is just one click away

44367
equals	compareto
not that performance usually matters with 99 of the times you need to do this but if you had to do this in a loop several million times i would highly suggest that you use equals or because as soon as it finds a character that doesn t match it throws the whole thing out as false but if you use the compareto it will have to figure out which character is less than the other leading to slightly worse performance time

44380
mouse	keyboard
either participant can choose to share their screen and the other participant can request control of the keyboard mouse vnc style

44391
post	get
then when the form post even though i don t receive any cookies from the browser i know they re logged in because i can decrypt the hidden form field and get the username

44421
administration	activation
when i try to run the code from the server i get a dcom source error message that states the machine-default permission settings do not grant local activation permission for the com server application with clsid 000c101c-0000-0000-c000-000000000046 to the user this security permission can be modified using the component services administration tool. i have modified the permissions using the component services tool but still get this same error

44443
postgresql	mysql
i guess i was wondering if postgresql or mysql have any obvious advantages in these areas i am primarily familiar with oracle

44461
min	max
double nextdouble random rng double min double max

44461
min	max
return min + rng.nextdouble max - min

44523
put	get
to get around this you could put a wrapper around the dll and use it to delegate the calls to the ui thread by using the invoke method of the form

44560
subtract	add
well if you know the current page it s pretty trivial to just subtract the number by 1 and add it by 1 then check those numbers against the bounds and display the first and last page always then if they aren t in sequence add the ellipses

44575
chmod	mkdir
it s useful for the chmod and mkdir functions in unix land but aside from that i can t think of any other common uses

44602
cvs	svn
i implemented this change at a previous employer first to cvs and then to svn and while it was successful we had to build a lot of bits around the edge and rely on a lot of sometimes unreliable open source projects to get all the tools we needed

44602
cvs	svn
having evaluated these i could have made a proper value judgement on whether cvs svn were worth their free price tag

44607
vmware	virtualbox
of course using paralles vmware virtualbox or any other virtual machine with a windows guest as you describe will also work fine

44635
vbscript	jscript
you can try wmicodecreator it generates vbscript jscript vb.net and c# code

44638
merb	ruby-on-rails
ok ruby-on-rails is actually pretty good but there is just a little bit too much magic going on in there from the ruby world i would much prefer merb to ruby-on-rails

44700
perforce	accurev
other systems exist git mercurial accurev perforce that let you make queries of the type what changes on branch a have not been merged into branch b

44708
cvs	svn
the hassle in cvs svn comes from the fact that these systems do not

44708
children	parent
note how a and b have two children whereas m has two parent

44708
cvs	svn
cvs does not record this information nor did svn prior to

44714
pull	push
so if i simply wish to push only to the one outside and will never pull from it what is the best git way to do this

44752
perforce	svn
make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with perforce and svn and while perforce is better svn is free

44781
int	boolean
as ricardo reyes suggested if it contains non-string types such as int floats boolean none then do

44803
vsto	add-in
from within a vba macro or vsto add-in we re trying to access the metaproperty on the document to set get the user name

44916
pascal	delphi
method references in delphi object pascal

44921
cil	ildasm
this is actually quite easy to verify by writing various c# switch statements some sparse some dense and looking at the resulting cil with the ildasm tool

44926
width	height
height constrained by style z on element q or width contributed to by inner elements a b and c

44927
int	chars
if the type of the switch expression is sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string or an enum-type then that is the governing type of the switch statement

44927
int	chars
otherwise exactly one user-defined implicit conversion â 6.4 must exist from the type of the switch expression to one of the following possible governing types sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string

45040
3des	aes
so using system.security.cryptography aes or 3des in cbc mode without rolling your own checksum can be dangerous

45072
inherited	subclassing
sealing these subclassing also discourages deep levels of inherited which works well for gui frameworks but works poorly for business logic layers

45101
pull	push
i have found that generally the most performant and stable way to push pull large amounts of data of a device over activesync is to use a socket

45239
google-chrome	firefox
today i started testing on webkit and google-chrome and discovered that not only are the styles inconsistant with both firefox and ie but javascript is not executing at all probably due to a syntax or parse error

45241
google-chrome	safari
just so you ve got one less browser to worry about google-chrome uses the same rendering engine as safari

45241
google-chrome	safari
so if it works in safari it should work exactly the same in google-chrome

45241
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses webkit for rendering which is the same rendering engine as appleâ s safari browser so if your site is compatible with safari it should work great in google-chrome

45364
int	chars
int myfunction in chars name inout chars address out chars phone

45385
mp3	wav
can anyone recommend a good library for generating an audio file such as mp3 wav or even midi from python

45405
pull	push
the fact that you never connect your repository to anyone else s to push and pull changes doesn t mean that tool won t be right

45406
cvs	svn
you don t want to complicate things going from svn or cvs to clearcase for example

45431
mstest	typemock
has anyone got ncover typemock and mstest to work together

45431
mstest	typemock
i m using mstest 9 ncover 2.1 and typemock 4.1

45440
subclipse	visualsvn
can integrate with most of ides visual studio ankhsvn or visualsvn -- more info or eclipse subclipse -- here someone asked about that

45440
cvs	svn
i do merging for about 4 years including about 2 years in cvs -- that was terrible but doable and about 2 years with svn

45499
pull	push
that code sample tries to turn xmlreader style code into sax style code - if you re writing code from scratch i d just use xmlreader as it was intended - pull not push

45512
disk	ram
hard disk - when there s not enough ram data is paged to hd which is really slow not really under cpu control as such

45512
profiling	debugging
always profiling release optimised builds profiling debugging code is pointless

45518
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
therefore if your method wants to explicitly disallow null as opposed to just happening to have a null value raise a nullpointerexception you should throw an illegalargumentexception

45554
width	height
in page_load function you need to define the width and height of the list box properly so that it won t overflow with the div

45557
postgresql	mysql
regarding untrusted languages i heard a podcast from josh berkus a postgresql advocate who discussed an application of postgresql that brought in data from mysql as part of its processing so that the communication itself was handled by the postgresql server

45592
post	get
as things have moved on since the original post on 3by9.com here are the steps that i had to follow to get the environment working on my powerbook g4

45592
powerpc	i386
on the build tab change the architectures to standard iphone simulator i386 powerpc

45606
ninject	spring.net
for the rest i think spring.net castle windsor ninject and structuremap aren t that far apart anymore

45613
for-loop	arrays
the imagesarr variable can be iterated through with a for-loop and elements like can be accessed so why is it not seen as an arrays when calling the reverse method

45616
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is actually a little different to safari it uses a completely different javascript implementation and problems have been reported with both prototype and jquery

45681
gif	png
if a to implement a website with user profiles logins extensions gallery s etc s a newbi then a cms like joomla etc are good but else if you presently have only static content then its good to go with good old html about jpeg i though presently its better to use png or gif as its less bulky

45803
rss	feed
point podcatcher at new rss feed

45823
rss	feed
once you have the audio files you can reconstruct the rss feed to link to the audio files if so desired

45835
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
of course you could go the other way and only count requests from things you know are web browsers covering ie firefox safari opera and this newfangled google-chrome thing would get you 99 of the way there

45858
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses webkit the same engine as is used by safari omniweb icab and more

45866
google-chrome	safari
as has been mentioned google-chrome has the same rendering engine as safari iphone etc. webkit which passes acid3 so there should be minimal issues if you follow the standards

45866
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome currently uses a slightly older version of webkit than safari

45889
asterisk	pbx
asterisk is a sip pbx and may or may not work for you depending on exactly what you re trying to do

45899
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses a new javascript engine so you ll have to test your javascript using google-chrome as well as safari

45904
width	height
img width 100 height 100 alt fpo lady src uploadedimages temp_photo_small.jpg

45918
coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl	isnull	nvl
if you replace your isnull and nvl nonsense with coalesce it ll work in t-sql and pl sql

45945
qtkit	quicktime
hopefully we ll get all the features of the quicktime c apis in the next version of qtkit whenever that may be

45954
hex	binary
i m working on a utility which needs to resolve hex addresses to a symbolic function name and source code line number within a binary

45954
elf	dwarf
the mips binaries are in elf format using dwarf for the symbolic debugging information

45963
free	malloc
are you using new delete or malloc free or both

45963
free	malloc
finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility

45997
rpm	yum
i transfer these rpm s into a yum repo and puppet handles making sure the latest or correct versions of software are installed in the cluster

46014
post	get
the load should just be a normal get request and the saving of new data should be a post to the url which currently has the data.

46014
put	get
a put request could be used when creating a new record put the data at a url which doesn t currently exist but in practice just posting is probably a better approach to get started with

46053
mbunit	nunit
i like the sound of combinatorial tests in mbunit i ve tried the abstract base class interface test technique with nunit and although it does work you d need to have a seperate test fixture for every interface a class implements since in c# there is no multiple inheritance - although inner classes can be used which is pretty cool

46061
mouse	keyboard
i also found that you can paste text into the text box using the mouse - it just won t accept keyboard input

46087
move	drag
in tortoisesvn use can move file via drag drop

46128
profiling	debugging
the other great thing about this technique is that if you re looking in sql profiling you can see the query you generated and debugging it much easier than seeing a stored proc call with 20 parameters come in

46204
hash	md5
it would seem that an md5 hash would work fine

46209
int	chars
why don t you do something like 1stchar + 10 x 2ndchar + 100 x 3rdchar .... where you use the simple int value of each chars a 1 b 2 etc or just the int value if it s not a letter

46210
short	base
if they are very short then a unique id can be generated by considering the characters as digits in base 36 26 + 10 that form a n -digits number where n is the length of the string

46216
int	chars
if you have a string of more than 4 ascii chars or more than two unicode chars then there are more possible string values than possible int values

46216
int	chars
you can t have a unique int value for every possible 5 chars string

46241
hash	md5
using a credit card number you could perform a hash on it md5 or sha1 or something similar

46247
int	chars
assuming it s n chars in length and assuming you only need uppercase letters and the numerals 0-9 then you need to have an int representation that can be as high as

46247
int	chars
if you want to handle 72 possible values per chars uppercase lowercase numerals punctuation... and you need 10 chars then you ll need 62 bits - two 32 bit int or one 64 bit if you re on a system that supports 64 bit computing

46247
integer	unsigned
cast the pointer of the string to a 32 bit unsigned integer array and compare the string 4 bytes at a time or 64 bits 8bytes at a time on a 64 bit processor

46255
getter	setter
extract an interface from the helper class add a public getter and setter to the original class to inject the helper class used through its interface and then inject a mock version of the helper class into the original class to test how the original class responds to exceptions from the helper

46268
hash	salt
the next thing you need to do is hash that value using a secret salt value and base32 encode the hash

46268
hash	salt
you just take the left side of the code hash it using your secret salt and compare that value to the right side of the code

46290
versioning	upgrade
this can be useful in maintenance or upgrade scenarios where you have an updated versioning of your type that won t work in some old code but you need to upgrade it to the new versioning

46294
phpunit	simpletest
i ve used both phpunit simpletest and i found simpletest to be easier to use

46296
bazaar	git
i m not familiar with bazaar but git doesn t track file renames

46465
rsa	dsa
you normally don t want to use public key encryption rsa dsa for the bulk data encryption due to its large computational time

46492
oledb	dataadapter
once your oledb connection is made you can easily create your datareader dataadapter and process as needed

46508
put	get
the only way i know of to get a reasonably accurate estimate that is it to break the project into individual tasks and get the developer who will be doing the actual work to put an estimate on each task

46544
bazaar	git
in a dvcs like bazaar or git the merged revision ends up with two parent revisions

46558
hide	show
what i ve done is obfuscate it when it s rendered and hide it then use javascript to fix the obfuscation and show the link

46582
post	get	submit	submission
we have the requirement to take a form submission and save some data then redirect the user to a page offsite but in redirecting we need to submit a form with post not get

46585
post	get
never use get and use post

46585
post	get
never use post and use get

46595
post	get
the original intent was that get was used for getting data back and post was to be anything

46602
post	get
using get will allow linking to a particular page possible too where post would not work

46614
post	get
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

46614
post	get
one final note post can transmit a larger amount of information than get

46639
post	get
i know the question was about get and post but i ll return to post in a second

46639
post	put
typically a post would be used to create a new resource for example creating a new so question though in some designs a put would be used for this also

46639
post	get
in practical terms modern web browsers typically only support get and post reliably you can perform all of these operations via javascript calls but in terms of entering data in forms and pressing submit you ve generally got the two options

46639
post	put
in a restful application the post will often be overriden to provide the put and delete calls also

46639
post	get
but even if you are not following restful principles it can be useful to think in terms of using get for retrieving viewing information and post for creating editing information

46655
post	get	post	put	put	get
rails utilizes post get put and delete but it apparently has to do some fakery for put

46663
gmail	hotmail
answers with any of using hotmail yahoo or gmail are acceptable

46666
post	get
there is an excellent podcast on software engineering radio that gives an in depth talk about the use of get and post

46700
post	get
you get the added advantage that you don t have to name all of your server controls to make the 3rd parties form you can do this translation when building the post string

46709
int	boolean
when designing a database to use mvcc multi-version concurrency control you create tables with either a boolean field like islatest or an int versionid and you never do any updates you only insert new records when things change

46727
junit	testng
i have info on my migration from junit to testng here and here

46731
versioning	upgrade
to me it s important that the consuming projects explicitly know which versioning of the common library they are consuming and for them to take a deliberate step to upgrade that versioning

46821
profiler	yourkit
i ve used yourkit java profiler 7.5 and was reasonably happy with it

46855
udp	tcp
i plan to use tcp packets for strategic data and udp packets for tactical data

46855
raknet	lidgren
i have found a few options such as garagegames torque network library c++ raknet c++ and the lidgren network library c#

46932
put	get
i could put a spy on this webpage and if you have it open i get to see what other websites you have open

46978
try-catch	exception-handling
for portability one thing to try is using try-catch blocks for most vanilla exception-handling and then set a terminate handler set_terminate_handler to have a minimal hook available for catastrophic exit conditions

47000
hash	md5
as long as it s a hash function be it string.hashcode md5 or sha1 collision is unavoidable unless you have a fixed limit on the string s length

47113
postgresql	mysql
today most languages platforms java .net php perl etc. can work with almost any dbms sql server firebird mysql oracle postgresql etc. so i wouldn t worry for one second

47116
put	get
do a reverse google lookup meaning put their answer into google as soon as they click submit and see if you get exact matches

47125
punctuation	words
if you get to design the entire course try to have some online homeworks as well so that you can build a profile for each student such as a statistical analysis of how often they use certain common words and punctuation

47209
extjs	mootools
i ve used extjs and mootools as frameworks in this kind of area

47209
extjs	mootools
if you don t need all the extjs widgets i d say well away from it in future and look at something like the mootools dynamic sortables demo

47236
vim	emacs
cscope does this in a standalone xterm and also can be used inside your favorite editor - it has great emacs and vi vim support

47309
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to install godi on linux ubuntu

47320
hash	salt
if you only need to test for equality between two strings ie is this string the same as the one i had earlier store only a salt hash value of it

47335
post	get
get may yeild marginally better performance some webservers write post contents to a temporary file before invoking the handler

47335
post	get
transferring more data than that should use a post to get better browser compatibility

47346
put	get
oh and we have this method too that allows you to put in a whole url string without having to get the querystring out of it

47389
post	put
wow i think that s the most raw work i ve ever seen put into a stackoverflow post

47413
sorting	grouping
unfortunately the last keyword in a grouping gives you the last physical record in the database not the last record by any sorting

47434
punctuation	words
remove-first-word finds the first words boundary of sentence then takes that section of characters including space and punctuation and removes it and returns new sentence

47434
punctuation	words
add-first-word finds the first words boundary of sentence then takes that section of characters including space and punctuation and adds it to reverse-sentence and returns new reverse-sentence contents

47472
goto	break
i could just have easily declared a boolean break variable and used it as part of the conditional for each loop but in this instance i decided a goto was just as practical and just as readable

47512
goto	break
until c and c++ amongst other culprits have labelled break and continues goto will continue to have a role

47519
ubuntu	linux
the system in question is ubuntu 7.04 but that is irrelevant as i m looking to fix it for at least the majority of if not all linux users

47591
int	double
int and double

47591
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
cgrect cgpoint cgsize and cgaffinetransform structures

47615
int	double	int	chars
the + operator can work between a string and a string chars int double or float data type value

47617
put	get
all objects with a finaliser get put on a special finalise queue by the garbage collector where the finalise method is invoked on them so it s technically a performance hit to declare empty finalisers

47658
post	get
amongst other sections which i may post here as i get to them i am writing a section on code formatting

47659
maven	pom.xml	maven	m2e	m2e	pom.xml
once you associate your project to maven and update the dependencies using m2e any change to pom.xml are reflected to entire project even java version definition causes it to be compiled in right jre if you have it installed and properly configured into eclipse.

47665
try-catch	exception-handling
to make our lives easier we also have a safedispose method in our infrastructure which calls the the dispose method of its argument within a try-catch block with error logging just in case although dispose methods are not supposed to throw exception-handling

47670
post	put
put the data in a standard form with no runat server attribute and set the action of the form to post to the target off-site page

47670
submit	submission
before submission i would submit the data to my server using an xmlhttprequest and analyze the response

47674
maven	m2e
in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way

47703
cpu	hyperthreading
is here any performance benefit to using multiple threads on a computer with a single cpu that does not having hyperthreading

47710
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
you should be using illegalargumentexception iae not nullpointerexception nullpointerexception for the following reasons

47735
post	get
by definition the browser will make that via a get request even if the original request was a post

47735
opera	firefox
alas unlike the opera and firefox developers the ie developers have never read the spec and even the latest most secure ie7 will redirect the post request from domain a to domain b without any warnings or confirmation dialogs

47743
winforms	shell32.dll
there is actually no managed way to do that form of animation to the tray in native winforms however you can p invoke shell32.dll to do it

47869
rss	feed
we have a list of permalink url s as well as the rss feed

47902
int	chars
the jdk is full of examples like in int chars and math classes

47903
udp	tcp
how much more efficient is udp over tcp

47929
udp	tcp
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

48001
superclass	subclassing
simple superclass name qualified subclassing name

48015
vim	emacs
i came from emacs to vim when i realized how organized vim s documentation is and how chordable many of the features are

48015
emacs	textmate
textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris

48018
bbedit	jedit
i m a bbedit user but i keep jedit around for writing xquery

48053
division	modulo
i read somewhere once that the modulo is inefficient on small embedded devices like 8 bit micro-controllers that do not have integer division instruction

48065
vim	emacs
for background i m also a long-time vim user but i learned emacs about 2 years ago and now use them interchangeably

48065
vim	emacs
there are still some things that i find easier in vim block-select mode simple macro recording diff mode and things that are easier in emacs line alignment file buffer management window screen management

48069
rss	feed
blogs almost always have an rss feed for comments

48069
rss	feed
even if the blog is your own if you are already generating an rss feed then don t bother making a call to your db

48078
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
have you considered doing a division multiplication and subtraction to simulated the mod

48093
division	modulo
all the assembly language i have seen x86 68000 implement the modulo using a division

48103
division	modulo
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo

48103
multiplying	division	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	modulo	division	subtract	division	modulo
processors with multipliers have interesting division routines using the multiplier but you can get from division result to modulo with just another two steps multiplying and subtract so it s still comparable

48103
division	modulo
so in that vein here s a very low level look at the math of modulo for an example of x which should show you how simple it can be compared to division

48128
public	protected
if i come up with a good solution i ll remove any ip protected code and put it out for public use

48170
google-chrome	firefox
all three worked well in ie 7 firefox 3 and google-chrome

48184
websphere	ibm
ibm s websphere mq site

48219
apache	nginx
nginx is great but if you don t fancy a whole new web server apache 2.2 with mod proxy balancer will do the same job

48228
post	get
you can submit form on the web page from you program by sending post get request to a website

48236
g++	gcc
gcc g++ 4.2

48265
google-chrome	safari
its based on the open sourced engine - webkit which is used in apples safari and googles google-chrome browsers.see this blog for details

48282
nunit	mstest
look at unit tests - they re loaded by reflection at least in nunit and mstest

48405
nunit	mstest
i haven t tried it - but i would advise clients who have a large investment or who have a strong preference for it over the mstest tool in nunit who are interested in implementing tfs to continue with nunit as opposed to trying convert all their existing tests

48451
dictionary	map
use map if you need something like a dictionary

48509
allocator	stl
memory management pointers allocator etc basics of stl and templates since stl uses templates

48533
width	height
the html width and height attributes do not allow for units

48533
width	height
you re likely thinking of the css width and height properties

48533
width	height
in the width and height attributes might cause a rendering engine to balk

48555
post	get
note method 2 in the definitive post on gzipping your css looks like a good solution but i couldn t get it working

48660
innodb	myisam
and myisam works differently from innodb

48704
drive	createfile
createfile - the createfile function creates or opens a file file stream directory physical disk volume console buffer tape drive communications resource mailslot or named pipe

48745
udp	tcp
think of it this way if a packet goes missing would you rather just get the next packet as quickly as possible and continue use udp or do you actually need that missing data use tcp

48760
subtraction	addition
if you had a math class you might have a few static methods to deal with addition and subtraction because these are concepts associated with math

48761
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox ie and opera probably safari too all send the if-modified-since header when they receive content with a last-modified header attached so this works fine

48900
expression-blend	silverlight
microsoft has positioned expression-blend versions 2.0 and 2.5 for designing the ui of silverlight 1.0 and 2 applications respectively

48903
actionscript	mxml
flex actionscript 3 and mxml for ui definition

48974
getter	setter
ruby and c# both easily let you create accessors by specifying getter setter methods for an attribute much like in python

49060
int	double
type-inferred constants can only be scalar values - things like int double etc

49060
pascal	delphi
to explain why historically typed constants in early delphi and its predecessor turbo pascal are writable and thus essentially initialized global variables we need to go back to the days of dos

49060
pascal	delphi
a lot of people took advantage of this since turbo pascal and delphi did not at that time have initialized global variables as a feature

49131
udp	tcp
so the answer to your question depends a fair bit on whether you are using udp or tcp as your transport

49131
udp	tcp
this applies to both udp and tcp

49133
getter	setter
the reason for this is that daos should only be responsible for holding properties of the real world objects they are modeling and only have getter and setter methods or just direct property access

49138
hash	md5
in sql server would a varbinary 16 be the most efficient way of storing an md5 hash

49182
hash	md5
based on the documentation on msdn and my experience binary is better since the md5 hash does not vary in size

49185
put	get
without knowing what your tag is actually doing presumably its its outputting something in the body section then there is no way that it will be able to get at the head to put the declaration there

49197
submit	submission
if you want the user to be able to select something from the dropdown and that changes the submission url then you re going to have to use javascript to achieve this by intercepting the form submit and formulating the correct url

49217
cout	cin
i m feeling your pain i also learned php first and i m trying to learn c++ it s not easy and i am really struggling it s been 2 years since i started on c++ and still the extent of what i can do is cout cin and math

49220
set	bag
i ve consulted the nhibernate reference material but i can t seem to figure when to use set bag and the other nhibernate collections

49232
rsa	3des
ok forget the last answer i can t read you are working with 3des keys not rsa keys

49263
rss	feed
and then we need to process texts from various sources like rss feed web-sites forums etc. - we extract parts of those texts there are entire sets of rules for that but that s irrelevant and we need to match those against the search-list

49282
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
as noted in answer by joseph pecoraro you might want to watch for strings that are valid non-decimal numbers such as those starting with 0x for hex and 0b for binary and potentially more tricky numbers starting with zero that will be parsed as octal

49315
des	aes
you can go with a tripple des implementation which will give you 112 bits key often referred to as 128 bit but only 112 of them are actually secure or as previously stated you can use aes

49421
disk	ram
to speed things up i have experimented a little with ram disk specifically changing the compilation attribute in web.config setting the tempdirectory to my ram disk

49443
voip	sip
a feasible architecture would probably be to use a sip trunk they optimize on using voip as much as possible and thus can provide much lower rates than a gsm provider generally does

49443
asterisk	pbx
also they allow for concurrency an asterisk box - a free pbx some custom made flash client and a custom made sip client on the server

49524
cvs	svn
the other classic integration would be your source code repository svn or cvs

49575
getter	setter
if there s no hope of changing the canonical names you could alias the getter and setter manually

49576
pascal	delphi
at the time i was programming windows 3.0 using borland s turbo pascal 1.0 for windows which later became delphi

49604
ingres	mysql
limit 10 works for mysql and others ingres uses

49630
hide	show
i m using javascript to hide an image and show some text thats hidden under it

49630
hide	show
but when the text is show if you scroll over it it fires the mouseout event on the container that then hide the text and show the image again and it just goes into a weird loop

49666
hash	md5
i d suggest you take the pieces of information you want in the key and hash it with md5 and then just take the first x characters where x is a key length you think is manageable

49674
crypt	hash
we keep it simple store every license data to an xml easy to read and manage create a hash of the whole xml and then crypt it with a utility also own and simple

49687
mouseover	mouseout
and catch the mouseover and mouseout events on this div instead

49687
mouseover	mouseout
because it has no child elements you shouldn t get spurious mouseover and mouseout events propagating to it

49687
mouseover	mouseout
what i believe happens is that when the cursor moves from a parent element onto a child element a mouseout event occurs on the parent element and a mouseover event occurs on the child element

49698
mouseover	mouseout
i m not sure if this would fit with the rest of your styling but perhaps if you changed the css on the text div so it was the same size as the image or fixed the size of the outer div then when the mouseover event fired the size of the outer div wouldn t change so much as to cause the mouseout event

49702
quicksort	heapsort
with an array i d use either quicksort or possibly heapsort and just change the comparison to use texample.sortorder the swap part is still going to just act on the array and swap pointers

49722
cvs	svn
best thing is you can incorporate more developers to your project seamlessly as opposed to having to give them access to your main centralized svn or cvs repository

49767
cpu	processors
if you can limit your code to one cpu setthreadaffinity you can use rdtsc assembler instruction to query performance counter directly from the processors

49859
getter	setter
there is some additional language elements like properties think getter and setter and the ability to overload operators

49890
post	get
i will post my code below but the problem is after it hits the first custom tag in the page it calls it and prints the response but does not get anything that comes after it in the wikitext

49890
wikitext	mediawiki
update george mauer -- i have seen that as well but this does not stop the page from rendering just the mediawiki engine from parsing the rest of the wikitext

49943
profiler	yourkit	profiler	vtune
i have tried pretty much every .net profiler on the market ants vtune optimizeit devpartner yourkit and in my opinion dottrace is the best of the lot

49953
int	boolean	int	double	int	chars
java has basic types which aren t objects which is why many classes in the standard library define 9 different versions of functions for boolean byte chars double float int long object short

49954
cobertura	emma
you could also use code coverage tools like cobertura or emma for java analysis
