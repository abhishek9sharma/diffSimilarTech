width	height
in the validation block of the model that has_attachment when i try to access image_size width or height it always comes out as null

500069
width	height
what would be the most efficient way of finding out the edges x y height and width coordinates

500096
accessor	properties
i have a class with many properties and they all share the same accessor code

500166
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
the more complcated way to do this is to use touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended to keep track of the user s fingers and adjust your view s transform property appropriately

500215
kate	gedit
i d suggest using a good text editor like kate or i guess gedit since you re gnomey

500233
anjuta	gnome
there s also anjuta devstudio written for the gnome desktop environment and it works pretty well with c c++ projects

500233
vim	emacs
if you just want stuff like go to definition etc. vim and emacs have that too with help from ctags

500258
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
in all cases you ll need to implement touchesbegan touchesmoved and the like to determine what the user is trying to do zoom pan etc.

500331
int	chars
for the first one the right-hand side is an unsigned chars and all unsigned chars values fit into a signed int so it is converted to signed int

500338
rss	feed
if so i d investigate providing an rss feed or some other way of notifying them so they don t eat up your bandwidth

500365
getter	setter
i think that if you created a dynamic method getuser return request.user that the groovy javabeans getter setter access would allow you to simply reference user the way you want

500434
post	put
i thought they would be in the request.post array as put is somewhat similar to post in my understanding but that array is always empty

500532
for-loop	arrays
and since you can never be sure that nothing will be added to the prototype chain just use a for-loop to enumerate the arrays

500551
tcpclient	networkstream
then what happens when streamreader then networkstream then tcpclient each go through their disposals

500565
for-loop	arrays
an alternative way of iterating through an arrays is using a for-loop

500622
komodo	notepad++
if i had to choose between notepad++ and komodo i would choose pyscripter

500638
jboss	glassfish
it is tightly integrated including with prototype much like jboss seam in the java world being integrated tightly with jboss hibernate and yes i know recent releases and articles have tackled the issue of using it with say glassfish and another jpa provider

500638
post	get
what also rings alarm bells for me is the comments you get in post like on derek siverâ s return to phpâ is

500680
jboss	glassfish
glassfish jboss etc. you want to be

500805
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
apply margin width and height to your iframe or embed or object to position it within the div that has the ipod background image

500878
inherited	properties
for..in will loop over all own and inherited properties of the array object which aren t dontenum

500878
inherited	properties
inherited properties can be excluded by checking hasownproperty but that won t help you with properties set in the array object itself

500920
int	chars
int dosomething chars hihi means a function called dosomething which returns an int and takes as a parameter a pointer to pointer a chars

500926
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
is there a way to add buttons to applications uinavigationcontroller in the other uiviewcontroller s xibs

500980
x86	mips
one thing you might consider is taking an assembly language class mips x86

501043
rss	feed
what kind of delay will there typically be in an rss feed vs polling and scraping

501078
ienumerable	iqueryable
all it requires is that your dal expose your entities as ienumerable or iqueryable and you can use linq against it

501086
dbml	edmx
update resharper wasn t the issue but rather the plugin huagati dbml edmx tools. it seems some plugins might be conflicting and i encourage people to disable all plugins as a preliminary step in debugging the crashes

501121
rss	feed
typically be in an rss feed vs polling

501121
rss	feed
that depends on what sort of caching the site uses for its rss feed

501137
versioning	upgrade
for each change i usually create one script named dbverxxxx.sql that contains all necessary upgrade xxxx is versioning number

501137
versioning	upgrade
create script that will upgrade your user s database to new versioning

501137
versioning	upgrade
script should check current versioning of database and then execute database upgrade scripts that will convert schema to required level

501191
nfa	dfa
then convert the nfa into a dfa

501191
nfa	dfa
there are know procedures for converting a regular expression to a dfa and converting an nfa to a dfa

501227
firefox	safari
here it is in the safari firefox browsers

501251
backslash	double-quotes
python as many other languages uses the backslash as an escape character the double-quotes at the end of your xp1 .

501265
gnu	groff
gnu troff groff seems to be more popular than latex in the software community

501362
metaclass	subclassing
django s model object and thus also your models which are subclassing has a modelbase metaclass

501443
jdom	dom4j
i d suggest using an xml library like jdom or dom4j for manipulating xml instead of using regular expressions

501457
backtracking	greedy
this might be a bid greedy though and the backtracking to much for the matcher to handle

501461
fast-forward	merge
and you can undo the merge even if it is a fast-forward merge

501474
integer	unsigned
some other insight is that a pointer is always an unsigned integer type

501477
textile	bbcode
html textile wiki syntax markdown bbcode or even your own markup system can be easily implemented

501602
move	drag
the reason i was seeing the mouse enter leave event was because when moving the cursor the lines would drag 1 frame behind and thus allow the mouse to enter leave but not move

501647
kde	gnome
the standard windows-like os x gnome kde etc set of window management metaphors really break down when you have more than one window you want to see at the same time

501689
subscript	superscript
honestly i don t see the point in doing superscript subscript in css only

501689
subscript	superscript
beware css for superscript subcript on why you arguably shouldn t style superscript subscript with css at all

501689
subscript	superscript
typically superscript subscript is not actually a styling issue but is indicative of meaning

501689
subscript	superscript
side note it s worth mentioning this list of entities for common mathematical superscript and subscript expressions even though this question doesn t relate to that

501697
postgresql	mysql
depending on your actual data usage mysql or postgresql should be able to handle a couple of billion records on the right hardware

501697
merb	ruby-on-rails
the big advantage of using a rdbms with ruby-on-rails or merb is you gain access to all of the excellent tool support for accessing these types of databases

501718
disk	ram
i want to create a ram disk and move my solution onto this virtual disk

501718
disk	ram
ps i think when i have some documents in my program real world which are used frequently for example some document templates it could be good idea to move these documents onto a ram disk as well to speed up i o

501741
kde	gnome
if you only need some dialogs to improve your scripts you can use kde kdialog or gnome zenity

501751
disk	ram
personally i d just buy a ssd disk you could lose your whole soln at any time if your ram loses power

501751
disk	ram
right now i have 4gb of ram and a 150gb 10k rpm velociraptor hard drive for my boot disk running win xp pro 64bit and everything vs 2008 sql management studio and my testing vm s is very fast

501752
postgresql	mysql
a single mysql machine can deal with a few million rows postgresql can probably scale to a larger number of rows but might work a little slower

501752
vertica	greenplum
if your organization has deep pockets check out what vertica asterdata and greenplum have to offer

501756
disk	ram
honestly if you have vista windows server 2008 x64 and you jam your workstation with 4 to 8 gb of ram for most tasks everything will be in cache or stored by superfetch which will be a lot easier to manage and just about as high performance as a ram disk

501756
disk	ram
the ram disk won t do a thing for you if you re starving your other system ram to make it work

501756
disk	ram
while it technically worked copying the necessary data to the ram disk on every boot took too long and was a pain

501770
floating-point	integer
an example of this second usage is in the expression int float_var + 0.5f which rounds a floating-point variable by adding 0.5 which produces a floating-point value and then explicitly converting that value to an integer

501770
superclass	subclassing
casting can be done when there s a superclass subclassing or interface implementor relationship meaning 1 above or when the two types are primitive numeric types meaning 2

501775
udp	tcp
do you think c# tcp udp socket use in the managed application can handle roughly same amount of data as native c++ version

501803
bazaar	git
in addition to scott s comment of just doing it paraphrased if you start with a distributed system such as git or bazaar instead of subversion you can start with having it running locally without even impacting others and then spread it amongst the other developers over-time

501816
int	chars
however when i run this arr outputs the address of the first element of the array of int as expected but arr2 doesn t output the address of the first element of the array of chars

501832
komodo	notepad++
i use both komodo edit and notepad++

501841
rss	feed
a variety of rss feed for tracking changes would nice too

501867
button	checkbox
for flags and options you can simply use checkbox combo boxes radio button and file selectors filenames

501870
writetofile	nsdata
once you have the nsdata you could write it to your documents directory using writetofile atomically and then i believe you can pass it in as a local url although i ve not tried this

501888
disk	ram
if you use up memory with your ram disk you just going to deprive the os ram for virtual memory and that is going to be causing more frequent page faults and thus potential more writing to the hard disk

501888
disk	ram
if you do decide to use ram disk at least have a batch file on your desktop that copies everything to disk and run it frequently

501967
udp	tcp
i would also pick up a copy of the tcp ip illustrated as well since understanding things like how ip routing works how tcp and udp both work as well as how they differ are the most important practical things to know about networks

501999
modifiers	sealed
access modifiers like internal and sealed don t have anything to do with obfuscation or code security they just tell other classes how to interact or not interact with them

502005
folder	directory
this should be recorded separately for each user the position should not be recorded in the file because if the file is shared with a different user or edited in a different context the other user may move the window to an undesirable position so for windows i put this in the users s local settings folder do not put it in the registry for unix i put this in a home .app directory

502013
hex	binary
don t forget that this is a text file so convert binary to hex n 0a

502024
stdout	stderr
indeed i have researched the air 1.5 documentation and looks like they have omitted any access to stdin stdout stderr file pipes - despite they are available on all the platforms that air supports

502024
stdout	stderr
the merapi bridge library implemented via the interprocess pipes of stdin stdout stderr would grant to air a shade of microsoft powershell ability which can marshal .net objects over std interprocess pipes

502038
put	get
to get it to accept the mouse moved events i simply put in it s awakefromnib

502094
post	get
i am trying to get the title of the last 8 topics which has the newest post

502194
pop-up	dialog
using visual studio 2008 when i add to a c++ project a file that is not .c .cpp .h .rc or anything the ide doesn t recognize a dialog pop-up which asks me if i want to create a custom build step rule for this kind of files

502194
pop-up	dialog
this is the dialog i mentioned which pop-up when you add a file with an unknown extension

502196
firefox	safari
this works great on firefox safari but not on ie6 which doesn t understand the display inline-block

502208
width	height
when you increase the width and or height of a control the designer is interpreting your actions as a request to make the control that specified width and or height

502305
postgresql	mysql
craigslist uses sphinx and it can connect to both mysql and postgresql

502329
submit	submission
alternatively you could add a submit button to the page allowing you to check the form values before submission to the database

502343
ubuntu	debian
a debootstrapped copy of debian or ubuntu makes a great starting point to create the former

502384
inherited	properties
the only difference between object literals and constructed objects are the properties inherited from the prototype

502389
inherited	properties
a few google results dealing with custom controls suggest changing the properties from dependencyobject to frameworkelement but i d have to inherited datagridtextcolumn and define my own properties to do so - there must be a better way

502399
vim	emacs
i guess you don t use emacs as you d use for example vim

502428
versioning	upgrade
as an example i have a rails app running in our company right now that was coded about 2.5 years ago that only needed to have some work done to it once this year to upgrade it to a new versioning to be compatible with apache mod_rails it was originally written against rails 1.2 i believe

502488
vim	emacs
although he s a vim guy he wrote it you might get some ideas about how best to go about becoming more proficient with your text editor that ll apply to emacs

502496
width	height
and often it needs to be done twice - first to calculate the width height of the text for positioning and then actually drawing the text at the right coordinates

502580
folder	directory
if i add the root image folder as directory i receive this error

502593
cpu	processors
the gpu is just like the cpu except it s less general purpose and more a data paralleled processors

502614
superclass	subclassing
subclassing must override a superclass method

502625
post	get
unfortunately there are no details but maybe you can get more information by commenting that blog post or by contacting the stackoverflow team

502627
chipmunk	pymunk
as a first reference you may want to look into pymunk a python wrapper of chipmunk 2d physics library

502658
vim	jedit
personally i would recommend jedit rather than vim

502721
config	ini
error tracing and logging via editing php s ini config file is a good way as well specially if you can manage it to log information

502748
entity-relationship	diagram
so use uml finite state machines entity-relationship diagram plain english whatever you want but be sure to include a logical path that your readers can follow to understand what s going on

502758
folder	directory
the data directory where we create delete files and folder is located at c projectx data

502769
outputstream	inputstream
you have to get an inputstream as well you can t read from the outputstream

502770
superclass	subclassing
now that we have established the fact that your subclassing method doesn t override the superclass method according to the jls let s look at the runtime implications when type erasure has occured

502770
superclass	subclassing
so the type system here will decide that the subclassing method does override the superclass one they are identical after type erasure and we can never have a conflict

502776
ant	maven
we do not do ant builds directly or use maven

502776
put	get
we now want to be able to put all these projects and their various versions in a continous integration tool - i like hudson but this is just a matter of taste - which essentially means that we need to get an automatic way to check out the projects to a fresh workspace and compile the source folders as described in the project-files in each project

502794
min	max
min and max return the smallest and largest if there was an aggregate function like nth which d return the nth largest smallest value then i could do this in similar manner to the above

502847
int	boolean
then you can use the ispointer boolean to decide if you should treat the union as an int or pointer

502849
integer	unsigned
the following type designates an unsigned integer type with the property that any valid pointer to void can be converted to this type then converted back to pointer to void and the result will compare equal to the original pointer

502849
integer	unsigned
which is the unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof operator

502876
min	max
you already have an index on goods min and max values so this sql for known goods and its value

502892
interbase	firebird
firebird and interbase are using b-trees with multi-record versioning systems for storage

502903
vim	textmate
i get by with vi vim textmate editors and what they provide or what i ve so far found in each of these editors

502958
nodevalue	innerhtml
in internet explorer all the properties i ve tried text innerhtml data nodevalue return item1 instead of item1

502969
versioning	upgrade
those scripts contain the sql statements which are necessary to upgrade the db to a certain versioning

502969
versioning	upgrade
next to that i ve a small application which upgrade the db to the latest versioning by executing those script files in the correct order from current versionnr of the db to the last script-file

502970
calloc	malloc
to the excellent responses posted i want to add one more point of difference between using calloc nelem elsize versus quality implementations of calloc will ensure that if your nelem and elsize were big enough to cause an integer overflow when multiplied together it will fail rather than cause an undersized allocation as a naive malloc invocation would

502970
calloc	malloc
just this feature alone would be enough for me to prefer calloc to malloc

503061
folder	directory
basically there s a sites folder which has a directory for every site you re hosting

503139
dictionary	map
another answer is to use a map or dictionary in the user class

503172
vsto	add-in
i have created a vsto application using office 2005 visual studio 2005 professional.i found there a setup folder.while i am running the .exe file in client machine it giving me error. an add-in could not be found or could not be loaded.

503208
ienumerable	iqueryable
my mock repository implementation would be only a in memory collection but my question is do you know an easy way to implement the iqueryable interface of my mock to transfer the query to my in-memory collection ienumerable

503208
ienumerable	iqueryable
but i have to implement the iqueryable interface on my repository with a iqueryprovider which transform the expression in a call to a ienumerable object

503219
vsto	add-in
create a new vsto add-in without any additional code and run it

503233
width	height
ok that s not what i want but i don t want to define the exact size either since i know height and width should be flexible so i try

503250
arp	icmp
arp is layer 2 protocol so it s packets are not forwarded by routers but it s much more reliable then icmp echo ping

503267
scrollable	panels
the controls can be many so the panels has to be scrollable

503285
hide	show
i would only make the show and hide methods when needed that is if

503295
post	get
using a query in a view and custom forms i was able to get a list to the form but then i was not able to post

503427
opencv	emgucv
if anyone who use emgucv opencv wrapper in .net 3.5 framework please tell me why this exception appears its inner exception is unable to load cxcore.dll

503540
put	get
the data context is created fine but when i instantiate an object of this type the only item i get showing on the intellisense for it is the class based on the table i dragged onto the designer and even on this i get no intellisense if i put a dot after it

503550
min	max
these are the max and min functions so it s useful to define them as such

503577
for-loop	loops
when doing vector operations at some level within the internal code there is likely a for-loop which loops over the indices you are swapping

503607
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
there s also common lisp which is a case-sensitive language that many people mistakenly believe is case-insensitive

503612
jquery	scriptaculous
i recommend the javascript route -- using a framework like jquery or scriptaculous

503629
width	height
you can set verticalalignment to center top or bottom to get automatic height of about one line maybe backed up by a minheight setting to avoid problems really tiny fonts and then set the width so the textbox width does not change as the user types into it

503630
getter	setter
how could i setup my getter setter using the child controls in the parent class

503648
udp	tcp
a simple example if your processes runs on three different machines how could the proxy machine step aside without involving traffic redirection at tcp udp whatever level

503658
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stderr to stdout so you can capture it

503658
stdout	stderr
this example routes stdout to devnull thus ignoreing it and routes stderr to you

503671
stdout	stderr
2 1 means re-route stderr messages to the same place as stdout and thus will be loaded into the output array

503691
addclass	removeclass
i know my test function is working since the addclass removeclass functions are working

503709
post	get
cross domain request only work with the get verb and not post

503709
post	get
if the request is using a get then i have to convert it to a post

503737
implements	extends
some network filesystems do not implements file locks on regions that extends past a certain position often 230 or 231

503751
folder	directory
close the solution delete the directory testresults under your solution folder and then open the solution and run all tests test - run - all...

503770
post	get
as i said in a different post the sole obstacle is that users will take a few days to get accustomed to the idea

503778
folder	directory
you should also delete the .svn directory that s kicking around in the folder that you re removing or you ll end up confusing svn tortoise

503778
folder	directory
you can also do an export for step 1 which will remove any .svn directory for you if you re doing this for a whole directory tree rather than a single directory this is a lot more convenient than cleaning the folder out by hand

503788
width	height
width 0 height 0 visibility hidden

503820
ant	cruisecontrol
i have a hand-written ant build file we call it cc-build.xml because of our cruisecontrol roots. this file is responsible for refreshing the working space for the project from the cm repository and labeling the contents for future reference

503943
bazaar	git
as an alternative to git which has already been mentioned i would highly recommend bazaar

503981
width	height
this is a follow up question to that at can i create a html table width a percentage height but pixel accurate row height

503986
freemarker	velocity
velocity freemarker and others are templating engines that allows the separation of ui logic and business logic thus facilitating changes in the presentation while minimizing the changes on the business side

504022
bazaar	git
the major choices for a distributed vcs are git mercurial also referred to as hg and bazaar or bazaar

504058
sdl	xlib
sdl is not a hardware interface in its own right but rather a portability layer that works well on top of many other display layers including directx opengl directfb and xlib so you get very good portability and its a very thin layer on top of those technologies so you pay very little performance overhead on top of those

504077
post	get
i ll edit the post once i find out how to get a list of all defined variables

504112
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer	integer	fractions
ecma script does actually have a concept of an integer type but it is implicitly coerced to or from a double-precision floating-point value as necessary if the number represented is too large or if it has a fractions component

504133
post	get
post and get parameters are only available per request

504219
subtract	add
i would like to add or subtract to this number

504262
xlib	xcb
pure xlib xcb if you want to take into account non-opengl plaforms

504309
hash	salt
thus you can regenerate the salt once the user applies and you can generate the expected hash and get the job done in a single query

504327
inherited	subclassing
b will be subclassing by other developers and inherited from a

504362
notepad++	textpad
i used notepad++ now but i have to keep textpad around just for that number-filling function

504386
xsl-fo	xslt
i am total noob with xslt and xsl-fo and i am looking for some advice on the possibilities and limitations with dotnet 2.0 and 3.5 when using xslt for formatting xml data for reporting purposes

504386
xsl-fo	xslt
i also read some posts about adding an xslt schema to visual studios schemas for intellisense does anyone know of a current xsl-fo schema for this purpose

504434
hash	md5
often a hash digest is stored as the ascii representation of hex digits for example md5 of the word hash is

504434
hash	md5
but md5 really produces a 128-bit binary hash value

504434
hex	binary
this should require only 16 bytes to be stored as binary values instead of hex digits

504434
hex	binary
that is a given amount of cache memory can store twice as many rows worth of binary data if the string is half the size of the char needed to store the same value in hex

504533
treeviewitem	menuitem
now i want to pass the treeview control in the commandparameters of the contextmenu s delete menuitem s deletecommand so that i can handle the selection of the treeviewitem on the deletion of the currently selected item

504537
webkit	gecko
but you ll need a bit more for handling all browsers mobile gecko webkit opera etc.

504537
google-chrome	safari
if required you can also create additional files to specifically target google-chrome or safari if required

504575
jboss	oc4j	jboss	weblogic	weblogic	oc4j
i ve worked with jboss and weblogic before but this is the first job i ve been at where we ve used oc4j

504606
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i run firefox on vista xp and a macbook pro regularly and aside from taking a while longer than safari or google-chrome to start up it s fine and seems to use less ram than either

504643
int	chars
try the atoi function or the appropriate version if you re using wide chars to convert strings to int

504668
jruby	rubinius
also rubinius jruby are doing things the right way and are moving along at a great pace

504686
merb	ruby-on-rails	datamapper	activerecord
we went from ruby-on-rails activerecord to ruby-on-rails datamapper and finally to merb dm each iteration getting more speed simply because of the underlying frameworks

504686
merb	ruby-on-rails
generally when it comes to ruby ruby-on-rails merb you have to scale out throwing hardware at the problem

504716
cpython	ironpython
ironpython python for .net is faster than regular python cpython on the same machine

504759
filtering	grouping
now the entire function reading from right to left is a pipeline that filtering only alpha or separator characters splits it into words breaks it into grouping filtering those grouping with more than 1 element and then reduces the remaining grouping to the first element of each

504763
openrowset	openquery
try openquery and or openrowset and pass through the mdx

504900
perforce	svn
about a year ago i moved my home scc depot from perforce to svn in a few steps using a python script

504900
perforce	svn
this gave me a complete svn mirror of my perforce depot with all history comments and branch info retained

504907
exponent	modulo
export the public key as rsaparameters and write the modulo and exponent values to disk

504907
exponent	modulo
on the c++ side you ll need to read the modulo and exponent values from disk convert them into bignum values

504935
implements	extends
the most important thing in java is that you can implements multiple interfaces but you can only extends one class

504945
xna	slimdx
if you don t like xna you can use slimdx

504945
xna	slimdx
unlike xna slimdx supports directx 10

504947
post	get
what s the difference when using get or post method

504950
versioning	upgrade
i d suggest having a baseline script and upgrade scripts so that you can always run a sequence of scripts to get a database from it s current versioning to the new state that is needed

504962
post	get
the alternative to the get method is the post method

504981
post	get
get and post methods have nothing to do with the server technology you are using it works the same in php asp.net or ruby

504981
post	get
get and post are part of http protocol

504992
post	get
i use get when i m retrieving information from a url and post when i m sending information to a url

504993
post	get
in plain english that means that get is used for viewing something without changing it while post is used for changing something

504993
post	get
for example a search page should use get while a form that changes your password should use post

504993
post	get
so a post request is a superset of a get request

504996
post	get
just be careful of people hitting refresh with the get method because the data will be sent again every time without warning the user post sometimes warns the user about resending data

505000
free	malloc
systems might choose to give free memory to other processes for re-use immediately while other systems especially if you use the rather private lib functions such as malloc might just use memory that is only available to this one process of yours so nothing will happen to free memory because no other parts of the system will know about it

505004
xna	slimdx
you might also want to look into slimdx a very fast lightweight open source alternative to xna

505054
ienumerable	iqueryable
and i want to deal with iqueryables or ienumerable in my code how would i convert a datatable to an iqueryable

505077
perl	tcl
vim has a native scripting language and can also be built with embedded python tcl or perl interepreters that can operate on selections buffers etc through the plugin mechanism

505077
vim	emacs
i used to use xemacs a major code-fork of emacs that goes back a number of years back in the 1990s but went to vim later on

505077
vim	emacs
if you find the user interface of vim or emacs a bit too much there are a variety of other text editors available many of which offer scripting

505131
hide	show
i think you would want to group your associated controls together in panels align them to the top bottom of your form and then programmatically show hide the appropriate panel when the user clicks more detail less detail

505131
hide	show
edit i don t know of a helper control for this specific functionality aside from panels used to group controls and show hide them all at once

505135
hide	show
if the panels are docked for example top - then just hide show the panel and everything should fall into place automatically

505163
superclass	subclassing
all subclassing always can specify their own constructor as long as they call a constructor of the superclass - so there is no way of forcing the a class to have a specific constructor at least that is the way it works in java

505284
vmware	esx
we have experimented successfully with vmware esx to get better usage out of our data center

505292
xsl-fo	xslt
you still need to write the xslt file and as far as i know there is no intellisense for xsl-fo under visual studio

505321
richtextbox	textblock
if you want one paragraph per element you should probably do as suggested and use a read-only richtextbox or do what this person did and derive from textblock so that the inlines property can be bound

505353
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have multiple dropdownlistfor in a page and would like to disable all if user selects a checkbox which reads disable all

505374
gridview	datalist
i am using the link button in the datalist to filter the territories and display them in a gridview

505387
parent-child	one-to-many
the scenario is the following i have a one-to-many parent-child relationship

505401
atoi	strtok
since the list of integers is variable i d be tempted to use strtok to split the string up into individual strings separate by space and then atoi to convert each number and sum or find minimum on the fly

505448
innodb	myisam
it may depend upon whether you are using myisam or innodb tables but i would run the optimize after truncating the table

505467
folder	directory
to keep things clean i don t want to have a .git directory in the myfiles folder so i thought i could create . backup git_repos myfiles

505507
try-catch	exception-handling
to do this you have to make sure that every line of code is either enclosed in a try-catch block or only called by code that its exception-handling can bubble up into

505534
fastcgi	scgi
cgi fastcgi and scgi are language agnostic

505534
post	get
the reason this is so great is that we can avoid the messy step of converting from a http get post to cgi to python and back again on the way out

505578
mouse	keyboard
you could use this to globally listen for messages that bring a window to the foreground and or messages for user interaction mouse keyboard

505594
put	get
you want to put global get at the beginning of every function except get itself

505611
serializable	deserialization
the serializable deserialization works fine however if i were to change the assembly which does the work it fails to deserialize because of the header in the binary file indicating that it requires assembly x instead of assembly y to handle the data

505611
serializable	deserialization
is it possible to setup the serializable deserialization to be assembly agnostic

505706
mantis	bugzilla
mantis definitely wins on usability grounds over bugzilla

505706
mantis	bugzilla
compared to bugzilla or another system we tried implementing some weird european thing mantis is gorgeous

505762
merb	ruby-on-rails
the ruby-on-rails framework is what i ve used mostly but i played around with merb a little bit before the announcement that it was merging with ruby-on-rails

505786
cpu	affinity
context switch use a multi-processor core chip on a lightly loaded system and set the process s affinity to a specific cpu preferably not cpu 0

505795
cpu	affinity
it may help to set the cpu affinity in order to bind the process to a single cpu

505797
getter	setter
if you have a set of fields are simply read and written via the getter and setter you could probably get away with a single lock for these fields

505839
width	height
my fixed document xps has its page orientation set to landscape the page media size has a width that is longer that its height and it displays correctly in the viewer as landscape

505896
profiling	debugging
if you need a tool to debugging this look at .net memory profiling or windbg with the sos extension both will allow you to sniff through your your managed heaps

505901
vb.net	vb6
if you want to learn more about tdd and unit testing you should apply it to functions or procedures in vb6 -- although i d recommend vb.net or c# and doing object-oriented development

505942
set	bag
what you want is a bag - which is like a set but also counts the number of occurances

505943
inherited	properties
i cant assign a to the unsubscribe properties which is an arrayofstring - even though it inherited from list

505951
factors	matrix
usually the management uses more sophisticated matrix and all to make their decision but more or less these are the factors they usually put in

505956
equals	gethashcode
fortunately you can tell it to use different criteria by specifying an iequalitycomparerâ ¹xelementâ º basically an object that has an equals method that returns true iff two xelements are equals according to your definition and false otherwise and a gethashcode method that takes an xelement and returns a hash code based on your equality criteria

506033
coalesce	isnull
i just had a look at the linked article and can confirm short circuiting can fail for both coalesce and isnull

506159
profiler	gprof
it s a kernel level profiler requiring a kernel module unlike gprof however also unlike gprof it can profile multithreaded applications

506163
ssl	https
https http over ssl can help prevent hackers spoofing requests allowing you to securely exchange messages between the client and server

506241
division	multiplication
division is per se slower than multiplication however i don t know the details

506241
sin	sqrt
the basic reason is that similar to functions such as sin or sqrt it s just mathematically more complex

506241
division	multiplication
iirc a multiplication takes about 10 cycles on an average cpu while a division takes about 50 or more

506252
division	multiplication
both operations are done down at the floating point unit fpu level and even in the world of integral alus the division circuit is a far busier place than a multiplication circuit

506378
typedef	struct
you can define the typedef and forward declare the struct first in one statment and then define the struct in a subsequent definition

506378
typedef	struct
edit as others have mentioned without the forward declaratation the struct name is still valid inside the struct definition you can used struct a but the typedef is not available until after the typedef definition is complete so using just a wouldn t be valid

506380
stdout	stderr
you may need to read stdout stderr of a java program

506381
post	get
the controller get and post methods are as follows

506463
vb.net	vb6
the reason why microsoft designed vb.net to size arrays based on upper bound rather than array length is to make it easier to port code from vb6 to vb.net

506463
vb.net	vb6
by designing vb.net to interpret an array s sizing argument as an upper bound rather than the number of elements in the array old vb6 code that looped from 1 to n could be ported directly to vb.net

506463
vb.net	vb6
the array in vb.net will have one extra element compared to what the array had in vb6 the element at index 0 but otherwise behaves as it did in vb6

506528
implements	extends
secondly you need to create a class extends canvas and implements the paint method

506530
put	get	daemons	systemd
what s the best caching systemd daemons that supports get put delete and list memcached i think doesn t support list

506560
ogre	irrlicht
it includes gui elements is much smaller than most full-blown engines like irrlicht or ogre optionally makes use of 3d hardware acceleration and has been tested by popcap on millions on computers

506591
folder	directory
as you ve added the c xpressmp lib folder to the library search path in vc++ directory check that only the library file name is specified under additional dependencies and this does not include the path i.e xprm_rt.lib not .. .. xpressmp lib xprm_rt.lib

506599
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
freebsd is a nice in-between linux solaris though

506611
wxruby	shoes
shoes and wxruby are interesting

506630
merb	ruby-on-rails
web applications wit frameworks such as ruby-on-rails merb

506633
versioning	upgrade
this file is used to upgrade the database from 1 versioning to 2

506642
gdi	direct2d
have you had a look at direct2d which is kinda the replacement for gdi

506705
classname	inherited
all i need is method in the action class only in it because there will be a lot of inherited classes and i donâ t want to implement this method in all of them which will return classname from a static call

506707
int	chars
i need to convert a chars array into int and float using c

506714
atoi	strtod	atoi	atof	atof	strtod	strtol	atoi	strtol	strtod	strtol	atof
use atoi strtol and atof strtod library functions to convert from string

506743
internationalization	localization
so what are they key differences between localization and internationalization

506786
internationalization	localization
internationalization prepares your application for localization

506793
http.sys	httplistener
httplistener should be fine but it s just wrapper around http.sys and this library is available only on windows xp and higher

506828
multiplying	add
you need to write rules to transform this into add multiplying lit 2 variable x lit 3

506894
packets	multicast
you just send your udp packets to a multicast address that is 224 4 and the routers decide whether to route it to a subscriber

506894
packets	multicast
if you want to limit destinations where your multicast packets go you do it on routers

506894
packets	multicast
you should understand though that the word routes above means that the router emits the packets into appripriate interface with a multicast destination address in ethernet header and multicast destination address in ip header

506929
division	multiplication
for example the compiler can replace integer division between 3 with a multiplication and a binary shift

506929
division	multiplication
also it can replace float division between 2.0 with a multipliation by 0.5 but it cannot replace division between 3.0 with a multiplication by 1 3.0 as 1 3.0 cannot be represented exactly using binary numbers therefore rounding errors may change the result of the division

506987
accessor	properties
in objective-c you can use the properties and synthesize directives to let the compiler generate the code for accessor

507015
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up select general then appearance then colors and fonts

507051
client-side	server-side
using either server-side or client-side code

507074
short	base
but in short the base object isnt yet an instance of the derived type therefor cant call any overloaded functions on the derived object

507093
hex	binary
where can i find more information on handling binary file formats and are there useful tools for these kind of jobs besides regular hex editors

507136
range	max	range	min	min	max
a class of numeric responses defined as a set of intervals where each interval range from a min to a max value

507156
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
the windows filesystems fat ntfs do not care about the case of file names case-insensitive

507157
put	get
first put an id on the element so you can easily get a reference

507240
spaces	delimiter
just to elaborate on what others have said multiple css classes are combined in a single string delimiter by spaces

507358
many-to-one	one-to-many
when you define both a one-to-many and a many-to-one does this not make it bi-directional

507367
cassini	iis
i m sure installing iis or cassini on the client would work but i was hoping for a simpler solution

507465
put	get
make the static versions of xml s you get over xmlhttprequest and put then into a folder on disk

507530
rss	feed
i surf over the rails blogs in my rss feed reading the headlines and just enough to figure out what the article is about

507530
post	get
i also open the post i want read in depth in another tab for later i used to use readitlater but it got out of hand and as i read them i write notes in a post on my own blog more for my own benefit than for others - to get into memory and to ensure i can find it later

507671
next	except
i need to be aware of how each method will affect the way i program the site using rails since if i do consolidate there will be essentially 4 levels of categories in a single table but that definitely seems more manageable than separate tables for each level since apart from subclass which directly links to product blocks they don t do anything except show the next level of category under them

507735
width	height
so all w10 w11 w20 etc share the same image nav_logo4.png all have fixed height and width

507754
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have the following javascript that works perfectly under ie google-chrome safari and opera but dies in firefox by forcing the page to reload client side it redraws all elements

507774
client-side	server-side
due to deployment restrictions we can t deploy wcf on the client-side yet but would like to use it on the server-side

507778
put	get
you don t care what a bag is made of or what it does when you put your stuff in it as long as the bag performs the job of being a bag and you can get your stuff back out

507854
configobj	configparser
consider using the a href rel nofollow noreferrer configparser a standard library module or the a href rel nofollow noreferrer configobj a third-party module which supports complex datatypes such as nested dicts lists etc to parse a configuration file instead

507857
put	get
i ve found bigger impacts can usually be made by adjusting the way pages are put together particularly in reducing how much images get cut up into little pieces to reduce the number of requests

507859
mouse	keyboard
you can use the quartz events system to install application-specific or system-wide event taps which let you monitor and inject keyboard and mouse events at a pretty low level

507937
put	get
so it s generally best to just go get a resource as if you know for sure it exists and put your development time in to making sure your exception handler does a nice job with the failures

507986
ati	nvidia
if your gpus are all the same brand you might be able to get gpgpu support from the vendor either through nvidia s cuda or ati s stream

508004
gif	png	mp3	flv	mp3	wmv	wmv	flv
object oriented handling of multimedia files mp3 jpg gif png flv wmv without writing my own wrappers for everything

508008
post	get
if you can get them on an ftp and post a link i can take a quick look and post my findings thoughts here

508072
inherited	subclassing
it s not really clear why you re creating a subclassing within the class itself though - i suspect your inherited hierarchy might not be ideal

508120
preventdefault	onsubmit
the problem with onsubmit still continues when i even use preventdefault option

508126
equals	gethashcode
given this implementation of equals how do you correctly implement gethashcode

508135
put	get
basically some other people who have control over the repository and therefore get to decide what goes in there put a directory in there that really didn t need to be in there

508146
post	get
if i get my git daemon up and running on my home server i ll edit this post to add the url for the project

508146
int	chars
int main int argc const chars argv

508172
folder	directory
if you rename the .svn directory in the bad folder and then run an update svn will skip over the directory and say it was deleted even though it s still there

508188
jsf	seam
seam is a superset of jsf and introduces a new conversation scope for

508230
versioning	upgrade
before 1.5.x releases your repository was automatically upgrade to the latest versioning when you access them with a later versioning

508234
jobs	cron
my site is with an isp who has a plesk control panel and i see a crontab section which lets me set up cron jobs

508273
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome uses dep data execution protection but firefox does not

508290
hide	show
additionally you will need to hide the form until a user action requests it to be show

508319
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox opera internet explorer safari google-chrome etc

508319
int	double
you can log arrays strings int double etc

508385
queue	fifo
they re the same for practical purposes with the difference that a queue is fifo

508393
put	get
also don t put sensitive information in the query string only option with get because it shows up in the address bar bookmarks and server logs

508441
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos
i ve been trying to move a project over from xcode to linux ubuntu x86 for now but hopefully the statically-linked executable will run on an x86 centos machine

508446
put	get
had to pull out some sensitive lines so i wouldn t get canned and put them back in the wrong order

508485
post	get
if you get nothing else from this post then let it be this do not assume that the ids will always increase

508537
mouseup	mousedown
please allow me to call these events mouseup and mousedown

508537
mouseup	mousedown
most often you ll want to perform some processing on mousedown and do some further processing on mouseup

508537
mouseup	mousedown
the trick is that simply tracking mouseup messages is not enough mousedown may not have happened in your window

508537
move	drag	mouseup	mousedown
going further up the reasoning you should not rely on receiving a mouseup after you processed mousedown user may have move the mouse and released the button somewhere else think drag n drop in which case you don t receive the mouseup event.

508537
mouseup	mousedown
unless you capture the mouse on mousedown to make sure you get mouse event up to mouseup even if the mouse left your window

508537
mouseup	mousedown
all in all you end up tracking mousedown capture the mouse and when you receive mouseup just check if you own the capture

508537
mouseup	mousedown
if not the mouse was either double-clicked no 2nd mousedown or mousedown happened somewhere else hence you most likely don t care about this mouseup

508572
post	get
to get a prettier period you can calculate how long it really is divide by two and adjust the start of the period back by that amount and the end forward this will center the post inside the hour

508577
uiview	subviews
you need to add your icons which are uiview of some sort as subviews of your springboard view

508630
integer	unsigned
in c++ i enjoyed having access to a 64 bit unsigned integer via unsigned long long int or via uint64_t

508661
getter	setter
the record class has setter getter i feel like i need a helper function somewhere to help it serialize the whole class

508690
post	get
as mentioned in another post if you can get an examdate in there that would be more reliable than the examid column

508694
cos	sin
y1 sin x +.02 cos 200 x +0.001 sin 2000 x +0.0001 cos 20000 x

508701
int	double
now if what you want is the object and not the primitive then using valueof string may be more attractive than making a new object out of parseint string because the former is consistently present across int long double etc

508726
ant	cruisecontrol
if you don t do asp.net theres still the original cruisecontrol with ant that you can use in the same capacity

508758
getter	setter
intellij can generate all the getter setter for me

508763
inherited	properties
after much searching on msdn and other sources i have basically found that some dependancy properties do indeed support properties value inherited similar to wpf

508763
inherited	properties
i need to know exactly which dependancy properties do indeed support properties value inherited

508776
getter	setter
the bloat in java code is caused by other things than getter and setter

508809
inherited	properties
everything that inherited from system.windows.forms.control has a designmode properties that returns a boolean indicating if you are in design mode or not

508889
joptionpane	jdialog
it will be almost instantaneous you should use jdialog or joptionpane for this

508931
post	get
i agree with the previous two post about going straight into while dr.read and get the ordinals in the first iteration

508972
perforce	cvs	perforce	accurev	accurev	cvs
in many version control systems including cvs perforce accurev mercurial and team foundation server the command is annotate

508982
ready	each
when each stage of the computation on the clusters is done it will some how notify the cs that a specific file is ready

508990
typedef	struct
if you really must typedef a struct and most programmers that i work with would notâ¹ do this

508992
updatepanel	scriptmanager
there is nested listviews and i want to register a button in the second listview to scriptmanager for updateing the updatepanel inside the masterpage

508994
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
all works fine in all major browsers opera safari ie6 ie7 ff3 but not in google-chrome

508994
updatepanel	scriptmanager
after a few attempts i discover that it isn t a problem of the updatepanel but it seems that the autopostback of dropdowns doesn t work properly even in pages without scriptmanager and updatepanel..

509000
put	http-post
you can put in documents by posting http-post them to the search-server

509003
getter	setter
although you can override the methods in setter and getter few ever do

509003
getter	setter
i still average one setter getter every class or two but not enough to make me feel that a new programming structure is justified

509046
objectdatasource	detailsview
i have a detailsview control which uses this via an objectdatasource

509053
serializable	deserialization
for example when java s serializable constructs an object during deserialization it calls the constructor of the first non-serializable class in the hierarchy

509057
implements	extends
another reason is that it makes refactoring so much easier especially in cases where you want to implements or extends a generic framework through inheritance or delegation

509057
serializable	deserialization
what the attributes are basically doing is dynamically creating an interface definition specifically used for data serializable and deserialization

509084
post	get
is it the difference between using get and post i can t recall seeing a hyperlink do it but forms usually do

509098
post	get
i would recommend using the tryupdatemodel method in your action you ll have to get the customer from the database again and update it with the form s post variables

509103
hide	show
you can then show and hide them get messages from them about selection changes etc

509104
lisp	scheme
when you re starting out you may actually be better helped by looking at some lisp or scheme tutorial because symbolic math is conceptually very straightforward to do in lisp and to build a symbolic engine in python you ll more or less have to implement a mini-lisp as a foundation

509112
children	parent
in my case its actually a children and parent relationships

509122
getter	setter
when defining a property with non-trivial setter and getter or how to disambiguate foo if the the declaring type also contained a property called foo

509168
xsl-fo	xslt
ok i downloaded the syntext xsd and put it in the same directory that has my xslt which generates xsl-fo in it and its working using the visual studio editor

509170
for-loop	loops
using a java 5 for-loop you can rewrite your loops as follows

509189
put	get
unless i get another really good idea today i want to turn this into a stored procedure and also put together a version as a table-valued function using a temp table to put all the results in one resultset for select queries only

509219
implements	extends
i want to add support for http authentication password protected directories on the server but i don t know how to implements this - i assume i need to extends the class somehow but on how to i m a little lost

509222
inherited	properties
so perhaps there is something going on under the covers that allows what you re calling properties inherited since the the framework might transfer the values between these similar dp ids

509238
put	get
to get the definition you can run this hit ctrl-t first to put the results pane into text mode

509259
width	height
your animation does update but the width and height of the app don t update

509386
submit	submission
i have a client that is a newspaper and when they submit the pdf form of the paper to their site they are submission the same copy they send to the printer which can range from 30-50mb

509428
cvs	svn
i d check git svn cvs logs for the few most recent changes you made and look for anything that might be slowing down queries

509433
required	placeholder
that s why many of the examples you see out there including mine attach name john+doe -- it s just a placeholder for some data that urlrequest seems to required when setting any custom http headers

509481
inherited	properties
class b inherited the properties from class a instead of the reverse

509522
width	height
sometimes when i have to scale the video down on the client size height or width less then videoheight or videowidth keeping the aspect ratio flash player makes text look blurry

509553
google-chrome	safari
this happens because microsoftajax.js does browser detection and it s incorrectly detecting google-chrome as safari

509553
google-chrome	safari
be sure to put the google-chrome check before safari

509590
mockups	balsamiq
from an interview with peldi guilizzoni the creator of balsamiq --an adobe air application for creating mockups

509590
mockups	balsamiq
first version balsamiq mockups

509596
firefox	safari
only works in firefox 3.1 and above though i think safari is heading in the same direction

509642
disk	ram
my first thought was ram or disk corruption but that all checked out fine

509703
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
it s probably overkill for what you need but sproutcore is an mvc framework and it doesn t look any more heavyweight than javascriptmvc or trimpath s junction

509718
box-sizing	border-box
update also box-sizing border-box

509721
integer	fractions
modulo is performed in the integer context not fractions remainders are integers

509764
multiplying	modulo	multiplying	division	division	modulo
note that i multiplying the result of the modulo by 1.0 to ensure that a floating point division operation is done rather than integer division which will result in 0

509799
post	get
no scheme you choose will be perfect our one month rule but as long as all post are following the same rule set you still get a good comparative value

509836
division	modulo
you ve confused division and modulo

509836
division	modulo
modulo is the remainder left over after integer division

509845
free	malloc
it can be much easier to deal with than malloc free but it doesn t allow the laziness that java and scripting languages engender

509878
git-am	git-apply
another could have been to export them via git format-patch and then importing them with git-am git-apply but that would likely be slower plus it won t record the origin of the commits.

509922
jsf	seam	stateless	stateful
i am expecting to use jms with mdbs session beans stateful and stateless jpa and i am really excited about using jsf with seam

509953
ant	maven
ant maven

510149
button	checkbox
however maybe you should just check all checkbox after a submit button click then it may be simpler

510193
put	get
why do i get the following error when i try to put the same figure into the a0poster document

510225
kerberos	ntlm
above when talking about accessing the network this refers solely to spnego negotiate ntlm and kerberos and not to any other authentication mechanism

510261
direct3d	gdi
on top of this are the plethora of api s that often have many different ways of doing the same thing std library boost .net wxwidgets cocoa carbon native script libraries for python lua etc opengl direct3d gdi aqua augh

510265
cgpoint	cgrect
i ve found nsstringfrom helpful when logging structs like cgrect cgpoint etc

510272
mouseup	mousedown
i want to enable controls in my next button mousedown and then disable them at my next button mouseup

510317
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
you can use any depth-first-search or breadth-first-search algorithm and continue searching till you have visited every vertex in the graph

510322
atomic	interlocked
there is a number of functions that allow for atomic operations interlocked increment interlocked decrement and interlocked exchange

510342
datamapper	activerecord
propel uses the activerecord pattern not the datamapper pattern so your domain objects end up with a lot more persistence responsibility and afaik it does not include a unit of work facility

510360
base-class	subclassing
i don t think you can force any subclassing to override any of the base-class s virtual methods unless those methods are abstract

510445
rss	feed
validating in the context of xml files and hence rss atom feed which use xml to encode the values means to use a document schema which describes the expected structure of the xml file which elements can have what child elements what attributes can be present etc

510445
rss	feed
now seeing how you are parsing arbitrary rss probably it is the best to skip validating and make the best effort of parsing the rss feed

510448
mxmlc	compc
in general i check in the most minimal set of whatever i d need -- given a clean flexbuilder installation or none at all -- for example if i were compiling instead with mxmlc or compc and an empty project -- to build the project successfully

510455
post	get
if you are connected to the internet directly and not through a proxy and requests for a page get post in internet explorer 7 the default time-out is 1 minute

510462
cpu	processors
now in a multi-core system it could be that after measuring time1 the thread is scheduled to a different processors whose counter is less than that of the previous cpu

510483
width	height
you could create 2 new properties myfoo.avatarsizewidth and make this property change the width same goes for height

510495
width	height
does these size object have write properties for height and width

510497
put	get
if i set the function to static when i try and put this.errormsg.text error i get this error an object reference is required for the non-static field method or property

510550
opera	firefox
firefox and opera and i m sure the newest ie display new windows as a new tab unless otherwise specified by user preference

510573
libevent	epoll
listen to the people advising you to use libevent or os specific utilities such as epoll kqueue

510581
mouse	keyboard
the input can come from different sources mouse keyboard prepared for multi-touch

510590
perl	tcl
for instance i use the man command for perl tcl tk and various flavours of unix and linux the online language reference manual for ada apple developer resources for objective-c and cocoa

510598
width	height
note that setting the width and height separately will be less efficient than setting them in one go

510609
actionscript	mxml
my problem is that i dont know how to access the methods in the actionscript section of my main mxml class from my actionscript class any ideas

510621
post	get
here is a blog post to get you started on drag drop functionality in wpf

510630
uiview	subviews	uilabel	uitextview
one way to do it which i used recently is to create a uiview subclass which simply draws a rounded rectangle and then make the uilabel or in my case uitextview a subviews inside of it

510632
dictionary	map
from what i understand hashtable is an old implementation extending the obsolete dictionary class which has been adapted later to fit the map interface

510657
nsstring	nsdata
on mac os x and probably also on iphone os the defaults database can only contain property list objects nsstring nsnumber nsarray nsdictionary and nsdata

510664
children	parent
each knowledge node can have any number of knowledge nodes as children 1 sorted parent child relation

510665
put	get
collections.synchronizedmap map synchronizes all operations get put size etc

510714
division	multiplication
actually the opposite is often suggested as a performance optimization using shifts to implement multiplication division by a power of 2

510714
division	multiplication
but any half-decent compiler will do that for you so you should absolutely not do it manually keeping your code clear is the most important thing so use multiplication and division if you re doing math and use bit shifts if you re manipulating bits

510715
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
if you did use the multiplication or division option you would clearly need to comment why you are suddenly multiplying values by seemingly random numbers

510721
subtract	add
you can use normal relative positioning and use + or - to add to or subtract from properties

510765
hide	show
once the application has completed loading i want the splashform to hide or me sent to the back and the main from to be show

510781
division	multiplication
as others have said a modern compiler will probably produce the same output whether you use shifts or multiplication division

510816
superclass	subclassing
you have to invoke the superclass constructor otherwise java won t know what constructor you are calling to build the superclass on the subclassing

510830
pascal	delphi
delphi rad studio and lazarus ide for pascal delphi language

510854
gif	png
developer notes this tests the case where gif input is automagically converted to png

510860
client-side	server-side
you would typically make use of ajax and hence javascript to invoke some sort server-side validation that would be inappropriate for client-side validation

510903
firefox	safari
the following css works great in firefox and safari but doesn t in ie6

510907
hide	show
your javascript will need to be waiting for the reply in order to handle it in your example show or hide an error message

510953
int	double
you haven t said what you re trying to parse int double etc or what options you want allow hex thousands separators etc which makes it harder to give a good list of things to check

510968
pascal	delphi
which tool approach would you suggest to convert of a large 16bit windows gui application written in old borland pascal 7 owl to delphi

510968
pascal	delphi
understanding the pretty heavy differences between owl and vcl as well as the differences between the pointer manipulations in 16bit pascal and the state-of-art using of strings and objects in delphi - are there any ways tools which could help to avoid almost complete rewrite of the application

511002
accessor	properties
i found that it was much easier to define a simple intermediate representation of these properties as an inner class define transformers for both concrete object classes again very simple as it s just using relevant accessor methods to get the properties out and then use collect to convert my incoming objects into the intermediate representation

511003
superclass	subclassing
from class sub you can call super.anothermethod bla but you cannot access the method of the superclass in your main method - that would be against the whole idea of using subclassing

511012
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the header and footer do not stay fixed in opera or safari google-chrome but the whole table is scrollable so it is usable

511012
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
if you want to experiment with opera safari google-chrome support look at giving the tbody display block and go from there

511094
actionscript	mxml
im calling an actionscript class from my main mxml file

511108
inherited	properties
no ie has never supported inherited for any properties - sorry

511153
inherited	subclassing
if your subclassing overrides test then it overrides test - this is the whole point of object inherited

511153
superclass	subclassing
that s the beauty of polymorphic typing in fact the caller doesn t have to know about any of this at all and the subclassing determine how their behaviour differs from the superclass

511153
superclass	subclassing
if you sometimes want it to act as its superclass method and sometimes want it to act as its subclassing method then you need to provide the context required to do this

511153
superclass	subclassing
one which is never overridden and so always returns the superclass behaviour you can even mark the definition with final to ensure it s not overridden and your normal one which is overridden as appropriate by the subclassing

511181
pascal	delphi
delphi prism is an add on for visual studio which allows you to code to linux and mac from vs albeit in the object pascal language though

511209
accessor	properties
jcc attempts to make these python types pythonic by detecting iterators and properties accessor

511281
put	get
we ve got an api right now where all operations either retrieve from a list resource ie get user or on a single instance put user 1 delete user 22 etc

511314
pascal	delphi
c how much of the code is using stuff that you know can be done differently in delphi but that would work as it stands in pascal right now

511325
inherited	properties
you could call inherited first and check if the properties are still set

511325
inherited	properties
and by the way free doesn t care if the instance to be freed is nil so this will work if but only if inherited destroy sets the properties to nil

511326
multiplying	add
your compiler will look at any integer multiplying divide by a constant amount and reduce the expression to a series of shift add operations almost all of the time

511326
post	put
if there s enough call for it i ll edit the post and put it in tomorrow

511380
chunked	transfer-encoding
cgi you could return a response body with transfer-encoding chunked to spit out a few bytes every so often and keep the connection alive

511385
hide	show
you can prompt the user with the columns and have a show hide or something similar

511390
innodb	myisam
just remember that you need to use the innodb storage engine the default myisam storage engine doesn t support foreign keys

511478
firefox	safari
when we moved it to a load balanced environment the images stop working only in mac safari but still works in all other browsers including windows safari and firefox on the mac that had the original problem

511614
ant	maven
one approach would be to analyze the standard xml files that are output from the junit running in both maven and ant

511617
put	get
instead of providing a function that must be called to convert the utc times to local times put this logic inside each datetime property s get function

511623
super	extends
allowing code to not call the super constructor first breaks encapsulation - the idea that you can write code and be able to prove that no matter what someone else does - extends it invoke it instansiate it - it will always be in a valid state

511648
post	get
i then do the replace on spaces in the search string as described in my original post to get contains to work on multiple words and to stem words individually

511658
ready	each
inside each you could create a new data context and attach the entity to that context when you are ready to perform the action

511747
profiling	debugging
the loss of performance between engine and normal extensions is that profiling isn t nearly as accurate editor - server debugging isn t reliable and doesn t appear to work on anything but explicit xdebug_break statements

511762
nunit	mstest
fwiw we run the crappy visual studio testing via mstest on our hudson box and i ve got an xslt that hudson uses to convert the results to the nunit format so hudson can decipher them

511781
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
i don t mean fat or ntfs or a particular type of filesystems i mean the filesystems structure as a whole

511789
versioning	upgrade
i am having trouble generating an msi file that will upgrade from one versioning of the service to another

511796
gridview	repeater
rather than a table you ll have better luck with a true server control like gridview or datagrid or repeater

511862
ant	maven
or if you going to to serious stuff opt for a build script like ant or maven

511891
pop-up	dialog
it automatically pop-up a dialog with a progress bar if the operation is taking a long time

511915
mvp	presenter
as an alternate question i would also like to know if the mvp pattern can should handle a situation where you have many presenter and many views or should you only have one presenter

511921
int	double
official javadoc says that math.floor returns a double that is equal to a mathematical int but then why shouldn t it return an int

511928
int	double
the largest double value is also larger than the largest int so it would have to be a long

511940
filtering	grouping
how about grouping by category id then using the having statement to filtering out specific categories like

511948
int	double
returning the int as a double is the right thing to do here because it offers a much wider usefull number-range than a int could

511951
int	double
what would you want it to return if you gave it a double bigger than the largest int or long

511956
folder	directory
you can right click on the folder in vs and remove it from the project or you can make sure any of the files contained in the folder have their build action set to none and copy to output directory set to do not copy

511966
innodb	myisam
if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries

511967
hash	salt
store the hash with salt only

512022
integer	unsigned
i like the fact that the compiler warns me if i do things like assigning a signed integer to an unsigned variable

512076
folder	directory
in modern linux systems this folder is managed largely by udev which helps with the automatic configuration and population of this directory

512076
kde	gnome
gnome or kde are usually installed in this folder and you will find many of the programs you fire up in daily usage like firefox or evolution or gedit located here

512076
folder	directory
the reason for this is that the programs can be installed to a root-like set of folder like the installer is expecting without actually muddling up the directory with a plethora of files

512087
opera	firefox
can i check if host page for a javascript is active by the browser s tab in ie7 firefox opera

512100
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know whether there is an equivalent in firefox google-chrome though

512106
multiplication	modulo
it later states that it can be viewed as a matrix multiplication but as the elements of the matrix must be bytes and output as bytes then each element of the matrix must be modulo 256 and therefore not reversible and non linear

512113
integer	unsigned
doing that with an unsigned integer or overflowing such one has perfectly defined semantics because there is no such bit in the way

512123
onfocus	onblur
you can attach the onblur and onfocus events to the window

512129
actionscript	mxml
the right way to do this would really be to figure out some way to pass a reference to your custom component to the actionscript class that requires access to it -- for example in your mxml

512135
hide	show
i was able to show wait message but i am not able to hide the same when the execution is complete

512135
onbeforeunload	onload
i attempted to hide the wait message using javascript but any javascript function written in onload onunload onbeforeunload etc of iframe is not being executed

512145
versioning	upgrade
recently i upgrade a couple of cruisecontrol.net server from versioning 1.3 to versioning 1.4.2.14

512149
post	get	post	put	put	get
regarding http you should simply do a get for reading data no side-effects and a post for submitting actions side effects with perhaps put delete etc

512186
min	max
so you can give a min and max

512222
int	chars
i must ve typed a couple of hundred unused int args chars argv lines back in the day

512254
mockito	jmock
if it helps i m switching to mockito from a jmock test that did this

512257
fancybox	thickbox
do either thickbox or fancybox support being closed from a child iframe element

512405
post	get
i ll post the code when i get home from work

512449
put	get
it really depends on how big a shop you are and whether you will get back the resources you put into writing one

512517
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview bound to an objectdatasource

512528
textarea	textbox
for example if a textbox input element not textarea has 50 characters in it and i want to position the caret before character 20 how would i go about it

512542
textarea	textbox
excerted from josh stodola s setting keyboard caret position in a textbox or textarea with javascript

512542
textarea	textbox
a generic function that will allow you to insert the caret at any position of a textbox or textarea that you wish

512542
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
tested on ie6 and up firefox 2 opera 8 netscape 9 seamonkey and safari

512569
xsl-fo	xslt
all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo

512628
int	chars
int foo1 handle handle const chars sentence

512631
sorting	grouping
the advantage is that you can generate a report in about 10 lines of code including different query parameters sorting grouping etc

512636
hide	show
should i hook into each webservice call to hide and show the updatecontrol s div

512643
fflush	gets
then it s just a matter of which buffer gets fflush first

512646
stdout	stderr
to system.out stdout while the stack trace is printed to system.err stderr

512677
prng	random
you need to use a pseudo random number generator prng with a fixed start seed

512777
hide	show
drillthrough and show hide features

512779
rss	feed
i have a rails application that allows users to import information from various sources using rss feed and such

512831
children	parent
i know of the tablefunc connectby function but that is for getting a parent children

512849
children	parent
as you add more children you simply look up it s parent s top parent id and insert the appropriate row in the additional table

512911
width	height
to add an iframe with it all you do is iframe url iframe you can set width and height and everything

512915
multiplying	add
so the question how to create a template to add up the size of all the elements multiplying the values of each element and then adding all the results and then do a static_assert and stop the build if they exceed the magic number size of the eeprom

512960
children	parent
is there a good code profiler trace utility i can use to watch the parent process and children to see what is going on

512965
int	chars
this reads an unsigned int but stops after reading two chars two hex chars equals eight bits or one byte

513023
gentoo	linux
i have apache 2.2.11 using mod_python 3.3.1 python 2.5 running under gentoo linux

513034
google-chrome	firefox
i can open these documents in firefox or google-chrome and by open i mean from windows explorer not through a web server

513052
uiview	subviews
august i took your advice and added the uibuttons as subviews of the uiview rather than look further into the uitable

513082
profiling	debugging
xdebug can both do profiling and interactive debugging

513095
hash	md5
to meet the requirement you could simply use a hash such as sha-1 or md5 on your indexes

513095
hash	salt
i d also very strongly recommend insist on using a salt otherwise the hash values could easily be broken

513107
width	margin
give the wrapper div a left padding of 50 and the inner div a negative left margin equal to half of its width

513124
filtering	grouping
what would the filtering need to look like if i only wanted everyone in the manager read only ad grouping

513132
microstrategy	cognos
cognos sap business objects oracle bi suite microstrategy and reporting services are all basically comparable in performance on rendering to excel and pdf from their respective report builders

513157
int	chars
what sort of performance hit would there be in simply storing the value as a varchar x or perhaps a chars x over the additional work in doing the conversion to and from hex to store the value as an int in the database

513169
versioning	upgrade
there are several things that need to be done to get upgrade to work with msi s if you want to automatically remove the previous versioning

513169
versioning	upgrade
for you upgrade scenerio the product code must be changed for each versioning

513173
cvs	svn
my hosting service does not currently run allow svn git cvs on their server

513190
mouseup	mousedown
try capturing on the mousedown and releasing the capture on the mouseup

opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
from what we can tell there is nothing wrong with this page and it renders fine everywhere else ie7 ie8 firefox opera safari etc

513296
mouse	keyboard
-it is possible to accomplish any given task with just the keyboard without the mouse

513511
put	get
if i put an echo in the function i get everything back as i should

513542
komodo	scite
it looks like komodo edit scite and eclipse monkey are the winners

513542
komodo	scite
scite s api though does not seem as extensive as komodo edit s api

513566
int	chars
an advantage i see of storing the value in hex vs int is that if we needed to grow the size which i don t see happening with this application at 16 chars we could simply increase the truncated length and leave the old values without fear of collision

513588
shutil	copytree
for highlevel file operations like that use the shutil module and in your case the copytree function

513590
jobs	cron
if you go with ruby stick with ruby for your utility scripts cron jobs and that little gui app the boss wanted to automatically sms the intern when he takes more than five minutes to bring him his coffee

513618
inherited	properties
both properties are inherited from the listbase class

513763
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
major upgrade which will uninstall the old versioning so you need to be aware of this

513789
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up make sure java build path is selected in the left pane click the source tab then click the add folder.

513858
post	get
will allow you to post your whole application but it may be a bit more difficult to get feedback from it there unless it is appealing to lots of people

513954
bazaar	git
i agree with most of what s been said here but i d add the obvious point that it s less important to do frequent check-ins to the central repo if you re using a distributed vcs like bazaar or git

ati	nvidia
my advice would be to get the best machine you can afford with a top-end ati or nvidia card ideally an ati mobility radeon hd 4850x2 or 48xx or nvidia 98xx xxx card

514074
innodb	myisam
afaik the innodb engine still doesn t handle full text indexing so you need to use myisam

514104
pop-up	dialog
load the file into the swf modify it and save it back it requires user interaction a mouse click and again it pop-up a save file native dialog

514110
put	get
once we do a request.send null the object basically attempts to â œgetâ the url via http and once we get the data back from the server it is put in the responsetext argument

514147
cos	sin
also consider standard mathematical functions sin cos and tan would only work for half their input values you couldn t find the log of values 1 you couldn t solve quadratic equations x -b + - root b.b - 4.a.c 2.a and so on

514161
for-loop	loops
ordinarily you might use a for-loop and loops around 100 times

514184
floating-point	integer
they take up more space and floating-point math is slower than integer math

514263
mouseup	mousedown
mousedown mouseup approach to click pushbuttons

i d like to show or hide a few fields in a form in rails depending on the state of a select field in the form

514377
hide	show
what s the accepted practice for conditional show hide forms in rails

using php how can i efficiently get info about a user to display next to each post they make

514476
consistency	acid
3 acid sort of a corollary to #1 if atomicity consistency integrity and durability are not challenges with a flat file then go with a flat file

514517
ord	chr
however if you don t want to import anything and are only working in unicode use the built-ins ord and its inverse chr

514518
extjs	qooxdoo
and interface to this api using a framework such as qooxdoo or extjs

514531
mouse	keyboard
plus the user with inputs of mouse and keyboard has a variety of ways to break what you produce

inherited	subclassing
if i implement an interface on a base class will it be inherited by its sub classes i know the functions procedures will be but i am more interested in whether i will be able to cast the subclassing to the interface and then back to its original class

wxpython	qt-designer
as far as i can tell qt-designer is more powerful than any wxpython counterpart like boa constructor and pyglade

515327
cfstring	nsstring
the basic string objects are cfstring and nsstring

515333
inherited	subclassing

515548
doc	rtf
doc -- pdf html txt rtf

515562
for-loop	arrays
i use the for-loop when i have a collection with ordinal sequence as arrays or with a special rule for the step declared generally as a simple increment counter++

515582
int	double
i doubt scripting is setup to turn that into a real value and it would have to be something like a double not an int

515589
for-loop	loops
with the for-loop the scope is limited to loops itself in the case of the while loops however the scope extends to the end of the enclosing block no big surprise since the declaration is outside loops

515603
versioning	upgrade
then you have a core schema that you ve dumped from your database and when the versioning number is too low you upgrade your database using the migrations from the migration schema directory

the interface is inherited by the subclassing and you can cast the objects to the interface but it is not safe or recommended to cast the interface to class

515712
serializable	deserialization
java serializable does a lot of things under the hood that will probably make the actual deserialization step faster than reading from a file and instantiating your objects manually

you could use map dictionary instead of list

516148
public	protected
i can t see much of a case for private or internal modifiers in interfaces but supporting both public and protected modifiers seems perfectly reasonable

516163
implements	modifiers
an interface is all about what a certain object can do so when using a class which implements that interface the developer will expect all the members to be implements so the protected access modifiers won t mean anything for interfaces

516271

518111
inherited	properties
on occasion they can leverage some member functions and properties inherited from their base prototypes but this is only for convenience it does not mean that they are objects themselves

518113
getter	setter
you need both a getter and a setter or the property will not be serialized

518123
getter	setter
i had to look it up and couldn t quickly find an authoritative source but it looks like the xmlserializer does use getter and setter while the binaryformatter does not use getter or setter

518123
getter	setter
my first point showed that you don t really want to use getter setter

518123
getter	setter
the binary formatter can just take the exact in-memory representation of the object so it skips the getter setter

518172
width	height
creating a bitmap using the width height constructor will construct a ddb device dependent bitmap

bash	zsh
it s much less comprehensive than cygwin but is mature and stable and has a good cross-section of the basic unix commands sed etc. it will play nicely with windows command files you can do piping and redirection and there is a port of zsh with it so it will also run shell scripts although zsh is not totally compatible with bash

518368
postgresql	mysql
the limit offset clause from mysql and postgresql is a good solution that no-one else appears to do

518393
throttling	throttle
you can do some kind of throttling to limit it to x clicks per y seconds etc but then the adversary can also throttle his click rate

520378
ati	nvidia
quality opengl driver both windows linux nvidia tends to care more than ati about it

520382
vbulletin	phpbb
plus it s not a high-profile target like phpbb or vbulletin which means you won t have to worry about spambots constantly banging on the gates

520400
inherited	properties
edit my goal is to examine an assembly to see if any of the types in that assembly contain properties that are mytype or inherited from mytype

520469
vim	emacs
i assume that you mean javascript running in a browser and by program you mean an real application running on the clients operating system such as bash vim or emacs

520495
pop-up	dialog
one can use key preview per form to listen for the prefix suffix characters - and when intercepting something that resembles a barcode the barcode text can be sent to the correct edit box or used to pop-up a dialog box

520510
mouse	keyboard
this allows us to replicate an auto-away behavior much like msn live messanger when there has been no keyboard or mouse events after a certain amount of time

520510
mouse	keyboard
it seems that the filesystemwatcher class is similar in that it notifies the program of file changes that occur outside the program why not a similar function for mouse keyboard events

520600
post	put
i wonder if maybe it s trying to do an http put as opposed to a post

520607
folder	directory
edit i can t use flatten as there is a directory structure beneath folder that needs to be preserved

520640

a 4 byte integer may be overkill especially as it is unsigned but space is cheap and its very unlikely you will ever run out of ids

521033
rss	feed
i would need to programmatically determine whether an rss feed exposes the full content of its articles or just extracts of them

521034
subclass	abstract-class	getter	setter
for instance if the contract of the dosomething method above required sometype to have populated x y and z fields when they were accessed via getter and setter your subclass would blow up regardless if you used the concrete class that returned null as your base class or an abstract-class

521034
superclass	subclassing
do i need the behavior of my proposed superclass in my subclassing

521034
superclass	subclassing
do i need the state of my proposed superclass in my subclassing

521034
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing was created from the proposed superclass would it truly be an is-a relation or is it just a shortcut to inherited behavior and state

521034
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if it is just a shortcut and you cannot qualify your proposed subclassing as-a superclass then inherited should be avoided

521034
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
only if a class needs the behavior state and can be considered that the subclassing is-a n instance of the superclass should it be considered to inherited from a superclass

521040

i ve made myself a bookmarklet and it functions just fine but when added to a toolbar in opera or firefox it just takes on the default bookmark icon for the browser a globe and a star respectively

521073
post	get
granted there could be multiple links there some to other blog post but if you focus on the last one and try to come up with a few heuristic words for the title of the link more read full etc you should be able to get a lot of them

521080
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this definitely happens in opera safari and firefox

521177
vb.net	vb6
vb.net array is padded with extra element so legacy vb6 code migration is easier

521337
getter	setter
it supports getter setter constructs delegates and true generics which java does not

521392
ant	maven
ant looks hard when compared to maven

521392
maven	pom.xml
sure there is a learning curve with maven but reading a pom.xml is far easier than reading a build.xml

521402
profiling	debugging
i had the idea to run profiling collect the dml statements then replay them on the test server while debugging the app .

521478
jms	jta
you can use jms and jta java transaction api together - see here

521478
jms	jta

i wanted to take on the challenge of having a pdf option that would be a menu choice and do a tranform to xslt to xsl-fo to pdf

521751
int	double
clojure already has a reader that knows how to distinguish int and double so if you re sure your string only has numbers in it you can use it

521758
put	get
i create and populate my struct put it in the tag pull it out get the data of the selection and so forth

521782
ant	maven
however since it involves system-level and cross-platform functionality most development languages platforms are not properly suited which includes java and therefore ant and maven

521782
scons	setuptools
scons buildbot setuptools easyinstall and base python are my current target platform for the build process

521782
ant	maven
when necessary integration with ant maven and any other such tool is easy

521831
cvs	svn
it will check out from cvs svn automatically increment the version build number execute build tasks in ant scripts and tag your repository with the new version

522158
versioning	upgrade
as part of the upgrade we d like to be able to serve a web page to people using out-of-date vms telling them which versioning we now support and where they can download them from

522178
put	get
the way to do this with the least leftover space is to put the centers of the circles on a hexagonal grid like the pattern you d get if you were making a pyramid of coins

522203
firefox	safari
html5 s contenteditable is modelled after the existing property from ie which is also supported by at least firefox and safari so you don t have to wait for html5 to be â supportedâ

522244
move	drag
when the user is trying to click it interprets is as a drag even if the mouse has only move 1 pixel

522249
client-side	server-side
what makes this really different from a client-side javascript invoking a server-side php

522311
hide	show
either the finished html menus hide and show as needed or in a big json object in the js part

522334
vb.net	vb6

filtering	grouping
never accept free-form input from users when filtering data -- instead use controls that pre-validate input textboxes with input masks dropdown lists options grouping and limit it to values that you know are valid

522389
rss	feed
i don t know if you can link directly to the rss feed xml so that it s always up to date

522444
button	checkbox
if you do not want to use a list i think a button or a hyperlink that toggles from select all to select none would work better than yet another checkbox which is hard to make out among all the other checkbox

522502
post	put
google and others put a high value on words in the url that match words on the page so if the title of your blog post is in the url it will help your search engine juice

522509
debian	linux
the server runs a linux debian

522525
mouse	keyboard
since you have to have a place to put the mouse to move it and let s face it little point in the middle of the keyboard just isn t it

522537
goto	break
a much simpler way of inspecting the code in msvc is to simply set a break point and inspect the disassembly right click on the line and select goto disassembly from the pop-up menu

522545
onfocus	onblur
since that doesn t work with all browsers they go with javascript in the onfocus and onblur events to remove a class that sets the border color

522546
width	height
i ve used -scrolltorowatindexpath atscrollposition animated in other parts of my application successfully but the difference there is my uitableview covered the entire height width of the content view so the scrolling worked

522563
for-loop	loops
when i loops through it using a for-loop how do i access loops index from 1 to 5 in this case

522572
actionscript	mxml
one thing i do recommend however is keep actionscript out of your mxml files as much as possible

522572
actionscript	mxml
mxml is a layout language and in my experience it pays in the end to use it where it makes sense and drop into actionscript whenever heavier lifting is required

522622
cpu	processors
incidentally i think the current trend of cpus with multiple identical cpu cores will eventually subside as well and the real processors of the future will have a single master core a collection of general purpose cores and a collection of special purpose coprocessors like a graphics card but on-die with the cpu and caches

522626
terminate	timeout
if a query in the database hits the maximum query timeout in sql server the database query terminate and the web service returns an error to the client

522712
rss	feed
i have a wcf service that uses a system.servicemodel.syndication.syndicationfeed to create an rss feed

522801
int	chars
you ll keep an int variable that will be your index into the string and inside the loop do your letter-shifting on the chars at that index and increment the index variable by one until you reach null

522823
put	get
but regardless of where i put the and in relation to the footnote text i get the following error

522846

i can tell the droppable target is accepting the element being dragged via the thumbnail class but the draggable item won t drop

522912
firefox	safari
i don t have any problems with your code on either mac safari or mac firefox using jquery 1.2.6 and jquery ui 1.5.3

522927
post	get
you need to go to the source of the blog figure out how the comment form is posted post or get then you can use mock ajax documentation here

522964
gif	png	tiff	png
other than that it s up to the uses of the images quality compression etc. in terms of whether you choose png gif jpeg tiff etc

522966
gif	png
if you were it usually doesn t matter between png gif and jpg other than jpg being a lossy format the other two are lsosless which is ok for photos and the like but not say for icons or text

522974
division	addition
i need basic mathematical operations such as addition and division for arrays

522974
division	addition
what about the addition and division between a and b

522988
hibernate	gilead
gwt is a pain to work with hibernate - you can try using gilead but i havent had much success with it its too cumbersome for me

522993
perl	tcl
after occasional exposure to tcl and perl i was really wishy-washy on the value of these kinds of tools

522998
ubuntu	debian
sudo apt-get install libdirectfb-extra # for debian and ubuntu anyhow

523106
freebsd	linux
also needs to run under freebsd linux

523109
union	distinct
in that case you might want to reconsider the idea of querying the list of distinct categories first then union the per-category queries

523139
hash	salt
you should store the passwords as salt hash not as plaintext

523139
hash	salt
it might be a good idea to select the password don t do select anyway and compare it to the salt hash of the password the user typed in

523154
postgresql	mysql
on mysql and postgresql the two databases i ve used the syntax would be

523171
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up windows are very easy to implement and the modal dialog boxes are even easier

523195
pop-up	dialog
i have a strange encoding situation whereby the html page itself displays as it should with all the accã nted chã racters properly displayed but all the pop-up dojo dialog fail to use the correct encoding

523353
post	get
once you get going read through scott guthrie s mvc post and check out phil haacked s blog and steven walther s blog

523360
hide	show
i need to crawl a web board which uses ajax for dynamic update hide show of comments without reloading the corresponding post

523391
cpu	affinity
you could set the cpu affinity of your program

523393
cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
or since the other dll will be loaded in your process you might be able to set your process or threads processors affinity to just one cpu

523427
cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
you can then set the processors affinity for that job object to include only one of the available cpu cores

523427
affinity	processors
the child process is not able to change the affinity mask to anything that is not a subset of the processors affinity for the job object

523472
affinity	processors
setting processors affinity is the wrong approach

523475
inherited	properties
it seems as if object inherited is not working in the javascript microsoft jscript runtime error object doesn t support this properties or method

523477
mockups	balsamiq
a tool like balsamiq is great for fast ui mockups

523483
apache	lighttpd
apache lighttpd etc are all great for being flexible but you run a single purpose website and you really need to be able to both do more than the current servers are capable of doing both in handling traffic and in appropriately combating bots

523530
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick and imagemagick are two different libraries

523542
cos	sin
on my labtop sin and cos takes about 144 ns

523544
serializable	deserialization
i have found the mvc json framework has some shortfalls in regards to serializable deserialization ignore member attributes

523544
post	get
.getjson also works but lacks http request type post get

523570
cos	sin
you could pre-store your sin and cos in an array if you only need some approximate values

523570
int	double
you then use this array using degrees int instead of radians double

523595
i2c	spi
ethernet serial ports uart spi i2c and gpio s support are all in one

523601
atan2	sqrt
i could have done something similar for the other trig functions but i have not found it necessary as profiling showed that only sqrt and atan atan2 were major bottlenecks

523635
post	get
now the question remains if i repeat the joincolumn attributes updatable false and insertable false on the parent see code in first post the additional update statements seem not to get produced.

523675
hide	show
this will show all the divs on page1 and hide them all on page2

523679
hash	salt
a server might also provide digest authentication which avoids transmission of the actual credentials - the client instead generates a hash of their credentials with a server generated salt

523696
pop-up	dialog
i d use the jquery ui dialog plugin to pop-up the dialog

523701
cos	sin
on the x86 the java.lang.math sin and cos functions do not directly call the hardware functions because intel didn t always do such a good job implimenting them

523708
emacs	textmate
i do almost all my coding in textmate which has been dubbed the emacs of macs

523711
post	get
remove the get contactusform method and only have the post version

523725
post	get
when session_start is called php is looking for a parameter from the client that was sent via post get or in a cookie depending on the configuration

523741
hash	md5
feed that into configured session hash function either md5 or sha1

523762
google-chrome	firefox
download a copy of google-chrome firefox with firebug or ie9+

523810
solaris	procfs
for solaris you could try the procfs module from cpan

523818
awt	swing
the answer will vary slightly depending on whether the application or applet is using awt or swing

523818
awt	swing
for swing the method to override is the paintcomponent method of the jcomponent and draw the image as with what was done in awt

523818
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

523837
switching	screens
however when i put a default in one of the switching statements that default applies to every other switching statement and so when i use the variable of another switching statement in the url the default case of that other switching statement will appear on screens along with the case of this switching statement

523854
inherited	properties
if you mean a class that inherited from system.componentmodel.component like for example the system.windows.forms.bindingsource and strongly-typed datasets this will allow to drag an instance on the visual studio design surface on a form in design-time and set some properties using the properties grid

523856
post	get
correct me if i m wrong but i believe you can only send post and get requests with a browser in html

523878
bash	subshell
if this is run the bash subshell running in the background is terminated ok but tail still hangs around

523939
versioning	upgrade
i run into this fairly often when coding in python because my desire to upgrade to a new versioning of the interpreter can easily introduce problems in libraries that worked fine before

523945
filepath	unc
as they are detected the stored procedure calls a .net console app using xp_cmdshell passing the product id unc path report name adobe reader filepath on the sql server and a few other parameters

523945
filepath	unc
the filepath and unc path are passed as parameters and voila - automatic printing of ssrs files

523982
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
if you can construct a tree in this way forming the various notations prefix postfix infix are fairly simple -- you just follow the preorder postorder and inorder traversals of the tree for which there are well known algorithms

523986
instances	transient
i put transient data into instances variables instead of passing them as arguments among the private methods that support count

523989
tcplistener	tcpclient
if you want to have a stream like access to a tcp socket you should use the tcpclient tcplistener classes which wrap a socket and provide a network stream for it

524021
aptana	radrails
however i see that the main developer on that project has joined aptana radrails

524024
rss	feed
i need a php library script that can retreive data from feed no matter if they are rss or atom because i want users to insert random feed which will then be stored in a database

524034
rss	feed
consuming rss and atom feed

524035
aptana	radrails
i have used aptana radrails in the past and thouroghly enjoyed it

524036
aptana	radrails
i ve used aptana radrails and that s definitely one to steer clear of

524039
width	height
i m having trouble consistently setting the width and height of an img tag

524039
width	height
sometimes the width and height are set properly and sometimes they aren t

524039
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox seem to be working fine

524039
width	height
also when ie7 doesn t display the image with the proper height width if the browser is refreshed it then displays properly

524069
try-catch	exception-handling
put the try-catch where you are sure you won t just swallow the exception-handling

524074
hash	salt
to fix this you setup a method that takes in the browsers valid session and generate a md5sum + salt + hash of your own private device and send it back to the browser

524074
post	get
the browser then is required to return that hashed key back during every post get

524074
hash	salt
if you even have access to ajax there is a way to send a salt and hash key across the wire and use javascript with it to build the onkeypress characters valid token that gets sent across the wire

524099
width	height
if i use a custom panel to layout my listboxitems the listbox won t respect their combined height it does respect their combined width though - even when my arrangeoverride returns a size that surrounds all the items

524104
pexpect	subprocess
if you re familiar with how a href rel nofollow noreferrer expect a allows passthrough to interactive subprocess with specific key sequences from the user or strings received from the child process triggering matches and sending control back to your program the same thing can be done from python with a href rel nofollow noreferrer pexpect a

524114
put	get
if demand for your random crap is high enough that people are willing to go to these lengths to get it legitimate users aren t going to be put off by a captcha

524193
textile	bbcode
the three common markups i know of for this purpose are markdown used i believe by so textile and bbcode

524210
affinity	processors
this is done by setting the processors affinity of the thread

524212
width	height
this is because you need to remove the width and height attributes of the tag

524212
width	height
simply changing the css image width and height values will not work

524250
qmail	exim
i have no experience with them but i m told that qmail and exim are equally good

524309
lisp	prolog
try c# lisp prolog and c for example add some toy functionality to a local copy of the linux kernel to see how it ticks

524342
disk	ram
so that next time when the program runs it can just load the ht off disk into ram

524386
unix	bsd
plus bsd is a bit more mature operating system being directly descendent from at t system v unix

524404
anjuta	gnome	anjuta	geany
anjuta geany and a bunch of other micro-ides for gnome fail at indentation and misc features

524408
ubuntu	linux
sure you can install most of the same stuff on bsd as linux but you won t find a distro similar to say ubuntu which focuses strictly on the desktop

524413
post	get
i recall reviewing someone else s php code once and he had a function or class method that rolled all get and post variables into a single plain old object that could then be passed around

524413
post	get
if the same name-value pair appeared in both get and post post would win

524444
codeigniter	cakephp
i ve used codeigniter cakephp and even smarty template engine

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox opera and internet explorer but not in google-chrome

524721
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this was tested in ie 7-9 firefox opera and google-chrome

524754
int	boolean
c didn t have an intrinsic bool type so all boolean were typed as int instead with canonical values of 0 or 1

524754
int	boolean
the not-not syntax converts any non-zero int to 1 the canonical boolean true value

524786
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
an nslog in viewdidload is being called when the application starts which makes sense. nslogs in viewdidappear and viewwillappear aren t doing anything

524791
iprincipal	iidentity
with a totally custom implementation you can still use iprincipal iidentity and formsauth

524815
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if you were using a uinavigationcontroller as the container then viewwillappear viewdidappear would be called whenever you push pop a new viewcontroller

524827
integer	fractions
i m using the following piece of objective-c code to format a nsnumber and it works fine most of the time but it doesn t quite do what i want when the nsnumber object holds an integer no fractions part

524834
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
i haven t used tortoisecvs in a while but i guess there might even be a gui option for that in there your server would still have to be cvsnt for it to actually work

524834
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
note that tortoisecvs is just a graphical frontend for the cvsnt client

524845
post	get
thus every request every http get and post and the rest will end with this string

just to get a handle on creating custom controls in .net cf if you haven t already i d highly recommend following this blog post on making controls transparent as the concept is largely the same

524919
free	malloc
will malloc free be slower than allocating a big chunk at the beginning of the program and running my own memory manager over it

524944
disk	ram
the reason it can be slow allocating memory from the os is that it deals with lots of processes and memory on disk and in ram so to get memory it s got to decide if there is enough

524944
disk	ram
possibly it might have to page another processes memory out from ram to disk so it can give you enough

524945
free	malloc
will malloc free be slower than allocating a big chuck at the begining of the program and running my own memory manager over it

524950
free	malloc
what they will give you is memory allocation libraries which provide malloc free etc

post	get
a lot of mvc frameworks assume that you will be using the post - redirect - get pattern for handling user input in your web forms

525041
children	parent
to accomplish what you re describing at least what i think you re describing one way could be to have both the transparent wrapper and the image children of a parent div with relative positioning

525049
width	height
the top and bottom divs are the full width of the image and are set to have a height that is the difference between the top bottom of the selection box and the top bottom of the image respectively

525125
xmltype	clob
if you are storing xml in oracle use an xmltype column which can easily be converted to a clob and works wonderfully with the jdbc 10g driver as that is what we are currently using in our production environment

525167
min	max
that site did lead me to the postgres gotchas list which had more details on count speed and another sequential scan issue max and min are sequential scans

525187
memcpy	memset
memchr like memset and memcpy generally reduce to fairly small amount of machine code

525189

525503
appfuse	spring
the best lesson i can recommend is having a good look at the spring mvc build of appfuse

525615
many-to-many	one-to-many
well since relationships such as one-to-one one-to-many and many-to-many are defined in the in app models how does rails enforce such relationships

525661

seam combines jsf and hibernate

525672
opensuse	linux
i d like to know if it is possible for non-root user on linux i m using opensuse to run apache without using sudo command

you can then remove the processing instruction convert the nsstring to an nsdata and pass it into the nsxmlparser

525714
freebsd	linux
to put it all into practice read the linux or freebsd kernel source to see how the networking stack there is put together

525714
udp	tcp
tcp ip udp bgp and friends are much more interesting in my view

525737
width	height
it looks like the height of the main view is being cut by a little more than half and the width is being increased by about 50

525739
des	aes
unless you have backwards compatibility reasons you should use aes and not des in new production code

525745
3des	aes
please use aes or at least 3des if aes is not available

525816
google-chrome	firefox
the following code shows what i expect in firefox and google-chrome

525909
cpu	hyperthreading
if your application is single-threaded and your test system is multicore hyperthreading multi-cpu then you should expect to see around 50 idle cpu time for two cores 75 for four etc

525926
kde	gnome
does the function definition differ on different wms gnome kde or is it handled on a lower level in the os

525932

for linux it will depend on the window manager gnome kde - as you ve already mentioned

525934
dictionary	map
i am doing a report on the various c++ dictionary implementations map dictionary vectors etc

525954
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
assuming a nix based platform you can use apache nginx or lighttpd

525954
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
there s a bunch of other ones but they are typically used as app servers tomcat zope mongrel etc and have apache nginx lighttpd squid proxy in front of them

525977
accessor	properties
in this properties s set accessor i convert the string back into a fontfamily

525977
accessor	properties
the only reasonable alternative to validation that i can think of would be having the properties s set accessor ignore invalid values and filter out the invalid deserialized objects later

525980
width	margin
this is where width 33 may not work because you will need to factor in the amount of margin that element has

525986
actionlink	redirecttoaction
has anybody tried it and is there a strongly typed redirecttoaction and maybe actionlink in rc

525992
width	height
the problem is i can give a width to an iframe but the height should be dynamic so that there is no scrollbar in the iframe and it looks like a single page.

526005
button	checkbox
for checkbox and radio button at least in delphi 6 which is all i have access to there is no transparent property

526013
client-side	server-side
it s unclear whether you want a client-side or a server-side solution

526013
web.py	cherrypy
i really like how cherrypy and web.py handle them but the api is pretty simple in any library

526025
rss	feed
it displays an rss feed from google

526037
ubuntu	linux
other issue - function doesn t work on linux at least on ubuntu 8.10

526057
unsigned	short
malloc allocates bytes and an unsigned short is most likely to be two bytes

526065
width	height
i haven t had a chance to mock up this particular issue since then but i recently discovered that setting height or width to double.nan resets it to its default free-spirited behavior

526070
int	double
today i noticed that when i cast a double that is greater than the maximum possible int to an int i get -2147483648

526070
int	double
similarly when i cast a double that is less than the minimum possible int i also get -2147483648

526070
min	max
is putting if statements for min and max int before the cast the best solution

526092
int	double	min	max
limits.h has constants for max and min possible values for int data types you can check your double variable before casting like

526114
opera	safari
i ve tried this in ie6 ie7 opera and safari and it works fine

526115
subtract	addition
the implementation will allow for normal addition subtract etc on a c++ number type including casts

i wrote a nintendo ds application that requires a folder to be copied to the root directory of your memory card and i often get e-mails from people who copied it to the wrong place and don t understand what the root directory is

526281
folder	directory
i don t think they realize that the root directory can be thought of as a directory or folder

526285
lisp	scheme
because common lisp unlike scheme and other lisp requires funcall your proposal is not ambiguous

526290
folder	directory
for them the root directory is the first folder they see when the double click the memory card icon

526303
margin	height
you ll need overflow hidden on the parent object but the result will be that each column will request to render this additional height suggested by the margin but not actually request layout of that size because the negative margin counters the calculation

526337
lisp	scheme
ever since reading what paul graham has to say about lisp i ve been intending to go back and pick scheme up again and see if it ll improve my programming in general

526340
entity-relationship	diagram
it even produces entity-relationship diagram and you can feed it with xml file containing the comments for tables and columns

526356
opera	safari
safari same thing as opera it works but i can t find any documentation on it

526373
hide	show
then when the resizeiframe function kicks in put two extra lines in there that will hide the loading image and show the iframe for that faux ajax look

526373
rss	feed
of course this only works from the same domain so you may want to have a proxy php script to embed this stuff and once you go there you might as well just embed your blog s rss feed directly into your site with php

526420
innodb	myisam
i m using innodb at the moment but am interested in answers for both innodb and myisam

526431
slideup	slidedown
have your tried using slideup and slidedown

526455
sharepoint	splist	spweb	splist

526471
hide	show
i m not exactly sure why your adding the extra calls to show hide

526471
hide	show
please explain further as to why you need to do the show hide

use something like findwindow findwindowex to find the hidden window and get its window handle and then call showwindow handle sw_normal to unhide it

526521
post	get
if you use the technique in the post referenced by nobugz you will need to make sure the delegate doesn t get garbage-collected by using gc.keepalive _proc when setting the hook otherwise after an indeterminate period the hook will stop working when the delagate gets gced

526528
median	minimum
so the median gives a local minimum

526528
median	minimum
so the median gives a global minimum

526537
int	double
the computation works for x86 80-bit extended precision values aka long double as well but the bit-twiddling must be done byte-wise as there s no int type large enough to hold the values on 32-bit hardware

526550
jar	war
you probably just need the necessary jar files and either include them with your war or add them to your application server many have different ways of doing this

526600
gdk	gtk#
according to the documentation for gdk _threads _init g _thread _init has to be called first and the gtk# documentation says the same

526604
stopwatch	chronometer
one somewhat confusing thing about chronometer is that you can t really use it as a stopwatch that gets started stopped and restarted again

526604
stopwatch	chronometer
if you need something like a stopwatch you ll have to subclass chronometer or maybe create your own version using the source

526682
ostream	ostringstream
using my common sense i would say that for ostringstream this should give 0 for default constructed ostream -1 and for ostream with freshly opened file 0

526684
jsf	seam
the point of seam is that it is a closed -ish technology stack combining jsf and hibernate

526723
public	protected
scene is protected meaning it can be accessed from any class that derives from the class it resides in which in this case is screen however you haven t declared sceneitem which is the type of scene to be public

all you need to do is make the string lowercase turn it into a char array like you have done loop through each letter take the value of each char and subtract the value of a and add one

526986
equals	gethashcode
the cell implements inotifypropertychanged and overrides gethashcode and equals

526998

int is a function that converts a chars or whatever to an int

527006
interbase	firebird
interbase firebird has a generator object which is pretty much like a sequence in oracle

527036

add something in the cruisecontrol build like setting verbose on nant and confirm you have the same paths set up

527129
fadein	hide	hide	show
i know how to show hide or fadein out in jquery but is there a built in way to toggle between show hide or fadein out or do i have first look if the element is display none if yes then show otherwise hide

which is an unsigned int type used for 32-bit chars and is the same type as uint_least32_t also described in 7.20.1.2

527342
tcpclient	sslstream
are you sure that you need to manually implement the http protocol in code using a tcpclient and an sslstream to communicatie with zeep

527368
post	get
i presume that comments page should call three action methods index addcomment get addcomment post

527425
folder	directory
this works fine in a firefox browser when i place my trust file at etc flashplayertrust folder with entries for the directory and the swf file i want to trust. according to the flash security guide the global trust file should be at the same level as the directory which contains the mms.cfg file

527457
jquery	simplemodal

527466
accessor	properties
usually you can do the same job better and more cleanly by implementing and using accessor or better yet properties

527468
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
the first resize works fine mousedown mousemove then mouseup but on subsequent mousedown+mousemove s the browser attempts to drag the whole resizebar div instead of properly resizing its parent container

527468
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
on mouseup the div then starts resizing cooldiv on mousemove without any mousedown required until a further click of the mouse

527502
inherited	properties
you can access them in the code-behind files as well because the viewpage inherited from system.web.mvc.viewpage that has the viewdata properties

527789
versioning	upgrade
any hack you could use to make it directly can be removed when you upgrade your interpreter versioning since no one expects backwards compatibility to preserve such things

527791
post	get
that is not necessarily true if you have used a post to get to the current place

527794
superclass	subclassing
generally it s not such a good idea when a superclass has any knowledge of the subclassing

527893
codeigniter	cakephp
alternatively you might build your own solution on top of cakephp codeigniter zend or similar framework which include plenty of ready stuff so that you don t need to completely re-invent the wheel

527916
public	protected
typically you d also use explicit implementation rather than public properties - perhaps with some protected virtual methods for the implementation details although keeping track of where the reader writer is across different classes would be a nightmare

527989
hide	show
if it happens to work then most likely the show desktop operation will hide the window

528045
put	get
question is there a way to get the jquery clean-up code to run after the js-generator code but without having to put an alert box in there

528093
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
i ve recently installed mbunit version 2.4.2.355 on our build server which runs via cruisecontrol.net and nant on a windows server 2003 machine with .net framework 3.5 sp1 installed

try-catch	exception-handling
this is the only valid usage i can think of throwing an exception-handling with throw and catching it yourself in a try-catch block

528476
try-catch	exception-handling
anyway i d argue that throwing an exception-handling from within a try-catch block so the catch block can be executed represents really bad logic flow

528540
inherited	properties
because toolstripitem doesn t inherited from control it doesn t have a cursor properties

528762
aggregate-functions	sum
i m not a cognos guy but it sounds like your detail is not wrapped in an aggregate-functions like sum x

528848
uiview	calayer
i m not sure that touch events will find their way to the view as it s moving across the screen so if you need to have the uiimageview respond to touches you may need to replace it with a calayer insert it as a sublayer of your main uiview s layer and call the hittest method on the presentationlayer of that main layer

528868
charindex	substr
you could split up the string you already know the delimiters . with charindex substr and order by the different parts

you can also group them in hierarchies to inherited some common properties

529314
treeviewitem	listboxitem
the various itemscontrols including treeview let you override the creation of the item such as listboxitem treeviewitem etc

529375
int	double	mutators	setter
if you are talking about primitive variables like int double etc then this will be tough but if you need to trace access to your custom classes then all you need to do is place a few trace statements in your property setter and methods which modify state mutators

529380
profiling	debugging
essentially it s closer to profiling or debugging than to tracing

529430
ordinals	difference
an ordinals comparison compares strictly on the numeric character values stopping at the first difference

529523
rss	feed
i am trying to scrape some website and republish the data as a rss feed

529533
mouse	keyboard
with the keyboard and mouse locked away from curious users

529538
submit	submission
by cancelling the submit dialog we will keep the add operation pending and will be able to edit the files before submission to p4

529603
mouse	keyboard
you can listen the document you can listen keyboard and mouse events you can listen for action events

529612
feof	fread
you read only the first 4 096 bytes from the pipe you ll need to place the fread print _r in a loop and check for the end-of-file using the feof function

529665
post	get	post	put	put	get
the general form for all the test methods of get post put delete are as follows

529666
stdout	stderr
the directs stderr into stdout which you are capturing with popen

529700
internationalization	localization
however at some point typically between internationalization testing and localization linguistic testing internationalization and localization tend to overlap

529700
internationalization	localization
one person mentions l10n feeding back to internationalization but if you are doing quality i18n testing and creating pseudo-localized content then iterating on development issues during localization should be the exception not the rule

529700
internationalization	localization
interface resizing and particularly adapting pages to support bi-directional languages like arabic and hebrew also tend to blend both localization issues and internationalization engineering

529815
getter	setter
edit well the simple answer is that the mere fact that a property getter or setter could include far more than just a field read write makes it undesirable not to mention possibly unexpected to allow the sort of sugar you are proposing

529825
post	get
i can t exactly paste the text i m trying to parse because the characters get filtered out of the post

529825
int	chars
but when looking at the chars value its an int of 2

529842
ant	maven
even ant can use a maven repo nowdays

529869
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the issue is that the link works and returns values when clicked in ie and safari and google-chrome and opera

530014
profiling	benchmarking
if you really believe that piece of code to be a performance bottleneck profiling or benchmarking it both ways

530018
vmware	esx
if you have one vmware esx server on a high-end hardware box converting it to a physical server will give you a minimal performance advantage

530062
versioning	upgrade
finally i would want to be able to draw a clear line between the base code and each website s customizations so that we can easily upgrade an existing site to the latest versioning of the core software by just bringing the core code up to date

530067
getdate	dateadd
where current_date between dateadd day -31 getdate and getdate

530068
subtract	add
add or subtract in days

530079
put	get
it will run on that hardware sure but it depends entirely on what kind of load the apps will put on it lots of complex db access for instance and also how many hits it will get

530086
freebsd	linux
just a tip but from personal experience i ve found that freebsd works much better on low-end hardware than a modern linux distro does

530116
realloc	qsort	realloc	malloc	qsort	malloc
i m thinking of using qsort to do the sorting on a malloc realloc -allocated array

530139
hide	show
once the drag drop is complete hide the label and show the grid

530155
printf	fgets
fgets and printf deal with strings which in c are char-arrays ending with the special character 0

530243
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
if so start by looking at sqlconnection and sqlcommand if you re using sql server otherwise use oledbconnection and oledbcommand

530249
google-chrome	safari
javafx also promisses to release a webkit component engine used by safari and google-chrome named jwebpane in a future release

530250
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i m not sure from your question what you ve got going on but if you just want to learn how to use a sqlconnection sqlcommand and a sqldatareader object to retrieve items from a database check this out

530286
post	get
when i run this servicehost on my local machine windows xp it works fine - when i post a soap message to it i get back an http 202 code accepted which is the correct response for my service because the contract has isoneway true

530289
type-safety	typechecking	type-safety	erasure
all of this results from a known and deliberate weakness of generics in java it was implemented using erasure so generic classes don t know what type argument they were created with at run time and therefore can not provide type-safety unless some explicit mechanism typechecking is implemented

530298
free	malloc
comment out calls to malloc free around the problem area and any associated areas where those pointers are used

530298
profiling	debugging
on unix check out this guide for debugging memory on unix and the valgrind profiling sol thx for reminding me about this one

530332
ienumerable	iqueryable
the .where implementation for iqueryable is different than the .where implementation for ienumerable

530354
listview	gridview
especially inside repeaters listview and gridview name your controls something short

530368
printf	strncmp	printf	strncpy	strncmp	strncpy
so things like printf s scanf s strncat strncpy strncmp etc aren t really happy with null 0 characters embedded within our binary data array

530395
multibyte	setlocale
you ll have to set the locale first with setlocale to utf-8 so it chooses this implementation of multibyte support

530404
rank	max
i d argue that given that definition of rank that straights can only start with a max of ace.points - 4

530405
instances	transient
2 would work but if there are a lot of dependencies then all of these would have to be transient too and this would result in a lot of instances being created every time i needed the person repository

530419
translation	localization
think localization companies that have to reuse memory translation between versions for rainier we should use the memory from shasta or from whitney

530426
hash	salt
an example hash password and salt is and the password used was password

530467
hash	salt
you need to unencode the salt to convert it back to it s byte representation and then concatenate that with the password to get the hash password value

530522
getter	setter
suppose i have an object representing a person with getter and setter methods for the person s email address

530525
pascal	delphi
in delphi or object pascal as we oldies like to call it calling conventions come after the function declaration like this

530581
getter	setter
i find lots of getter and setter to be a code smell that the structure of the program is not designed well

530581
getter	setter
you should look at the code that uses those getter and setter and look for functionality that really should be part of the class

530581
getter	setter
having both getter and setter is equal to the field being public when the getter and setter are trivial generated automatically

530581
getter	setter
but there are also cases where having getter and setter is a good pattern

530581
getter	setter
in one project there is a gui model which has 15 getter and setter of which only 3 get methods are trivial such that the ide could generate them

530626
client-side	server-side
i know how to do this server-side but i d like to do it client-side if possible

530630
rss	feed
have you looked at feedity - - for creating custom rss feed

530630
rss	feed
i ve been using it for a while to create rss feed for those feedless webpages

530700
x86	64bit
and on x86 in 32 and 64bit mode that is 32-bit integers

530706
x86	64bit
in those situations where 64bit data operands are desired they can be activated using the new rex prefix woohoo yet another x86 instruction prefix

530735
jar	war
we have an ear file which contains a few jar files one of them being named ugc-ws.jar for libraries that we use and also a war file which has the web.xml to load a servlet - this war file also has the same ugc-ws.jar in it s lib directory because the servlet is inside that jar

530735
jar	war
so basically we have the main ear file and within it multiple jar files as well as a war file - which also has a jar file inside it s lib directory

530759
lisp	prolog
procedural is part of the procedural functional logical or logic oriented distinction compare c lisp and prolog between different ways of describing what a program should do

530776
ienumerable	iqueryable
you might need to cast it to ienumerable or iqueryable first or something

530779
int	double
you can double int strings matrices complex numbers reals window sizes on your monitor and all sorts of different things

530794
inherited	properties
your code can be more or less oo depending on how heavily you rely on inherited polymorphism classes and the methods as a properties of data worldview as a means of structuring and explaining understanding your code

530848
versioning	upgrade
additionally when you allow subtyping you actually present a very complex contract to consumers and you inevitably end up with versioning problems when you attempt to upgrade your class in the future

530875
int	chars
or instead of invoking int 21 with which prints one chars at a time you can set to print a string set ds dx to a block of memory which contains

530886
phpunit	simpletest
there are at least two mature stand-alone junit style test suites available named phpunit and simpletest respectively

530886
codeigniter	cakephp
as far the mvc frameworks go symfony has its own testing framework named lime codeigniter has a unit_test library and cakephp relies on the aforementioned simpletest

530886
phpunit	simpletest
i know that zend studio has built in support for phpunit tests and both phpunit and simpletest have command-line runners so integration into any workflow is possible

530902
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
we may notice that one class is very much like another so instead of copying and pasting code we let one class inherited from another the subclassing inherited from the superclass or base class

530902
superclass	subclassing
in this way the subclassing has access to all of the data structures and procedures of the superclass and can augment or override them in certain ways

530992
qdockwidget	qwidget
i m just trying to get into qt and kde program and have hit a snag trying to add a floatable draggable qdockwidget to the .ui file based as a qwidget that is embedded into my kde 4 program

530993
easymock	jmock
one final note when a field cannot be injected for whatever reason but i still would like to mock it out in a test i have found the junit-addons privateaccessor class helpful to be able to switch the class s private field to a mock object created by easymock or jmock or whatever other mocking framework you prefer

531060
datamapper	activerecord
if you have that much associated data you could look at using something like datamapper instead of activerecord with rails as it supports lazy-loading data as required

531083
swt	swing
i ve developed both with swing and with swt but not with qt

531083
swt	swing
however there are a few things that swt does that swing doesn t do as well or at all -- such as launch the system s native browser and execute javascript scripts in this browser

531083
swt	swing
swt and swing of course do not have licensing fees jambi i don t know about either way but it may depend on your intended use -- for example are you distributing a gpl application or a commercially licensed one

531105
vb6	vba
in vb6 and vba

531146
direct3d	gdi
wpf graphics are hardware accelerated where possible through direct3d - it is not gdi based

531166
superclass	subclassing
template method originally states that the method should be abstract in order to force subclassing to implement it adhering to the superclass contract

531173
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it currently supports firefox 1.5+ safari 2.0+ ie 7.0 opera 9+ and google-chrome 0.2.x

531253
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
jquery and other libraries make it easier to code the behavior -- but you generally can t get around the fact that ie6 has so many weird rendering issues that you ll be frequently banging your head on the keys trying to make it do what firefox safari and opera do right the first time

531260
folder	directory
if you put the images directory into the public folder of the rails app for example public images then you shouldn t have any problems with mime types unless your web server is configured wrongly

531291
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i d suggest using dotnetzip or sharpziplib

531350
queue	fifo
in fact this defeats the whole purpose of queue and the class you ll eventually come up with the will violate the fifo semantics altogether

531365
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
on the internet as a whole ie is the most popular browser with firefox a close second and safari opera and google-chrome taking up most of the remainder

531388
public	protected
that will restrict the returned properties to public instance properties excluding static properties protected properties etc

531408
try-catch	exception-handling
wrapping something in a try-catch doesn t really have any impact at all if the exception-handling is seldom raised

531462
textarea	textbox
input type text and the textarea to 500px doesn t work in ie6 and chrome only works fine in ff2 haven t tested other browsers ie and chrome add two pixels to the textbox

531509
ant	maven
we ve since abandoned that practice and now use maven to manage library dependencies - even for projects that we re still building with ant

531578
ant	maven
if you re developing in java then you can set up a local repository and then use a tool like maven or ivy + ant to access it

531600
disk	ram
assign subsequent drive letters to any ram disk

531656
dictionary	map
the most i ve been able to do is to query the data dictionary to do things like map the package dependencies

531706
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if it works on firefox it will almost certainly work on opera safari google-chrome etc with only a few minor tweaks

531734
toolbar	tabs
my viewport on firefox with tabs open quick links and the excellent web developer toolbar extension is only 572px when set to 1024x768

531765
keydown	keyup
the keyup event isn t actually fired for all keys not just arrow keys etc. until you release the key there are just many repeated keydown events

531772
x86	64bit
reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly

531814
ilist	iqueryable
edit1 changed ilist to iqueryable in repository and filters

531824
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy vs strncpy in a similar way to how g++ used to warn for inclusion of vs

531825
rational-numbers	fractions
to give you a practical example take the set of rational-numbers or fractions are they re commonly called

531873
pascal	delphi
is there any tool preferably freeware that can analyze pascal delphi syntax and automatically remove unused vars

531920
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization times increase linearly with the amount of data being processed as opposed to exponentially with snakeyaml

531946
inherited	properties
would explicit inherited suppose multiple instances of the class functions and properties

531961
portrait	landscape
it s still possible to use the designer for basic layout but you ll need to run the forms on various emulators devices and try switching portrait landscape to fully test the regenerate methods

531973
min	max
i have a jquery slider on my page having min -100 and max 100 and startvalue 0

531977
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
you should use the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes unless you have a specific reason not to

531989
google-chrome	safari
there is a known incompatibility with ajax.net and google-chrome safari 3

531989
post	put
recently there was a great post put up detailing what to do which you can find here

531989
google-chrome	safari
the general gist of it is that both google-chrome and safari 3 report themselves as webkit in their useragent strings

531997
kde	gnome
on gnome kde you can select in which application you want to open file right click on file - open with - other

532038
rss	feed
i am using an excel macro to generate an rss feed

532038
rss	feed
the user s timezone offset needs to go in the field of the rss feed

532045
post	get
all your state must be explicitly passed via post or get or explicitly saved to a session

532072
ubuntu	debian
i ve installed svn through apache under various versions of ubuntu and debian but never with the newest ubuntu

532072
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r www-data www-data home subversion

532122
kde	gnome
these commands should open up the in the preferred application in gnome or kde respectively although i don t have an installation of either to test on

532138
pop-up	dialog
the only pop-up dialog i ve found in the doc is the wshshell.popup method

532173
mouseover	mouseout
one is tripping over your own state because the mouseover effectively hides the object which triggers a mouseout when the cursor moves again ad infinitum

532254
cvs	svn
a simple plain text file todo in the top level of the project s cvs svn area works for me for simple projects

532277
titlebar	window
you should be able to maximize the window without the titlebar buttons and menus

532278
parallels	bootcamp
i ve just discovered which is a free alternative to parallels and bootcamp

532279
free	malloc
oh and don t forget when you re done with this structure you need to free up all the pointers that were malloc d in this structure or you ll have a memory leak

532286
metaclass	subclassing
look at the modelbase metaclass db models base.py to see what all is done for you behind the scenes when you subclassing model

532290
mouseover	mouseout
the first div outer 1 has event handlers for mouseover and mouseout events

532290
mouseover	mouseout
when you cross the boundary between outer 1 and inner 1 the mouseout and mouseover event handlers fire which in your case is causing the flicker

532290
mouseover	mouseout
the second div outer 2 has event handlers for mouseover and mouseout events but these have been created through the jquery .hover command

532320
mouseover	mouseout
i m currently catching the mouseover and mouseout events to disable enable dragging and zooming but i still can t highlight text and now scrolling the mouse wheel on an area of the overlay that doesn t have anything to scroll causes page elements outside of the map to move up the window

532324
antlr	irony
there s a discussion on that in this question you re essentially stuck with writing your own parser and tokenizer rather than simply writing a bnf file for it and then using antlr gold irony

532378
cvs	svn
oops - used csv instead of cvs to many imports and i use svn heh

532386
integer	fractions
use the integer datatype if you don t want the fractions part or convert to int

532440
glassfish	weblogic
i am not familiar with glassfish but you could do this in websphere or weblogic using a commonj workmanager

532440
jboss	glassfish
apparently the same can be accomplished in glassfish and jboss via a jca workmanager which i am not familiar with

532442
put	get
what i actually intended to do was to create a factory that provides implementations of a generic file transfer interface containing get and put methods based on a given connection uri

532447
vsto	add-in
i want to deploy a vsto 3 application level word 2007 add-in that i ve written with visual studio 2008

532506
rss	feed
my company is starting work on building a web-based rss reader that users can sign up to and track feed

532559
hide	show
i m going to implement an access control list for each individual user so they can assign access to their own resources so they can hide stuff for example from their mothers but show their friends

532564
getter	setter
the standard xmlserializer serialization only acts on public properties that have both a getter and setter

532577
factors	matrix
s is a diagonal matrix which represents scaling or squashing with different scaling factors the diagonal terms along each of the n axes

532577
factors	matrix
so the effect of left-multiplying a vector v by a matrix m is to rotate reflect v by m s orthonormal factors v then scale squash the result by a diagonal factors s then rotate reflect the result by m s orthonormal factors u

532580
opera	safari
im unsure about other browsers like opera or safari it is possible that you need to extend this list with further variants

532599
typedef	struct
typedef struct wf_list_workunit_fe

532617
versioning	upgrade
i have had a lot of success with older versioning i haven t upgrade in a while though

532668
inherited	properties
the datagridview contains an autosize properties inherited from control which garbles the control if enabled

532733
iasyncresult	idisposable
because iasyncresult does not implement idisposable another place must be chosen to free the resources

532745
next	except
also you cannot return a result set except through a ref cursor output parameterâ this is discussed in the next section

532786
iasyncresult	idisposable
anyway there should not be any leak because if the iasyncresult is holding some native resource it should correctly implement idisposable and dispose such resources when the gc calls his finalizer

532787
filesystems	ntfs
have a look at quotas for ntfs filesystems

532828
int	chars
if you can waste a little storage well 25 you might gain from adding a fourth dummy unsigned chars to the structure imgrgb provided that this would increase the size of the structure to the size of an int

532828
int	chars
native int are usually fastest to access and if you re looking at a structure of chars that are not filling up an int completely you re potentially running into all sorts of interesting access issues that can slow your code down noticeably because the compiler might have to generate additional instructions to extract the unsigned chars

532828
int	chars
in the same vein upping the size of the structure members from unsigned chars to unsigned int might waste lots of space but potentially can speed up the code

532888
swt	swing
i have no experience with swt yet i was working with jambi qt swing and gtk as well

532921
filtering	grouping
so ordering grouping filtering

532986
pascal	delphi
are there any static code analysis tools for delphi pascal

532986
pascal	delphi
i have seen plenty of options for c++ and .net but nothing for delphi pascal

533040
puts	gets
the first puts prints hello foo gets called returning hello which is the argument to puts

533046
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
one more thing you can also bind the width height of the child element to the actualwidth and actualheight properties on the canvas so that the child will adjust the size of its parent

533094
stdout	fflush	fflush	gets
i write a lot of perl scripts and on a fast server unless you set stdout to always fflush after each write the output gets all mixed up just like yours

533167
width	text-align
try making the link a block with an assigned width and then applying text-align center

533229
profiler	aqtime
aqtime from automatedqa offers a static analysis profiler

533229
profiler	aqtime
i have never used this profiler but am happy with those aqtime profilers that i use regularly

533263
public	protected
from a purely practical standpoint java s visibility constructs allow classes in the same package to access methods and properties with protected and default visibility as well as the public ones

533277
gridview	objectdatasource
next modify your objectdatasource to define a deletemethod in your mynamespace.itemmgr that accepts the id datakeynames paramater from the gridview and performs the task you wish to perform

533318
overwrite	preserve
you can change that to public or you can add a method property to your form2 class to set the label and call that latter method is generally preferred to preserve encapsulation and because the designer may want to overwrite your public change.

533338
int	double	int	chars
and the types of variables were defined by a suffix chars a was a string while a was an int and a# was double precision

533368
pascal	delphi
pascal analyser delphi 2006+ has built in audits and metrics source monitor and code healer are the ones that i m aware of - all are pretty useful

533374
int	chars
i think the best approach will be to unroll the loop enough times to ensure that each iteration processes a chunk of data divisible by 4 bytes so in each iteration the loop can simply read a small number of int rather than a large number of chars

533392
width	height
it accepts a height or width argument that you append to the url that calls the script

533398
bash	tcsh
without using the new 2.6 subprocess module how can i get either os.popen or os.system to execute my commands using the tcsh instead of bash

533398
bash	tcsh
the string will be interpreted by bash and then interpreted by tcsh

533398
bash	tcsh
can t i just tell python to open up a tcsh sub-process instead of a bash subprocess

533398
fish	tcsh	fish	bash	bash	tcsh
i realize that bash is the cat s meow but i m working in a corporate environment and i m going to choose to not fight a tcsh vs bash battle -- bigger fish to fry

533421
bazaar	git
however it may also be a good chance to look into alternative version control systems that allow greater ease of use and flexibility take a look at bazaar and git

533435
zsh	tcsh
i don t have tcsh installed but with zsh

533447
ubuntu	centos
there s a little extra work involved since you re on centos and it s a lot easier if you re on ubuntu but it s still do-able

533453
button	checkbox
there are various asp.net standard web controls within these tables usually checkbox radio button lists text entry boxes labels etc

533453
put	get
i am trying to put a datagrid within one of the rows under a tag and get the error message

533462
google-chrome	safari
i would like a solution that works on all popular modern browsers ff3 safari google-chrome ie plus ie6

533475
createfile	getlasterror
but my application is failing calling createfile with getlasterror code of 123

533496
post	get
you could easily provide your partners with the javascript to do the get and post

533509
put	get
using tags and css one can hide and display areas of html so while i couldn t get the datagrid in the table i could put it outside of a table and simply display or hide it

533611
put	get
once you get that working you could try to put similar code into a subclassed version of the listview control

533631
inherited	subclassing
reading between the lines of this example which i ve linked to because it s quite long i m presuming it s a case of using multiple inherited to extend a class as opposed to proper subclassing

533656
versioning	upgrade
for example what if a user installs the ie6 versioning of your app then upgrade to ie7

533670
hash	md5
i don t know of any flash-specific ways but it certainly wouldn t be difficult to write a script that compares the md5 hash of the original file with the version you have online

533701
public	protected
i m looking into releasing a public rest api which i d like to keep protected via api keys

533720
jobs	cron
i have found when managing large numbers of cron jobs for a single application that it is best not to have the jobs all hanging loose in the crontab because that encourages you to overlook dependencies between them one task that runs at 14 minutes past the hour depends on a task that runs at 12 minutes past the hour succeeding but every so often that task takes 2.1 minutes to complete and the other script fails giving you a heisenbug

ironruby	ironpython
if you host the dlr you would quickly be able to take advantage of ironruby or ironpython scripting

534112
post	get
if you post your question to the ironpython mailing list i m sure you would get a better reply around the xbap scenario and some of the developers there created toyscript

534183
ubuntu	linux
note that i use ubuntu linux and so does my friend and that this application compiles and runs without the -wl -bstatic options just fine.

534243
rsa	dsa
in order to check the signature of the hash anything from rsa over dsa to ecc can be used

534243
crypto++	libtomcrypt
i can recommend crypto++ or libtomcrypt for that

534250
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
however i would prefer to use a linqdatasource or objectdatasource if possible

534283
profiler	visualvm
visualvm is just the standalone edition of the profiler tool included in netbeans

applicationsettingsbase has a method called upgrade which migrates all settings from the previous versioning

534405
portrait	landscape
i build 2 views one in portrait and another in landscape mode in the interface builder

534444
rss	feed
another idea is to separate your pages between servers - rss feed on one server homepage on another checkout on another one

534447
rss	feed
trac offers you rss feed for everything you can think of

534447
rss	feed
it should be possible to generate daily reports from this or you simply tell your rss client to check the feed once a day

534456
maven	pom.xml
edit if you are using maven you will need ehcache and commons-logging in your pom.xml as well

534475
cos	sin
as below note that in c# for example sin and cos take radians not degrees - multiply by math.pi 180 to get the value in radians first

534520
boost	stl
i m not sure about well written but there are a few things out there like hypertable and kfs that are system-level software that both use boost and stl extensively

534566
versioning	upgrade
google designed protocol buffers for this type of scenario they shift a huge amount of data around - their format is compact using things like base-128 encoding but extensible and versioning tolerant so clients and servers can upgrade easily

534570
put	get
with the bin obj directories gone you don t need to exclude all exes xml files etc - which is handy as it means you still get to put in the ones you want you might have sample xml files etc.

534575
hide	show
this works fine but i d like one of the controls to hide if the boolean is true and show if it s false

534581
ssl	https
also this sets the server up for an ssl connection so once you ve set it up the address will be and https address not the regular

534583
post	get
is there any way to get the size of a post request in javascript

534628
cos	sin
you can use cos and sin to work out the amount of movement in the x and y coordinates

534628
cos	sin
the other thing to note is that the cos and sin functions are using radians instead of degrees

534756
stdout	stderr
produces a log file from stderr and stdout the contents of which are displayed as well but

534767
folder	dir
so if you execute the script test.bat below from the c temp long dir name folder

534805
addslashes	multibyte
addslashes is generally not good enough when dealing with multibyte encoded strings

534837
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
java has two types of exception checked exceptions and unchecked-exception those that inherit from runtimeexception

534949
directsound	mixer
on xp waveout and directsound feed to the same kernel level mixer api

534980
ccl	clisp
my guess is that the code is ccl-dependent so use ccl instead of clisp or sbcl

534993
versioning	upgrade
when you follow these steps you try to upgrade assembly a and assembly b to versioning 2.0.0.0

534996
onfocus	onblur
you might have to just hook into the onfocus and onblur events for the checkbox to keep track of when it gets and loses focus

535036
kerberos	ntlm
if it is a web application i would recommend using one of the standard methods for authentication ntlm kerberos

535053
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
how about firefox opera safari etc

535070
opera	firefox
according to that page ie4+ netscape 6+ opera 4+ and i gather all versions of firefox support http 1.1

535083
width	height
i can do that without having the symbol | by changing the bgcolor of the table cell and making width of the a tag to 100 and height of a tag to 30px

535092
bazaar	git
check out other options too - miscrosoft s tfs this not only used for source control system but for defect tracking project management etc etc bazaar git are popular ones

535115
post	get
you might also get some ideas from history flow which jeff atwood linked to in a recent coding horror post

535144
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
instead of having two identical for loops in your presentation logic you should have one for-loop outside of it that builds two arrays then your presentation logic should use each the way that would actually be beneficial to it

535308
int	double
the first step after all the declarations is to make the double an implied decimal by multiplying it by the relevant power of ten then turning it into an int

535324
addslashes	multibyte
the two practical effects are addslashes tends not to work well with multibyte characters and more importantly by asking mysql what characters need to be escaped you avoid a possible future compatibility

535344
opera	firefox
in firefox img tag showed up but in ie and opera img tag did not show up so i have spent 2 hours try to find out why

535363
mouse	keyboard
i m not a fan of looking at a monitor from an angle am wondering what the pairing experience would be like if you had 1 computer with 2 monitors displaying the same info each with it s own keyboard and mouse

535366
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox 3 google-chrome but fails in internet explorer but only sometimes certain actions such as resetting the form which really just does a response.redirect with some querystring parameters .

535366
google-chrome	firefox
can anybody suggest why this only happens in ie and not in firefox or google-chrome

535376
translation	localization
this illustrates the issues that you can run into when you think localization is just translation

535397
rss	feed
lets say for instance i have a website for managing an rss feed

535402
lisp	scheme
so if you want to learn lisp scheme or common lisp would be a great start

535415
post	get
however if you use post alot there is a limited amount of information you could get from correlating the apache access log with your php error log

535428
mouse	keyboard
the mac mini isn t that expensive at 599 assuming you ve already got a keyboard mouse and monitor

535471
hash	md5
where timestamp is the unix timestamp and hash is an md5 hash say of the timestamp appended to a secret string on the server

535492
versioning	upgrade
but issue is that iphone sdk gets frequent updates and requires updated versioning of mac os x - updating hackintosh is pain you can do better development on macmini instead of wasting time to upgrade and you will never know when your hackintosh will be unbootable

535496
std	ostream
edit true manipulator semantics a persistent quoting state could also be achieved by wrapping an std ostream rather than deriving from it as noted by benã it in the comments.

535496
std	ostream
to the best of my knowledge this cannot be done directly without either deriving a new class from std ostream or similar or wrapping such a class in another class that forwards most methods to its contained std ostream object

535589
urllib	httplib
jamesâ specific example was the http libraries httplib urllib urllib2 urlparse mimetools and ftplib

535654
getter	setter
if the dto is a class that is exposed by a web service the wsdl that is created defines the property as an element and the proxy that gets created on the other side just creates a getter setter property that is run on the client itself so the getter and setter do not cause a roundtrip

535654
getter	setter
even if you just create a public variable in your dto the proxy will be implemented as a getter and setter

535655
hide	show
given that most people have a tendency to top post i d like to be able to hide the duplicated message in an email reply in a manner similar to how gmail does it show quoted text

535655
hide	show
i created a regexp that looks for these lines and wraps a div around them to allow some js to hide or show this block of text

535769
gridview	rowdatabound
i need to strikeout the entire text even the whitespace between text cells in a row in the rowdatabound event of the gridview

np-hard	satisfiability
we want to prove that deciding the satisfiability of boolean formulas is an np-hard problem as well

535826
implements	extends
with poco you have to use the runnable interface and the usage is close to what you would get with java threads if you implements runnable not extends thread

535826
implements	extends
instead of implements extends an interface it depends on the operator being defined

535859
children	parent
given a n n-sized multi-headed acyclic graph where each node has at most three children and three parent is there an non-exponential algorithm to identify whether a n-length path exists where no two nodes share the same value and every value of a set is accounted for

535930
x86	64bit
back to basics 32-bit and 64bit confusion around x86 and x64 and the .net framework and clr

535933
apache	nginx
i typically use nginx as a frontend and apache passenger as a backend

535933
apache	nginx
so have apache listen on port 81 to handle rails requests proxied by nginx and let nginx deliver static content

535933
apache	nginx
not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content

535937
versioning	upgrade
also i would suggest you to upgrade your jvm versioning if its possible as that is what sun will suggest at first place

535944
user-controls	elementhost
in winforms use elementhost and add you wpf control inside best practice here is to create a wpf user-controls and add you controls into the user-controls

535963
hide	show
why can t i instantly show or hide private or protected members

535988
nginx	lighttpd
i need to know which one of this good for downloading uploading nginx lighttpd or litespeed

536031
subtract	add
then add the number of preceding enumvalue siblings of the current node and subtract the number of preceding enumvalue siblings of the node from which you took the data value

536081
mouse	trackpad
in general the scrolling action on a trackpad simply sends the same signals to the pc as the scroll wheel on a mouse so your current implementation should work

536104
move	drag
now did you notice that while the dragging most definitely occured your drag didn t actually initiate until you d move out of the square you began in

536106
unsigned	short
bonus tip sometimes in one dump you will see unsigned short and

536143
vsto	add-in
also useful are getting started with visual studio tools for office don t knock it because it says getting started in there s a lot of useful info in there and which is linked from the first and is an overview of vsto add-in

536163
cpu	affinity
create one thread per cpu core and set its affinity to each core

536195
superclass	subclassing
not a subclassing of t not a superclass of t but precisely t

536207
gcov	lcov
we have started to use gcov and lcov together

536207
gcov	lcov
i also want to add that if you are already using the gnu compiler tools then gcov lcov won t be too difficult for you to get running and the results it produces are very impressive

536275
sorting	grouping
given that the view you want is - as you say - just a view of the underlying data then you should do the sorting and grouping in the view module

536290
superclass	subclassing
slicing means that if you assign a subclassing instance to a superclass variable the extra information contained by subclassing is sliced off because the superclass variable doesn t have the extra space to store this extra information of the subclassing

536290
superclass	subclassing
when you assign a subclassing instance to a superclass variable you actually just copy the reference

536350
put	get
i want to have a db script for cleaning up an existing db which is not in use rather than creating new ones especially when you have to put in a request to your db admin and wait for a while to get it done

536360
mouseover	mouseup
you ll need to remove the toggle that occurs when you mouseup without having triggered a mouseover i didn t bother tracking that down as it should be obvious

536424
put	get
i might put file compare into this search engine and get a bunch of matching projects back

536439
boost	stl
today everywhere i look i see raii and sfinae and stl and boost and well modern c++

536479
accessor	properties
the synthesize directive tells the compiler to generate accessor for your member variables according to the specifications given in the properties directive in your .h file

536486
division	multiplication
note that converting this number to from a human-readable form is by no means a trivial task - it requires multiplication and division by 10 or 256 and i cannot present code as a sample without proper research

536486
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
the advantage is that the operations add subtract and multiplying can be made really efficient and the heavy conversion to from base-10 is done only once in the beginning and once after the end of the calculation

536492
factors	mean
i m sorry i m unsure of exactly what you mean by passing around the function pointer to the factors method but i generally wouldn t use a function pointer if you don t have to

536511
folder	directory
for example given the files folder x.file and folder folder y.file i want to create the directory folder x and folder folder y

536584
hash	salt
typically i always recommend using a cryptographically-strong random value as salt to be used with hash functions for passwords such as to protect against rainbow table attacks

536584
hash	salt
note i am not asking about why to use salt how to protect it it doesn t need to be using a single constant hash don t or what kind of hash function to use

536605
pop-up	dialog
i have a button when a user clicks it i want to pop-up a jquery ui dialog with two go nogo confirmation buttons

536620
hash	salt
using a salt that is known to the attacker obviously makes constructing a rainbow table particularly for hard-coded usernames like root more attractive but it doesn t weaken the hash

536620
hash	salt
the concatenation of a username and password might still provide an entry for an intelligent rainbow table so using a salt of a series pseudo-random characters stored with the hash password is probably a better idea

536642
cvs	svn
if you use the svn cvs git

536671
hash	salt
salt should have as much entropy as possible to ensure that should a given input value be hash multiple times the resulting hash value will be as close as can be achieved always different

536671
hash	salt
using ever-changing salt values with as much entropy as possible in the salt will ensure that the likelihood of hashing say password + salt will produce entirely different hash values

536671
hash	salt
the less entropy in the salt the more chance you have of generating the same salt value as thus the more chance you have of generating the same hash value

536671
hash	salt
by varying the resulting hash value as much as possible by using high entropy salt values ensures that hashing the same input+random-salt will produce many different hash value results thereby defeating or at least greatly reducing the effectiveness of rainbow table attacks

536698
width	height
what you can do offcourse is to open a new window with defined small width height and all menus are stripped.

536726
post	get
can you not use get or post and extract the header yourself

536746
vmware	esx
on one server running on vmware esx i see the following tell-tale signs of a virtual machine

536756
hash	salt
salt is traditionally stored as a prefix to the hash password

536756
hash	salt
however using the username or any other user-controlled value as salt would reduce cross-system security as a user who had the same username and password on multiple systems which use the same password hashing algorithm would end up with the same password hash on each of those systems

536763
serializable	deserialization
mostly because of serializable deserialization and network latency

536767
postgresql	mysql
oracle vs postgresql vs mysql

536773
postgresql	mysql
weight sqlite mysql postgresql ...

536777
put	get
if you don t put resources into it time money focus effort then you won t get anything out of it except failure and cost

536778
hash	salt
though this doesn t add much to security against dictionary attacks etc. it does remove the fringe case where someone copies their salt and hash to another record with the intention of replacing the password with their own

536829
pop-up	dialog
on the dialog that pop-up check the run with different credentials

536829
pop-up	dialog
when you start the program through the shortcut it will pop-up a dialog asking for which username and password you wish the program to run under

536852
hash	salt
since you need to be able to recreate the hash you have to already know what the salt is

536852
hash	salt
you have to assume that the attacker who has your hash values probably knows your salt values as well

536878
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could use mouseenter and mouseleave in this way

536895
nunit	mstest
the problem is when trying to unit test our code nunit or mstest are not running from within the autocad context and they also cannot start it

536900
implements	extends
so if anyone tries to use your library it won t have difficulties implements your interface as opposed to the case where he would have to extends your abstract concrete class given that he already extends another already

536907
gmail	hotmail
this approach can have mixed results depending on your user s mail client so before sending it out try testing your format on dummy gmail yahoo and hotmail accounts

536911
postgresql	mysql
anyways mysql and postgresql have several enterprise consulting services but in the end these consultants aren t really resposible for the product because the product belongs to everyone

536951
post	get
sql loader can be a little challenging in terms of initial learning curve but you can soon post again if you get stuck

536981
x86	mips
the device i m currently working with is sh4 based while you mostly see arm x86 and the odd mips cpu

537008
client-side	server-side
i m not familiar with the server-side .net part of this but if this issue were happening in a regular jquery client-side setup this would need to be added to the click handling function

537033
accessor	properties
incidentally the value properties is a parametrized properties which must be accessed through an accessor in c#

537035
mouseleave	mouseenter
maybe create one for the mouseenter and mouseleave events and style the control appropriately for each

537035
mouseleave	mouseenter
the style registers for the mouseenter and mouseleave events for all listboxitems defined in that listbox

537044

all that said if it still makes sense to put this data into the defaults db then see the post f3lix posted

537180
vbscript	jscript
windows xp and vista have vbscript and jscript engines installed by default

537180
vbscript	jscript
as for my 2 cents vbscript and jscript are both very mature technologies that have plenty of resources available

537188
vbscript	jscript
windows scripting host invoked through cscript.exe supports vbscript and jscript

537197
vbscript	jscript
xp and vista come out of the box with vbscript and jscript support

free	malloc
horrible pseudo code with no error checking on malloc or free

537309
inherited	properties
in your example inherited principles don t apply since a css rule targets the span element directly for the color properties

537334
dxcore	coderush
dxcore is the framework on which refactorpro and coderush are built which should give you an idea of what sort

537382

of course instead of using toggleclass you could also use addclass and removeclass to be more explicit

537491
submit	submission
to stop the submit if you don t intend on it submission

537493
ncover	partcover
if you have a build process you could use a tool like ncover or partcover and fail the build if the coverage isn t sufficient

537531
hash	md5
if saving is a very expensive api call db transaction etc then you might find that it s worth the expense to serialize the object on-load and save an md5 hash of it

537542
hash	md5
how can i get a md5 sha and other hash from a file but only doing one pass

537549
processors	hyperthreading
basically my understanding is hyperthreading on the same processors shares the same l1 l2 cache which can cause issues between the two

537553
vmware	virtualbox
contemplating on moving to vmware or virtualbox setup for development and keeping the development tools off of my main system but then think that would cause a headaches if i want to just try something really quick

537562
put	get
if you put your code before the base.onxxx you get executed before the event does

537616
children	parent
the class inherits the interface but it is still the responsibilityy of the children class to implement the interface it inherited from the parent

537633
postgresql	mysql
that s the same with psql the postgresql command-line interpreter and mysql the mysql shell

537693
debian	linux
it happened with an alternate signature field for pgp and weaknesses with ssl implemented on debian linux

superclass	subclassing
using prototypes would save you this and make a property update on a superclass filter through to the subclassing as expected

537857
width	height
width and height trigger it if you don t want to set a width or height you can use the ie-only zoom property in css

octal	binary
there s no syntax for literal binary constants in c++ the way there is for hexadecimal and octal

prepare	execute
also if you look under the hood most db abstraction layers will prepare the query then run it even if you just tell it to execute a static sql statement

537943
put	get
a lot depends on how detailed you want to get - but additional buffer time should be based on a risk assessment - at a task level where you put in various buffer times for

hash	md5
an example for content of userfile.jpg md5 hash is 39f9031a154dc7ba105eb4f76f1a0fd4 and sha-1 hash is 878d8d667721e356bf6646bd2ec21fff50cdd4a9

537989
hash	md5
if this file s content changes but has the same md5 hash before and after is it probable that the sha-1 hash will also stay the same

537990
drive	createfile
i m using the web client service aka webdav redirector webclnt.dll which does a wonderful job of letting the normal createfile read write windows api calls be redirected from their normal drive i o path out to the network via webdav

538003
hash	md5
checking the md5 hash by itself is sufficient for most purposes

538011
hash	md5
md5 is probably safe for what you re doing but there s no reason to continue to use a hash with known flaws

538016
hash	md5
in general if the md5 hash don t match the sha1 or any other similar hash won t match either

538040
hash	md5
because the two hash are calculated differently two files with the same md5 hash are no more likely to have the same sha-1 hash than two random files

min	max
start at either the top or bottom of your convex hull search for coordinate with min or max y and split it into horizontal trapezoids

538074
hash	md5
md5 is considered weak in the sense that it is possible to construct two documents with the same hash with a much lower amount of cpu time needed than it would take for a brute-force search collision resistance of md5 has been broken

hash	md5
but it s not as far as i know weak from the standpoint of if you have an arbitrary document x someone else can create a document y with the same hash with a much easier time than a brute-force search md5 still has preimage resistance

538074
hash	md5
even if md5 is broken in that regard it s improbable that someone can come up with an algorithm to create documents to match an arbitrary md5 hash and an arbritrary sha1 hash

538074
hash	md5
but again if this is just integrity to protect against errors one md5 hash is fine

538116
google-chrome	safari
for safari google-chrome the console methods accept only 1 argument while the firebug console api which is what i m trying to replicate accepts any number of arguments that are printed as a concatenated string

538120
vbscript	vba
to start with vbscript the flavour of vb that scripteditor is aimed at is very different to vba in quite a lot of ways

538132
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary

538152
multibyte	substr
but in case if your string contains multibyte characters non-english characters mb_substr should be used which is a safe multibyte substr function

538236
hash	md5
ignore the time of the error and get an md5 hash of the error message

538236
hash	md5
check to see if that md5 hash is already in your database of errors

538277
min	max
how would i calculate what the pan and tilt values are of the edges min pan value and max tilt with this information

538317
children	parent
rules like a parent object will have up to 2 children could be enforced in database using triggers

538325
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
aggregate-functions like count max min avg sum and others by definition perform their function on a set or group of records so the max arrivaltime needs to be in the form of

538333
jar	war
maybe i am not understanding you correctly but it sounds like that you are putting the classes in a jar or a war before you are trying to refactor

538334
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
tested it on ie7 firefox safari opera and it gives the desired effect

538363
superclass	subclassing
i have heard of conventions where this indicates calling the subclassing s method while an absence of this is calling the superclass s method

538439
photoshop	paint.net
paint.net is a nice graphics package not quite up to photoshop but impressive nonetheless written in c#

538468
gendarme	mono.cecil	gendarme	fxcop
ps for me the best source way of getting some practical il knowledge was reading c# code for some gendarme rules it is an analogue of fxcop that uses mono.cecil to do the code introspection

538480
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
lisp haskell scheme - functional programming

538548
drive	createfile	createfile	deviceiocontrol
this article includes a download in which the author implements createfile and deviceiocontrol to extract drive information through interop services in vb .net

538584
cvs	svn
first of all i think that it goes without saying that if you use an scm repository for such a task use svn instead of cvs

538615
jruby	mri
it seems that jruby and mri have different limits to separate fixnum and bignum

538657
client-side	server-side
i did this for a while but that kind of tight-coupling of server-side and client-side causes problems

538701
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
note that the cache won t work with dependencies that checkout from a source code repository like svn git hg bazaar

538762
ant	maven
i ve tried mavenium ant task selenese and maven plugin to execute my tests

538792
accessor	properties
if you expect to be using copies in this way itâ s likely your properties should be declared copy instead and the synthesized accessor will do the work for you

538797
division	multiplication
adding cards would be multiplication and removing cards division both of large multi-word numbers which are more expensive operations than adding or removing elements from lists

538819
vmware	virtualbox
i m not entirely sure about virtualbox but i ve set up a lot of vmware installations

538819
disk	ram
ram and a disk and probably not much else

538856
children	parent
the problem is i d like to have a tree like structure for nodes instead of simple list so a node can have a parent and n children

538931
vmware	virtualbox
sorry it doesn t really answer your question but i personally chose to use virtualbox instead of vmware partially because of the exact issue you ve run into

538931
vmware	virtualbox
trying to figure out what vmware products i was allowed to use and how i was allowed to use them would have taken more time than getting everything set up in virtualbox did

538940
vmware	esx
vmware esx is not free thus not for you

538955
put	get
this can all be put into an extra layer of looping so you get a new segment and then inside of that go through each row in that segment

539030
stdout	stderr
add to the end of your command to redirect errors from stderr to stdout

539034
width	height
what i want is to generate a copy of a given gif image using the height and width parameters that the user provides

539082
min	max
in almost all circumstances you want to put the min max occurs on the element within a sequence and not on the sequence

539082
min	max
finally if you put the min max occurs on the sequence and you later add an additional element

539155
children	parent
i ve got a task table with the following columns the taskorder is for ordering the children within the scope of the parent not the entire table

539193
gridview	repeater
no databinding no gridview and no repeater

539224
put	get
i was thinking that if i could put a list collection into a gridview then perhaps i could get it right back out

539278
antialiasing	transparent
specifically using drawtext any text that s rendered with antialiasing flags set is rendered as though the background were not transparent

539295
textmate	bbedit
although only the trials are free both bbedit and textmate are excellent text editors and reasonably priced

539295
textmate	bbedit
i like textmate a little bit more but i tend to use bbedit as it has better printing capabilities and i often find myself printing hard copies for reference

539316
width	margin
you need to set the margin of the body to 0 for the table to stretch the full width

539360
subtraction	modulo
you can convert that to hours and remainder by using a combination of modulo and subtraction

539450
vim	emacs
i would also consider trying to learn how to use vim or emacs

539460
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
you can use a static autoresetevent manualresetevent data member in your application class

539488
hash	md5
what i need to do is provide a file browser box on a web page where a user selects a file from their computer and through javascript or flash if necessary some sort of hash is returned such as crc md5 or sha1

539497
put	get
what you d also proabably need to do is put it in a namespace and implement the free function operator overloads and rely on adl for it to get picked up

539501
super	implements
class.getinterfaces will not return the interfaces implements by super classes

539561
public	protected
there s no syntactical way of making a method private public or protected in javascript it strictly relies on where the method is defined scope

539568
inherited	properties
the inherited interfaces define simple data properties like

539584
boost	stl
if you do decide to take a c++ job make sure the shop uses the stl effectively and that they are using boost

539584
boost	stl
not looking at using boost stl but actually using it

539609
rss	feed
each entry in the so rss feed has a category node which contains all of its tags and pipes would allow you to build and or not expressions based on those categories

539609
rss	feed
even if you don t want the pop-up notifications you get with e-mail the pipes solution will let you monitor what you want in an rss feed

539628
allocator	stl
i m trying to write a custom stl allocator that is derived from std allocator but somehow all calls to allocate go to the base class

539631
sorting	filtering
it depends on what you are filtering sorting on and how the table is indexed

539633
sorting	filtering
also if you do the filtering sorting on the client-side then the records would only have to be retrieved once

539717
javadb	hsqldb
it includes javadb built on top of derby hsqldb sqllite

539739
ssl	https
you can enable https in your iis config but it won t be secure unless you acquire an ssl certificate and plug it into iis

539769
implements	extends
you could always extends smtpappender to implements the functionality you need

539801
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side technology and what you describe is mostly a client-side issue

539804
hash	md5
convert the integers to strings separated by commas and hash the resulting string using a common hashing algorithm md5 sha etc

539816
salt	md5
can i use md5 or sha1 or salt

539820
packets	pcap
then fireup tcpdump ethereal wireshark choose your pcap poison and move around do random stuff to find out what packets is doing what

539828
hash	md5
md5 sha1 are used to derive hash that are used to verify that data has not been tampered

539850
hash	md5
to create a hash value using md5 try

539850
hash	md5
hash md5 string to hash

539857
translation	localization
localization it s easier to translation text than images

539944
listview	gridview
i have a listview gridview that has a list of clients

539987
chgrp	chmod
eventually you ll want to extend the script so you can pass through chmod and chgrp commands

539988
installation	downgrade
downgrade your installation of xampp to the previous version and the bug is fixed

540045
expression-blend	silverlight
to get design control over your silverlight 2 xaml you need to install expression-blend 2

540045
button	checkbox
once the asset library is open a good tip if you can t find the control you are looking for you mention you cannot find the button control in expression blend 2 is to type it s name in the search area at the top left or click the show all... checkbox as shown above

540045
expression-blend	silverlight
this blog post is a good place to start for a first look at using expression-blend with silverlight 2 with plenty of screenshots

540045
expression-blend	silverlight
there are also some follow up videos to that blog post called introducing blend to silverlight developers and silverlight programming and expression-blend that you can watch

540123
haskell	ocaml
edit if you want general information try perusing a bit of haskell or ml family ocaml f# to see how they re used and then form your own decisions

540128
wordpress	joomla
for instance joomla uses an extra xml file that defines each area whereas wordpress uses comments within a page template to inform the system that the php file is a template

540128
wordpress	joomla
i like the joomla approach because you don t have to parse the php file to find the areas but i like the wordpress approach because you don t have an extra xml file associated with every template

540141
basecamp	trello
you really should consider something like trello versionone rally or even basecamp for this

540208
database-normalization	denormalization
database-normalization and denormalization are at the heart of this trade off

540316
firefox	safari
although the gradient without the image is only working in firefox and safari

540319
subclass	abstract-class
this seems like a bad use for enums - why not just go with a base abstract-class with a new subclass for each operation

540329
ubuntu	debian
get your apache up and running and try do configure it like debian and ubuntu do it eg have directories for loaded modules

540349
hide	show
using jquery i want to show hide the rollover image when the onmousemove onmouseout event happen

540373
postgresql	mysql
you might like to look at the chapters in the mysql manual and postgresql manual on indexing

540375
wxpython	pythoncard
ive never used pythoncard but in pure wxpython you can just put a scrolledwindow inside the frame then use a sizer to controll the scrollbars asumming the contents of the sizer dont fit in the window

540391
firefox	safari
actions 1 2 works in in firefox but not in safari and ie 6 7

540393
vb.net	vb6
well the vb.net has some stuff for backward compatibility with vb6 but you can access the moste of it from c# if you add a reference to the right assembly

540452
mouseleave	mouseenter
consider using a textblock and adding each word as it s own inline or then either bind to the inline s ismousedirectlyover property our add delegates to the mouseenter mouseleave events

540468
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
the advantage to have a multiplatform application is that our customers sometimes have knowledge in linux sometimes in solaris sometimes in freebsd .

540515
inherited	subclassing
however the above breaks when i subclassing foo since even tho init is inherited it still returns which contains a pointer to instance of foo

540543
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation	nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
nsinvocationoperation objects can be added to an nsoperationqueue just like nsoperation so that you get multi-threading without having to subclass

540561
disk	ram
getting your software use less resources run faster be smaller use less ram less hard disk space both when running and when storing documents less network access .

540658
vsto	add-in
is there a way round this without switching to vsto com add-in etc

540684
folder	directory
i pull of my source from tfs into my vs projects folder and it doesn t take this app long to search all sub directory and it always seems to find what i need

540768
x86	64bit
i am only really focussed on linux x86 and 64bit and the mac which is important if you are building on a powerpc due to endian issues

540784
bazaar	git
it isn t clear to me how to support this work flow well with git or mercurial or bazaar

540832
children	parent
two combo boxes on a winforms form the first has a list of parent categories the second is children of the parent the child list changes contents depending on the selection in the parent

540832
children	parent
this also works fine and as soon as i change the parent selection the presenter changes the list children on the dto and the values shown in cbochildren changes fantastic i hear you cry and i did myself

540842
ubuntu	debian
which works on at least debian and ubuntu and since it s lsb it should surely be on most of the other mainstream distros at least

540846
ssl	https
recently i ve set up the clearcase remote client an eclipse plugin to work through ssl so instead of an http url it follows an https url

540847
pull	push
thus checkout clone push pull for git users will be fast

540903
client-side	server-side
gwt provides client-side and server-side components

540907
vmware	esx
i have a vmware esx server

540974
easymock	jmock
use mocks easymock is one of the best mock frameworks or you could use jmock if you like the name better

540977
gridview	detailsview
and changed autogeneratecolumns to false in gridview and autogeneraterows to false detailsview

541034
junit	easymock
once you have small components it s pretty easy to test them with junit easymock or any other standard test utilities

541054
folder	directory
at work we use code igniter as a php framework for our web applications and have created a new project template which does exactly that simple directory structure blueprint css jquery and the code igniter application folder filled with a couple of commonly used libraries authentication some speciales models for often used databases...

541098
post	put
because the code was a bit too much to put in a post i moved it to github as a gist

541147
public	protected
it s pointless to test your private and protected methods since those will be consumed by public methods that you should test in your subclasses

541147
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
whenever you re testing a subclassing of your base class have your test class inherited from your test superclass

541179
equals	gethashcode
you should override the equals and gethashcode method in order to implement your own equality comparission

541179
equals	gethashcode
as you have pointed out they have to be same type cause if not it would fail on compile-time but i would insist that it might be convenient to implement your own equals and gethashcode functions

541179
equals	gethashcode
that s because .net internally uses gethashcode and equals methods from object

541203
put	get
if i try to add a user to that group i get the access denied page but the user is not put in the group

541205
hide	show
i need to produce letters that hide and show sections paragraphs based on formulae but the users want to be able to edit the text

541222
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
you have to implement the uipickerviewdatasource and uipickerviewdelegate protocols to get data into your picker and know when the user makes a selection

541258
tripledes	aes
in that case use any decent symmetrical encryption algorithm you can such as tripledes or aes or blowfish

541260
hash	salt
you hash the password when the user first creates it preferably hashing with a salt value and store the resulting hash value

541260
hash	salt
to check that a users password is correct you simply ask the user for the plain-text password hash their input again and compare the resulting hash value with the hash value you have stored taking salt into account of course

541278
subtract	add
datetime.today holds today s date from which you can subtract 1 day add -1 days to become yesterday

541305
inherited	properties
everything from the prototype is inherited including the constructor properties

541329
typedef	struct
a stack frame is held in a struct typedef d to pyframeobject which is defined in frameobject.h

541329
versioning	upgrade
versioning and upgrade of workflows

541334
base	fractions
automated testing is not possible and can only be applied to a small fractions of the code base

541348
accessor	properties
this can also be used on accessor properties and events

541349
hide	show
yes the entity framework hide foreign key id properties and show navigation properties instead

541361
vsto	add-in
i think compared with the alternatives ie constantly rebuilding excel workbook files it d be much less hassle to move over to vsto or com add-in using vba for light prototyping work

541363
put	get
to do that you have to associate each key with a set of values with corresponding logic to create the set and enter remove values from it instead of simple put and get on the map

541372
width	height
from what i can tell in xamlpad the problem appears to be that your canvas does not have an explicit height width and that its horizontalalignment defaults to being in the middle of the border

541372
width	height
without an explicit height and width the border appears to collapse to 0 height and stretches on the width

541372
width	height
your best bet is to give the canvas an explicit height and width

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
typically xsl-fo is generated using xslt and then the transformation result is passed to a formatting objects processor such as fop

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
in some cases xslt at least not 1.0 is not enough if your xsl-fo document is very complex

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
in some cases maybe xslt is not right for the job you could then consider using code to generate xsl-fo

541454
put	get
now that the level of indent becomes meaningful you no longer have to rely on balancing parenthesis to get that information and since it s more compact to put them on the same line as the closing statement that s what lispers do

541456
width	height
var popup window.open popup height 400px width 400px

541500
implements	extends
i m not an expert but i can think of one reason to implements runnable instead of extends thread java only supports single inheritance so you can only extends one class

541506
implements	extends
in practical terms it means you can implements runnable and extends from another class as well

541517
udp	tcp
specifically what are some good tools for viewing data and not tcp udp header information

541549
migrate	upgrade
each upgrade is specified in php code which will change the database schema and migrate all existing data

541609
pull	push
then every time it was called it would check what state it was in and process i o accordingly push bits onto output pins pull up a line etc

541640
stateless	stateful
what you want is to open a session with the client stateful soap instead of stateless

541758
width	height
setting height and width to 100 does not size the image to its actual size

541758
width	height
it sets height and width to approximately 1.04 inches which skews the image

541758
width	height
leaving off the height and width has the same effect

541758
width	height
setting height and width to auto has the same effect

541758
button	checkbox	width	height
most annoyingly if i open the generated document in word 2003 right click on the image open the format picture dialog and go to the size tab it display the correct height and width under original size. it even provides a reset button that resizes the image to its original size assuming the relative to original picture size checkbox is checked.

541871
profiler	yourkit
i use yourkit java profiler which lets you measure this sort of thing and much more but using it s own format rather than analysing the log

541875
int	chars
you d then map that random number or a series of random numbers to a chars possibly by casting the int to a chars and repeat that until you have a string of chars long enough

541881
qwebview	pyqt
i haven t used qt-jambi but if it is anything like qt in c++ or pyqt the qwebview would resize automatically as the window size changes

541938
post	get
problem solved it was in the .js file it was pointing to post and should have been get

541964
spaces	linefeed
the pre tag in html marks the text as preformatted and all linefeed and spaces will appear exactly as you type them

542010
dictionary	map
you can use a dictionary or hash map if you are coding in java it s called table driven development by steve mcconnell

542075
for-loop	loops
a for-loop is merely a nice convention - a for-loop is easily decomposed as a while loops

542102
submit	submission
in your handler function you can determine the submission element simply by inspecting the event target s name and if you need access to the form s information or other elements you can get this from the submit elements form attribute

542176
post	get
my guess is that the issue you are experiencing is due to the fact like others have advised that you are doing a get request instead of a post request

542189
ssl	https
also this example does not work properly over an https ssl connection tcp 443 by default because the telnet client cannot negotiate the necessary encryption commands to establish the ssl session

542189
ssl	https
although an initial connection is possible over the https ssl port no data is returned when you issue a get request.

542192
processors	hyperthreading
robin day is probably right however if you are using a processors that supports hyperthreading you may get a performance benefit by turning this off in the bios

542192
affinity	processors
has not a got processors affinity set

542211
rss	feed
from a windows command line i d like to be able to publish to an rss feed

542234
awt	swing
which java framework awt or swing makes more sense for something this simple

542252
awt	swing	swt	swing
use swing or swt since awt has no tabs built in

542257
ssl	https
the telnet client is not going to know to send a properly constructed request to initiate an https handshake so i imagine the ssl secured server is just waiting for more data

542329
google-chrome	firefox
this works in the three browsers i use for testing ie firefox and google-chrome

542387
awt	swing
swing is your best choice if you re stuck choosing between swing and awt

542396
post	get
if i take the attrib out the form post and i get the cf enctype multipart form-data error

542435
rss	feed
we also have some internal rss feed so i want a control to be able to add an rss feed to the page

542442
awt	swing
awt was the first java gui framework it had a lot of flaws and was abandoned in favor of swing

542446
googletest	gmock
gmock which only works with googletest

542537
post	get
you can check out this post with the sample code to download to get you started on how to do it

542550
prepare	execute
for instance in the above query i could prepare the statement once and then loop over creating the data array from a bunch of data and repeat the - execute as many times as needed

542585
inherited	subclassing
the subclassing cannot automatically inherited init so that init would still call the subclassing constructor because init is not a virtual method and is called without an object

542660
np-hard	np-complete
in other words the carrying costs just made our tsp harder so it is still np-hard and can be used to solve any np-complete problem but it did not make it hard enough that we cannot quickly check a proposed solution to the decision problem does this tour cost less than c

542723
post	get
correct but non-working example because google only supports get â sorry i couldn t think of any open post forms off the top of my head

542759
client-side	server-side
again the js library is built the backend is build - so its just a question of should i build out pages and logic using jquery client-side repeaters and such or the more traditional server-side approach

542788
min	max
i would tend to use defined min and max dates instead of nulls

542864
min	max
define min and max constants and let null be null

542934
imperative	declarative
it then goes on to express that functional languages because they are not imperative are declarative by their very nature

542991
matlab	simulink
matlab and simulink are good examples of this

542992
ubuntu	debian
for instance if you re on debian ubuntu you can install a ming win32 cross-compiler by doing

543017
ncover	ndepend
i seem to recall ndepend being able to compare with data from earlier builds so it looks like the combination of ndepend and ncover might do the trick

543027
puts	gets
the trick in get_values starts with the top-level reference gets the next lower level and puts it in the same variable

543029
dictionary	map
basically no you will at least need to have a dictionary or function to map operator characters to their implementations

543048
disk	ram
i use ram tables frequently to avoid any transaction costs and save on disk activity

543069
width	height
stretch to width and height of the stage

543105
filtering	grouping
the situation is this i want one user grouping to have one filtering as default on blogs while another grouping - another filtering without having an effect on filtering defaults for other content types

543107
bazaar	svn
i m working on emulating svn externals in bazaar

543126
telerik	componentart
i d also have a look at many third party grid tools from telerik infragistics componentart componentone devexpress that have a lot more capability than the inbuilt gridview control

543151
collabnet	svn
we re using collabnet svn binary on a windows machine

543163
rss	feed
i m trying to build a simple user template system so that my users can edit the layout of rss feed items and system-generated emails without messing with view files and such

543173
inherited	properties
that is because the content properties of tooltip inherited from contentcontrol and the content properties of a contentcontrol can be any type of object such as a string a uielement or a datetime

543258
stdout	stderr
if you want the actual traceback sent over you need to create a socket channel for both stderr stdin and stdout which goes over the network instead of printing to your local host

543283
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
to the left main-window with a nspopupbutton under the nsmenu

543290
inherited	properties
the most basic differences in this context are that by providing an abstract base class you provide an inherited point for custom plugins written either by you or other developers and ensure that certain methods properties provide default behavior and force the derived classes to implement certain required methods properties

543290
public	protected
you also cannot specify anything other than public members in an interface while an abstract class can have abstract or virtual non-public members typically protected

543300
keydown	keyup
you could trap the enter key in keydown keyup keypressed

543304
children	parent
it seems as though you are accessing children folders through their parent

543327
put	get
the reality is that if you make data hard to get to in the database developers will use other techniques to not put the data in the database or perverting the database

543361
stdout	stderr
including stdin stdout and stderr

543379
vim	textmate
i d like to know how people deal with this in other editors including vim texshop textmate and any others you think would be useful to collect here

543437
width	height
it s also possibly to manually programatically rotate the image in a lossless fashion if certain criteria are true - rotation must be 90 180 degrees and the width height must multiples of the block-size

543448
children	parent
it doesn t allow for an unlimited hierarchy max 10 levels max 1000 children per parent node - if i d started the orderby at 0 but more than enough for my needs

543451
min	max
and looking for any instances where the max and min values returned differ

543520
getter	setter
it also depends on what standard is used in your organization in your application or even on what language you are using if you use a language with getter and setter you can more easily replace member variables at a later time for example

543531
min	max
there may be a third way using nulls for dml statements and then have a trigger change that to a predefined min max value

543566
actionscript	mxml
flex is an mixed open-source proprietary framework + compiler by adobe written in actionscript and an xml based declarative language called mxml used to construct user interfaces in a declarative style

543575
csc	vbc
if you open the config file for nant you can see where it expects the .net version to be go check to make sure it s there and that you can see hte compiler methods csc vbc etc

543581
actionscript	mxml
flex is many things but in short flex is a technology that combines mxml and actionscript and allows you to quickly build rich internet applications for the flash player

543581
actionscript	mxml
good to know is that mxml is compiled down to actionscript so it is perfectly possible to write everything in actionscript and avoid mxml although i wouldn t recommend that in most cases

543582
hide	show
you d attach a handler for the log in button s click event that would hide it and show the _chatform instead

543591
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode for anonymous

543605
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux and you

543608
cos	sin
now let s review some sample values for cos and sin

543608
cos	sin
note that calculator.app gives wrong results for cos xï and sin xï

543647
equals	gethashcode
if they are not value types then the type needs provide it s own equals and gethashcode implementations for it to work

543693
versioning	upgrade
to versioning simply deploy the solutions as an upgrade and use powershell to update in your apps as appropriate if you update your versioning number

543693
versioning	upgrade
in a recent upgrade i had to versioning two web parts and then used powershell to loop through all 1 500 my sites removing the old web parts and adding back in the new ones

543714
put	get
since you re opening up a new window this is about as efficient as you re going to get unless you want to put it into a function to shorten it for typing purposes

543730
width	height
and then also set other relevant attributes like the width height background color etc for that

543734
width	height
setting the to block lets it fill the width and you can give it height padding etc

543783
cpu	processors
on a machine with a load less than 1 per core your desktop machine when you re not doing much of anything a cpu bound process will consistently have more that 50 of a processors often more than 90

543800
dictionary	map
it can be treated as an array list vector hash table an implementation of a map dictionary collection stack queue and probably more

543848
outputstream	inputstream
you don t need to fiddle with inputstream and outputstream and so on just to extract a file

543865
rss	feed
rss feed must be paid for by hashcash or captchas

543873
keydown	keyup
rather than trying to stack up the animations you could start an animation on keydown and if at the end of the animation you haven t yet received keyup then start another animation

543905
cvs	svn
the downside is that you cannot assume that students will know how to use cvs svn at the beginning of the semester

543962
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works in ie8+ webkit google-chrome safari seems will work in next opera and firefox

543963
opera	safari
usually ie6 vs everyone else with safari and opera adding their salt

543964
min	max
according to the documentation in mysql the max and min aggregate functions accept a distinct keyword

543964
min	max
distinct is supported for avg count min max group_concat and sum

543965
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works on firefox ie google-chrome safari and opera

543973
versioning	upgrade
have you updated the versioning number and configured the upgrade

544011
width	height
i haven t debugged the app at this level but i m assuming that they have a horizontal stackpanel populated with containers that are fixed to the height and width of the dialog and they slide them in and out with a storyboard

544015
min	max
in the case of min and max this seems meaningless since the result is the same either way

544015
aggregate-functions	sum
but for other aggregate-functions such as count sum and avg the distinct option may affect the result

544065
actionscript	mxml
this framework allows you to use a markup language called mxml to define structure similar to html and a scripting language called actionscript to define behavior similar to javascript

544070
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
sqldatasource or objectdatasource

544116
imperative	declarative
sql is declarative rather than imperative your query is a description of the criteria that your results must meet it is not step-by-step instructions on how to generate those results

544183
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
are fat-clients coming back with the new versions of ie firefox safari and google-chrome

544183
cpu	hyperthreading
how does the latest ms-sql server or oracle or mysql handle using the additional resources of both multi-core and multi-socket if a quad-socket motherboard has quad core cpus in each socket and something like hyperthreading on top there are 32 threads that could run at once which is really different than a single core cpu back in the days

544196
getelementsbyname	each
you can then loop through each checkbox returned by getelementsbyname and mark them checked unchecked

544215
tostring	getter
is there a way to set itemlabel to use tostring s value without having to create a getter

544411
post	get
however if i post the same url into a browser key2 some_other_value i get a small xml snippet like

544436
post	get
therefore you probably should be using a get instead of a post

544441
post	get	post	put	put	get
when you put the information in the address bar that is not the post method that is the get method

544441
put	get
when you put the address in the browser it is using a get

544463
hex	binary
such a person might jailbreak their phone get access to the binary run strings or a hex editor and poke around

544493
postgresql	mysql
very simple question i hope does there exist a tool similar to phpmyadmin when working with a mysql db but for postgresql databases

544493
postgresql	mysql
the reason i m not just googling for a solution is that i am not as familiar with postgresql as i am with mysql and i was hoping that the so community would be able to provide a tool that you have experience working with

544513
post	get
i think you need to use a get request instead of post

544513
post	put
instead of adding post values to your webrequest just put this data in the querystring

544523
post	get
again this is assuming you are actually supposed to be post ing to the specified page instead of get ing

544528
hide	show
then in the code when i want to hide control 1 and show control 2 i have this

544559
versioning	upgrade
download a clean copy of the wp versioning you are trying to upgrade from the wp release archive

544625
exponent	modulo
a public key contains both a modulo very long number can be 1024bit 2058bit 4096bit and a public key exponent much smaller number usually equals one more than a two to some power

544625
exponent	modulo
the formula to decrypt a signature is message public exponent modulo

544633
free	malloc
for the same reason you can have a malloc without matching free in c it s your responsibility

544648
width	height
just for fun i checked the jquery implementation of height width

544672
int	chars
this was because they erroniously used an unsigned chars for the fd field in their struct file implementation instead of an int

544691
emacs	aquamacs
if you re an emacs fan try aquamacs an aqua-style version of emacs

544691
emacs	aquamacs
i use it because i don t have to learn the weird emacs command to quit or save - aquamacs uses traditional mac hotkeys for quit save open new

544703
int	chars
int fileno file stream returns the file descriptor for a file file fdopen int fildes const chars mode creates a file from a file descriptor

544773
cpu	processors
given the frustration i have with a two core machine and seeing high cpu usage i think my blood pressure would rise less on a 4 processors box.

544789
postgresql	mysql
navicat for postgresql is an easy one to use simple administrative tool very similar to the mysql one

544795
children	parent
for reference the naive approach i m referring to could be summarized as select all items with no parent then for each item recursively get it s children

544795
children	parent
traverse the array and assign a reference from the parent object to each of it s children

544805
filtering	grouping
findstr does have some regex support but it is pretty weak no grouping or alternation especially so if you want to filtering out multiple response codes using findstr you would have to chain them eg to also filtering out auth failures

544840
put	get
however if i put the in a hash i get the same syntax error you got with print

544898
northwind	adventureworks
what are your strategies best practices when it comes to dealing with a reasonably sized sql server database anything larger than northwind or adventureworks - do you use multiple filegroups

544918
post	get
maybe some component where the request passes through php webserver firewall ... gets confused that you use a post request with get parameters

544939
rss	feed
of course do this for rss feed as well

544946
ubuntu	linux
i ve managed to build a .so .dylib and .dll for linux macos and windows respectively but to do so i had to have a machine running each operating system in my case running linux ubuntu gcc natively and windows mingw and macos xcode gcc in virtual machines

544949
mbunit	nunit
test these libraries using nunit mbunit or the likes

544949
cassini	iis
if you have doubts if something runs on cassini but not in iis

544978
for-loop	arrays
just use a for-loop that moves over the arrays in sizeof int chunks

545014
vsto	add-in
in the windows forms project i can create an excel instance and make it visible and verify that my vsto add-in is running as i can see the button and it works

545020
int	double
in either of these cases you ll need to byte-swap all numbers that are bigger than 1 byte shorts int longs double etc

545020
int	chars
b based on your question it sounds like you have a chars pointer and want to extract the first 4 bytes as an int and then deal with any endian issues

545024
mouseover	mouseout
now i have attached mouseover and mouseout event for programinfo class using jquery

545024
mousemove	mouseout
what i want is to change the border color of inside table containing class tblprogram on mousemove and mouseout

545024
mousemove	mouseevent
my mousemove and mouseevent are

545024
width	height
also i want to change the width and height of upper table through jquery

545081
integer	unsigned	pthreads	usleep
in old-school pthreads you could use the usleep function which accepts the number of microseconds to sleep as an unsigned integer argument

545081
gentoo	linux
for newer posix-style programs my gentoo linux box man pages says it s posix.1-2001 you d use nanosleep which requires a pointer to a structure holding the period to sleep

545126
fortran	ada
the glut library has both c c++ same as c fortran and ada programming bindings

545150
decoder	encoder
i need to get the wm picture field inside a wma file that i decoder using wm encoder and c#

545154
maven	pom.xml
so when you reference the parent pom.xml you re getting the published parent artifact from your local maven repository

545157
cvs	svn
for someone coming from a more conventional vcs background cvs svn what are the most compelling reasons to learn and migrate to git

545170
cvs	svn
i know that it supports migration from cvs svn

545170
cvs	svn
the best part is that you can still maintain a cvs svn style workflow should you want to

545187
uilabel	nsstring
i am thinking about a work-around applying a transform to the uilabel to make a y-axis symmetry but how can i detect if a nsstring contains a rtl string

545194
junit	powermockito
i have a problematic situation with some quite advanced unit tests using powermockito for mocking and junit 4.5

545195
put	get
keep in mind you can put xml in sql server and query it using xpath so depending on the shape of your data you may be able to get the best of both worlds

545240
profiler	yourkit
i personally would have every developer have a copy of yourkit java profiler it s cheap and effective and know how to use it

545250
dreamweaver	aptana
the combination with dreamweaver of the occasional wysiwyg edit invaluable i find when laying things out or making macro layout changes and the one click preview has kept me with it despite looking at better tools - aptana netbeans etc

545254
merb	ruby-on-rails
in what situations would you recommend using sinatra instead of ruby-on-rails or merb

545273
nsstring	nsobject
note that because we are dealing with an nsstring which is an nsobject derived class we use the retain option to ensure the reference counts are correctly updated

545362
gridview	detailsview
you can hook up the gridview and detailsview and use basic sql scripting or complex business objects along with detailsview

545364
pop-up	dialog
i have seen ctrl+n pop-up the connect to server dialog in some screens but when i am in a query window already and hit ctrl+n it just opens up another query window

545375
openrowset	openquery
you have the choice of creating a linked server and use with openquery or use openrowset

545387
folder	directory
edit to clarify my files are at multiple levels in a directory tree they re not all sitting in the same root folder

545467
g++	gcc
to install gcc g++ and other utilities like make in one step you can install build-essential meta-package

545497
portrait	landscape
when a user moves their iphone my views switch appropriately between portrait and landscape mode with no problem using the following code

545497
portrait	landscape
the problem is if they press a button that takes them to another screen after the rotating to landscape then the next screen goes back to portrait mode and the status bar correctly remains in landscape mode

545526
pop-up	dialog
both will pop-up the connect to database engine dialog box

545526
openrowset	openquery
if your wanting to write some tsql between servers then you ll need to create a linked server and then use openquery or openrowset in your sql

545562
accessor	properties
that is the base class provides a virtual properties with only a get accessor but the child class overrides the get and also provides a set

545586
public	protected
unfortunately you can not even override and change the accessor level from protected to public for example as documented on msdn

545589
inherited	base-class
and either way you need to be careful not to break polymorphism and inherited what if the base-class talks to the private field

545589
accessor	base-class
so if the accessor in the base-class was protected

545601
implements	extends
the disadvantage would be reactions like yeah great but i just need to know what class i need to extends to implements this controller.

545635
put	get
the complication comes if you talk to multiple instances and partition your data ie split it across different instances then your clients need to know which instance to get the data from or put the data into

545637
put	get
- knows where to get new preferences and where to put them

545637
pop-up	dialog
view.askforprefs - pop-up a dialog box retvals stored in the view as a state change

545653
disk	ram
but my understanding is that the disk boot rom should go in the last 256 bytes of ram

545697
int	double
perfectly valid code if a little unconventional but in the above i know that bbb is a double despite the initializing value appearing to be an int but aaa will definitely not be a double but rather an int

545706
yacc	bison
tools like bison or yacc can help with the generation of a parser from such a grammar and make it quite trivial to produce an interpreter

545730
ant	maven
i used to be a java developer and we used tools like ant or maven to manage our development testing uat environments in a standardized way

545744
sprint	roadmap
on your first sprint you have to estimate at least 80 of the backlog items i m assuming the product owner already had it prioritized to build a reasonable project roadmap which will consist of stories grouped in sprint and a initial estimated projection of the project length

545744
sprint	roadmap
on the following sprint this roadmap will be revised over and over at the start of each sprint adjusting the velocity to the actual velocity that the team is obtaining and re-calculating the project length as needed

545744
sprint	roadmap
so basically these are the 2 types of estimation you should be doing at the start of each sprint where usually the 1st sprint requires a little more effort to build the initial project roadmap

545755
iboutlet	ibaction
change iboutlet to ibaction

545758
stdout	stderr
edit you can always read stdout stderr and return code of the process using p.getoutputstream p.geterrorstream

545778
stateless	stateful
the whole idea of session is to make stateful applications using stateless protocol http and dumb client web browser by maintaining the state on server s side

545817
vbscript	jscript
why are you btw doing this in vbscript if the rest of your code is in jscript

545819
getter	setter
humans say this is a getter and this is a setter but tools don t

545900
vim	emacs
i m 28 and switched from vim to emacs a month or so ago

545912
bazaar	git
bazaar mercurial or git for version control

545925
jrails	ujs
if you d like to keep using helpers with jquery then take a look at a jrails but if you do that you ll still be violating the ujs premise

545932
hash	md5
tfs does this by comparing md5 hash of the files contents before and after check-in

546099
switching	screens
especially if you have multiple screens the user could switching between

546147
maven	cargo
for that it s easier to use the maven cargo plugin it can re deploy your ear to a running j2ee server

546245
min	max
those five are avg count max min and sum

546250
integer	unsigned
use boost lexical_cast to perform a lexical translation from strobj to either a signed or unsigned integer of largest width unsigned long long or something similar

546255
min	max
i mean that min should be on top and max on x-axis

546271
post	get
it will allow you to create post and get data and serve to communicate relatively well

546309
filtering	grouping
chart properties - data tab - series grouping edit - filtering - add the appropriate filtering to remove series that you don t care about

546314
gridview	repeater
i have found out that the repeater doesn t have a dom which can be used to do client side operations like adding of rows and stuff the only easy way out due to some constraints i had was to use the gridview control instead and then use its dom and that s what i finally did

546316
vbscript	jscript
try to do what you want to do in a cmd-file it that doesn t cut it use windows scripting host to call a wsh-file with jscript and or vbscript in it

546316
vbscript	jscript
if you prefer the jscript-look use that as your primary language and use vbscript for things you copy from the net or cannot find a jscript solution to

546316
vbscript	jscript
you can call vbscript from jscript and the other way around

546367
opera	safari
anyway i discovert that s it s not even working in opera and safari but the whole thing ajax control toolkit - modal popup extender

546367
google-chrome	firefox
in my case i wanna make it works at least in firefox and google-chrome too

546450
post	get
you could take a look at aspect orientated programming and cross cutting concerns - there may be an aop solution to this some googling will get you started then post back here for details

546470
strtol	atoi
specifically this talks about the function strtol string-to-long which is basically atoi with error checking and capability to work with other bases hex for example

546498
inherited	properties
it will only take methods and properties on class2 and not inherited ones otherwise you would get all public methods all the way down to your base class

546573
vsto	add-in
i created a outlook add-in using vsto 2008

546573
vsto	add-in
instead vsto automatically create the add-in button in the built-in ribbon when outlook starts

546599
filesystems	ntfs
the windows filesystems ntfs works much the same way but the high level api is different

546608
int	chars	int	boolean
in a database i use throughout several projects there is a field that should actually be a boolean but is for reasons nobody can explain to me a field duplicated over two tables where one time it is a chars y n and one time an int 1 0

546629
sorting	filtering
sql is specialized code well-suited to manipulating sets of data such as sorting filtering and joining

546629
client-side	server-side
for this answer i ll use the term server-side to refer to sql code and client-side to refer to everything written in a different more general purpose language

546629
client-side	server-side
so i prefer to write client-side code rather than server-side code unless i have a compelling reason to do otherwise

546629
sorting	filtering
joining filtering and sorting data almost always belong in sql because the database will do that faster and easier than you can do on the client side

546681
g++	gcc
the other thing to do is turn on your compiler warnings - if you are using gcc g++ the option is -wall

546686
post	get
using the msxml.xmlhttp-object to first do a post to login and then add the cookie-headers to a get request

546736
liferay	web-inf
c liferay webapps root web-inf classes

546749
width	height
the problem wasn t so much from having the iframe on the page it was because i had set the zone to be 100 width and height

546770
children	parent
unless you restrict the children that are loaded by default using the method you linked to you ll have to load the parent in one query and the children in another

546772
ant	maven
at my company we decided to use ant for all new project and try to port maven 1 and 2 to ant whenever the occasion presents itself

546871
qgraphicsscene	qwidget	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicswidget
i spent some time this weekend with qt and have discovered qgraphicsscene class - which seems to be the fundamental class for qt s 2d retained type graphics mode - and qgraphicswidget which allows some auto-layout functionality of the qwidget class

546984
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
runs fine against the following on firefox ie safari opera and google-chrome

546987
union	distinct
the distinct is superfluous because the union will not return rows that are identical for all columns

547064
children	parent
each has a single parent and zero or more children

547064
children	parent
ado.net entity framework object with parent and children

547064
profiling	debugging
i m monitoring the sql server profiling while i debugging my application

547067
jobs	cron
cron jobs are nice but a database should be able to survive if a script doesn t execute at a specific time

547111
subtract	add
in this case i ve defined this made up moxy method to subtract 2 from the integer if it s zero and add two if it s nonzero

547160
queue	fifo
queue enables fifo implementation without you having to do it yourself

547172
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
i am trying to create a subclass of certain .net controls label panel that will pass through certain mouse events mousedown mousemove mouseup to its parent control or alternatively to the top-level form

547185
public	protected
you need to write a public protected method in your base class which will raise the event for you

547195
children	parent
ideally we would model scopes as having parent children etc

547222
post	get
the update edit and delete actions post data from a form to the server while the cancel and list actions are can be handled by appropriate get requests

547222
submit	submission
in order to get the form submission to work in the absence of javascript i think i must use submit buttons

547222
post	get
on the get url when the request is submitted as a post when javascript is turned off

547240
folder	directory
hdf5 groups are analogous to folder directory except that folder directory are hierarchical a unique path describes each one s location in filesystems w o hard links at least whereas groups form a directed graph which can include cycles

547241
reentrant	readerwriterlockslim
the .net framework s readerwriterlockslim will dramatically improve your performance in many cases over the lock statement while being reentrant

547261
firefox	safari
i don t have any way to test in ie 6 the this works in safari and should in firefox

547268
vbscript	jscript
it can generate lots of admin scripts in vbscript perl javascript jscript and python

547278
many-to-many	one-to-many
it also cannot model one-to-many many-to-many relationship but with creative uses of union it could be made to work

547289
merb	ruby-on-rails
i ve used several languages and frameworks as well from .net both mvc and webforms classic asp ruby-on-rails merb and django

547295
getter	setter
inotifypropertychanged when used also gives you the ability to add more logic in the code of your getter and setter of your properties

547295
getter	setter
in your getter and setter --- all you can do is simply call setvalue and getvalue respectively b c in other parts of the framework the getter setter is not called instead it directly calls setvalue getvalue so your property logic wouldnt reliably be executed

547295
getter	setter
this could be in a getter setter or anywhere else

547300
put	get
a good place to put the logic to get the next route is probably the movenext of your iterator

547337
.htaccess	httpd.conf
to permit ssi on your server you must have the following directive either in your httpd.conf file or in a .htaccess

547376
apache	lighttpd
is apache iis lighttpd etc. running

547383
superclass	subclassing
subclassing is an option you don t loose the designer as long as you don t set the superclass as mustinherit it doesn t really like that

547389
g++	gcc
well it s not a complete answer but the gcc manual mentions that g++ can sometimes place empty base classes at the wrong offset

547441
imagemagick	mogrify
imagemagick s mogrify convert commands will indeed do the job

547453
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you are just loading subviews as above you can construct them in the same xib or build them programatically in viewdidload or viewwillappear which will be called after the xib is loaded with your basic view

547457
pop-up	dialog
inherited an app with a page that has a link that calls the javascript function addvalueclick when i do this a dialog box pop-up i type in some text and then the text gets put in the select box

547511
win64	windows
check the windows event log application and system and check the httperr log file in c windows system32 logfiles httperr folder may be different location on win64

547620
sorting	grouping
the grouping by order by was probably causing it to save an intermediate data set as a temporary table and sorting it on disk which is very slow

547632
put	get
you could use this to get the count and put as the first row

547659
inherited	properties
in the upcoming release of asp.net web forms with .net 4.0 this will be a settable properties using a number of different methods such as static inherited etc.

547662
innodb	myisam
any table that didn t need transactions could be set up as myisam instead of innodb

547680
width	height
i m guessing you re running into trouble when your target height is not an exact multiple of the original rectangle height or the same for the width

547682
width	height
try a width height combination which do not have even multiples prime numbers .

547690
integer	unsigned
similarly you can specify an integer to be unsigned by adding a u or a long by l lowercase ell etc

547722
getter	setter
btw i don t like the getter setter convention that is so commonly used on java i think a using leftchild instead would be better

547747
client-side	server-side
long before there were application servers web servers have been running server-side scripts based on client-side input

547747
client-side	server-side
so the answer to your question is that you can almost certainly run a server-side script based on client-side input

547887
post	get
if you mean they literally initiate a get or post request from their server to yours then john rasch is correct they don t have your authentication cookie

547922
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
i am a haskell newbie though had a previous lisp scheme experience

547962
happy	alex
update deleting the reference in solution explorer an alex suggested did the trick and the project now builds but i m not entirely happy with that as a solution

547989
free	malloc
its garbage collected while allowing you to specifically delete objects when you want to or even eschew the gc all together in favor of malloc free

548033
uitableview	reloaddata
i tried calling reloaddata on the uitableview after changing the uiimage but the uiimage still does not change

548042
ssl	https
that s why it can be very helpful to enable ssl sessions for your https service where many connections are made

548058
int	double
note that switch only works with int primitive types and enums so you do need to use if else statements if you re using other object types and you probably shouldn t be comparing double or floats for equality anyway

548077
maven	pom.xml
for maven 2 i d recommend creating your own custom pom.xml for the dependency that has your exclusions

548101
inherited	subclassing
java and other object oriented languages have polymorphism implemented through inherited subclassing

548116
ant	maven
maven and ant contain a forkmode parameter for running junit tests which specifies whether each test class gets its own jvm or all tests are run in the same jvm

548142
uiapplication	uiwindow
i imagine it is uiapplication but maybe the appdelegate or uiwindow

548154
pem	pkcs#12	pkcs#12	pfx
one way to do this is to convert the jks to a pkcs#12 aka pfx file using keytool and then use openssl to convert the pkcs#12 files into pem private key certificate files

548155
int	double
in printf d is for a signed decimal int whereas cost_unit and total are double

548184
int	chars
chars foo is probably aligned to int boundaries

548187
many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-one	one-to-many
i am not understanding the difference between them and not sure about when to use what in one-to-many many-to-one many-to-many relationships

548202
many-to-many	one-to-many
collection mapping refers to a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship which will be mapped by using an implementation of java.util.collection

548248
ssl	https
is there some sort of firewall setup on either the virtual machine or the host machine that might be blocking port 443 https ssl port

548257
children	parent
parent view controllers are responsible for notifying their children of orientation changes

548271
getter	setter
and then there are the setter getter automatically being built

548271
getter	setter
you can create all the variables then right-click in the editor go to source and then pick generate setter getter

548312
int	chars
an int chars constant is a sequence of one or more multibyte chars enclosed in single-quotes as in x

548312
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

548312
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant containing a single chars that maps to a single-byte execution chars is the numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an int

548312
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined

548312
int	chars
if an int chars constant contains a single chars or escape sequence its value is the one that results when an object with type chars whose value is that of the single chars or escape sequence is converted to type int

548312
int	chars
in most implementations it s safe to use int chars constants of up to 4 one-byte chars

548312
int	chars
an int chars constant is a sequence of one or more

548312
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

548312
int	chars
int chars constant containing a single chars that maps

548312
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant containing more

548312
int	chars
bit position of a single-character int chars constant is

548332
disk	ram
up to the point if you can cache the entire db in ram you eliminate the i o at least for reads delay of moving data from the disk to a ram buffer

548336
migrate	upgrade
check out this link for more information it is not for windows but is hopefully still useful - upgrade bdb to 4.4 or migrate to fsfs

548339
put	get
it s best to get the second file from the sqlite website and extract it to the ruby bin directory as you shouldn t manually put dll s into the windows or windows system directories any more

548354
getter	setter
and is there a propertymodel alternative that uses getter and setter by default

548356
int	chars
as already stated those are int declared using chars constants

548356
int	chars
when an int is declared using a chars constant of more than one chars it is sensitive to the byte order of the machine for which the constant was developed

548379
spaces	delimiter
my script allows you to specify multiple characters to print delimiter by spaces

548411
atomic	interlocked
interlocked operations must operate on aligned data to ensure they are atomic on multiprocessor systems see

548422
delphi	oxygene
delphi prism aka rem objects oxygene formerly chrome provides the gc version of delphi that those who need it are looking for along with asp.net and wpf silverlight ce with the readability and lack of curly braces of delphi

548440
post	get
plus those systems tend to have a lot of plugins or built-in functionality that will further encapsulate things like authentication session management post get data etc

548476
hash	salt
firstly its a best practice to hash passwords one way encryption with a salt random string you tag on the end of your password i know it sounds complex but it isn t

548501
jruby	mri
a quick sanity test showed that using your example i would get 2 os threads on mri and 12 when running the same thing under jruby

548501
jruby	mri
this was on os x using mri 1.8.6 and jruby 1.1.6

548526
inherited	properties
i have a user entity and i want to have two additional entities called creator and assigned that inherited from the user entity basically they should just have the same exact properties as the user entity i don t need any additional properties

548526
inherited	properties
the problem is that when i try to associate the inherited entities with another entity - i don t have access to any of the properties from the base entity

548549
public	protected
note that the propertymodel will check private and protected fields in addition to public fields for a match

548549
getter	setter
this way you can force all property accesses to occur through getter and setter

548551
implements	extends
how do i extends implements the irtd stuff

548567
inherited	properties	tstringlist	tlist
i find myself unsure of which route to take when setting up these properties -- using an array properties a tlist a tstringlist a tcollection or something else altogether perhaps a new class that inherited from one of those

548589
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i don t know if ie supports __proto__ or even has an equivalent frome some s comments this looks to only work in firefox and safari based browsers so camino google-chrome etc work as well

548591
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the closest cross browser thing i have come is this tested in firefox ie google-chrome and opera

548620
yacc	bison
the usual version for c is lexx yacc or flex bison and the easiest way to do it is construct a parse tree

548624
yacc	bison
and of course you could compile a full-fledged parser via yacc bison

548630
public	protected
we don t have this problem in c# because there are namespaces and private protected and public keywords to denote visibility

548635
postgresql	mysql
openoffice.org users however can choose to connect to external full-featured sql database such as mysql postgresql and even oracle through odbc or jdbc drivers

548669
folder	directory
why not check the current directory to see if it s a temp folder

548705
lisp	scheme
in lisp scheme a function is thought of a piece of code and examining a function simply means examining its code

548705
lisp	scheme
similarly as in your question in lisp scheme you would write a derive function that differentiates correctly when given expressions and just errors out or returns garbage on arbitrary inputs

548737
profiling	debugging
strange i had to use an entitlements.plist with the get-task-allow checked for debugging profiling and unchecked for distribution profiling for the respective profiling to work

548749
integer	unsigned
16 bit unsigned integer

548751
boost	stl
does it make sense to restrict yourself to the stl libraries when learning c++ and then tackle boost and its additions after you have become fairly proficient with vanilla c++

548761
udp	tcp
the answer points out that tcp + binary serialization or udp + binary

548772
width	height
there s a problem with the constructor - you use width and height before they are assigned

548774
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
strings equal case-sensitive equalp case-insensitive

548779
boost	stl
if there s functionality provided by the stl but not boost concentrate on learning those bits of the stl

548784
postgresql	mysql
mysql can do it and also postgresql

548791
lisp	scheme
lisp are the only ones with a regular syntax at the core and well-defined standards in the case of cl and scheme

548808
width	height
it is customary for data members to be called m_width and m_height and not just width and height

548827
boost	stl
i d suggest getting a clear handle on stl before looking at boost

548827
boost	stl
boost is meant to build on top of stl and many of the libraries are slated to become part of the standard library eventually

548827
boost	stl
boost libraries are generally less mature and less standard than stl

548848
boost	stl
once you re past the basics with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost

548855
postgresql	mysql
it s a cross platform framework on top of wxpython which supports mysql postgresql firebird and sqlite

548859
boost	stl
the principles used to design the stl are built upon and expanded on by the boost libraries

548859
boost	stl
if you don t and boost ends up hard to follow you can go back to the stl to get your bearings

548875
button	checkbox
an alternative to a checkbox in this case could be a togglebutton or normal button control

548921
g++	gcc
and you would have to use ld directly and not gcc g++ to link to avoid linking with the dynamic versions as well

548921
g++	gcc
libstdc++ for that reason is tightly coupled with gcc and code compiled with one version of g++ will in general only work with the libstdc++ from with this or a very similar version of g++

548987
tlbimp	sn.exe
edit the solution with using the tlbimp tool from the sdk works beautifully you just have to remember to give the generated file a strong name by generating a keyfile using the sn.exe tool else the visual studio wont compile the solution

549004
portrait	landscape
going from portrait to landscape

549041
int	chars
the error in ie says that it s expecting the identifactor string or int on 17th row and 4th chars

549085
width	height
in the initialization list the fields constructors for the fields width_ height_ and data_ are called passing a width height and the returned pointer of the new sentence as arguments

549085
int	chars
changing the unsigned int to unsigned chars will reduce the size of the structure to 32 bits instead of the 16 that the fully optimized structure

549118
gnu	uclibc
i assume you checked this and i know that uclibc is intended to be a lightweight but rather full standard c library but do not forget that c++ code is hardly independent on the c library and g++ and libstdc++ depend on quite some delicate things i remember problems with libc on some proprietary unix versions so i would not just assume that g++ or the gnu libstdc++ actually works with uclibc without trying - i don t recall seeing it mentioned in the uclibc pages

549212
ienumerable	icollection
here s a small function i m using to determine if an object is a collection which will be enumerable as well since icollection is also ienumerable

549254
rss	feed
i need to create an rss feed from a sqlite3 database containing blog posts

549254
rss	feed
to create an rss feed would it be easier to use a server-side script in python or to use a windows software tool feedforall to produce the news feed say once a week

549278
boost	stl
but stl can be learned in isolation whereas boost won t make much sense until you understand the stl since that s what boost is modeled on and designed to extend

549285
kde	gnome
then most systems have some other information stored about users like their long or full name which is nicer to read and therefore many user interfaces windows xp mac os and i guess also some newer unix desktop interfaces like gnome and kde display on desktop login choosers messages etc

549294
curry	first-class
some features of note include type inference generators multimethods optional duck typing macros true closures curry and first-class functions

549314
opera	safari
is there a guide on a safe subset of css which can be used across browsers ie6 ie7 ff1 ff2 safari opera

549331
opera	firefox
i recommend developing for firefox opera w3 spec then using conditional comments for ie6 7

549365
ironruby	ironpython
where a dynamic language is more appropriate use ironruby or ironpython

549427
post	get
the idea is that you have your ajax client written in javascript or maybe something else it doesn t matter and then it will call your backend php with post or get data

549427
post	get
what do you send via post get and how do you interpret it in your backend

549437
vim	emacs
i m 17 and i started using emacs when i was 14 and vim when i was 15

549441
hide	show
the better alternative is to place that code in the page load the values based off the id s and show hide it if necessary

549470
accessor	properties
use bind toobject withkeypath options to bind the view s properties to the array controller s arrangedobjects i assume properties and implement array accessor including indexed accessor if you like in the view

549470
sorting	filtering
if so you may need to bind the view directly to the array s content propertyâ or to the original array on the underlying object and suffer the loss of free filtering and sorting

549521
gtk	fltk
recently i had the opportunity to work with both wxwindows and qt while some time ago i wrote some small programs using fltk and gtk

549570
versioning	upgrade
the correct answer now is to ship a single binary and offer your paid versioning through in app upgrade

549572
swt	swing
swt could also be an option but so far i ve been happy with swing

549573
client-side	server-side
they have allowed server-side developers to prototype and build features that otherwise would require someone with real client-side experience to do all without having worry about the quality of the javascript code they write and leaving the real front-end engineers free to focus on the advanced client-side features

549646
decoder	encoder
lodepng is a lib-less png encoder decoder

549649
oncreate	ondestroy
create the class in the oncreate and free it in the ondestroy of the form

549662
postgresql	mysql
for postgresql or mysql you might check out sphinx

549693
google-chrome	firefox
then what s going on that in firefox google-chrome steel android browser and ie 6 the page loads and does not execute anything in schedulegrid.js

549719
redhat	fedora
reasons being that it is a branch off redhat so experience with fedora should help me if i ever switch to development on redhat a common server choice

549737
stdout	stderr
because it will mix the original stdout and stderr

549789
put	get
get a button and a listbox on a form and put this in the button_click

549790
docx	xlsx
office openxml format based files include the new 2007+ xml based file formats including microsoft office files such as xlsx docx and pptx

549817
equals	compareto
equals should also be consistent with compareto though this is not strictly necessary

549840
pseudo-class	visited
first of all if you don t want the browsers own history to interfere with your styles then use the visited pseudo-class to match the style of the non-visited link then just apply classes manually based on your db records

549882
config	ini
legendary windows guru raymond chen described the advantages of xml config files over ini files

549934
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
i think you can implement your own easily using flowlayoutpanel and mouseup mousedown mousemove events of the controls where you change the location property approximately and flowlayoutpanel should handle it

549961
accessor	properties	accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
the list is defined in a superclass but the hibernate annotations are applied to properties accessor in a subclassing

549967
post	get
post get and how do you interpret it

549992
pyexcelerator	xlrd
there are also some utility libraries such as pyexcelerator xlrd and xlwt for python and spreadsheet writeexcel spreadsheet parseexcel for perl

549999
sorting	filtering
i can t give up using an array controller because i need the filtering and sorting and because there s an nstableview bound to the same controller

550002
public	protected
so if you don t export all your class it s usable by client code as far as it don t have any public or protected function definition in a cpp file

550026
uitableview	uisearchbar
i m trying to set up an app with a uitabviewcontroller and one of the tabs will have a uitableview and uisearchbar but no navigation controller

550028
googletest	cppunit
personally i don t think the test framework googletest boost test cppunit etc matters that much

550057
accessor	properties
implement accessor including indexed accessor for the mutable array properties that you ve exposed as a binding

550057
accessor	properties
the other way is to implement accessor in the object with the bindable properties the view

550073
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
also we test our sites in firefox safari ie6 ie7 and opera

550097
versioning	upgrade
keep in mind this is not upgrade proof - you will probably have to do this again if you upgrade your versioning of wp

550129
pdfbox	itext
although i do know about itext pdfbox and various other java pdf libraries i am hoping for a pointer to some working example or some how-to

550157
post	get
assuming you are trying to get just the post data into a fieldstorage object

550209
width	height
for instance the radiator item might have data like condition material weight height width and thickness

550243
cgpoint	cgrect	cgpoint	cgsize	cgsize	cgrect
a cgpoint is a c struct and so are cgrect s and cgsize s

550246
nssearchfield	nstableview
i have a simple cocoa user interface with a list of items and a search field implemented using nstableview and nssearchfield respectively

550275
textile	creole
the easiest way to do what you want is to find an appropriate formatter for some lightweight text format like textile or creole pass that through to generate xhtml and then parse the xhtml using any regular parser

550319
width	height
ignoring the whole ns4 sections of code the above will break in today s browsers as the width and height css rules being applied to the #ref #outer and #inner elements are missing a px quantifier

550322
pull	push
so after much push and pull i m curious..

550341
ubuntu	debian
if the machine doesn t have apt-get then chances are it isn t a debian or ubuntu machine which means that using a tutorial designed for debian or ubuntu is unlikely to get you very far

550365
getter	setter
rather the expectation is that you ll access and mutate properties via getter setter methods

550365
getter	setter
in objective-c 2.0 it s easy to declare these properties and automatically synthesize the getter setter so there s not much excuse for not using them

550365
getter	setter
the reason the ivar should be used directly in these cases is beacuse the getter setter may have side effects that depend on a fully initialized instance thus making them dangerous in -init and -dealloc where the state of the object is fully initialized

550365
getter	setter
prefixing with _ works and is relatively common i believe the synthesize d setter and getter will automatically do the right thing in this case but you may have to explicitly set the _ivar as the backing

550480
width	height
you can now apply additional transformation that will scale the width differently along the height

550564
int	double
but your function matches the second argument by a standard conversion sequence from int to long double integral to floating point conversion

550564
int	chars
it s confusing so here are some examples conversions from chars to int are called promotions which are better than conversions from chars to something other than int which is called a conversion

550564
int	double
even though a standard conversion sequence converting from int float double to long double is better than a user-defined conversion sequence converting from myclass to long double your operator version is not chosen because your other parameter long double requires a conversion from the argument which is worse than what the builtin operator needs for that argument perfect match

550565
int	double
edit you ve updated your question to suggest that your conversion is to long double and your comparison is against an int

550565
int	double
either t s operator long double is called and the built-in operator for long double and int is used or d must be promoted to a long double and your member operator is used

550568
int	double
i assume you are comparing against a literal int and not a long double

550568
int	double
built-in conversion int to long double

550570
filesystems	hfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs+	fat	hfs+
in addition to carbon fsgetvolumeinfo which returns a fsvolumeinfo containing signature and filesystemid fields there is the cocoa -getfilesysteminfoforpath method of class nsworkspace which returns a string representation of filesystems type hfs for hfs+ and msdos for dos fat

550589
hide	show
you can then use the visibility on each element to show hide them

550589
hide	show
setting grid2.visibility to visible hidden will show hide your overlaid content

550629
nsstring	nsdata
i wanna have a nsstring object as nsdata

550636
ndepend	fxcop
a client i work for has begun using ndepend as a replacement for fxcop and the architect has compiled a list of practically unusable cql queries which i gather he has taken from advice from the ndepend website

550643
extjs	mootools
for javascript jquery prototype mootools extjs

550654
dia	visio
i m not after something that will do pretty diagrams that take ages to do btw. like visio dia kudos the the dia developers though kick ass app etc

550677
imperative	declarative
now you can use role-based security either declarative or imperative

550690
division	multiplication
i was thinking if there is a simpler and less expensive considering that this is timing code way to do such scaling than doing the equivalent of iterative 64-bit multiplication and division with two 32-bit integers

550693
libpcap	wireshark
for protocol reverse engineering common tools of the trade include wireshark and libpcap

550710
public	protected
webforms do not offer that convenience however for internal applications or the public ones protected by customer login it is no concern at all

550714
spaces	delimiter
i want to add a text box on a web page in order for users to add spaces delimiter tags

550732
floating-point	fractions
you might wanna read up on floating-point representation as fractions seems to be the first bits of the significand

550732
int	double
you ll need 64-bit int and double floating-point

550735
firefox	safari
full seo compatible supports firefox ie6 and safari and degrades gracefully on other browsers

550767
onkeyup	onkeydown
onkeypress onkeyup or onkeydown check the key that was pressed and if it is a tab then append t to the textbox and return false so that focus remains on the textbox

550792
versioning	upgrade
we have a table that stores the versioning number of the latest patch applied - so upgrade tools can apply any newer patches

550855
profiling	benchmarking
if you really believe that piece of code to be a performance bottleneck profiling or benchmarking it both ways

550901
pull	push
this is the default remote used when you type git fetch or git pull to retrieve new commits into your local repository and the default destination when you git push to push your new local commits out to a remote repository

550934
rss	feed
2. keep up-to-date as best as possible with each apps security updates most have an rss feed

550940
onkeyup	onkeydown
try onkeydown or onkeyup instead

550967
ienumerable	iqueryable
linq reuires only that ienumerable and iqueryable interfaces are implemented

550974
printf	fgets
there are other functions that can help such as printf fscanf fputs and fgets

550979
versioning	upgrade
your best bet is to upgrade to the next versioning of windows7 when it comes out and hope it permanently fixes the issue

550988
cvs	svn
i doubt any generic version control system git svn cvs etc. can handle database in the ways you described

550997
int	chars
switching on a value is fine ok but switch statements are in the majority of cases used to test on a single int chars enum .

550999
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you want to stay within micrsoft s .net world linq is a great technology to learn and not just linq2sql which as you say isn t a full-blown orm anyway as linq can be applied to objects xml and basically anything that s ienumerable iqueryable

551031
pull	push
when a is happy he will git push to push the newly merged changes to the shared repo and b and c can git pull to fetch them

551043
inherited	properties
you can create a single set of project properties vsprops and have multiple configurations inherited from that single set

551043
inherited	properties
when you edit the properties of the configuration you can select for inherited from parent this will set the value to whatever the parent has

551046
folder	directory
we make a complete directory listing all drives and folder to a text file each day

551068
datamapper	activerecord
if what you want is to compare activerecord rails and datamapper hibernate the data source architectural patterns chapter from patterns of enterprise application architecture is a good place to start

551122
int	double
the built-in operator long double int

551126
free	malloc
i believe they simply override the memory allocation and deallocation methods malloc free which has some logic that keeps track of the pointers

551178
typedef	struct
the above link covers commonly encountered issues typedef pointers to struct etc

551180
width	height
a table with the scroll pane cell s width and height set to 100 and all others to 1

551236
domcontentloaded	onload
also greasemonkey executes the script after the domcontentloaded when the dom is ready event so you don t need that onload nonsense

551251
fink	macports
of course if you re not generating the ps yourself then the simple answer is that preview sucks and you should use a better postscript viewer instead install gv through macports or fink or macgsview from here or macghostview or 22 postview

551301
vim	emacs
the difference between emacs and vim is that emacs includes many many features and combines mail news filemanager and of course a text editor

551301
vim	emacs
i personally like vim more but give emacs a try and find the best suitable text editor for you

551310
vim	emacs
these days i use emacs for my serious editing and vim for quick things when i m ssh d into a server

551342
vim	emacs
since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

551342
vim	emacs
your tool of choice can be either vim or emacs or perhaps something else but in any event take the time to learn it well

551385
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it looks fine in firefox google-chrome safari opera even ie 6 alas not ie 5.5 but who cares

551394
vim	emacs
1 in this question emacs could be replaced with vim or any other cross-platform editor

551394
vim	emacs
this for me is the primary benefit of being fluent with emacs or vim

551408
google-chrome	firefox
the typical user there is not an administrator on their machine and can t change browsers say by downloading firefox or google-chrome

551446
width	margin
put another div around everything in the and set your margin and width styles on that div rather than the body itself

551463
uninstall	upgrade
also remember that you d probably have to uninstall upgrade the installed .net runtime or reinstall it

551489
post	get
i have seen this with the web application we are supporting - a stray get request out of the blue for an already logged in user wrecking the server-side state and resulting in an error on the subsequent legitimate post request

551520
rss	feed
if you want your drupal site to periodically retrieve content from other sites rss feed for example check out feedapi

551539
rss	feed
i ve tried rss feed but these always-updating sites that have tons of entries per day just fill up my poor reader

551545
postgresql	mysql
i will be running things like mysql postgresql tomcat and my own code

551573
gentoo	debian
right off the bat i d say the major contenders are debian red hat and gentoo depending on management preferences and needs

551595
disk	ram
the tmpnam command appears to be what i need but from what i can see it saves the file on the disk and not the ram

551595
disk	ram
i would like to avoid using a ram disk method if possible

551595
disk	ram
if i m totally honest i m a linux user so ditching windows wouldn t be too bad i m looking into using ram disk for now as fuse seems a bit overkill for a learning thing

551602
portrait	landscape
the line breaks that are visible in portrait remain the same in landscape

551613
puts	gets
wrote a small app that accesses a bunch of search websites and puts the results in a word document which gets run a few hundred times a day

551634
int	chars
in this example assuming that int is 4 bytes and chars 1 byte and the cpu aligns at 32bit boundaries you need 3 padding bytes after b to get the structure aligned

551634
typedef	struct
as for typedef around struct you can even use the same name for the typedef and the struct something like this

551634
typedef	struct
from my point of view typdef-ing a structure is a bad idea as that hides the information that the typedef like foo is a structure and writing the keyword struct isn t really additional work especially if those typedef get a postfix added to indicate them being a structure -- i ve seen this quite often

551652
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in google-chrome firefox and ie7 but none work

551660
vim	emacs
if use now use and like an ide and you are already familiar with vi vim then don t give emacs a second thought

551660
vim	emacs
emacs will never replace your ide and if it could then vim would do you just fine

551669
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
strictly speaking there are possibilities to do real ajax file uploads but this is only possible in firefox 3+ safari 4 and google-chrome 2

551709
ant	maven
this will put the desired jdk first in the path and any secondary tools like ant or maven can use the java_home variable

551711
post	get
i could then sort this table based on data of replies to get the start to last post

551720
cvs	rcs
it will make rsync ignore files that the rcs program cvs ignores not just .cvs directories

551762
post	get
but to get the whole thread you also need to have some sort of path or sequence column that presents the post in a logical order

551762
post	put
for that reason i would put it in another table - with a 1 1 relationship to the post table

551764
ssl	https
for https this works fine except that if you have a web server which supports ssl session caching then the ssl session cache will be lost if the client comes back to a different server

551771
cpu	processors
just using the stopwatch class won t work and having a look at the process processors time doesn t respect the fact that the cpu time could have been consumed on another node

551778
firefox	safari
the css active link style is being correctly applied in ie7 firefox and safari but is not applied ie6

551824
multiplying	subtract
also generally speaking you shouldn t multiplying or divide by variables adding and subtract is fine though when you move them to the other side of the equation because you ll generally forget of about the condition where the term you multiplied or divided by is zero

551875
required	placeholder
if you need even more fine-grained positioning then you need to put a placeholder or div or span etc on your page in the required position and add your control to that as in scarletgarden s answer

551877
vmware	virtualbox
if virtual machines will work for you you can choose between virtual pc vmware and virtualbox

551877
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox supports same hosts and guests as vmware

551927
getattr	subclassing
my best guess is that the c++ getattr method should check which will of course be the subclassing dict if this an instance of the subclassing and only call getattr_methods if you fail to find name in there see the pydict_ api functions

551965
folder	directory
for this i need to switch off the normal mapping of url paths to directory folder in apache all requests to all paths should go to one central script pages.php which than analyzes the path component of the url

551970
post	get	post	put	put	get
all resources can be manipulated through a constrained set of well-known actions usually crud create read update delete represented most often through the http s post get put and delete

551970
put	get
it can be a different set or a subset though - for example some implementations limit that set to read and modify only get and put for example

551976
post	get
to contrast a non-restful api might use many more urls and only use the get and post actions

551976
post	get
you ll note how in this case the urls are different and the methods are chosen only out of technical necessity to send data you must use a post while all other requests use get

551990
post	get
what i d like is to get a tabulated list of all my controllers my actions show whether they respond to get or post what their cache settings are etc

552065
pop-up	dialog
and the site requires either a cookie from a previous logon or a response to a pop-up dialog

552113
post	get
you might want to use the post method rather than get with the login form otherwise their password will appear in the url and urls aren t very secure they might get bookmarked or sent to another server as a referral url for example

552123
entity-relationship	diagram
i use omni graffle for entity-relationship or class diagram and graphviz for showing flow charts state diagram really

552148
pull	push
what you probably should do is look up the various git workflow questions and answers - they describe the means by which various team members pull push from to each other

552149
getter	setter
in the second project the code is identical but the first thing that is called is the setter for the selectedsubscription property it is null then the getter for the subscriptions collection is called and finally the setter for the selectedsubscription is called a second time and it has a value that matches the first item in the subscriptions collection

552162
google-chrome	firefox
and yeah that means it gets flagged in say firefox or google-chrome for a partially invalid ssl certificate

552210
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
there are lots of gotchas which are browser defendant and that you may not see unless you check in ie firefox safari opera etc

552240
fadein	fadeout
for instance when you re doing a callback after an animation or a fadein or fadeout

552241
unsigned	short
c1 is unsigned int src is unsigned short

552268
temp	tmp
php session data is stored in the os tmp temp directory by default so the data could be viewed by others

552284
opera	firefox
html5 provides window.postmessage which provides a mechanism for safe cross domain messaging and is supported by firefox 3 opera 9.6 and webkit nightlies

552292
width	margin
if you want to fix up the logo see top right then add an extra container div immediately inside the wrapper and apply the above width margin to the container as suggested by jonathan sampson.

552295
int	chars
int foo float chars chars

552385
stdout	stderr
or use proc_open which gives you much more control than popen as you can specify where you want stdin stdout and stderr to be handled

552390
hex	binary
when trying to determine the content of binary data string use repr or hex

552397
width	height
i want to keep the width but the height should adjust automatically

552412
kerberos	ldap
apache can hook into ldap most any type of sql server or even use kerberos authentication

552415
post	get
in the window.onbeforeunload event is there a way to detect if the new request is a post on the same page or a get going to a page

552446
int	double
suppose i have a takeintreturndoublearray method in this c# library that takes an int and returns an array of double

552446
int	double
all i need to do is have a c++ method that takes an int calls the c# library and returns an array of double to the calling application

552474
lisp	scheme
in a functional style data and functions tend toward having more in common with each other as in lisp and scheme while offering more flexibility in terms of how functions are actually used

552479
avr	microcontroller
it uses a pic microcontroller but my personal favourite is avr

552486
getter	setter
you can certainly observe readonly properties but be aware that in order for kvo to work you need to be kvc compliant - which means using either the setter getter for a property since you re readonly you don t get a setter for free via synthesize or the property s -setvalue forkey method

552496
clang	llvm
the features in question require both compiler and runtime support and so while it is certainly possible to build a compiler that supports the syntax llvm clang comes to mind many of these features call out to the objective-c runtime and to my knowledge and quick double checking on google the gnu runtime doesn t have the necessary support

552506
width	height
if you want to get the image dimensions width and height with out loading the image you need to read some part of jpeg file yourself as below

552509
g++	gcc
my question is can i call the apparently already configured gcc g++ in the iphone developer package which i already have installed like in the latter article

552509
g++	gcc
can i call them like normal or do i need to specify it s path because i m not calling the default gcc g++

552609
width	height
which will extend the height of your textfield but not width as the multiline has been set to true

552734
ironruby	ironpython
both languages will have some level of broken backward compatibility in their next majopr releases both have .net implementations ironpython is production ironruby getting there

552749
post	get
i m trying to log all exceptions to a sql server database through log4net and i ve seen some post here explaining how to properly configure the web.config file but my question is do it is enough to get the exception logged the application will log automatically but in this case it does not work on my app or do i have to call the logger from code-behind into try catch statement

552783
for-loop	loops
a for-loop is evaluated as a while loops under the hood anyway

552784
for-loop	while-loop
you can think of the for-loop being a more compact way of writing the while-loop

552789
versioning	upgrade
perhaps it was a problem with a partial upgrade or a versioning mismatch on the settings

552797
for-loop	loops
however unless you need to access the i variable outside loops then you should use the for-loop

552825
move	drag
then you only have to define different working sets and can move projects into them using drag and drop

552851
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
the problem lies with domcontentloaded - that s where the hacks with doscroll defer onreadystatechange and whatever else someone has cooked up come to play

552895
pull	push
every repository is also a backup of the â œmain repositoryâ which is â œmainâ by convention only so a git push from the repository that did the most recent git fetch or git pull should be all it takesâ up to its state of course

552908
pull	push
a git pull and then a git push should be enough

552917
abc	isinstance
these are useful because you can then test to see if something implements a given abc by using isinstance

552943
idictionary	ilist
you declared images property as idictionary while bag should be declared as ilist

552986
integer	fractions
this is the way to do rounding for integer values because the division discards the fractions part

553032
hash	md5
also md5 hash contain only alphanumeric characters all of which are safe to use pretty much anywhere

553097
userid	usergroups
public sub logevent byval userid as string byval usergroups as string

553133
svnkit	subclipse
i am installing subclipse 1.4.x into eclipse ganymede and i m thinking that i should use the svnkit adapter

553160
svnkit	subclipse
svnkit was specifically developed with subclipse in mind so no surprises there

553160
svnkit	subclipse
the subclipse guys support svnkit but i ve had issues with it in the past that was several years ago

553275
post	get
search for get after post - - basically redirect to the current page after you re finished processing your event

553284
opera	firefox
my test applications are opera firefox quicksilver and xcode

553284
opera	firefox
opera no response system beep firefox no response system beep quicksilver correct response xcode no response system beep

553284
opera	firefox
opera no response system beep firefox no response system beep quicksilver correct response xcode no response system beep

553296
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
of course you need the inotifycollectionchanged interface to fire whenever one of the member inotifypropertychanged items fires its event

553317
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
which is better for developing gui applications with haskell wxwidgets via wxhaskell or gtk via gtk2hs

553320
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
convert both strings to timestamps in your chosen resolution milliseconds seconds hours days whatever subtract the earlier from the later multiplying your random number assuming it is distributed in the range 0 1 with that difference and add again to the earlier one

553325
int	double
on some platforms you can generate a time as a double date is the int part time is the fractions part is one implementation

553325
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
subtract the difference multiplying by random number 0 r 1 add to start time and done

553330
autofac	castle-windsor
having seen how ninject can do it and autofac can do it i m trying to figure out how to inject dependencies into mvc actionfilters using castle-windsor

553370
cvs	svn
its possible to use cvs in this situation altough i would recommend you take a look at other options like svn

553398
queue	fifo
i don t think lilo is the real term...but you re looking for a fifo queue

553400
vbscript	vb6
this is in vbscript but it should work the same on vb6

553417
rss	feed
but it only takes in rss feed

553424
stretchblt	bitblt
is there any way to mirror an image with something as simple as bitblt without the overkill of a stretchblt

553440
switching	screens
remember every second the splash screens is visible is a second that the user is impatiently staring at your logo swearing they ll switching to the first decent competitor they can find.

553444
rss	feed
visual studio gives you the choice of showing a start page which is based on an rss feed or to show a home page which can be any page on the internet

553444
rss	feed
if you choose the start page you can modify the rss feed from tools options environments startup start page news channel

553482
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i m making a website that will have to render correctly on firefox ie6 ie7 opera safari

553519
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
build in a more-compliant and developer-friendly browser like firefox first test thoroughly in ie and safari google-chrome webkit and opera later

553524
internationalization	localization
the specifics of internationalization localization in .net applications are outside of the scope of this answer but there are many books on the subject

553576
subtract	add
if you were to add up all the inbound deliveries and then the outbound deliveries and subtract one from the other you have the current stock level

553623
pascal	delphi
it s fast and can be compiled with most current pascal tp 5 5.5 6 bp 7 vp 2.1 fpc 1.0 2.0 2.2 and delphi versions tested with v1 up to v7 9 10

553719
post	put
then later on you can collect all the logged data from the file parse it do any required post processing like looking up host names from ip addresses and put it into a database table

553733
inherited	properties
if you have a label control you want to use over and over again inherited from it and set your own properties

553764
firefox	safari
then i d just wrap the entire chunk of code in a conditional that checks to see if the user is on ie as there s no need to run this on firefox or safari

553765
trac	mantis
is a solid step up from trac and mantis and provides migration tools

553928
nurbs	3dsmax
i d like to slice the nurbs surface with a slicing-plane thats on-axis not as advanced as 3dsmax

553981
listener	eventhandler
so in your remove method it s trying to remove a new eventhandler object that was never added as a listener to the event in the first place

553989
int	double
casting double to int truncates the .99999 right off

554009
versioning	upgrade
when the user upgrade to a new versioning of the app i want to maintain their existing data but replace all config data

554093
rss	feed
i ve used this method in creating rss feed and they pass validation based on the validator available at

554099
switching	screens
each can then have their own distinct conventional menubar and toolbar and the users can put the windows side by side on their screens to do their work instead of switching back and forth with a tab control

554108
int	double
shog9 has it right using the type double for a problem like this is not the best way to go if you are going to cast things to int

554108
integer	unsigned
looking at it i realize that you could probably get away with a standard unsigned 32 bit integer as the sum number but i will leave it as is just in case

554138
free	malloc
and don t worry - basically all i want to do is print a more user-friendly error message and free some malloc ed memory and then die

554145
implements	extends
the big problem is that .net seals lots of classes that would occasionally be nice to extends and they don t usually implements a common interface so api methods that take a foo would not accept a superfoo and you can t add an overload

554159
ilist	iqueryable
i am also using the tolist method on the iqueryable interface so this is another reason for sticking with ilist - it just works

554160
folder	directory
for this case you might be able to improve on that by immediately creating a small placeholder file in directory in question and holding a lock on that file until you re completely finished with the folder

554161
median	rank
find median point value count rows less than this value the count gives a rough estimate of rank not considering those with same amount of points

554181
post	get
i m probably missing something obvious but i don t seem to be able to get my ajax post to run consecutively instead of concurrently with jquery

554215
ceil	floor
if you are still stuck with older standards you may use std floor which always rounds to the lower number and std ceil which always rounds to the higher number

554237
postgresql	mysql
mysql is appallingly bad with complex joins innodb when compared with other cost-based engines like oracle and postgresql

554237
postgresql	mysql
i switched from mysql to postgresql and complex joins that would take 30s+ on mysql with all indices in place take milliseconds on postgresql

554247
vb.net	vb6
in vb6 a long was a 32-bit value hence the need for a change in vb.net

554303
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
support the latest versions of all major browsers internet explorer firefox safari opera google-chrome

554307
textmate	bbedit	textmate	textwrangler	textwrangler	bbedit
on mac os x i would suggest textwrangler free textmate or bbedit

554369
getter	setter
the best alternative seems to be abandoning properties in favor of getter setter methods in this case

554396
accessor	properties
in c# you can specify the visibility of a properties accessor independently of the properties

554512
int	double
i looked around for a good idea on how to make your implementation of generatenthfibonaccinumber handle cases where it returns the double 54.999999 but when you cast to an int or a long you get 54

554552
inherited	subclassing
if the number of additional fields columns is small for subclassing then single table inherited is usually the simplest to deal with

554564
getter	setter
basically marking the overall property as public but giving a more restrictive scope to the setter or getter

554564
getter	setter
since the property you re defining in there is marked as mustoverride you can t provide a default implementation it too is abstract and this includes the get and set outlines therefore whichever overall scope you give to this abstract property declaration vb.net will force you to use this scope for both the getter and setter within derived classes

554564
getter	setter
leaving off the readonly qualifier still will not work since whatever scope you give to the abstract property will be the scope you must apply to both the setter and getter within derived implementations

554564
getter	setter
ordinarily when not overriding a base class s abstract definition with a specific scoping level you can give a getter or setter a more restrictive scoping level but you can t give it a less restrictive scoping level

554564
public	protected
doesn t work either due to the public scope being less restrictive than the overall property scope of protected and moreover not of the same scoping level as defined on the base class s abstract property declaration

554564
getter	setter
if the design of your classes is as you mention in your question i personally would go with a java-style getter and setter methods as they can then be declared separately with their own scoping levels

554579
addition	multiplication
this grammar handles only multiplication and addition and already it s not immediately clear whether the grammar is ll 1

554611
put	get
i couldn t seem to get the require-bundle header in the manifest file to work so put everything in the feature.xml

554629
keydown	keyup
for many keys i check on keyup and keydown

554629
keydown	keyup
i use keydown while trying to watch the entire time that the key is held down and keyup when it was used just once

554689
post	get
i d like to dynamically generate from the controller the jquery script code associated to perform the classical .ajax calls to the controller for create read update delete operations in ajax instead of classical get post form actions

554695
put	get
also in the folder app_code i get an error if i put my js file saying that the language is not the same as other file in app_code

554731
children	parent
ado.net entity framework object with parent and children

554731
children	parent
each of these things has a single parent and zero or more children

554731
profiling	debugging
i m monitoring the sql server profiling while i debugging my application

554731
children	parent
ado.net entity framework object with parent and children and a related object

554734
superclass	subclassing
you ll find articles on how to set up tables that store the attributes of the generalized entity what oo programmers might call the superclass separate tables for each of the specialized entities subclassing and how to use foreign keys to link it all together

554758
sqldatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	detailsview	objectdatasource	detailsview
i have always used the standard asp.net detailsview formsview controls along with either sqldatasource or objectdatasource controls to accomplish what you are trying to do

554767
public	protected
is it a bad idea to make my data members in my data class to have public protected default protection so that i don t have to use a getter

554768
put	get
though to get a new row you could work with the nth-child selector or use an attribute for older browsers and put clear left

554775
fgets	fgetc
it is possible to read the stdin by creating a file handle to php stdin and then read from it with fgets for a line for example or as you already stated fgetc for a single character

554792
getter	setter
if you are developing it yourself it might still help because if you have a difficult to track bug you can set a breakpoint in the getter setter and see exactly when you are changing the values

554800
getter	setter
chances are good that trivial getter and setter will be inlined anyway - but with public fields you ll have lost the distinction between contract api and implementation

554801
getter	setter
getter setter is a way to expose part of the class to java s simple introspection

554801
getter	setter
the java bean specification relies on having public getter and setter as a way to determine which attributes are important

554811
getter	setter
from the perspective of who has written the code and who is going to use it then it doesn t matter whether its you or anyone else you might still need getter and setter - if anyone at all uses it later on its a defacto public api

554822
getter	setter
if you are replacing getter setter for performance memory optimisation then you are taking the wrong approach

554822
getter	setter
also i would be careful about designing the application as you suggest since it will mean that some properties eg simple properties will be directly accessible while others more complex derived properties or properties where you do not want to expose the underlying types will have getter setter

554826
getter	setter
the jvm will inline frequently used getter and setter

554838
getter	setter
imho for properties that by their very nature are just meant to passively hold data and couldn t do anything more complicated without completely changing their meaning from the perspective of the api user getter and setter are just unnecessary boilerplate

554842
versioning	upgrade
the database has a versioning table that i can programatically access and determine which upgrade scripts to run to get the database upgrade

554844
versioning	upgrade
apparently our infrastructure upgrade to a new versioning of the pop server and new uids were assigned on the new versioning

554874
profiling	instrumentation
if you don t have access to a profiling add simple instrumentation to determine where the bottleneck is

554888
getter	setter
getter and setter are not just for protection privacy

554888
accessor	properties
the external properties accessor mutator has a different meaning to the underlying variable

554907
folder	directory
i was going to use a filesystemwatcher to watch a folder on the server sign each instance up to it s deleted event and just create and delete a file in the watched directory but that s just dirty isn t it

554909
rss	feed
i m creating a website where i need to show the top 5 records from an rss feed and these need to be sorted by date and time

554909
rss	feed
the date fields in the rss feed are in the following format

555014
public	protected
when referencing a public or protected method or property on the base class be sure to prefix it with base

555066
objectdatasource	entitydatasource
what are the pros and cons of using entitydatasource vs objectdatasource in entity framework asp.net based apps

555073
post	get
i have an operation contract below that i want to allow get and post requests against

555079
xlwt	xlutils
there is a package on pypi call xlutils which might help and there is this presentation from chris withers lightning talk from last europython i think where you can see some example code with xlrd and xlwt

555115
formview	detailsview
i m trying to develop a small utility a winforms app and i was hoping to save time to use a winforms equivalent of an asp.net formview or detailsview to bind to - for single objects as opposed to multiple objects which we could use a datagridview for

555123
sorting	filtering
basically entitydatasource is build to support entity framework entities for features like sorting filtering inserting deleting etc.

555136
lisp	scheme
the above bullet points apply to scheme another lisp dialect

555153
actionscript	mxml
for a true flex application i think you need to start with a top level mx.core.application often defined in mxml rather than actionscript to which you would add mx.core.uicomponent s

555179
ssl	https
_server https isn t there switched on or not no matter if you re looking at the site via ssl or non-ssl

555327
gif	png
i m only concerned about jpg gif and png

555330
put	get
logan suggests to use -fno-implicit-templates and put somewhere presumably into a separate .cpp file that gets compiled with -fno-implicit-templates but i still get linker errors

555353
globalization	localization
i m working with an asp.net app with localization and globalization

555353
globalization	localization
does anyone know the best way to handle globalization localization of a javascript date value

555361
libjpeg	libpng
libpng and libjpeg offer pretty low-level access to png and jpeg files respectively

555391
post	get
i post that to service and used htmlencode then i get a result

555461
agile	metrics
it s a metrics and one of the key things i tell teams with any form of agile is that metrics should be captured for clear purposes that the team agrees with

555494
vim	emacs
engage in hackery like having the program check for the lockfiles that vim or emacs create

555535
gridview	formview
using this method you can still use dynamic data formview gridview validation etc

555595
post	get
i don t mind if it s a post or a get

555595
post	get
but i ve heard that these days browsers don t allow cross-site calls with either post or get

555660
gridview	objectdatasource
normally if i m linking an objectdatasource to a gridview and i have a templatecolumn that has an eval in it and it s null i can just put a .tostring it works fine

555660
gridview	objectdatasource
i tied it to the gridview with an objectdatasource

555670
post	get
there s no way to do a post in this manner the src url must be a get so you can pass arguments that way

555718
internationalization	localization
i feel localization can go without internationalization but.

555718
internationalization	localization
internationalization with localization should not be done.

555776
folder	directory
this should work recursively inside the sub folder of the selected directory

555781
getter	setter
designing functionally you are never going to need getter setter is just as bad as premature optimisation

555900
testdriven.net	coderush
also integrates with a code-generation tool called coderush and i ve seen them both used very effectively together with testdriven.net check out the summer of nhibernate screencasts

555904
getter	setter
you should store the state of your wizard in the wizardmodel and add getter and setter like a javabean appropriately

555971
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter kohana and my own mvc framework

555998
boost	stl
you may use boost stl whatever to learn these

556019
mouse	keyboard
i will respons to both keyboard and mouse

556089
integer	fractions
if you want integer rounding for positive floating point values so that values with a fractions component below 0.5 round to the next lowest integer and values with a fractions component of 0.5 or greater round to the next higher integer

556097
mathml	tex
edit #2 convert that messy word-stuff to tex or mathml

556109
free	malloc
it was designed in the sense there was a definite easy to comprehend architecture - malloc a struct send the main loop a user message with the pointer to the struct as the lparam and then free it when the message is processed

556131
serializable	deserialization
however if you need some flexibility in the serializable deserialization logic and not get tightly coupled with datacontracts then option 2 looks good

556139
children	parent
now the parent has a reference to you via the handler as well as in its children controls collection

556145
backslash	double-quotes
putting a in front of a string enables you to use special characters such as a backslash or double-quotes without having to use special codes or escape characters

556193
mp3	wav
first convert to wav trim off the samples you don t want and then convert back to mp3

556274
serializable	deserialization
support will be a nightmare imagine adding a single column to the resultset which will lead to an avalanche of modifications in both serializable and deserialization code

556279
try-catch	exception-handling
when exception-handling are used sparingly you don t need to turn your code into a try-catch -spaghetti in order to avoid receiving incomprehensible-in-the-context exception-handling from the deeper layers

556288
button	checkbox
in my forms i want to make html labels bold in general but not bold when they are labelling radio button and checkbox

556353
versioning	upgrade
is there any valid reason why the user would not want to upgrade when a new versioning of the program is released

556353
versioning	upgrade
maybe in the options there could be an option for prompting when a new versioning comes available but the default should be to just upgrade it silently without telling the user unless it is a major upgrade which is not fully backwards compatible or might break some other stuff

556367
cpu	affinity
gets the opportunity to be cached near affinity cpu

556390
sum	coalesce
prior to the introduction of annotations you might have used extra to do something like this which i think should return 0 in cases where there are no votes if it doesn t for any particular database implementation you can at least directly insert the necessary coalesce function call - coalesce sum value 0 - using this method

556390
sum	coalesce
this looks rather ugly as you need to monkeypatch the new aggregate into django.db.models.sql.aggregates due to the way the sql aggregate classes are looked up but all we ve done here is added a new aggregate which subclasses sum hardcoding a call to the coalesce function and adding a placeholder for the default value which you must supply as a keyword argument in this very basic example implementation at least

556456
lisp	scheme
it obviously is possible to write almost any kind of application in almost any programming language especially in such a powerful one as lisp be it scheme or common lisp

556478
pop-up	dialog
a while back i read before i lost it a great book called gui bloopers which was full of examples of bad gui design but also full of useful tidbits like don t call something a dialog one minute and a pop-up the next

556526
getter	setter
with the given resultset extracting the metadata i want to build a class file dynamically with getter and setter methods for all the columns that exist in resultset

556549
implements	extends
your other code will not be able to call any methods on this class because it did not exist when they were compiled and consequently the only way to actually use this generated class would be either via reflection or via methods on its parent class or implements interfaces i m going to assume it would extends resultset

556643
getter	setter
often you do need getter and setter perhaps but when i write a getter i always ask myself whether that data should be exposed or whether the object should hide it completely for me

556660
inline	inlining
declaring the method within the class declaration makes the function inline which is a hint for the compiler to do you guessed it -- inlining

556684
vim	emacs
eclipse netbeans kdevelop vim and emacs are all good options

556692
client-side	server-side
also the feature you reference in outlook actually just keeps it in your client s outbox until the designated date so it s a client-side feature not a server-side feature

556698
children	parent
however the control needs to be able to instantiate itself when the user clicks the button of the parent control at least 1 nested children control of the same type will be displayed underneath kind of like a tree

556698
children	parent
by the way this control would be used in a fairly finite number of recursive combinations so maybe it would be better to create a separate control for each parent children scenario

556704
profiling	debugging
in circumstances like this i get the actual call to the sproc either from a debugging in my app or using sql profiling and then plug that into ssms or whatever ide you use wrapping it in a rollback transaction so it can t accidentally make any changes

556750
int	chars
avoid at all costs utter abominations like throwing int hresults chars std string.

556789
hide	show
having an html page with a simple table and js code to do show hide on it

556792
onkeyup	onkeydown
also if you don t use his script make sure you use one that involves either a time interval check and or the onkeydown onkeyup events of the textarea

556794
getter	setter
in theory and as long as you keep m_somevalue always equal to somevalue like a simple getter setter nothing

556794
public	protected
the proxy class will generate a public property whether you use a public protected internal private field or property

556810
addclass	removeclass
or you can use addclass and removeclass if that s more appropriate

556838
boost	stl
any idea how i do that with c++ and possibly stl boost

556844
int	chars
you can print out chars using the chr int function if you know the chars code

556859
hide	show
jquery offers browser independent hide show and toggle methods

557004
put	get
hence you can get a free blog and just put in the bits you want to share that way you would also have a steady online reference whenever you need it

557038
mouse	keyboard
and then i must make sure to block away keyboard mouse and focus messages so the underlying edit control doesn t mess with me

557139
mouseover	mouseenter
this is different behavior than that of the mouseover event which is dispatched each time the mouseenter the area of any child object of the display object container even if the mouse was already over another child object of the display object container

557143
put	get
i think most of the work to get a smooth result in such a case which of course does happen needs to be put in beforehand in having a good automatic test suite

557226
xsl-fo	xslt
in past i ve always gone for xml xslt xsl-fo using apache fop with perl being used to create the initial xml data

557232
jlist	jtree	jlist	jtable	jtree	jtable
to address your issue with jtree which i agree with you should look into using glazed lists if you want nice jlist and jtable interaction in your app

557333
waitpid	fork
after fork ing and running the test.sh script the bin sh shell which was the child of the perl system call exits and so you get a -1 return value from waitpid

557462
plone	buildout
i am using buildout to automatically download and setup the many dependencies of my plone installation

557478
firefox	safari
one question if you re planning to execute the same test at the same time under firefox safari and ie have you considered that there may be race conditions caused by artifacts of the test execution

557524
post	get
this will work for both get and post but you can modify accordingly if you only need one or the other

557538
stdout	stderr
the use of simple print statements to write stuff to the log doesn t work wonderfully consistently for all django implementations mod_python for example loses all the stdout and stderr stuff.

557544
for-loop	arrays
and run a for-loop over the arrays boxes or use the foreach member function

557587
client-side	server-side
are you working on the client-side or the server-side

557595
observer-pattern	memento
a combination of the memento pattern with observer-pattern should fit your needs

557598
rss	feed
i use simple html dom to scrape a page for the latest news and then generate an rss feed using this php class

557695
textarea	textbox
for instance i d like to use it with jquery validate so i can restrict a textbox textarea to have say 250 words

557719
folder	directory	folder	dir	public	protected
you can t get to a public folder inside a private folder in general and if you can t add new directory outside the web root your cache dir will have to be protected another way

557720
accessor	properties
new languages or even a future version of the c# compiler might decorate the properties accessor in a different way then _get and _set

557720
accessor	properties
you should really just implement your properties bag accessor to take a parameter to identify the properties - either a string name like hastable or an object like the wpf dependency properties bag

557721
width	height
one thing you will need to do to make it look right is to have a fixed width and height of cyclecontent with overflow hidden

557721
width	height
the css i m using is this note the width and height are the sizes of my test images

557753
folder	directory
from what you posted i think you are trying to expose a working copy instead of a repository the .svn folder is typical of a working copy and i bet the e dev.svn is a checkout directory

557755
cpu	processors
in addition to that this design will make maximum use of multiple processors or cores at the cost of slightly more memory consumption and more cpu cycles spent

557811
dsn	paradox
first of all when i m registering the odbc as a user or system dsn the microsoft paradox odbc driver only display versions up to 5.x so it looks like that it does not support paradox version 7.x

557825
client-side	server-side
this is not possible because you re mixing client-side behavior with server-side behavior

557838
xslt	xquery
that helps a lot since you can use a lot of tools originally designed for xml such as xml parsers xslt xpath xquery .

557882
mxmlc	compc
the compc task is using locale en_us and the mxmlc task is using locale en_us

557891
getter	setter
i then have getter and setter on my class that return accept only dates

557909
pow	floor
however using something like pow floor log seems a bit much for a simple problem like this

557948
nhibernate	massive
in my experience nhibernate now is relatively easy to use with the fluent interface entity framework is a legitimate contender and microorms such as dapper and massive are becoming quite popular

557973
firefox	safari
target users are users with ie firefox and safari browsers

557996
observer-pattern	command-pattern
the gui will keep watch on the game engine by using observer-pattern and interact with this by using one of several command object created using command-pattern

558009
getc	gets
i m looking for a way to do getc or gets or whatever that does not echo to the terminal

558011
rss	feed
i m looking into writing a proxy aggregator for feed where a handful of users specify a feed url and some set of conditions and the system outputs a continually-updated rss atom feed of entries that match those conditions

558042
stateless	stateful
the blog post author says that the true strength of asp.net was the controls i would argue that the strength was the event driven model and the presentation of a stateful environment overtop a nearly stateless environment

558075
udp	tcp
you ll want to choose a protocol udp or tcp

558115
int	chars
with regards to strings datalength returns the number of bytes and len returns an int value for the number of chars

558134
nginx	lighttpd
before that it was nginx but i came back to lighttpd because i needed cgi

558143
rar	zip
it supports almost any office office-like file format even dwg msg pdf and files in zip rar archives

558159
nginx	lighttpd
in my experience lighttpd and nginx are easy enough to configure and you can use fcgi bindings for most programming languages

558186
comparator	icomparer
icomparer or the comparator methods it relies upon did not return zero when array.sort called x

558227
g++	gcc
i am using gcc gcc g++

558243
width	height
html width 229 height 300

558274
stdout	stderr
the problem is that normal output like compiler command lines go to stdout and compile errors go to stderr

558274
stdout	stderr
is there a way to turn off buffering for stdout and stderr in this case

558275
min	max
not sure how to control where the fill goes i.e the graph min or max rather than to the x-axis

558284
int	double
you should really look into using some int type for these values that supports equality comparison rather than trying to use double

558302
stdout	stderr
this should work better for you because it is not redirecting stderr and stdout separately but redirecting stderr to stdout which should make the buffering sync up

558304
ienumerable	ienumerator
can anyone explain ienumerable and ienumerator to me

558304
ienumerable	ienumerator
what s the difference between ienumerable and ienumerator

558308
vb.net	vb6
background i m rewriting a vb6 app that used ms access for data storage to one that uses vb.net and ms sql server

558309
ienumerable	ienumerator
implementing ienumerable enables you to get an ienumerator for a list

558321
ienumerable	ienumerator
implementing ienumerable means your class returns an ienumerator object

558331
ienumerable	ienumerator
most of the time ienumerable ienumerator are used transparently as part of a foreach loop

558332
ienumerable	ienumerator
thus when your class implements ienumerable you are saying that you can call a method getenumerator and get a new object returned an ienumerator you can use in a loop such as foreach

558427
onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onmouseup	onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
then you can easily implement selection override onclick dragging and resizing onmousedown onmousemove onmouseup

558469
cpu	affinity
i have a pthread_t and i d like to change its cpu affinity

558469
cpu	affinity
i need to be able to set the cpu affinity of an arbitrary thread

558497
super	extends
because composite itself doesn t need to be initialized with a constructor no need to call super my constructors of widgets extends composite look something like

558582
hash	md5
also instead of using registration_confirmation_code you might want to consider using a md5 hash or the like of the users email address

558593
pop-up	dialog
if you want to pop-up a potentially long list i would suggest creating your own dialog

558650
hide	show
assuming you have the different tabs working showing already you can just loop through all elements the blocks with the form fields you show and hide as requested when the user clicks all and show them all

558652
ready	each
position all the div elements relative to each other on the all page in the ready method and set each div as visible

558760
min	max
here s the specific section on min max k values in a list

558772
redmine	trac
for something completely different the best way to do agile development with trac may be to simply migrate everything to redmine

558798
put	get
take the time and get the schema right and put some thought into data quality in the design of your application

558815
affinity	processors
other than accessing internal data structures of the threading library which you understandably do not want although with your assumptions about processors affinity and linux thread ids your code will not be portable anyway you may be able to play a trick at creation time if you control the code that creates the threads

558815
cpu	affinity
whether this trick is worth it depends on how important setting the cpu affinity is in your case versus not accessing internal structures of the thread library or depending on a thread library that provides pthread_setaffinity_np

558827
versioning	upgrade
to my knowledge microsoft doesn t simply provide a download of the epu to upgrade it so how do i execute the package on a server that s running the previous versioning of sql server

558828
client-side	server-side
i have found it most convenient to maintain the client-side and server-side code in separate solutions

558837
width	height
i ve had all sorts of trouble with measuring the width and height of textfields before

558839
int	boolean
subclasses for specific int boolean might also be needed

558952
punctuation	words
if there were punctuation between the words hello world would the punctuation be a separate token part of hello or ignored

558958
mouse	keyboard
i believe click will be triggered for both keyboard and mouse

558985
put	get
your code works when i follow this procedure but if i put it in the code module attached to thisworkbook i get the #name result you report

559025
int	chars
native data types chars int and floats

559102
pop-up	dialog
also you can experiment with css visibility by setting display none and undoing that just before you pop-up the dialog

559104
folder	directory
you can generally tell by looking at iis manager whether or not your directory is a virtual directory as it will not look like a yellow folder

559104
folder	directory
if it does look like the typical yellow folder right click the parent default web site or whatever and choose new virtual directory

559107
getter	setter
getter and setter are usually inlined replaced directly in the machine code instead of a call to a subroutine and constants are folded

559139
osql	bcp
if these still don t suit your needs you ll need to use another tool such as bcp or sqlcmd osql

559157
cvs	svn
we are still mostly on cvs but newer projects are in svn

559157
cvs	svn
i know that the resulting file is the same in cvs and svn for example a visual studio project file has two different versions

559161
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
this is about the domcontentloaded mozilla opera and webkit nightlies currently support this and the onreadystatechange for ie events which can be applied to the document object to understand when the document is available to be manipulated without waiting for all the images stylesheets etc

559168
mouse	keyboard
at the moment i m using a custom nsview inside a scroll view that quartz draws each node the arcs etc at each render and processes mouse and keyboard input by hand including hit testing movement and so forth

559183
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
eval is mainly intended for use in expressions within controls such as repeater gridview listview etc where there is a list of data items being bound using templates and you need a method to be able to access the properties of the current data item

559225
cvsnt	svn
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints

559287
vim	emacs
note that emacs vim etc can work as ides - i m not talking about forcing you the world of guis if you want to stay in a text-only situation because you re sshing in

559289
int	chars
alternatively the staff.role column s data type line 40 role int not null could be changed to chars 30 not null

559290
firefox	safari
for example to use it in firefox you would use the property -moz-border-radius for safari use -webkit-border-radius etc

559306
hash	md5
keep in mind that md5 hashing has been cracked by brute force attacks so having a hash password in the open is not 100 secure but for most cases it may be a non issue especially if you use some stronger hashing algorithm

559323
hash	salt
to defeat this attack you need to salt the hash

559323
hash	salt
this salt can be stored unencrypted next to the hash

559340
floating-point	integer
in ocaml you can t even mix integer and floating-point math or use the same operators + is for adding integers +

559340
haskell	sml	haskell	scheme	sml	scheme	lisp	sml	lisp	scheme
haskell is an exception ghc executables are almost as small as c programs both at compile-time and runtime but sml common lisp and scheme programs always require tons of memory

559450
range	max
if the angle is within some threshold of the current heading and within the max view range then it can see it

559451
g++	gcc
i usually run in nix so i usually use gcc and g++ as well

559480
getter	setter
limit permissions on getter setter method of each ejb

559531
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
the ftp protocol can be accessed through the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes in the system.net namespace and was introduced in .net 2.0

559544
move	drag
one thing i like about resharper is that you can use ctrl-shift-alt-up or down to move a method field property etc up or down in the file directly above or below the method field property adjacent to it or you can use the file structure browser to both view and rearrange the structure of your file through drag and drop

559550
ienumerable	icollection
see the icollection ienumerable etc

559578
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr output can be interleaved on the

559578
stdout	stderr
how do i log stdout and stderr

559583
mp3	wav
how do you convert a mp3wav a compressed wav in mp3 form to uncompressed wav pcm using sox

559595
subclass	abstract-class
something you might consider depending on the rest of your design is a factory where your abstract-class has a static method or multiple static methods depending on how you implement it that constructs the appropriate subclass and returns it as an iconverter

559595
super	abstract
with this you can expose only the abstract definition in the header file and have all the concrete class definitions and implementations in a single .cpp file along with the super class implementation

559676
stdout	stderr
your already defining the stdout stderr of the processes your executuing by the stdout stderr methods

559713
post	get
really i wanted the tooltip to show immediately so i used the mouseenter event instead. i can post my exact code tomorrow when i get to work

559722
inject	interceptor
but for certain events in the engine you can attach interceptor aka aspects the events being the point-cuts etc -- i use this to inject using ioc business entities into my domain objects

559729
put	get
you could even put the code to get the connection string into getconnection unless you need the flexibility of opening multiple connections with different connection strings

559775
yacc	bison
lex and yacc or their gnu equivaents flex and bison do their work at compile time and may not be flexible enough for your needs

559808
daemons	systemd
in other words if my daemons exits normally and closes dev watchdog the systemd would still re-boot 59 seconds later

559808
daemons	systemd
if the setting is on my daemons would need to preferably start an orderly shutdown on exit or at least warn the user that the systemd is going to reboot shortly

559831
serializable	deserialization
the advantage of this setup the blazeds proxy server will take care of all the serializable deserialization of the amf request and response

559856
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets

559856
put	get
this implementation provides guaranteed log n time cost for the containskey get put and remove operations

559906
getter	setter
examples are getter setter and or things that a compiler interpreter will catch immediately

559927
fadein	fadeout
you could consider implementing and learning jquery which has a few plugins to fade things as well as built in functions such as fadein fadeout etc

559937
trac	bugzilla
i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill

559937
trac	bugzilla
there are lots of vendors that do trac bugzilla other bug tracker hosting

put	get
thanks to the clarifications from brian and alan haggai alavi it seems that enough love is being put in archive zip to get these bugs out soon and finally have a fully functioning zip module in windows

560113
agile	sprint
you ll have to plan out your sprint ahead because the central planners will probably want an all-up feature list early and won t stand for the more laid back agile approach

560114
accessor	properties
and lastly the properties makes refactoring easier for example when the value later is no longer stored in a variable but is calculated inside the properties accessor or comes from some other source variable

560155
valgrind	memcheck
i have also tried running the program through valgrind memcheck tool but not getting anything significant about the above piece of code

560176
int	chars
byte short int long chars

560189
disk	ram
if you re worried about the overhead of constantly load and unloading the executable into process space i suggest you set up a ram disk and time your app from there

560246
cifs	smb
if the underlying disk is fat ntfs or cifs smb you must also make sure you use the latest version of the appropriate driver

560268
ant	maven
i want to make this process work from the cmd line using ant note i know maven is out there but i know ant pretty well from past experience so would prefer sticking to it for now

i have the following vb.net code to take the values out of a textbox on a webpage actually spaces delimiter tags and split them with a spaces delimiter into an array

560474
mouse	keyboard
using intentionally triggered mouse keyboard events to create pseudo worker threads as in this example

560492
int	double
you d only have to create a handful of custom types to wrap string double date int etc

560504
google-chrome	safari
i only tested in safari 3.2 and the webkit nightlies google-chrome just uses the webkit from safari 3.1 but i don t believe there s any engine changes between 3.1 and 3.2

560549
getter	setter
keep in mind the only place i want people mucking around with the backing field bar is in setter and getter of the property

560554
versioning	upgrade
and i havent had any need to convert any of my programs to another language in my 20 years as programmer only upgrade from different versioning of same language

560566
folder	directory
when you set up the three projects to work this way you will find that you are compiling each project to it s correspondent bin folder and to a combined target directory

560657
freemarker	velocity
velocity or freemarker might be a better option

560679
postgresql	mysql
a free database like mysql or postgresql

560679
postgresql	mysql
should i use mysql postgresql or something else which ideally is free as we have a limited budget

560694
spaces	delimiter
i want to add a text field to a web page that lets users add spaces delimiter tags

560828
ssl	https
if the uri begins with https ssl is used

560832
cvs	svn
if you need bi-directional sync both uploading and downloading changes then you ll need to go with either a remote filesystem-based solution or better imo a proper revision control system such as git svn or cvs

560862
.htaccess	httpd.conf
solution add the execcgi option to that directory via either httpd.conf or a .htaccess

561079
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
memory allocation every pointer new ed should be deleted malloc free should not be mixed with new delete when to use delete instead of delete why the c functions are still useful expand realloc

561188
jboss	weblogic
the java application is a standalone application not deployed on any java ee application server like oracleas weblogic jboss etc

561272
comparator	icomparer
this can work where icomparer comparator cannot because it operates on an entire collection instead of individual items

561272
comparator	icomparer
then i could implement a shuffle from the iarranger interface using a proper fisher-yates algorithm and also have implementations that wrap each additional ienumerable.sort comparator icomparer varieties that i care about

561285
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
do you specifically mean java ee app servers like weblogic websphere jboss glassfish

561297
qt-designer	pyqt
i would suggest using pyqt and the qt-designer wysiwyg gui designer for making cross platform gui apps

561346
fadein	fadeout
my problem is that the fadein for the second div fires at the same time with the fadeout for the first div

561463
udp	tcp
you should read up on tcp udp ip programming

561464
getter	setter
in general class data members shouldn t be directly visible either by being public or by having getter and setter

561486
int	chars
since base64 uses is a 64 chars encoding it should be possible to represent an int in base64 using even less chars than hexadecimal

561498
min	max
to find the min or max value for a specific indexed column

561643
int	double
seriously though if i is a native data type such as int double etc -- no difference

update made the code generic and to use iqueryable instead of ienumerable

561729
inherited	subclassing
now i have a subclassing d that inherited of b and c

561790
getter	setter
my prefered solution is to add a getter setter method on the ampibianvehicle class to change the surface member enumeration

561819
post	get
for those interested this code parses get and post parameters and stores them in the global associative array query_parameters

561861
bazaar	git
i you want to stay up to date you still can play with git mercurial bazaar at home

561874
versioning	upgrade
i think the url form you are looking for is at least that is what works in 1.3 and 1.4 i will point out 1.4.3 should be out soon and with all of the bug fixes and added functionality 1.4.3 would be a good upgrade target if you are thinking of going that way then you could get everything back on the same versioning

561893
width	margin
edit if you give .col-middle a left margin thereâ s no need to float it or to give it a width

561901
activemq	rabbitmq
these days i ve moved away from stomp activemq towards amqp + rabbitmq using the txamqp and py-amqplib libraries

562018
awt	swing

562065
folder	directory
go to the cc.net installation directory and delete the webdashboard folder

562074
migrate	upgrade
i would say if you are able to migrate anyway you might as well upgrade to increase the longevity of your code base

if fixed-width 32-bit integers are used then it is requires only two fixed-width numbers for 32-bit one 64bit number and one 128bit number

562227
globalization	localization
i ve found tons of information on localization globalization how these files work and lots of ways to manipulate them but nothing on preventing them building in the first place

562273

562283
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome not so great in ie7

562283
google-chrome	firefox
any reason why that would work perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but fail in ie

562293

562361
int	chars
create or replace function my_function mychar in chars return int as

562367
inherited	properties
i suppose my question is how are you supposed to access the properties of the inherited tables in linq to entities when using table per type

solaris	aix
we support all the major operating systems out there commercially aix hp-ux linux os x solaris windows even the as 400 mainframe

562485
width	height
tells if the layout handles height for width calculation

562490
cpython	ironpython
ironpython 2.0 is cpython 2.5 compatible so pure python that uses 2.5 apis should work fine under ironpython

562495
pascal	delphi
a delphi pascal parser can be used to validate the input

562512
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
add to the confusion that firefox google-chrome safari don t ask twice - only ie 6 and 7

562524
google-chrome	firefox
i tried opening the page in firefox ie and google-chrome but nowhere do i see the proper font

562537

heaps a tree where the parent of a node always maintains some relation to the children of the node for instance the parent of a node is always greater than each of it s children max-heap

562552
skip-lists	tree
a skip-lists is a probabilistic data structure based on multiple parallel sorted linked lists with efficiency comparable to a binary search tree order log n average time for most operations

562554
folder	directory
if it matters the folder structure of the global server is a subset of the dev server it s just a few select files directory but all have the same relative paths etc

562559
getter	setter
in my form class i getter setter methods for the properties like the ones below

562587
vsto	add-in
before vsto office add-in had to implement this idtextensibility2 interface themselves

562587
vsto	add-in
hence if you added a udf to your vsto add-in it won t be visible to office

562657
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works beautifully in firefox safari opera and google-chrome but - of course - not in ie

562682
put	get
how can i get list of all colors i can pick in visual studio designer which is system.windows.media.colors but that isn t a collection and put them into my own combobox using wpf and xaml markup

562700
groovy	gpath
so far i am quite impressed how quickly i can hack up something usable and groovy s features especially gpath expressions play a big part in that

562759
put	get
i get intellisense in both the master page and in content pages tried it with the code you put in your question

562787
implements	extends
if so you could extends them in a different file and extract an interface and let it be implements by all address classes

562810
accessor	properties
just so people know accessorizer does more than just generate accessor both 1.0 and properties for 2.0 it also generates core data code for persisting non-standard attributes your nsset accessor for custom to-many relationships

562853
subtract	add
updating vote_values on a vote record should also update total_vote_values with the difference subtract old value add new value

562907
vb.net	vb6
don t forget how negative numbers are expressed in binary and that vb6 and vb.net interpret numbers like h8300 differently

562907
post	get
as mentioned in the other post you can get around this by explicitly marking values as longs

562978
pop-up	dialog
no idea but we pop-up a separate error dialog displaying the issue rather than updating an existing label

562986
inherited	properties
i have another class that inherited from foo that adds a properties for a value

562990
boost	stl
.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost

563000
intrinsics	inlining
can the pdb file become less usable when the compiler uses different kinds of optimizations fpo pgo intrinsics inlining etc.

563063
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	linqdatasource	linqdatasource	objectdatasource
i don t just use the linqdatasource because i usually have to run some other subroutines whenever i do my normal crud stuff i know this is pretty standard so i use the objectdatasource controls to populate my gridview

563063
gridview	objectdatasource
considering that gridview don t sort when your objectdatasource s are ienumerable etc would it be better to just populate a datatable from the linq queries for all my selectmethods

563130
hide	show
if you are simply changing the visibility of the panels and not retrieving new data via an ajax call you didn t specify remove the updatepanel replace the panel controls with standard divs not running at server and just use javascript to hide and show the divs

563171
codeigniter	kohana
you ll get up to speed with codeigniter or kohana quickly

563229
int	double
this might be confusing because most of the c++ primitive types do have default constructors that init them to zero int bool double long etc

563235
udp	tcp
it will be making tcp connections sending udp datagrams and listening for udp broadcasts

563235
ubuntu	linux
i m running on ubuntu 8.04 w linux kernel 2.6.26

563259
clang	llvm
have a look at the llvm clang static analyzer

563259
clang	llvm
the llvm clang static analyzer is a standalone tool that find bugs in c and objective-c programs and it is very early in development

563259
clang	llvm
the goal of the clang project is to create a new c c++ objective c and objective c++ front-end for the llvm compiler

563276
rss	feed
it ll read rss feed and pop up notifications that will automatically go away if you don t read them for you

563319
inherited	subclassing
there is nsmutablearray and since that s a subclassing of nsarray it inherited makeobjectsperformselector

563458
post	get
which will rewrite only get requests leaving post requests as they are

563472
lisp	scheme
you don t just have to pick between common lisp and scheme

563472
lisp	scheme
you have to pick between several incompatible implementations of common lisp and several incompatible implementations of scheme as well as other little things like arc and clojure

563472
lisp	scheme
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp

563483
ironruby	ironpython
the issue is i d like to try creating one from ironruby or ironpython which to my knowledge don t support attributes

563678
rss	feed
ideally you would look for an rss feed to get the raw content

563678
post	get
also get to know the standard element names used by common cms platforms like wordpress post or drupal node

563680
ironruby	ironpython
you also might consider a dynamic language like ironruby or ironpython

563683
put	get
my best advice is just to get a very good spam filter if you re going to put your address on the web

563716
hex	binary
i didn t get the same binary data that was in the table i created but i haven t bothered going into a hex editor to see what was different

563721
post	get
i remember seeing a login handler that took a post request and redirected to a get with the user name and password passed in as parameters

563735
directsound	mixer
mixer direct audio device directsound capture via ac 97 audio wave

563828
codeigniter	kohana
there are libraries to accomplish this in the php frameworks codeigniter modular extensions and kohana dispatch and component

563869
post	get
the easy workaround is to change your form to do get instead of post

563976
implements	extends
it makes it easier to change what the class extends without having to figure out what interfaces it should implements

563988
folder	directory
as the number of files gets large the problem is easy to solve from the point of view of the filesystem store the files into relative path directory so you can keep the number of file per directory under control for instance creating a weekly folder or creating a new folder when the file count is over a certain limit

564076
jlist	jtable
aside from debugging overriding the tostring method of a class can be useful when ading objects into a jlist or a jtable which by default will use the tostring method to display the object as a textual form in the list or table

564105
passenger	thin
if all that seems like a bit much to keep nginx and thin playing nicely you may want to look into an all in one solution like passenger or litespeed

564144
mouse	keyboard
alex harui provides a good example with source here it s a bit of a lengthy solution but covers mouse and keyboard interaction with the datagrid

564215
centos	linux
i am not entirely sure what a media template server is but i think it is a pretty standard linux server centos

564220
button	checkbox
reset checkbox in datalist on click of button that is outside of datalist using c#

564268
put	get
i would expect that you would want to put everything on the table and get a full commitment from the customer before performing the work

564280
hash	md5
the registration key is then generated by calculating an md5 hash of the supplied name combined with a secred code some random bytes in an array

564282
button	checkbox	onclientclick	datalist
in the eventhandler for the button onclientclick event you d loop trough each item in the datalist and find the checkbox and reset it

564363
unix	solaris
for this purpose i m using io.popen and it works as expected in windows but on unix solaris reading from io.popen blocks so the script just waits there until something comes along instead of returning immediately.

564390
versioning	upgrade
ever so often they would release a patch for free and a new versioning that would require an upgrade fee

564392
int	chars
if you have an array of java objects which have a primitive type for example byte int chars etc

564414
subclass	abstract-class
it s an abstract-class of which you d need to create your own custom subclass that knows how to describe its own presentation via the defininggeometry property

564460
urllib	httplib
looking at the code it seems that this will not work due to httplib and urllib limitations in appengine environment but maybe somebody has patched cloudfiles

564498
inherited	subclassing
object-oriented class hierarchies with virtual method dispatch are good when you have a relatively fixed set of methods that need to be implemented but many potential subclassing that might inherited from the root of the hierarchy and implement those methods

564508
swt	swing
can generate guis for both swing and swt

564515
ant	maven
should i use ant maven

564591
haskell	scheme
program your logic not the ui in functional programming language such as f# or even using scheme or haskell

564629
haskell	ocaml
if you want to write multithreaded number crunching code and you are going to be doing a lot of it in the future i would suggest you take a look at using a functional language like ocaml or haskell

564648
folder	directory
how can i configure the zsh tab-completion such that when i type it expands to cd .. and after pressing again proposes the folder in the parent directory for completion

564658
versioning	upgrade
hitting this silverlight page on microsoft.com tells me my versioning rtw is now out of date and i should upgrade to gdr 1

564668
profiler	shark
try optimizing it using a profiler shark for example and make your object-creation method less time consuming

564698
ironruby	ironpython
to be fair either powershell or any dlr based language such as ironpython or ironruby would suit the task and would be less overhead than looking after trivial console applications

564747
lisp	scheme
i think you either want common lisp or plt scheme

564771
getter	setter
if you need to change any of these variables then you can define some getter and setter

564813
getter	setter
that s not the case if you pass a property by reference in vb.net the property getter is invoked once and then the property setter is invoked once

564838
hash	salt
if you do want to redirect then you could create a tamperproof url by including a hash of the error number with a salt known only to your code

564959
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

564966
urllib	httplib
previously you d have had to write your own library to do so using app engine s urlfetch api but with the release of sdk 1.1.9 you can now use urllib and httplib instead

564970
button	checkbox
i have datalist containing radio button and checkbox

564970
button	checkbox
when i come to previous page the radio button and checkbox in datalist must be selected

565002
submit	submission
though i have had a few odd issues with submission forms with javascript before so if that doesn t work you could try calling click or the equivalent of fireevent click on your form s submit button like so

565014
stdout	fflush
that is because when you use standard stream stdin stdout interactively from cmdline they are in a line-buffered mode in short system fflush on each new line but when you call it from within your program streams are in a fully buffered mode doesn t output till system buffer is full

565041
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
the language python itself has no such restrictions but perhaps your operating system or your python runtime pypy cpython jython could have such restrictions

565056
postgresql	mysql
i want my application to be compatible at least with oracle and mysql or postgresql

565080
width	height
using float left a fixed width height with a clear both on some images will do the trick

565085
win64	windows
for example on win64 you ll be able to run the 32bit build of python.exe but it won t get the benefits of the 64 bit environment as windows will run it in a 32bit sandbox

565095
getter	setter
after taking a quick look at my code the majority of it was getter and setter 60 compared to the rest that is truly needed for the logic of the game

565095
getter	setter
a couple of google searches have claimed that getter and setter are evil whilst others have claimed that they are necessary for good oo practice and great programs

565095
getter	setter
should i be changing my getter and setter for my private variables or should i stick with them

565117
getter	setter
somewhat evil getter and setter where they re not required

565117
getter	setter
good getter and setter only where they re really required - make the type expose larger behaviour which happens to use its state rather than just treating the type as a repository of state to be manipulated by other types

565121
getter	setter
my opinion is that getter and setter are a requirement for good programs

565121
getter	setter
stick with them but don t write unnecessary getter setter - it s not always necessary to directly deal with all variables

565155
getter	setter
if you need external access to individual values of fields use getter and or setter

565155
getter	setter
in general you should also find that you need to supply a setter much less often than a getter - especially if you are trying to make your objects immutable - which is a good thing but not always the best choice - but even if not

565158
getter	setter
there s nothing wrong with getter and setter though their verbosity in java can be a bit annoying

565158
getter	setter
edit if the main point for the getter and setter is to configure the game classe i understand your comment that way then your probably don t need the getter it s perfectly fine for a class to access its own private variables without using get methods and you can probably collapse many of the setter into group setter that set several variables which belong together conceptually

565168
rational-numbers	floating-point
gmp is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic operating on signed integers rational-numbers and floating-point numbers

565168
solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
gmp s main target platforms are unix-type systems such as gnu linux solaris hp-ux mac os x darwin bsd aix etc

565189
traceroute	packets
lots of hops in a traceroute do not indicate closeness just devices the packets routes through

565189
traceroute	lan
if you are on a lan or you get a tie with bgp then fall back to traceroute

565196
getter	setter
your question is framed in the context of java where it seems that getter and setter are generally thought of as a good thing

565196
getter	setter
thus in java it is usually best to use getter and setter religiously so that if you need to you can override access to the variables

565204
getter	setter
the presence of getter and setter tends to indicate a smell if you are into that sort of primary school language that there is a design problem

565204
getter	setter
trivial getter and setter are barely distinguishable from public fields

565204
getter	setter
in some cases getter and setter are fine

565204
getter	setter
but as a rule a type with both getter and setter indicates design problems

565212
getter	setter
just fyi in addition to all the excellent answers in this thread remember that of all reasons you can come up with for or against getter setter performance isn t one as some might believe

565212
getter	setter
the jvm is smart enough to inline trivial getter setter even non- final ones as long as they aren t actually overridden

565216
int	boolean
to fill the table i run a query that returns int a1 int a2 boolean b3 and runs multiple data checks

565222
put	get
but every time you re inclined to put in a value and expose both get .

565227
getter	setter
what i m trying to say is that discussing getter setter vs public fields often obscures bigger problems with objects manipulating each others internal state in an intimate manner and hence being too closely coupled

565245
width	height
if yes how are they linked up ie how do you retrieve width height length for a given solid

565270
getter	setter
is it on a getter or setter or is it on a field

565272
public	protected
as a minimum each identifier with public or protected access should have appropriate javadoc tags and a description

getter	setter
getter and setter are very very evil

565287
getter	setter
unfortunately the language has enshrined the use of getter and setter in the javabeans specification so java programmers are forced to use them even when doing so makes no sense whatsoever

565287
getter	setter
but if there s one thing i d get rid of in java its the over-dependence on getter and setter

565290
getter	setter
getter and setter enforce the concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming

565290
getter	setter
the only ways the object can be manipulated are through exposed public methods such as getter and setter

565290
getter	setter
there are a few advantages for having getter and setter

565290
getter	setter
one of the big advantage of using a getter and setter is that once the public methods are defined and there comes a time when the underlying implementation needs to be changed finding a bug that needs to be fixed using a different algorithm for improving performance etc. by having the getter and setter be the only way to manipulate the object it will allow existing code to not break and work as expected even after the change

565290
getter	setter
therefore having getter and setter are one way to future-proof the class for changes which may come later

565290
getter	setter
another way getter and setter come in handy is to enforce the ways the object can be manipulated therefore the object is in control of its own state

565290
getter	setter
exposing the variables of an object will allow it to be manipulated in ways which aren t intended but only exposing certain ways getter and setter the object can be manipulated in intended ways

565290
getter	setter
i suppose having getter and setter would be more important for classes which are part of an api that is going to be used by others as it allows keeping the api intact and unchanged while allowing changes in the underlying implementation

565290
getter	setter
with all the advantages of getter and setter said if the getter is merely returning the value of the private variable and the setter is merely accepting a value and assigning it to a private variable it seems the getter and setter are just extraneous and really a waste

565290
getter	setter
if the class is going to be just for internal use by an application that is not going to be used by others using getter and setter extensively may not be as important as when writing a public api

565302
post	get
make the form action get not post

565337
hash	md5
otherwise you should use a different hash -- md5 sha etc will work correctly

565344
getter	setter
i ve been programming in java for few monts ago and i ve learned that we should use getter setter only when it s necessary for the application

565355
accessor	properties
objective-c 2.0 let s you declare properties and writes your accessor for you

565382
int	double
for very simple objects int strings floats double which are represented more or less as simple c-language types you can simply calculate the number of bytes as with john mulder s solution

565409
inject	interceptor
with this relatively simple condition to detect i think it would be fairly straightforward to inject a field interceptor on threadstatus to fire an event when the field is set to a specific target value

565455
nsstring	nsdata
i don t think nsstring is really the right type for the digest so it might be worth changing your method to return an nsdata if you can

565567
profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
or possibly memory profilers such as yourkit profiler jprofiler jprobe etc

565628
centos	linux
i have recently installed subversion onto a linux server centos and everything works great

565653
post	get
if you are using restful url s tempdata is a best practice for transfering messages from your post actions to your get actions

565653
post	put
add the message to tempdata in the post controller and put some if logic in the view and your done

565660
octal	decimal
first one printed as 83 because java takes 0123 as octal number and it prints decimal equivalent of that number

565680
udp	tcp
i m trying to change tcp udp of a virtual machine using vboxmanage setextradata

565739
public	protected
because this helper is private and only used inside one class throwing an argumentexception is not appropriate that s for the public protected interface

565752
google-chrome	safari
this problem also exists in safari and google-chrome

565779
min	max
several things that you can try in your application is to hard set the connection pooling using min pool size and max pool size in your connection string

565823
hash	md5
where alpha and beta refer to any characters within which will also be hash using probably an algorithm like md5

565824
post	get
i want to do some get and post inside my unmanaged c++ programs ideally i would like to allow for proxy server configuration or just use the ie defaults

565910
int	chars
you could loop through the input string and use the string.charcodeat function to get the int chars code for each chars

565933
disk	ram
buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk

566004
width	height
what i want is to make the table height according to the number of rows and if possible i d like the table to occupy full width also

566012
client-side	server-side
it s a server-side framework written in java with client-side sdks for java and c

566049
public	protected
in php 5 it is deprecated and you must use public private or protected instead

566050
opera	firefox
if i now move back and forward between the form and form handler using the browser buttons as some user sometime will probably do firefox and opera recalls the session variables and can populate the form handler

566051
hide	show
is it possible to disable this animation so it just show or hide to the correct size

566078
rss	feed
the real problem here is that there are dozens of small variations in rss feed and atom feed too so supporting all possible permutations of feed available out on the internet gets very difficult to manage

566078
rss	feed
anyway what s the best way to parse rss atom feed in an iphone application

566093
perforce	cvs
i have a legacy cvs repository which shall be migrated to perforce

566097
vim	emacs
vim and emacs handle long lines pretty well and they re installed on almost every unix box

566186
jtextfield	jtable
is there anyway i can inform jtable that the real editor is the jtextfield

566187
unix	bsd
keep in mind that a previous winner of the obfuscated c code contest implemented a pretty good tetris game for vt100 terminals on bsd unix in fewer than 512 bytes of obfuscated c

566191
installation	upgrade
vs2003 uses http a local installation of iis for example whereas vs2005 projects use the built-in server -- most likely the upgrade project is still trying to use the local iis which doesn t exist

566245
gif	png
the images must be a format that supports transparency so png gif svg and wmf

566256
width	height
if you want to simply want to get the width and height of an element irrespective of where the dimensions are being applied from just use element.offsetwidth and element.offsetheight

566301
wav	aiff
to convert wav to aiff open the sound file in itunes

566356
background-repeat	background-position
even with the transparent png support its worth keeping in mind that transparent background images cannot be tiled repeated using background-repeat or positioned using background-position

566364
stdout	stderr
as you indirectly suggest the junit testrunners redirect stdout and stderr to a separate stream while the test is running

566364
ant	maven
the stream redirections etc are not a part of the junit framework but are implemented by ant eclipse maven idea

566398
google-chrome	firefox
a quick check verified that these do work correctly in at least google-chrome firefox and ie since this works i m assuming you can use your method to have urls like

566451
installation	upgrade
then you could use your installscript as a bootstrapper to upgrade each installation separately based on your conditions

566462
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient is not cover my requirements so i m looking for a solution with httpwebrequest

566481
merb	ruby-on-rails
my previous experience with web development was with ruby ruby-on-rails merb

566546
inherited	properties
have both types inherited from the same type that have the common properties

566605
ceil	floor
i ve never used number.tofixed before mostly because most js libraries provide a toint method but judging by your results i would say it would be more consistent to use the math methods round floor ceil then tofixed if cross-browser consistency is what you are looking for

566614
versioning	upgrade
how can i force it to upgrade the system to a specific versioning

566731
for-loop	arrays
when the for-loop runs for the last time the variable a is set to the last element in the arrays n and it never gets touched after that

566782
strlen	substr
forth uses address length doubles -- their strlen is o 1 plus they can easily share substr

566964
matplotlib	scipy
for scipy the most commonly used plot generator is matplotlib for example

566969
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
unfortunately i proved in the process that this approach will not work for firefox and doesn t appear to work in google-chrome safari either

566971
rainbowtable	salt	rainbowtable	hash	hash	salt
salt the password to prevent attacks using rainbowtable looking up the password in large table with the precomputed hash and the associated password in clear text

566973
comparator	icomparer
you need to create a custom comparator class that implements icomparer

567025
gridview	objectdatasource
i strongly suggest you check out the code project s example of using objectdatasource and gridview as this is clearly the intended way to support what you want

567051
rss	feed
i have a script that reads rss feed using fopen fgets

567068
put	get
from my understanding i need the synchronized block in addtomap to prevent another thread from calling remove or containskey before i get through the call to put but i do not need a synchronized block in dowork because another thread cannot enter the synchronized block in addtomap before remove returns because i created the map originally with collections.synchronizedmap

567103
children	parent
if you query the parent remove a child object from the parent children collection and then call savechanges ef will generate the appropriate delete sql statements for you - you do not need to track this yourself

567116
biopython	bioperl
the bio projects like bioperl biopython or bioruby would certainly like some help too

567186
put	get
see also 6 different ways to get the current identity value which has some code explaining what happens when you put triggers on the table

567346
fgets	feof
btw in case anyone wants to dig deeper according to other reports of fgets hanging it seems it has something to do with the feof or lack thereof.

567392
intersect	contains
i count nine different cases categorized in the figure below by the number of vertices of the triangle inside the circle and the number of edges of the triangle that intersect or are contains in the circle

567408
jobs	cron
on this separate box a cron job runs all outstanding jobs every 60 seconds unless jobs are still running from the last invocation

567437
width	height
if you know the width of your panels left right header and contents and the height of the header you can give the header and the content a position absolute

567490
width	height
that said if you need the height or width you should probably use element.offsetheight and element.offsetwidth

567537
mouseover	mouseout
edit another suggestion is to disable droppable on all tds and upon mouseover of a tr enable the droppables of tds present in the specific tr and disable them back upon mouseout of tr

567542
sudo	passwd
in the python interpreter with a string i ll get the passwd prompt properly still doesnt work in a python script as in my original problem a list just gives the help screen for sudo

567556
put	get
that is in the past your application became faster when a new cpu was released and you didn t have to put any effort in your application to get that extra speed

567559
rar	zip
you could use a zip rar 7z tar.gz ... library

567569
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
eventhandle manualresetevent autoresetevent mutex semaphore - recursion not supported

567610
profiler	hprof
also try using the built in hprof profiler it can give very different results as well

567643
prerequisites	uninstaller
as a consequence any prerequisites must be installed by a separate bootstrapper by the way the installation is no longer transactional - the prerequisites won t get uninstaller if your msi installation fails

567648
equals	gethashcode
you probably ought to override gethashcode as well to make sure that objects that are equals have the same hash code

567653
writetofile	nsdata
if you re displaying an image that s life but images that are not on-screen can be safely unloaded to a file via uiimagejpegrepresentation and nsdata s writetofile atomically

567653
portrait	landscape
sample code for doing this is not hard to find-- see uiimagepickercontroller camera preview is portrait in landscape app for example

567674
3des	aes
on a side note which algorithm are most people using nowadays aes 3des sha1 etc

567706
3des	aes
on a side note which algorithm are most people using nowadays aes 3des sha1 etc

567706
3des	aes
certainly new applications should avoid 3des in favour of aes for symmetric encryption

567741
profiling	debugging
i ve been reading through apple s docs on creating provisioning profiling for distribution but i m not finding any information for simply debugging my app which is running on my device through xcode

567741
profiling	debugging
i m getting conflicting answers on whether or not i need to create an ad-hoc provisioning profiling to debugging my app

567741
profiling	debugging
if i don t need to create an ad-hoc provisioning profiling what else do i have to do to debugging my app other than having my development provisioning profiling and certificate for myself

567741
profiling	debugging
this link iphone development guide preparing devices for development seems to say that you do need a development provisioning profiling for debugging on a device

567761
profiling	debugging
no you don t need an ad hoc provisioning profiling to debugging an app you only need a development provisioning profiling and certificate for yourself on your device

567790
min	max
the contents may change and the max and min may not exist in certain cirumstances

567795
button	marquee
right now my button look ugly but the biggest thing that is irritating is that the progressbar control doesn t work in marquee style

567800
maven	m2e
we are using maven 2 with m2e plugin

567805
put	get
i can get it to work if i put a touchesbegan method on the main view but this only works when the user touches the view

567867
pop-up	dialog
it s probably not possible to get around this or else all the script kiddies would just use that trick but i thought i d ask as i can t be the only one using simple ie pop-up as pseudo modal dialog boxes

567874
folder	directory
i d like to create a directory in the user s documents folder but so far i ve only found out how to get the user s home directory

567893
mouseover	mouseenter
you might want to use the mouseenter event not mouseover

567893
mouseover	mouseenter
mouseover fires when the pointer moves into or out from child element while mouseenter doesn t

567895
gridview	linqdatasource
how do i reference that field deptname after i bound the linqdatasource to a gridview

567995
multiplying	add
in your lexer as you parse the integer string you must multiplying by 10 before you add each new digit assuming you re parsing from left to right

568002
mp3	wav
for most applications and certainly for wav and mp3 encoding you should limit the number of worker threads to the number of available cpu s

568002
cpu	processors
with hard disks you might be better off not using all four processers on you quad processors cpu

568028
gentoo	debian	gentoo	linux	gentoo	solaris	debian	linux	solaris	bsd
it must run nearly everywhere or at least on bsd debian gentoo redhat suse linux mac os x solaris and windows nt

568037
rbac	acl
there are plenty of flexible thoroughly-tested authorization libraries out there implementing rbac sometimes mislabeled as acl and my suggestion would be to find one that suits your needs and use it

568068
disk	ram
normally the tables are cached in ram or the data is stored close enough on the disk that reads can be combined

568102
lisp	scheme
it s all of the hard to grok things in lisp - closures macros continuations with none of clojure s java interop complexity cl s namespace confusion or scheme s name fragmentation

568123
x86	64bit
so in order to run our application in a 64bit environment i had to compile my project for x86 as you described

568216
width	height
if you really need to know getsystemmetrics with a parameter of sm_cxicon or sm_cyicon will tell you the width and height that windows wants to load

568232
accessor	properties
and synthesize just has the compiler create accessor methods for your properties so if it s not an properties you don t use synthesize or dynamic

568233
int	double
first compute as an int 1000 10000 0 in this case and then cast this to double

568239
int	double
what actually happens is the division is done and truncated because both numbers are int and then the final result is cast to a double

568290
csv	tsv
pack the ids into for example csv tsv

568356
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
it looks as if the haskellized api for wxhaskell is still being worked on whereas the gtk2hs project doesn t mention this issue at all

568375
disk	ram
i would suggest you write a 512 byte disk drive to ram copier that loads your program from the disk into ram and then jumps to the start address of your program

568422
min	max
get max fieldname1 min fieldname2 fieldname3

568430
std	ostream
in the original example std ostream is actually a typedef for the templated class and the same situation applies when calling the templated function

568435
objectdatasource	formview
i don t understand your question but after reviewing your code i can only recommand you to consider using an objectdatasource combined with a formview and stop doing business stuff in code behind

568441
gtk	fltk
in fact if you know you already have this stuff covered it would be beneficial to choose a toolkit that is simple and know it is just a gui toolkit like gtk or fltk

568471
put	get
put your classnames here and i reckon you ll get a goodly number of reviews

568510
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux
as i come up with linux i found the commands are different in opensuse and ubuntu

568539
xfce	kde	xfce	gnome	kde	gnome
if you want to program gui programs you need to make a decision about which graphic toolkit library to use qt gtk+ ... which would also imply the choice of your desktop environment gnome kde xfce

568554
kde	gnome
obviously you wouldn t want to use winforms on linux or gnome kde if anyone wants to be pedantic

568560
int	chars
anyways it works fine however and when i pass command line parameters to main int chars it works unless i pass seven eight or more than twelve parameters to it.

568609
debian	linux
this seems to be true for debian lenny at least and arch linux

568633
accessor	properties
the properties declarations specifically the synthesize tell the compiler to use these declarations to automatically generate accessor methods as needed to satisfy your class s interface

568655
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
close the bufferedreader which will close the inputstreamreader which will close the fileinputstream

568699
post	get
as a side note being web application developer you should already get your hands dirty with javascript see this really old but not outdated post by james bennett

568703
ubuntu	opensuse
opensuse probably has the most up to date packages of any distro without building your own ubuntu s packaging system tends to hold your hand a little bit more though

568703
ubuntu	opensuse
both opensuse and ubuntu are well documented and have good support forums

568703
opensuse	linux
i have used a lot more than 10 linux distributions and i now stick to opensuse

568714
ubuntu	debian
distributions using apt either with .deb or .rpm packages are debian ubuntu and its forks and others

568743
condor	lsf
there s also similar solutions in torque platform lsf and condor

568787
post	get
the test code is exactly like the one in the original post called by a method testperfomance in a loop which is surrounded by system.currenttimemillis -calls to get the execution time...but

568807
cvs	svn
we use cvsdude who do cvs and svn it s a pay service 6 month 250m works really well although maybe you re after something free

568917
agile	metrics
neal ford has a good presentation on metrics driven agile which talks about many tools that are helpful for java java ee development

569039

i have a weird situation where i open a form from my application hide it and when i try to show it a second time the visible property says true topmost true also location is correct yet i can t see it

569084
put	get
btw it should be possible to put an edit box in the toolbar to get the value

569125
int	double
that is basically an union for some arbitrary types and in addition a type-flag which stores what value is currently stored in that field e.g whether a double int ...

569128
jobs	cron
you ll be using cron to regularly create a fairly heavyweight ruby process and the timing of your cron jobs would need careful tuning to ensure that each one has sufficient time to complete before the next one comes along

569130
datalist	repeater
in asp we can use datalist and repeater to repeate the rows but how can we do similar in php

569145
drwatson	minidump
ideally i would like to be able to include a few more command-lines to the list of choices in vsjitdebugger that are available when a process encounters an unhandled exception using drwatson or using windbg to save a minidump for later inspection

569149
hide	show
just want to use plain java script to show and hide a div on the center of the page with please wait... message and disable the background

569156

569162
min	max
the available options are count max min avg sum none and custom

569179
ssms	sqlcmd
you can turn sqlcmd mode on from ssms or run your script in sqlcmd.exe

569250
boost	allocator
however if you feel that the person asking a question is a beginner and tries to understand for example memory allocator telling him to try boost smart pointers is a very bad idea

569293
firefox	safari
i need to rewrite a classic asp page such that it will be compatible with internet explorer firefox and safari

569328
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
the sqlcommandbuilder examines an sqldataadapter that is set up with a single query that selects from a single table

569343
post	get
i think that on top of reading one or two good books on biztalk which always helps and there are several good ones out there you could get a lot of help on the biztalk specific forums and newsgroups as well as here if you post specific questions as it s quite hard to describe an overall solution to property promotion or mapping

569360
children	parent
ii you can use struct memory alignment feature to cast children into parent

569361
boost	stl
i think a beginner is better off understanding how the basics work before moving up the food chain using higher level tool libs like boost or even stl

569402
post	get
i don t want to lose or corrupt any get or post data that is sent in the domain.com request

569402
post	get
will this cause the user s browser to re-send get post data to the www.domain.com url

569408
onclick	onmouseup
i have tried replacing onmouseup with onclick - same problem.

569412
boost	stl
i know i m not ready for boost i m not really ready for the stl either so in most cases i steer myself away from that type of suggestion

569417
hash	md5
i was wandering if for the run-time licence it would be a good idea to have as part of say an md5 hash for the licence key the calling assembly s or executable module - not sure company info or perhaps it s own strong name hash key

569500
width	height
there is no automatic clipping performed so you have to ensure that parameters top and left are not smaller than 0 zero and left + as well as top + are not greater than the width or height of the destination image respectively

569553
trac	bugzilla
for full disclosure there are other tools than jira like bugzilla trac ibm rational jazz etc

how can i get an asp.net web form v3.5 to post a file using a plain old

569618
udp	tcp
the udp protocol does not establish a connection like tcp does

569621
stdout	stderr
another question is is there a way to use import logging import logging.handlers to capture command stdout stderr

569636
ubuntu	debian
beware that the common lisp packages in debian and ubuntu are often outdated and rather different from upstream

569648
profiling	debugging
better debugging and profiling

569751
children	parent
i m programmatically adding a usercontrol to another in silverlight 2 by adding it to the parent control s children collection

hash	salt
bob changes the challenge every time he receives a valid message for example he makes a salt hash of the current time

569801
httphandler	httpmodule
in our asp.net 2.0 app we are using httpmodule and httphandler to calculate some metrics via cookies

569801
httphandler	httpmodule
to calculate network transfer time httpmodule endrequest stores transferstart in the cookie and httphandler processrequest uses datetime.now to subtract the transferstart to determine overall network time

569801
httphandler	httpmodule
request httpmodule onstart httpmodule onend httphandler processrequest

569854
floating-point	fixed-point	floating-point	integer
be aware that this fpu mode rounding is applied to floating-point operations in situations that might not be obvious when thinking in terms of the currency type which is a fixed-point type scaled 64-bit integer

569886
folder	directory
only the main web application folder will have the installation dialog so if you want to customize the virtual directory names then you will need to add a screen and set the property of the web custom folder to be the same as the field name on the screen you add

569940
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
lecture 08 is related to an assignment to build a uinavigationcontroller based app that has multiple uiviewcontroller pushed onto the uinavigationcontroller stack

570034
sharepoint	spsite
the internal sharepoint account is used when you construct your sp objects like spsite

570069
post	get
use the post redirect get prg pattern

570069
post	get
to avoid this problem many web applications use the prg pattern â instead of returning an html page directly the post operation returns a redirection command using the http 303 response code sometimes 302 together with the http location response header instructing the browser to load a different page using an http get request

570083
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
the alternatives include returning it as an ilist icollection or ienumerable for more flexibility or a whole different way as the code below.

570089
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable ienumerable t unless you specifically need a list then you should return ilist t

postgresql	mysql
i ve dabbled with mysql and personally i find it vastly inferior to better rdbmss like postgresql

570166
postgresql	mysql
i m getting increasingly frustrated by these apps that i want to use but they only work with mysql and i won t bring myself to use it because personally i find postgresql a much better database and because i personally feel that your database should enforce it s own constraints instead of doing this only at the code level

570168
put	get
edit darnit richard s approach use put from the backing array of bbuf_src won t work if bbuf_src is a readonly buffer as you can t get access to that array

570175
yacc	bison
consider using yacc antlr flex bison coco r gold parser generator etc

570182
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
does it render correctly as compared to the 3 major browsers ie firefox and safari google-chrome

570223
postgresql	mysql
i also greatly prefer postgresql but i think if you re planning to use other peoples php applications forums blogs etc it s just a reality that you re probably going to have to run mysql to support them

570226
postgresql	mysql
the thing is that the web apps didn t really need full power of rdbms so mysql gained huge popularity while postgresql was used by few

570247
postgresql	mysql
you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql

570247
postgresql	mysql
however mysql is so much easier to install and manage for someone who is just getting started that it gains a lot of adoption relative to postgresql

570247
postgresql	mysql
simple tasks like configuring a login and giving it specific privileges are very confusing on a postgresql server compared to mysql

570247
postgresql	mysql
also there were a few years early on where mysql offered native binaries for windows but postgresql did not

570247
postgresql	mysql
by the time postgresql did support windows natively mysql had a substantial lead in market share and name recognition

570253
int	double
for example if you wanted to have an add method that accepted an int object and double

570299
hex	binary
edit try to find a binary hex dump display in fiddler so you can find the bytes

570300
hide	show
i added conditions to hide the control if the text was empty and show it if it was not empty

570302
subtract	add
if you need to subtract or add members to the interface lots of stuff will break

570307
width	height
as far as i know if you want its background to be visible you need to set width and height for the span

570317
free	malloc
i d like to hear your feedback on the best way to free the allocated memory in case the second malloc fails

570437
ubuntu	debian
this works only on debian ubuntu et al check your system documentation for others

570472
put	get
parsers are not complicated if you know how to build them but they are not the type of thing that if you put in enough time you ll eventually get there

570474
rss	feed
i m not very experienced with dbms systems so i need some advice about which dbms to use for storing rss feed

570497
wav	caf
it supports read and write of a variety of caf and wav formats

570497
wav	caf
the caf file structure and wav are fairly similar

570530
rss	feed
any of the dbms can be sufficent to store rss feed the questions should be

570566
firefox	safari
cosmetic web bugs involving styling in various browser o s configurations a page looks fine in windows and mac in firefox and ie but on the mac in safari something gets messed up

570566
firefox	safari
these are annoying sometimes because they require so much attention to detail and making the change to fix safari may break something in firefox or ie so one has to tread carefully and realize that the styling may be a series of hacks to fix page after page

570586
equals	gethashcode
since your equals method uses structural equality make sure you override gethashcode with an implementation based on your fields as well

570592
vmware	virtualbox
another free solution is virtualbox from sun which is able to install on windows xp home which vmware server will not

570624
windows	wow64
wow64 allows using 32-bit windows application on 64-bit windows translating 32-bit pointers to real 64-bit pointers

570644
stdout	fflush
the real problem however was that the the streamhandler s buffer was not fflush until after stdout was reset to its original output stream resulting in the log messages not appearing in junit s output for stdout

570649
folder	directory
enable directory browsing and you can click the folder of the last build and so on

570651
google-chrome	firefox
20 in firefox google-chrome

570680
httphandler	httpmodule
in our asp.net 2.0 application we have the an httpmodule and httphandler

570680
httphandler	httpmodule
httphandler processrequest is not entered on every httpmodule endrequest which seems like incorrect behavior since my understanding of the flow of events

570680
httphandler	httpmodule
httpmodule beginrequest httphandler processrequest httpmodule endrequest

570681
put	get
i was writing some code a few days ago based on hallvard s hack #10 and it made me wonder how many events tend to get put on things

570701
onclick	onchange
maybe if you use onchange on the select and not onclick on option

570707
boost	stl
stl boost is a tool for the job

570724
min	max
you get a coercion mechanism with allows you to define rules for max min and present value of the property

570739
distance	polygons
assuming no distance falloff i should be able to use the point on the polygons i ve found and compare the normal at that point to the angle of incidence on the light to figure out my illumination value

570753
asterisk	ivr
i have deployed several ivr s with asterisk and what i usually do is test them on my machine by setting up asterisk with just sip having one sip user which i set up on x-lite

570753
asterisk	ivr
start asterisk run x-lite and dial the proper extension and it will be just as if you call your ivr in deployment

570762
unix	solaris
i need to run perl applications i develop on cygwin windows on hp unix solaris hosts

570762
unix	solaris
however would having an other linux installation help would this be possible easier between different flavors of unix like package perl on linux and then deploy to solaris hp

570809
awt	swing
often it happens to work but you are not allowed to do anything with swing components unless you are in the awt worker thread

570816
asterisk	ivr	asterisk	pbx	pbx	ivr
will you set up asterisk just for this or is it will it be doing other stuff such as pbx ivr etc

570816
asterisk	ivr
if you are doing other stuff with asterisk then set up a hidden extension one not advertised on the ivr menu which you can dial once you re connected

570825
multiplying	add
using the terms defined above you take the x y and z components of each of those unit length vectors multiplying them together and add the sums to get the dot product

570829
asterisk	ivr
i use asterisk for ivr implementations

570829
asterisk	ivr
i currently have an ivr with 8 e1 links 240 channels with asterisk and a sangoma card works pretty well

570829
voip	sip
and it s easy to test new features since i can run it in my machine with just voip setting up sip in asterisk and using the x-lite softphone

570865
httphandler	httpmodule
if i understand correctly httpmodule would get executed for every request which comes to your application while the httphandler would execute only for the registered extension

570918
listview	gridview
i have a window using a wpf listview gridview bound to an observablecollection

570945
pull	push
i d like to clone a pure git repo off this and then use git push pull to move changes between the git-svn tree and the git tree while also using git svn dcommit rebase to move changes between the git-svn tree and the svn repo it s based on

570989
getter	setter
i didn t make a setter for imagebyte but i made a getter that does the following

570996
mouse	keyboard
it has color-coded highlights for different types of events mouse keyboard etc.

571014
opera	firefox
acutally most browsers are pretty good in supporting the open standards including some of the oldest browsers in the world like opera which is like 15 years old and firefox which is to some extend based on netscape which is like also from 1993 or something i think

571020
xsl-fo	xslt
as long as you can make sure to use proper xhtml you could also use a product like alt-soft s xml2pdf to convert xml xhtml into pdf by means of xslt xsl-fo

571036
switching	screens
you should almost always animate any switching between screens in iphone os

571039
bash	zsh
another way assuming a shell like bash or zsh

571047
super	self
update i skimmed your code and it seems you are setting file.nzb to which uses its media_url and then in the delete method you are calling the delete method of the super-class of file as super file self .delete which is obviously wrong as it will try deleting file.nzb and will try accessing the file through the media_url

571049
gentoo	ubuntu
i use gentoo and ubuntu for development

571061
coldfusion	verity
for the verity part without considering coldfusion it s easy enough to detach a collection rename it and reattach it again

571067
folder	dir
getresource some relative dir will look for anything inside of the web-app folder

571095
gentoo	ubuntu
any of ubuntu slackware gentoo should be fine as a development environment

571095
freebsd	opensolaris	openbsd	freebsd	opensolaris	openbsd
if you are at all interested in making better code i also recommend dual booting or running a 2nd computer into a non-linux system such as openbsd freebsd opensolaris etc

571133
range	min
borderlayout only allows one component to be in each area so min range will never appear as maxrange is now the south component

571196
mp3	wav
if i were to do it again i would have also made a separate repository for media files we have lots of mp3 wav files that need to be in version control but alas they are under our main repo

571199
vbscript	vb6
when i wanted to handle byte arrays from vbscript like a blob coming from a database i made a general vb6 com object that could perform operations on the byte array

571213
hbase	hypertable
there are a few very good free open source alternatives to these namely apache hadoop apache hbase and hypertable

571243
innodb	myisam
innodb doesn t support fulltext indexing and myisam doesn t support transactions

571245
packets	multicast
however udp does support multicast so the same packets can be delivered to one or more hosts

571255
post	get	post	put	put	get
the way to get the best of both worlds is to put the fixed-length fields everything except the post text in one table and the variable-length fields the post text in another

571376
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are both deprecated

571400
comparator	comparable
for keys that aren t comparable or whose natural ordering isn t what you need you can implement your own comparator and specify that in the constructor

571407
move	drag
i want to be able to drag and drop to rearrange the order of projects and also to reorder tasks and move them between projects

571469
tcpclient	networkstream
quick question here is there any obvious benefit to use asynchronous communication with the networkstream class generated by tcpclient the beginread beginwrite methods rather than running a separate thread and using synchronous operations on that read write

571490
jquery	simplemodal
i have a page that has two tabs created using jquery and i am also using eric martin s simplemodal plugin

571564
post	put
actually richard pointed me in the right direction to take to avoid the issue nicelly in a reply to the same post i put up on the erlang googlegroups

571607
bluetooth	usb
i have written apps that use usb bluetooth serial ports and have never had an issue

571633
post	get
drm raises the bar a bit but not by much since as soon as someone works out how to get around it they just post a program on the internet and everyone uses it

571654
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
linux particularly debian ubuntu

571676
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
some linux distributions such as debian etch and lenny ubuntu and arch include the suhosin patch in their php package so on those systems you ll often find it s turned on by default

571676
redhat	fedora
redhat derived distributions redhat enterprise centos fedora etc don t include suhosin in their php packages

571783
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
first of all hi to everyone i m here just to ask something maybe very simple i m working with files fileoutputstream and fileinputstream but i just want to get set a few props from the file i mean the owner the file the permissions read write etc

571797
vim	emacs
for various reasons i don t use vim emacs though i don t suffer from terminal-phobia

571801
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome still doesn t know what it wants to be safari or firefox

571801
google-chrome	safari
both safari and google-chrome were failing so i figured hey once i fixed the safari problem google-chrome would be fixed automatically but oh no no

571815
hash	md5
there is a site called that takes a md5 hash of your email to load a profile picture

571850
folder	directory
i m currently trying to get all images from a set of disorganized folder and write them to a new directory

571859
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
you might want to take a look at monodevelop as well sharpdevelop which has been mentioned already

571866
ubuntu	linux
p.s. i am using boost 1.32 on ubuntu linux

571897
rss	feed
it uses an rss feed located at the web root under the name rss.xml to give an rss feed of the events to users who are interested in the service

571897
rss	feed
i have the blog piece done but i m not sure the best way to integrate an rss feed for the blog in to the website

571897
rss	feed
what s the best way to integrate the blog rss feed in to the website

571897
rss	feed
do i combine the event listings and blog rss feed in to the main rss.xml or do i need to pick one

571945
calloc	malloc
also i needed the array to be initialized to zeros so when i googled malloc i discovered that calloc was perfect for my purposes

571945
calloc	malloc
malloc calloc also has the advantage over allocating on the stack of allowing me to declare the size using a variable

571954
width	height
the window .load was needed instead of document .ready because safari cannot use the width and height functions if no width height attributes are defined on the image on document.ready

571981
sudoku	crossword
i am attempting to create a sukodu like crossword player in wpf and i realize that i have a whole bunch of controls that will need to know the sudoku grid to function

571981
children	parent
ultimately what i want is one property where if it s set on a parent ui element all children ui elements that knows about the property will share the same value overriding any prior value setting

572011
awt	swing
generally you re supposed to use swing or awt if you want access to the keyboard which is silly

572042
put	get
modelmaker is like any other good productivity tool - the more you put into it the more you get out of it

572083
typedef	struct
your original typedef if you look had typedef struct bucket bucket

572214
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
for more sophisticated date calculations such as the number of days within the ten million seconds after 3pm on january 19th in 1983 you would use the nscalendar class along with nsdatecomponents

572252
accessor	properties
this is useful when fields and duplicated by properties accessor and they don t need to show up twice or if a properties performs some substantial operation like what you re suggesting and you need to suppress it always so that the debugger doesn t evaluate it

572262
google-chrome	firefox
my page is working fine in google-chrome and firefox

572289
free	malloc
you may see the time it takes malloc new and free delete to return increase 10-fold

572296
mouse	keyboard
here i have done all move moving as well as mouse clicking opereations by help of remoting concept here keyboard operation is pending in that i could send keyboard values to corresponding focused controls.

572366
rss	feed
i whipped one up to output atom feed instead of rss

572570
inherited	properties
i think what you want is an attached properties with the inherited frameworkpropertyoption

572577
put	get
threads should get jobs from a queue and put back results on another queue

572622
ubuntu	debian
i highly recommend debian or ubuntu server for domain-0

572622
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu use the apt package manager

572637
opera	safari
but another solution could be firebug lite which works for internet explorer opera and safari

572640
pull	push
for this purpose they setup a shared git repo and exchange their work using pull push commands

572644
google-chrome	firefox
works on ie and google-chrome fine so ideally should work on firefox

572694
put	get
so put your memory to one side get yourself either a really quiet space or a pink noise generator and dive in

572699
springboard	backgrounding
apple and the open iphone community has plenty of programs running on the phone such as the mobilephone mobile safari and springboard applications that can run in the backgrounding and load libraries

572727
public	protected
sometimes public private protected protection level is not quite enough for real world situations

572751
punctuation	words
the idea of parsing the file using a dictionary your only other option really apart from randomly inserting spaces and hoping for the best and inserting spaces at identified words boundaries a real problem when dealing with punctuation plurals that don t alter the base words plural etc would i believe be a much greater programming challenge than correctly parsing the pdf in the first place

572783
width	height
how can i scale a div to 100 height and width inside of another element

572792
width	height
why bothing having a div within a div if its going to be 100 of the height and the width

572799
pow	sin
- but it wouldn t be hard to change it to return the result instead and introduce more operations like sin pow etc - presumably by mapping them directly to public methods on a helper object via expression.call

572808
gif	png
side note the chart should be exportable to png gif whatever

572840
ant	maven
i found maven to be a horrible tool so build everything with ant

572849
opera	firefox
helps with older versions of firefox and opera aswell occasionally

572872
post	get
here s a post to get you started on that

572876
google-chrome	firefox
i build it for google-chrome then i optimize for firefox most of the time its just little things then i go into ie 8 and then i go into ie 7 since most bugs i will have eliminated by then

572878
bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn	cvs	svn
all files under version control cvs at that time but look at svn or bazaar for example

572891
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
it s should be highly efficient as it uses sendfile underneath the hood but not entirely portable only linux freebsd and solaris are currently supported

572909
jar	war
it was a hideous mess including one war that had the weblogic jar inside it

572936
unix	bsd
i have used dos windows pc s all my life switched my main laptop to mac two years ago and have used numerous flavors of unix linux bsd while studying for my comp.sci

572938
mouse	keyboard
i guess think i can do this by registering every mouse movement or keyboard movement when users are doing on every page of my application

572946
mouse	keyboard
events are dispatched in a predictable order the runnable objects enqueued by invokelater are dispatched from the same event queue as mouse and keyboard events timer events and paint requests

572946
public	protected
whenever the toolkit calls a method that might be implemented in client code for example any public or protected method in a public class the toolkit must save its state and release all locks so that the client code can grab locks if necessary

573010
put	get
i am currently trying to put together an url where i specify some get parameters

573031
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
otherwise the big name web environments apache tomcat spring glassfish rails jboss grails weblogic ... are all commonly deployed on some flavor of nix

573033
width	height
css box model states that in the width height of an element the padding and border withs are not included

573104
int	chars
you can also use unicode and an int value if you need chars outside of the ascii range

573109
pop-up	dialog
we were using word automation but it s painful because word will do crazy things like pop-up a modal dialog which will break your code

573120
vim	emacs
but you should also probably specify what vim version you re using and how that thing in emacs works

573134
width	height
these classes worth with binary data or streams and can decode and encode several popular image formats and generate thumbnails on the fly off a high resolution store through different decoding and encoding height and width

573182
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
then you ll be able to get the date columns out of your database and into datetime objects in the standard way using mysqlconnection mysqlcommand mysqldatareader etc

573305
actionscript	mxml
if i include a an external actionscript file in a flex mxml file i get different behaviours at compile time depending on the method used

573307
crypt	hash
the old app used crypt in perl to hash the passwords

573321
joptionpane	jdialog
i would also recommend to look into jdialog or joptionpane

573335
post	get
following up this other question by the op i post an alternative method to execute a command and get hold of stdout

573355
nsmutablestring	nsstring
immutable classes such as nsstring but not nsmutablestring don t need to offer an actual copy because they cannot be altered

573384
int	chars
i m trying to cast a chars that is stored in stack to an int and this is what i did

573395
int	chars
that s then autoboxed to chars and so when you cast to int the cast fails

573395
int	chars
that should convert from chars to int then box to int and you ll be away

573395
int	chars
in the first case the cast is actually then redundant as the result of the subtraction will be int rather than chars - but i d leave it there for clarity

573400
int	chars
you can t cast chars instance to an int

573404
int	chars
or the a is saved as a chars in the stack rather than as a chars and then the conversion to int fails

573410
int	chars
you re pushing a chars not an int

573422
sorting	filtering
this will allow you to do the filtering sorting at the controller level while maintaining a strict correlation between the client and its data

573425
int	chars
convert the chars to an int

573488
width	height
i have a canvas of variable width and height with a maximum being 2k 2k

573488
width	height
this canvas current height and width vary depending on the user screen size

573534
int	chars
the simple way to convert a chars to an int value is to do

573535
hash	md5
you could then use the md5 hash of some field like filename to sort this into the right directory hash fabe063e.

573545
awt	swing
the java launcher is not swing or awt specific

573550
nhibernate	llblgenpro
you want to use typed business entities instead of data tables to more naturally access your data and aren t already using something like nhibernate or llblgenpro

573564
versioning	upgrade
i would be furious if large parts of an enterprise application just wouldn t compile because my team upgrade to a newer versioning of java

573568
sorting	grouping
this might be sorting projection applying a predicate grouping etc

573590
pull	push
git-clone pull merge push operations

573593
getter	setter
i understand the reason for it but over the years having to call setter and getter and the like has made code huge and noisy

573624
implements	extends
and this worked because the locator class would return the stub class which in addition to extends org.apache.axis.client.stub also implements the addfunction interface class

573634
versioning	upgrade
there are several different algorithms for comparison so if the default doesn t work for you try syntax aware or some of the other algorithms now i am using versioning 8 and haven t upgrade to versioning 10 so ymmv but i doubt that the xml diff has gotten worse

573638
hide	show
well why don t you get rid of sidebar and squeeze the table so it is without show hide effect

573650
textile	bbcode
another way to handle it is to allow the user to enter comments in some kind of simpler markup language like bbcode textile or markdown stackoverflow is using markdown perhaps in conjunction with a nice javascript editor

573657
xslt	xquery
from there i imagine it s possible to write some sort of transformation via xslt or xquery into whatever end result you desire

573661
firefox	safari
the website i m building for escondido arts gallery has all of it s text in each element left-aligned in firefox and ie but for some reason everything is center aligned in safari

573672
width	height
x and y are the width and height of the grid elements

573682
ienumerable	icollection
generally you should pass around ienumerable t or icollection t depending on whether it makes sense for your consumer to add items

573697
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

573724
stdout	stderr
is there a fairly simple way to redirect stdout and stderr to a text control or other visible place

573733
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout stderr and stdin using freopen

573752
stdout	stderr
when you create a process using createprocess you can choose a handle to which stdout and stderr are going to be written

573758
std	ostream
or you can do that with a std stringstream or some other class derived from std ostream

573762
put	get
you need to create pipe with createpipe then attach stdout to it s write end with setstdhandle then you can read from pipe s read end with readfile and put text you get from there anywhere you like

573763
subtract	add
in fact because you can add or subtract elements from a list i would argue that this makes the return value more mutable than an array

573824
google-chrome	safari
in webkit safari google-chrome you can simply do

573843
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
an array inherently supports ilist as well as ienumerable and icollection for that matter

573854
invokelater	invokeandwait
you could switch from invokelater to invokeandwait which will wait until the window is created

573861
put	get
let us know where we are falling down on the job or where you don t have a tool you need and we ll put it on the list and get to it

573869
opera	firefox
debugging one browser is hard but debugging ie 7 ie 6 firefox opera safari.

573873
pop-up	dialog
after you do that vs will pop-up a dialog asking if you want a different product id

573885
logmein	hamachi
heres a link to hamachi - aka logmein

573918
awt	swing
after learning on here that the java console doesn t support keyboard input a great deal i switched to swing and awt

573928
inherited	subclassing
inherited by a subclassing but is not

573936
awt	swing
i am familiar with java awt and swing so no need to explain these concepts to me

573936
width	height
it would be in the left and fill all available height while using a fixed width

573957
implements	extends
if you re a c# and java programmer every time you use a class that extends a base class but also implements a few interfaces you are sort of admitting multiple inheritance can be useful in some situations

574006
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering by cck fields in particular can be slow because cck doesn t automatically add indexes beyond the primary keys

574068
cherrypy	twisted.web
pure python web server eg paste cherrypy spawning twisted.web

574108
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i use sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader set sql string etc

574200
pop-up	dialog
but if i navigate to or firefox pop-up a dialog asking if i want to save the file or view it in a program

574232
folder	directory
i have another db that is in the mssql data folder should that be placed in same directory as well

574245
jobs	cron
i personally use cron but the jobs scheduling parts of django-extensions looks interesting

574249
ironruby	ironpython
also consider that you can write applets in any .net language including ironpython ironruby perlnet etc

574252
ubuntu	linux
i want to go learn web programming but besides names and a little of html i don t know anything.so i ask you what programming languages you recommend why what can be done with it tools to learn etc.i don t know if it matters but i program in a linux enviroment ubuntu

574262
int	chars
i would hazard a guess that the original author of the database perhaps thought that int 4 meant an int with up to 4 digits whereas it actually means an int between -2147483648 and 2147482647 displayed with at least 4 chars left-padded with spaces if need be

574272
client-side	server-side
the server-side language is python the client-side language is javascript inside django templates

574285
folder	directory
first of all i d to establish that i do have the text file in my folder directory

574291
accessor	properties
the self.view properties accessor calls -loadview if the view isn t currently loaded

574317
width	height
with full height and width and a header and footer

574317
width	height
with full height and width and a header and footer

574317
width	height
with full height and width and a header and footer

574318
post	get
post data is not added to the url like get so you don t need to urlencode it

574319
bash	zsh
i m partial to zsh it s like a blend of ksh and bash

574335
getter	setter
this isn t exactly what you are looking for but if you apply the attribute to the getter setter of the property it will prevent the debugger from breaking on the property unless explicitly setting a breakpoint on the line

574344
hide	show
i know that i can manually initialize destroy everything on the show and hide events but is there an easier way

574360
jar	manifest.mf
in the jar file you can provide a manifest.mf file that tells the java command where to find the other jar files as well as what the main class is

574367
centos	linux
i am on linux centos 5

574368
folder	directory
so should i still stick with the trunk branch tag folder convention even if i m fairly certain the branch tag directory will go unused for the smaller projects

574405
content-length	content-type
you will also want to set the content-type to text plain and content-length to the size of the file

574421
cpu	processors
vectorized instructions are not limited to cell processors - most modern workstations-like cpu have them ppc x86 since pentium 3 sparc etc...

574423
firefox	safari
i can reproduce this with both ie6 and ie7 but not firefox or safari

574440
firefox	safari
i don t get this error or any other error when running the same application on firefox or safari

574449
cvs	svn
i ve seen it implemented in a number of different organizations using different tools clearcase svn cvs to name a few

574452
actionscript	mxml
i am referring to whether you can use mxml markup in an actionscript 3.0 file in flexbuilder 3

574468
implements	extends
in flex you have the option of extends the sprite class or implements the iuicomponent class

574520
put	get
so on an insert the dto would get its get id like customerdto.customerid property set and then put in this result object

574520
inherited	properties
i suppose i could solve this by having a lot of the different kinds of result objects maybe derived from a base result and inherited the error properties but that doesn t seem very clean

574523
post	get
variables in a form can be sent by post or get methods

574523
post	get
- the combination of get post and cookie variables

574538
mouse	keyboard
if you record your mouse keyboard actions using one project you can then re-run those actions for a set of projects

574548
std	ostream
change std cout to a std ostream and then pass your file or std cout as required

574554
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout stderr and stdin using std freopen

574576
post	get
these are known as the post or get methods

574576
post	get
the post method is sent invisibly to the server and is meant for uploading data while the get method is visible to the user as the query string in the url and is only meant to literally get information

574576
post	get
for example a site could use post exclusively to get around caching by proxy servers or your browser or because they use double byte languages and can cause issues when trying to perform a get because of the encoding conversion

574576
post	get
_request keyname to allow you to grab the post get and any cookie information that might have been submitted

574654
hide	show
afaik there is no built-in way to do this so you ll have to do it manually by handling the show and hide events as you mention

574690
apache	nginx
in the meantime i was going to have nginx proxy all connections to that path straight to apache and let apache handle it

574690
apache	nginx
however i m on a memory limited vps and i d rather not run one set of php-cgi processes for nginx with their own apc cache and another for apache using more memory for their apc cache

574726
range	max
normally the exp range is - max+1 - max

574741
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
for native functions firefox ie opera and google-chrome returns a function with the body native code

574741
opera	google-chrome
it is tested with ff3 ie7 opera 9.6 and google-chrome 1

574741
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in that case the code above will work in firefox ie and opera but not google-chrome

574782
implements	extends
as i understand it you want to get a global access to some instance of player but would not need to extends some other class or implements some interface to do so which means you don t have to inherit any behaviour you just want access to one object

574782
implements	extends
you can implements as many interfaces as you like but only extends one other class but you have to reimplement all functionality since you cannot write any code into an interface just define what attributes methods a class implements that interface must provide

574796
move	drag
i ve created a very iphone-y slider element that is both restricted in overall movement horizontally 0-400px and it does not move vertically and snaps to either side of the 400px container when it has passed the 200px mark and the drag has ended

574803
awt	swing
also note you should always use swing components on the awt event dispatch thread

574811
children	parent
because the forkbomb code you provided dies if it cannot spawn a child process the parent processes do not actually hang around but the fact that the children keep creating new grand -children keeps the process table full

574811
bash	zsh
as has already been mentioned the important part of the zsh command is the run-in-background so the bash command would basically be the same as given in the other answers

574919
cpython	ironpython
some of my workmates are working on ironclad a project that will make extension modules for cpython work in ironpython

574936
width	height
first make sure your embed tag is alright width and height set to 100 css etc.

574949
keydown	keyup
you could use the keydown keyup and keypress events as well

574971
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you need to trap paste operations with the mouse use onpaste ie ff3 and oninput firefox opera google-chrome safari 1

574990
x86	64bit
i m thinking of upgrading my linux installation to the 64bit version of linux mint but i m worried that because the book is targeted at 32-bit x86 architecture that the code examples won t work

575038
put	get
also if i try to put a loop in start i get only a white screen even if repaint is at the end

575074
haskell	ocaml
as haskell ocaml java c and c++ which are all very very fast

575143
boost	stl
the main idea is that it must have been able to compile itself which means i cannot use stl boost etc

575153
versioning	upgrade
the solution to my luck was rather simple commons-pool is being used only by my webapp so i could delete it from all referenced projects otherwise i think i would just try to upgrade them all to a single versioning

575155
boost	stl
which means i cannot use stl boost etc

575155
min	max
consider andrej alexandrescu s efford to write template-function versions of min and max that behave as correctly as the macro version

575177
vim	emacs
i would like to have emacs which has a vertical hierarchy at the left-hand-side about items in the document similar to vim s plugin taglist

575192
boost	stl
a subset of c++ and in particular the subset which it uses in its own implementation so that it can compile itself then you should avoid using stl and boost in your implementation because the stl and boost are implemented using templates so if and only if you use them then you will have to include implement support for compiling templates

575197
postgresql	mysql
if you re used to thinking a relational database has to be huge and heavy like postgresql or mysql then you ll be pleasantly surprised by sqlite

575198
elf	coff
coff elf etc

575206
put	get
i put a condition to breakpoint and press f5 to get it

575210
inherited	properties
if you have class a with an instance var foo which has a properties synthesize directive and class b inherited from class a does it also need to properties synthesize foo

575265
width	height
of course we could increase the width accordingly but that s not what we would expect when we were to ask an object of declared type rectangle which is actually a square underneath to change its height

575285
mouse	keyboard
when requirements are communicated a language of symbols is used whether it is keyboard clicks mouse clicks or any other form of input

575293
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
what it basically does is getting some data from connected another device and send that data to the server periodically using nsurlconnection and read data from the server periodically and visualize that data as a graph using nsxmlparser

575313
range	max
you could also lock the table get the max key insert your rows and then get your max key again and do a range

575346
treemap	treeset
insertion time for a red-black tree which is used to implement java s treeset treemap is guaranteed worst case to be o log n

575351
draggable	droppable
couldn t you just use the draggable and droppable utilities instead of the sortable

575353
treemap	treeset
the treeset treemap etc

575384
inherited	properties
if you have class a with an instance var foo which has a properties synthesize directive and class b inherited from class a does it also need to properties synthesize foo

575390
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
both interfaces are part of the posix standard and nowadays both interfaces are available on most systems i just checked linux freebsd mac os x and solaris

575390
pthreads	fcntl
in most systems these are equivalent operations in fact under linux lockf is implemented on top of fcntl but pthreads says their interaction is unspecified

575393
pthreads	fcntl
fcntl pthreads locks

575473
sorting	filtering
anyone know were to find a plugin for jquery that can help me build a filtering pageing sorting for items like

575493
folder	directory
pdfcreator has examples for different languages in the com folder of the install directory

575532
wtl	atl
i am using a combination of the atl and wtl for a project and have derived my own class from cwindowimpl which looks something like this

575573
getter	setter
as mentioned most properties must have both a getter and setter

575579
invokelater	invokeandwait
if the above is impossible i d go with invokeandwait instead of invokelater as paul tomblin already suggested

575602
children	parent
which means that even though the children are running concurrently they can only be processed one-at-a-time because they are all waiting for the parent

575602
children	parent
how can i have the parent communicating with a children using pipes in such a way that it is not blocking

575602
peer	p2p
we are implementing a p2p protocol that uses a centralized server to manage the peer

575616
children	parent
to answer your concurrent parent question you will need to have the parent set up a select loop to handle possible responses from any of its children at any time

575641
lan	intranet
on intranet sites where all the users have high-speed lan access to the server but the ram available for holding session data is limited it may make more sense

575668
cos	sin
a cos ïˆ cos î a cos ïˆ sin î a sin ïˆ

575697
lisp	scheme
i hated the parentheses in lisp and scheme because after c c# and languages like that it seemed very obfuscated and it wasn t really clear how things are related

575706
gif	png
i m trying to create an image and write it to gif or png and i want it to use a black pen on a white background

575782
ready	each
so far i have just put a static pending... text into each cell that is not yet ready to speed up display

575830
jtable	jlayeredpane
if i needed to do this i would use a jlayeredpane to draw my animated renderers on top of the the jtable

575830
jtable	jlayeredpane	jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
jscrollpane - viewport jlayeredpane - jtable jpanel transparent with animations

575906
pull	push
this changes will remain local to this repository unless you decide to push pull them to another repository

575924
gtk	drawingarea
basically i have nodes represented as small dots on a gtk drawingarea and i update the positions of these nodes and redraw the drawingarea in a loop

575928
pull	push
there s nothing else you have to do -- you simply don t pull from or push to the libraryb repo any more

575934
irc	bittorrent
it comes with a lot of features such as an irc and bittorrent client which is important to me at school where there is a quota of 50 megs on disk space

575934
opera	firefox
most of opera s features are eventually available copied to firefox as plugins but i still prefer opera at home because the text looks better

575958
google-chrome	firefox
for some others especially many reading stackoverflow.com it might be flawed because their expectation is that google-chrome can also seamlessly import their firefox or whatever other plugins which was not part of google-chrome s original features

576040
swt	swing
in practice you would want to pick eclipse for swt and netbeans for swing matisse is great when you are getting started

576080
width	height
i have a number of objects each one have an arbitrary number of shared and distinct property-value pairs more specifically files and their related properties -such as width and height values for images album artist length for music files etc

576084
getter	setter
i d make the isoname property derivative the getter will return self.selectedlanguage.isoname and setter will perform the look-up for a given iso name and set self.selectedlanguage to that language object

576129
typedef	struct
if you are writing a c library where you don t want to expose some internal data-structure it can be good to go an extra route and hide implementation with a unspecified struct typedef

576152
hide	show
if you are making it so a user can only see certain info after selecting a drop down you can hide it in a panel and only show that panel when the drop down is selected

576183
super	self
note that the syntax changed in python 3.0 you can just say super .__init__ instead of super childb self .__init__ which imo is quite a bit nicer

576295
rss	feed
if you are focusing on creating an rss reader and not on rss parsing logic you might want to delegate creation reading rss feed using this free rss library called argotic on codeplex.com

576296
skip-lists	tree
a bloom-filter a skip-lists and random binary search tree

576296
skip-lists	tree
so as you can see the random binary search tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists

576300
rss	feed
if you re really writing a feed reader you might want to start with parsing atom as it s a more standardised format and might get you further faster with a good design to branch off into rss from

576305
floating-point	integer
numeric promotion is the conversion of a smaller numeric type to a larger numeric type so that integer and floating-point operations may take place

576305
int	chars
in numerical promotion byte chars and short values are converted to int values

576418
graphics2d	jcomponent
however defining a method with the signature with paintcomponent graphics2d like the following is legal but it won t ever be called as it is not overriding any method that is defined in jcomponent

576418
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

576457
button	checkbox
i would like to have an option during installation maybe radio button or better checkbox to have an option to choose both that would say install epson drivers and install canon drivers

576465
accessor	properties
you can do it directly in each test or by creating an accessor class that wraps all of the private methods properties including the constructor

576540
strtol	atoi
plus there s already an atoi function and if you don t want to use that because it s outdated a strtol function you can recast as an int if you have to

576552
rss	feed
most rss feed only list the 10-25 most recent items in their xml file

576552
rss	feed
is there any general way to fetch an rss feed so that it gives me everything and not just the most recent items

576587
rss	feed
in my experience with rss the feed is compiled by the last x items where x is a variable

576597
rss	feed
rss atom feed does not allow for historic information to be retrieved

576667
cpython	ironpython
in addition to that ironpython doesn t have the gil an issue that prevents cpython threads from taking full advantage of multi-core architectures

576750
unix	solaris
i have some applications and standard unix tools sending their output to named-pipes in solaris however named pipes can only be read from the local storage on solaris so i can t access them from over the network or place the pipes on an nfs storage for networked access to their output

576763
jsf	wicket
another team which developed a project on jsf is now thinking to shift to wicket after our success with it

576807
cos	sin
h t a cos wt + i b sin wt

576807
cos	sin	cos	exp
using the fact that exp iw cos w +i sin w

576816
width	height
i probably could have used a plain shell but capturing the width and height would have been a greater nuisance

576823
rss	feed
bother php and perl would be perfectly capable of downloading the rss feed and insert the data into mysql

576883
unsigned	short
on wince when using printf what are the qualifiers for various data types - short unsigned long etc

576886
groupbox	panel
in .net windows forms 2.0 radio buttons are automatically grouped by their container control whether it is a form panel or groupbox

576886
mouse	keyboard
specifically is there any canonical or known way of subclassing radiobutton or go all the way down to win32 apis so that every time the control is checked by using the mouse keyboard enter space bar and any other way that i could not be aware of selecting them i can trap the event and manually update the state of every other control on my form and in a way that the automatic grouping feature is well known to be de-activated

576959
put	get
just define a keyword then put in the url to which the incoming sms request will be routed you ll get the info such as mobile number and sms text in query string parameters then whatever output your web script generates you can use any web scripting language platform will be sent back to the sender

576994
int	boolean
use a boolean flag to indicate whether you are inside a comment afaik there is no bool type in c so use an int with 0 or 1 or more ideally two symbolic constants like inside_comment and outside_comment

577003
rss	feed
i found it easier to parse the xml directly instead of using an rss module i tried xml feed because you need access to specific tags name preview...

577007
getter	setter
so no setter getter wastes anymore it s stunningly simple to add notification also in a single place etc

577009
width	height
you should not draw a bigger portion of the image than you are showing in your application use the x y width and height parameters to restrict the drawn area

577024
scons	autotools
hence there are tons of makefile generators autotools cmake or makefile alternatives scons waf bjam ....

577065
folder	directory
make sure all the dependent dlls are in the path path meaning not the directory where your assembly is because asp.net copies your assembly away into a temporary folder but rather a directory that s included in the system path environment variable

577110
range	max
since x can be max of n-2 and y can be max of n-1 for range of 1..n

577185
put	get
i d put the unversioned files up on a web or file server accessible to everyone using the project and add a script to automatically wget scp etc. download the files zipped if needed and extract them to svnignored folders so that they don t get picked up by subversion

577199
maple	mupad
the version of matlab you are using uses mupad as it s symbolic computation engine but they used to use maple

577199
put	get
i have the most recent version of the maple version of the symbolic toolbox and when i put your expression into it i get

577207
int	double
my guess is that in the first case there wan an implicit conversion of double to int

577216
filesystems	fat
the ability to chain files together in what we now call file groups was a way to work around filesystems limitations and allow dbs larger than 4gigs on fat based installs

577291
spweb	spsite
with the code above your webpart is portable because there s no hardcoding and runs in the correct security context while disposing of all unmanaged sprequest objects created by the spsite and spweb constructors

577303
sorting	filtering
grid controls tend to be fairly bloated because they expose functionality for sorting filtering binding templating etc

577401
memcached	apc
zend_cache with apc or memcached backend

577439
int	double
stop using double and use int instead

577439
int	double
or if you have to use double in the order array you need to decide how to round any non-integer value that may be found in order to a int

577446
int	double
well the array subscripts x and y are not of an integral type like int but of type double

577450
put	get
get the highest even number below x and put this in y

577454
extjs	mootools
i don t use libraries myself but dived into some like prototype yui- extjs the seemingly omnipresent jquery mootools to learn from them and extract some of the functions or patterns they offer

577457
put	get
you can then either put this 2 into one of your pieces giving you the answer you suggested or you could split it out evenly and add get two pieces of 15 as suggested in one of the comments

577464
int	double
not sure why you are working with double but wanting int division semantics

577466
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox opera camino and safari

577633
min	max
a variety of things are provided as standard currency date phone zip min max value max length etc and there is a keystroke filter

577635
poptoviewcontroller	dealloc
now in viewcontroller3 if i do a poptoviewcontroller maincontroller dealloc is called only for viewcontroller3

577639
width	height
glviewport use x y width height and i would like x y width height rotation from center

577656
trie	prefix-tree
of course you can think of other in-memory data structures like a trie prefix-tree a judy array and the like.

577693
for-loop	arrays
i would like to use for-loop to go through each param and insert them into my own arrays

577793
installation	upgrade
store the installation location in the registry enabling upgrade to find the correct location

577817
16-bit	64bit
although c is close to the low-level manipulation of 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit 64bit data there are a few mathematical operations not supported by c which can often be performed elegantly in certain assembly instruction sets

577822
hex	binary
for the binary hex data however it does not get entered into the registry correctly

577843
dia	visio
dia - a diagramming tool that does the same sort of thing as visio

577844
altera	xilinx
however since the configuration memory can be corrupted in a sram-based design xilinx altera lattice you have to worry about that too

577853
photoshop	paint.net
i m currently looking for a hand drawing 2d library module that would be like paint paint.net or photoshop - but i don t need all the power of photoshop... that would allow me to add a drawing module to an ide application

577856
x86	mips
the x86 arm mips and others can however do the multiply in a single instruction

577866
int	chars
wxonassert chars const int chars const chars const chars const referenced from

577866
int	chars
wxappconsole onassert chars const int chars const chars const referenced from

577866
int	chars
wxappconsole onassertfailure chars const int chars const chars const chars const referenced from

577875
persistent	transient
if it s the former you will need to size your tenured generation with the size of your persistent objects + 20 or so and make sure that your young gen is large enough to keep up with the transient objects that are created during the course of your application

577949
subnet	packets
this includes the ip address but also includes mac address subnet mask transferred recvd packets description etc

577984
range	max	range	min	min	max
i don t think there is a built-in way like the ada range keyword but you could easily create a type like restrictedrange t that had a min and max value along with the current value

577997
min	max
min max values can be stored in a configuration if necessary

578047
mouseup	mousedown
see if you can find a way to use mouseup instead of click which is possibly working off mousedown

578100
versioning	upgrade
i don t know if there s such a thing as an official place but a reasonable thing to do would be to do what you ve done and refer to tomcat through a softlink at usr local tomcat or some such which would allow you to upgrade versioning by simply installing a new versioning in opt and changing the softlink

578142
width	margin
the right margin option is intended to show you the width of the page if you re going to print the code and has previous posted said it was set to 80 because that s what the line length historically was before gui all the way back to punch cards

578240
post	get
max_input_time â â â maximum time in seconds a script is allowed to parse input data like post get and file uploads

578257
cpu	processors
these include - getting the processors architecture and specific processors features accessing flags not in the cpu man i really wish c gave you access to the carry flag etc

578340
installation	upgrade
if you use your msi to perform upgrade as well as new installs the major upgrade only approach and you save your installation location in the registry remember to create a variable for the key name for each install

578427
gridview	linqdatasource
that binds the grid to the linqdatasource declared just after the gridview

578438
stdout	stderr
i am redirecting the g++ compiler output both stderr and stdout to a file on linux

578438
stdout	fflush
i read in some other post that stdout is not fflush after every line

578462
bash	zsh
sh bash zsh version

578488
boost	stl
boost lambda is somewhat helpful if you use stl

578497
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in the function below the bugs above have been removed and it has been tested in firefox 3 internet explorer 7 opera 9 and google-chrome 1

578504
actionscript	mxml
do you have a script tag in your mxml file that points to your actionscript file

578530
qtableview	qtablewidget
since you use a qtablewidget which is a child of qtableview everything works out

578530
qtableview	qtablewidget
qtablewidget and qtableview create default headers

578551
disk	ram
the os will swap out a process to increase memory for disk cache - even if there is free ram the kernel knows best actauly the samrt guys that wrote the scheduler know best

from ram and then write out the result to disk in one big i o

578764
disk	ram

578952
kerberos	ntlm
i suspect that what s slowing my down is the ntlm kerberos challenge response and the number of simultaneous requests pegs even the multi-core processor

579033
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
you could however use wsdl.exe or svcutil.exe depending on whether you want system.web or wcf-style client proxy to your services from the command line and specify the appropriate option for shared types

579036
pull	push
i have done exactly this in a spelling and grammar checker which not only pull out plain text from outlook and checks it - it can then push all the user s changes back into the html without destroying any tags

579135
google-chrome	firefox
note all of this code works fine in firefox and google-chrome

579158
swt	swing
remember eclipse create swt to solve the problems swing had back in 1.3 where is was simply prohibitely slow

579203
libsvm	liblinear
since the answer is also depending on the particular classifier i am mostly interested in maximum entropy models liblinear support vector machines libsvm and perceptrons but answers that apply to other models are also welcome

579206
rss	feed
i want to be able to show some items in the item description of the rss feed as html such as images links br etc

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tried every display property on this page and none of them preserve the ordered list numbers when displaying the list horizontally in ie nor are they preserved in firefox opera or safari for windows - and by extension probably google-chrome although i admit i didn t test every display property there

579434
range	max	range	min	min	max
the control caters for a min and max date so that date of birth can have a range from say -100 years to current year while credit card expiry might range from current year to +5 years and so we use range validators

579448
width	height
if you can parse edid you can read the width and height of the monitor in centimeters

579496
getter	setter
the place where i ve seen this is in webworks where a single class had tons of getter setter methods -- the setter used for dependency injection url args passed to the object upon execution and the getter for making values accessible to various page templates i think it was jsps

579496
getter	setter
so the breakdown grouped stuff logically assuming the class was called myaction there was myactionbasicargs fields and setter for basic cgi arguments extended by myactionadvancedargs advanced-option args extended by myactionexposedvalues getter extended by myactiondependencies setter used by spring dependency injection non-cgi args extended by myaction which contained the actual execute method

579508
getter	setter
especially for certain kinds of classes that simply provide getter and setter methods for their member variables without offering any calculation or transformation functions

579751
mouse	keyboard
you can enter by keyboard or by mouse

579751
mouse	keyboard
you can do it easily enough via the keyboard but they should have a second set of little arrows on the calendar to jump a year at a time back or forth using the mouse

579771
put	get
consider that the people at netbsd have to put in a huge amount of work to get cross-compiling to work and they re running the same os just different architectures

579827
kde	gnome
a solution that comes to my mind is if you have the opportunity of using gnome or some other widespread distribution as kde you can rely on the messages informations they give

579864
base-class	subclassing
the base-class would return null if the field has not been set and the subclassing would return your default value

579878
button	checkbox
i want to insert a row into a mysql database table that copies the url of the photo and other associated information with the click of a checkbox ...no submit button

579899

getter	setter
4 personally i hate naming my getter setter getx and setx but prefer to lean on the overloading mechanism and use xtype x const for getter and void x xtype newval for setter

580317
mouse	keyboard
it counts every key up key down press as an onchange event meaning that you can t navigate a redirect select list via keyboard killing accessibility for users who can t use the mouse

my friend has allowed me to have access to his server he has been coding php a lot longer than me and still uses php versioning 4.3.9 and doesn t want to upgrade this current versioning

580377
g++	gcc
you use -lpthreads when using g++ just as you would with gcc

580393
coalesce	isnull
coalesce and isnull are essentially just shortcuts for a case statement

580450
bazaar	git
if commits will happen to both repositories maybe a distributed versioning system such as git bazaar or mercurial is more up your alley

580450
pull	push
git for one even lets you pull from and push to a subversion repository directly

580455
inherited	properties
apparently the default implementation will only return direct properties from an interface and not the inherited ones

580455
inherited	properties
but maybe you could even write a generic typeconverter that would find all inherited properties by using reflection

580457
int	chars
here index1 and index 2 are simple int variables..the configstring is a chars array contains 127.0.0.1 7005 address and port number ...address and port are chars array variables to store address and port number

580489
boost	stl
rather than using shared_ptr with standard stl containers take a look at the boost pointer container library

580500
pull	push
you could also make a branch of the mirrored repository and use that as your checkout then your commits are also a local-only operation and when you re ready with a batch of commits you push them to the remote svn repository and pull other user s changed back similar to an svn update command

580500
bazaar	git
other than that i second using bazaar mercurial or git as others have suggested

580517
disk	ram
assuming each of your machines had 4 xeon six cores 32gb of ram a fast disk array and a highly optimized database for writes you could do it

580552
viewdidload	viewwillappear
instead of using viewdidload use - void viewwillappear bool animated

580584
folder	directory
i really just want the filesystem to set newly created files and directory with a certain permission if it is in a certain folder

580588
debian	linux
you should then make sure everyone runs with umask 002 or 007 or something of that nature---this is why debian and many other linux systems are configured with per-user groups by default

580593
postgresql	mysql
what i m looking for is a way to convert the access database to an open-source database such as mysql or postgresql

580597
versioning	upgrade
as you upgrade to new versioning of the other vendor s dll you will need to extend the mock dll to support any new entrypoints that your application uses

580597
versioning	upgrade
in both cases you will need to revisit this every time you upgrade to a new versioning of the other vendor s sdk

580611
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
normally the wsdl would provide a common type and when compiled through wsdl.exe or svcutil.exe you d get a shared common type to use across any number of methods in the same interface

580626
wtl	atl
this is because the creation of the atl wtl window must go through the atl class

580652
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
i ve written a c c++ memory manager for heap allocations overloaded new delete and malloc realloc free based on doug lea s malloc but designed to be wait free and seem to be having some trouble with fragmentation

580674
postgresql	mysql
either mysql or postgresql will work fine as a replacement data store for your access data

580690
int	boolean
the commented-out line as it is should work just use int values of 1 and 0 in your data to represent a boolean

580692
int	boolean
sqlite has no built-in boolean type - you have to use an int instead

580692
int	boolean
also when you re comparing the value to true and t you re comparing it to those values as strings not as boolean or int and therefore the comparison will always fail

580718
put	get
not all devices will store their information in the same column either so you may have to put some logic into your wmi results to get he format you re looking for

580754
nodevalue	innerhtml
that s because the property nodevalue returns null for element nodes so you return innerhtml instead which is gonna contain the whole html code inside an element

580768
put	get
if you can t think of any such reason you can definitely put it all in one assembly and split it later on during development when you have had a better chance to get the full picture

580791
post	get
get the print button to send a or post get with the details to the page you want to print

580881
implements	extends
have a read of the liskov substitution principle your collection is a very poor candidate to extends list it is not even a great candidate to implements ilist

580927
versioning	upgrade
make sure to check your project references after you upgrade from 2005 to 2008 for some odd reason the upgrade wizard does not upgrade references to microsoft.visualstudio.qualitytools.unittestframework and leaves references to versioning 8.0 of this assembly

580952
width	height
instead of display none you could try visibility hidden and setting the width and height to 1px each

580968
put	get
you may get a warning if you put the value of isprimitive directly inside the if statement

580978
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve made an event-handler that displays the pop-up when the mouseenter but i m struggeling a bit with when the mouseleave

580983

581036
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
try the geckofix script at it detects the firefox lower than 3.0 so you can customize it how you want by adding more rules to it like detecting firefox 2 firefox 3 opera and safari

581154
hide	show
write a client-side callback method to hide indicator and show download file that user requested

581155
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
nginx and lighttpd are commonly used for webservers either by serving python apps directly through a fastcgi interface don t bother with any wsgi interfaces on these servers yet or by using them as a front end in front of apache

581155
nginx	lighttpd
calls into the app get passed through by proxy to apache+mod_wsgi and then nginx lighttpd serve the static content directly

581229
tomahawk	trinidad
will you use myfaces tomahawk trinidad tobago

581271
lua	scheme
metatables are a particularly lua-ish feature of tables and other types but that is a really advanced topic that are the basis for most of the scheme for doing object-oriented things in lua

581301
free	malloc
just remember that any memory you allocate on the heap using new malloc that is free in the destructor probably won t be released back to the os

581314
tapestry	wicket
you ll probably want the aid of a web framework jsp groovy tapestry wicket spring mvc etc

581323
ubuntu	linux
use linux maybe ubuntu

581353
google-chrome	safari
my problem is that in fx safari google-chrome etc all the decent browsers this works fine

581386
getter	setter
question 1 i would like a getter and setter for a property to be grouped together

581386
getter	setter
maybe you can group your getter setter methods with their latest mmx tool

581386
move	drag
drag and drop sorting in the mmx class explorer you drag the method to the new location and modelmaker move the code

581387
unsigned	short
at some point in the future i might want to switch the buffer to a different type like unsigned char or short

581492
rational-numbers	integer
for example the rational class represents all rational-numbers so it can be directly represented as a fixnum or bignum integer by calling to_int

581515
put	get
call registerinterfaceinglobal to put your com interface in the git pass its cookie to your other threads which can then call getinterfacefromglobal using that cookie to get the original interface

581525
firefox	safari
it seems that firefox and ie will happily render a png image from s3 even though it has the wrong content-type header whereas safari doesn t like this at all and consequently won t render the image

581538
post	get
basic get post or ajax request

581543
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox safari and google-chrome see the first object and use the quicktime plugin if installed to render a control

581567
put	get
also not documented is the fact that you can put arbitrary get parameters on the url of your change_list page to filter the results

581630
mouse	keyboard
users should be able to have expected behaviour from a select list regardless of whether they use mouse keyboard or mousewheel or voice screenreader whatever...

581648
src	attr
line 3 get the current image s src with attr and replace img_t with img_l

581719
entity-relationship	diagram
as you will see from the entity-relationship diagram i ended up with too many pks in the link table in many places

581738
int	chars
note that as you re sending data over a network chars and other int types may not be interchangeable due to endian-ness

581753
entity-relationship	diagram
looking at the actual entity-relationship diagram - the er_lp url in the question - the tbl prefix seems a trifle unnecessary

581786
implements	extends
you could extends system.collections.objectmodel.collection and override the insertitem method to get the behaviour you want and it also implements ilist

581799
jobs	cron
a couple of cron jobs backup monitoring

581876
agile	sprint
this is allowing us to stay agile by doing a partial migration of one or two directories or several files inside one directory over a series of sprint rather than having to migrate the entire site in one go over a much longer duration

581896
freebsd	centos	freebsd	linux	centos	linux
it may not be a bad first step to deploy into a lx branded zone think freebsd jails or linux vserver for a comparison as the lx branded zones can run linux binaries and are explicitly centos rhel based

581932
boost	stl
boost interprocess takes care of that part and you can use stl containers like trees lists etc

581947
post	get
here are a few post to get you started

581966
temp	tmp
on my computer the environment variables tmp and temp both point to the same location

581978
temp	tmp
also i never saw using tmp every time it was talking about temp

581996
next	except
next you can take a look at the more complex pointers into a big byte array chunk except my advice would be to have a queue of 4k 16k some power of two multiple of the page size blocks that you index into and when it is full you add another big chunk to the queue

582007
versioning	upgrade
for example your wxs files specify the product and its contents which files you install whereas you would use your wxi files to specify product versioning upgrade codes common paths etc

582021
execl	fork
if you roll your own system using fork and execl you won t get that

582030
lwjgl	jogl
jogl and lwjgl both seem to provide access to a tinting mechanic

i found this space invaders tutorial useful as its a nice rosetta stone between java2d and jogl lwjgl

582042
rss	feed
i was using a rss script that was causing the html-encoded angle brackets to be mixed in with the real html in the rss feed

582042
rss	feed
but in my rss feed it was being generated as notice no distinction between escaped html and the non-escaped html

582042
rss	feed
that way it was displayed in the rss feed properly

582065
put	get
so if you put 5 objects in and your template on the read take matches all 5 it is unspecified which one you will get

582070
put	get
we had a defect where objects being put into a remote cache would get overwritten because of this

582126
firefox	safari
it s a nightmare to get it to work properly on mac safari and mac firefox thanks liveconnect

582130
temp	tmp
since there were no standards some dos and win 3.x applications would look for the tmp environment variable and others would look for temp

582130
temp	tmp
temp is the standard now but tmp lives on

582173
jboss	glassfish
using the appropriate plug-ins http requests can be redirected to an application server tomcat jboss glassfish or a script language interpreter php

582257
folder	directory
hence i wanted to deny access to that folder or move it to a directory that is not served as content by the web server

582263
post	get
if you were to give an input field a name like and then have the script that receives this data loop through the post or get variables looking for something matching the pattern you could pull this off and this would have practically guaranteed success regardless of browser

582318
spaces	delimiter
update added spaces to the delimiter

582366
vb.net	vb6
vb6 as any in vb.net

582392

582447
libxml2	libxslt
i uninstalled libxml2 and libxslt and am re-installing them fresh so we ll see what happens

582453
ssl	https
for development - there are ways to generate an ssl certificate locally so that tests with https can be done in an environment that you have total control over

582481
typedef	struct
what if the conversion was to a custom struct and what about typedef

582485
listview	gridview
the point is i have designed a way to create a margin of error when picking something on a canvas with a mouse and then reading the hole that the selected ellipse belongs to and then i can read the holepattern that the hole belongs to and my entire ui listview textboxes gridview fo coordinates are all updated by the existing xaml binding and the canvas is updated with one call to an existing method to regenerate the canvas

582486
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i have already run into problems with old javascript code which i thought was standards compliant by firefox or opera standards - which are pretty good but google-chrome was even more picky

582491
hide	show
are there any built-in ways to make the menu drop left from the dropdown button or do i have to set the menu s position by hand and manually show hide

582497
singleton	facade
the devicemanager is a singleton that functions as a facade for other classes

582545
versioning	upgrade
despite the fact that i d already upgrade libxml to the appropriate versioning which has been a problem i ve had to address previously when installing postgresql it was not working with libxslt

582556
hash	salt
i need to salt and hash some passwords so that i can store them safely in a database

582585
portrait	landscape
if your main concern is accidental orientation changes mid-activity that you think the device s sensors and software won t cope with well for example in a tilt-based game consider supporting landscape and portrait but using nosensor for the orientation

582585
portrait	landscape
this forces landscape on most tablets and portrait on most phones but i still wouldn t recommend this for most normal apps some users just like to type in the landscape softkeyboard on their phones and many tablet users read in portrait - and you should let them

582604
minimum	max
i want the columns of my html table to be the max of a certain percentage of the screen or a minimum number of pixels so if the user has a 1024x768 display the table columns won t be all scrunched up and may require some scrolling and if a user has a 1920x1600 screen they can get more information

582611
hash	salt
store the user id the hash and the salt in your db

582611
hash	salt
retrieve the hash and the salt from the db for the supplied user id

582631
folder	directory
i do have django in this directory but it simply isn t getting executed i have _ init _.py in all my directory under the tech folder and this is a copy from my own personal computer which ran off of the django test server so i don t think that s the problem

582728
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
to understand if everything has been fully loaded on the page you have to use the domcontentloaded for firefox and onreadystatechange for ie

582781
atomic	compare-and-swap
you might be able to turn the loop inside out using compare-and-swap to get an atomic lock free increment

582788
postgresql	mysql
usually i say to hell with dbms independence and do it with sequences in postgresql or autoincrement columns in mysql

582823
google-chrome	safari
for some reason safari runs a combo of border-radius with box-shadow just fine but google-chrome doesn t render the combination correctly

582824
opera	firefox
just remove the overflow auto part and close the inner div correctly with a closing tag that way it works in ie6 ie7 firefox 3 and opera probably all browsers

582868
gif	png
it basically creates gif like substance for ie6 and a real png with alpha transparency for better browsers

582877
hash	salt
since you are using the .net and c# use can use the system.security.cryptography.sha512managed namespace for generating the salt value and password hash

582946
getter	setter
inline can be used for small and frequently used functions such as getter or setter method

583002
i2c	spi
supports common embedded peripherals and interconnects including flash memory eeprom gpio i2c spi usb

it is unlikely that the dll is using a client supplied buffer as both client and server would need to know the base address of that buffer and you can t ask calloc or malloc for a preferred address at call time

583140
tapestry	struts
the one sticky problem i can foresee is if struts and tapestry have conflicting requirements for third-party libs

udp	tcp
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

584129
udp	tcp
originally nfs was probably used on low latency networks where there was very little possibility of error so the overhead of initiating the 3-way handshake to set up the tcp connection together with the bi-directional acknowledgement of all messages outweighed the simplicity of using a connectionless protocol like udp

584131
udp	tcp
udp is the default for nfsv2 which nobody should really use these days but nfsv3 use tcp by default

584131
udp	tcp
tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

584135

shiny and new pointed out that means you can filter different urls with the tapestry filter and the struts filter or servlet

584796
tapestry	struts
i ve used both and i would strongly recommend that you try to keep tapestry from having to deal with struts urls

584796
tapestry	struts
with struts you can pretty much hand-code the url so it shouldn t be a problem to link to tapestry pages but if you want tapestry to link back to struts urls you may have trouble using it the standard way

my guess is that blit will automatically use the result of image.size when you don t specify anything else and thus blitting the whole image from 0 0 to width height

586044
dictionary	map
what i m inclined to do is map a dictionary where each element in the dictionary represents a column in the table that way it will be 100 dynamic with regard to adding columns in the database and i would only need to update the mappingfile with which table to use if i m integrating versus a different system

586834
postgresql	mysql
i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

inherited	properties
if you make the classa.securitykey properties also shared that would make a little more sense but then the inherited relationship is no longer important

587207
inherited	properties
you might just as well say classa.securitykey inside that method because you would have to already know about classa to know about it s inherited properties anyway

587207

with interfaces you have to implements the combination s functionality yourself except one class you can extends

587501
children	parent
i added the parentid field you have just because i ask the direct children and parent questions a lot and that speeds those up

587532
hide	show
this bit works fine - i m using javascript to show and hide the divs which contain the large images but as the page first loads it starts loading all of the images at the same time

587532
hide	show
ideally i d like to use my current setup - just show and hide divs - and have the hidden divs start loading their contents as soon as the first pane has completed

587623
udp	tcp
as you are probably aware when a tcp udp message is sent on the wire the data being sent is wrapped or prepended with a corresponding tcp udp header

587623
udp	tcp
however if you re using regular sockets to send and receive your data the ip headers as well as the tcp udp headers are stripped off you don t get this information from the socket

587623
udp	tcp
use the ip and tcp udp headers to filter the data based on your client and server sockets ip addresses and port numbers

587663
postgresql	mysql
when i made the migration from mysql to postgresql several things really got in my way

587672
folder	directory
3 builds the code in the default directory which is the precompiledweb folder its a web app

587678
post	get
however when i post back the whole page i get an error about the state information is invalid for this page and might be corrupted.

587695
getter	setter
there s alot of talk about getter and setter being evil and what not

587718
getter	setter
i don t believe that that is what is meant when people talk about getter and setter because this is not simply setting a member to the given value

587718
getter	setter
i don t care for setter and getter but mostly because i think of my objects as higher-level entities in the codebase

587718
getter	setter
this allows much more centralized handling of exceptional conditions than the getter setter example i gave above

587757
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
for example if an exception breakpoint for runtimeexception is configured to suspend on subclasses it will also be triggered by a nullpointerexception

587774
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter for all fields and everybody and his dog have access to the object then that is very bad as there is essentially no encapsulation of the data

587775
accessor	properties	getter	setter
setter and getter are generally accessor methods for private variables properties

587787
3des	aes
i know asp.net 1.0 used 3des but newer versions generally use aes by default

587849
stdout	stderr
either freopen stdout and stderr with con or do the other linker compile workarounds there

587850
width	height
to check out the results add to the img tag with width and height set appropriately if necessary

587874
openbsd	linux
my only recommendations are go for a unix-y server linux usually but openbsd is very light and easy to manange

587885
hide	show
you can create your own alert component subclassing titlewindow and then use popupmanager to show hide them

587887
versioning	upgrade
note that this was working in versioning 1.2.6 and represents a possible upgrade issue

587918
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
file downloads done right have some links that describe how to do it for apache lighttpd mod_secdownload security via url generation nginx

587918
content-disposition	content-type	content-disposition	content-length	content-length	content-type
generate valid headers for the redirect in your perl app content-type content-disposition content-length

587922
postgresql	mysql
i dunno how mysql does vacuum s innodb tables innodb is mvcc like postgresql and so needs to clean up .

587933
inherited	properties
we just inherited mycontrols.hellocontrol and set the name properties and it looks like we re done

587979
treeview	expander
i m noticing that sometimes frame and form units which normally have an associated dfm file do not always show the dfm file underneath accessible via the little + treeview node expander underneath them

587981
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
so let s say i have a site and i do not have a crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml on it

588036
disk	ram
even in 64bit systems though you re not going to have a lot of control over what portions of your program actually sit in ram in cache or are paged to disk at least in most instances since the os and the mmu handle this themselves

588059
int	chars
are there any performance drawbacks in sql to joining a table on a chars or varchar value as opposed to say joining on an int value

588085
telerik	radwindow
i have a strange issue with a telerik radwindow that only occurs in ie8

588088
hash	md5
i take the raw tex and run it through the md5 function then i insert the hash into the database along with the current timestamp and use the hash .png as the filename

588089
firefox	safari
this works fine on ie firefox and safari

588099
int	chars
if you take a number in int form it will be smaller than the same number in chars string form

588104
int	chars
joining on a chars or var chars will normally have an overhead as opposed to joining on an int

588104
int	chars
each chars is represented by 8 bits a 10 chars value is thus 80 bits long compared to 32 bits for an int

588109
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome are flawless

588139
int	chars
an int is 4 bytes wide - so any chars value larger than 4 bytes requires more disk i o cache space etc

588160
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout

588182
rss	feed
using the new syndication api is there any smooth ways to read rss 1.0 feed

588182
rss	feed
do we realy need to create our own xslt to transform the feed from rss 1.0 to rss 2.0

588187
width	height
for 6 frame strip the image will have a width of 6 16 and height as 16 pixels

588226
post	put
i did see this post about url debugging but i don t think that helps because although i m writing a debugging console i want the runtime values and don t want to put in an extra layer of abstraction

588243
websphere	ibm
what benefits do i gain by using ibm websphere application server community edition over apache geronimo

588253
apache	lighttpd
apache process or lighttpd for

588267
mockito	easymock
i dumped easymock because it wasn t easy and went for mockito

588269
ironruby	ironpython
in addition to being free they are also a good way to get support for lesser-known clr dlr languages like boo ironpython and ironruby

588275
put	get
type p4 user to see your user configuration and then under reviews put the filespec of the area in depot where you d like to get notified on a check-in as in

588381
freebsd	linux
freebsd for example is based off the ports system where you compile from scratch although there are binary packages pre-built for much of it whereas it s often the case in mainstream linux distributions that you ll find a completely pre-prepared binary package for something popular

588445
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
what it basically does is getting some data from connected another device and send that data to the server periodically using nsurlconnection and read data from the server periodically and visualize that data as a graph using nsxmlparser

588457
crypt	hash
you can do this easily enough with a sha-1 hash and a secret or you can use full-fledged cryptographic providers available on your platform or in java if using java. you do not need to crypt it as long as no secret information is stored inside

588496
3des	aes
another solution is to send the password between your programs encrypted with something like 3des or aes

588599
superclass	subclassing
you need to invoke the overloaded method on the subclassing not the superclass

588599
superclass	subclassing
can you instead write handleevent methods for the specific event subclassing without having a handler for the event superclass

588622
conio	ncurses
i would like the answers to be cross platform if possible but i realize i will probably need conio or ncurses

588683
codeigniter	cakephp
third magento mvc is very different from the ruby on rails django codeigniter cakephp etc

588712
versioning	upgrade
not only does it break all precompiled binaries making it unnecessarily difficult to use precompiled binaries if you happen to work for a software company that makes use of third party proprietary libraries then whenever they upgrade to the latest versioning of visual studios - your company must now do the same thing or the code will no longer run

588715
perforce	svn
while leaving the live server on you start your import from svn to perforce using the backup

588715
perforce	svn
this is especially helpful if your migration is over large geographic distances svn and perforce servers are far apart because the large part of your import is done locally possibly on the same machine instead of over the internet

588718
svg	vml
i don t need the vml ie support in raphael or the plotting abilities of jquery svg

588721
google-chrome	firefox
other modern browsers like firefox and google-chrome provide better support

588726
gif	png
one thought i had was to write the list to an html table with the punjabi converted into a gif or png file

588729
typedef	struct
although it s probably a lot more complicated than this in the standard you can think of it as the compiler knowing about struct cell on the first line of the typedef but not knowing about tcell until the last line - that s how i remember that rule

588745
boost	stl
particularly useful is the algorithms header which you can probably begin using immediately without many problems with legacy code. if you re writing a lot of new code it s far better to use the stl and boost if you can than to write your own utility classes and algorithms

588749
daemons	launchd
relatedly are there any common tools for setting up the daemons for running on boot as appropriate for the given platform init scripts on linux services on windows launchd on os x

588753
cpython	ironpython
for ironpython 1.1 support whose syntax mirrors cpython 2.4 i successfully built and installed the sample from the visual studio 2008 sdk 1.0 with the professional edition of visual studio 2008 sp1

588753
cpython	ironpython
for ironpython 2.0 whose syntax mirrors cpython 2.5 there is currently no good way to write and debug under visual studio 2008 and unfortunately it would be a significant undertaking to adapt ironpython studio to host ironpython 2.0--one of the big updates in ironpython 2.0 was to base it on the dynamic language runtime and this breaks the tricks for enabling intellisense that were used previously such as static compilation

588773
folder	directory
put all of the files that you obtained into the lib site-packages simplejson folder under your ironpython installation directory

588784
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this should do the trick tested in ie7 firefox google-chrome safari

588813
post	get
the important thing is what is encrypted in you cookie post get parameter and how is it encrypted and checked on the server side

588814
ubuntu	mint
if i statically link an executable in ubuntu is there any chance that that executable won t work within another distribution such as mint os

588820
inherited	properties
set up your data layer to inherited from a base class which contains 4 properties for those values

588823
post	get
so as others have said post and cookies and get data query strings are all easy to spoof since they re all just text in the same http packet

588834
actionscript	mxml
the thing to remember when using actionscript instead of mxml is that the style properties are not accessed as properties on the object but through the getstyle propertyname method

588835
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian	gentoo	linux	debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
on linux systems the system s package manager portage for gentoo aptitude for ubuntu debian yum for fedora etc. usually takes care of installing the program including placing init scripts in the right places

588874
clang	llvm
it s not a 100 solution but the llvm clang static analyzer can be a big help in tracking down incorrect manual memory management usage

588874
clang	llvm
you can find the llvm clang static analyzer here llvm clang static analyzer

588880
width	height
i set height and width on the user control works on drop

588880
width	height
should i be using explicit height and width to get it all started

588890
profiling	debugging
you can verify the actual query that was run using sql profiling which is very handy for debugging these sorts of things

588891
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr

588904
daemons	systemd
to answer one part of your question there are no tools i know of that will do daemons setup portably even across linux systemd let alone windows or mac os x

588922
accessor	properties
by default properties accessor are atomic

588938
tabcontrol	expander
when i place this control on a tabcontrol page or expander control it appears as if data binding only occurs when the control becomes visible for the first time therefore i never receive any of the routed events until i swap to the tab the control is on or expand the expander

588963
width	height
this is done by setting the height width of a control to double.nan which essentially says i have no specific size

588997
width	height
that way we can see that we re taking the average of n samples of f x to get an average height of the function then multiplying by the width x2-x1

589079
ant	maven
if you wanted to get really fancy you could use the maven ant plugin to call the task that can send emails

589080
mouseover	mouseout
events are attached on mouseover and mouseout to switch the css class

589085
mouseover	mouseout
css menus can also take advantage of the hover property on the anchor tag which will work in the same fashion as a mouseover mouseout event

589092
unix	bsd
bsd and unix don t present or handle their system calls in the same way linux does

589141
implements	extends
the game has a custom haxcanvas class which extends gamecanvas and implements runnable

589213
nunit	mstest
do automated web acceptance tests using watin or selenium - this would still be written in your testing framework of choice mstest nunit etc

589239
udp	tcp
if you google and find some tutorials on ethernet in general the structure of packets how tcp and udp data gets from point a to point b etc then the information wireshark presents will make sense naturally

589281
width	height
just retrieve the current pixel height width of the monitor you re on.

589281
width	height
when you get within say 25 pixels or so of an edge your main form s location.left + form width or height your main form s location.top + form height then go ahead and set the .left and .top properties so that your application docks in the corners

589282
stdout	stderr
you re not making a call when you use popen you re running an executable and talking to it over stdin stdout and stderr

589289
versioning	upgrade
if you ever outgrow their ad-sponsored services you can upgrade to a premium versioning that doesn t include ads

589312
stdout	stderr
of course you should check stderr too or else ask popen to merge it with stdout

589312
stdout	stderr
update after looking at the related questions answers it looks like it might be simpler to just use python s built-in select module to see if there s data to read on stdout you should also do the same for stderr of course

589313
post	get
also response.redirect works better than a postback since that causes a get rather than a post

589326
hid	keyboard
granted you ll need a barcode scanner that supports the usb hid pos and isn t just a keyboard wedge

589362
keydown	keyup
otherwise in keydown keyup events set the e.handled property to true which will tell the box that you want to handle the input yourself and don t want the message to filter down

589363
implements	extends
you can extends httpservlet and implements runnable

589392
clang	llvm
it is specified only by the absence of nonatomic -- atomic was added as a keyword in recent versions of llvm clang

589392
getter	setter
if you are writing your own setter getter atomic nonatomic retain assign copy are merely advisory

589392
getter	setter
with atomic the synthesized setter getter will ensure that a whole value is always returned from the getter or set by the setter regardless of setter activity on any other thread

589392
getter	setter
that is if thread a is in the middle of the getter while thread b calls the setter an actual viable value -- an autoreleased object most likely -- will be returned to the caller in a

589392
getter	setter
if thread a is calling the getter simultaneously with thread b and c calling the setter with different values thread a may get any one of the three values returned -- the one prior to any setter being called or either of the values passed into the setter in b and c

589437
postgresql	mysql	interbase	firebird
you can choose between sdac for direct access to sql server or unidac direct access to sql server oracle mysql postgresql and interbase firebird

589471
children	parent
this will enumerate the tree in a breadth first fashion it will yield the parent element first then it s children and then the children of those children

589501
width	height
the div is created by setting its x y coordinates and height and width

589503
vb.net	vb6
in the middle of converting vb6 code to vb.net i need to replace the following code that intends to close all open forms remaining in the application

589520
post	get
i won t list the configuration in the web.config to keep this long message short but i can post it if anybody thinks they can use it - i just want to stress that i can call a method and get a result - string or even a json object i can read from as long as i don t pass any data to the wcf service

589546
rss	feed
i have a php script which parses an rss feed and outputs the top 2 news items

589575
16-bit	64bit
i know that it depends on the architecture 16-bit 32 bits 64bit and the compiler

589575
int	double	int	chars
i tried to find without much success reliable information stating the sizes of chars short int long double float and other types i didn t think of under different architectures and compilers

589586
integer	unsigned
you can expect std size_t to always represent the unsigned native integer size on current architecture

589586
16-bit	64bit
16-bit 32-bit or 64bit

589586
int	chars
there are five standard signed int types signed chars short int int long int and long long int

589586
int	chars	unsigned	short
for each of the standard signed int types there exists a corresponding but different standard unsigned int type unsigned chars unsigned short int unsigned int unsigned long int and unsigned long long int each of which occupies the same amount of storage and has the same alignment requirements

589589
getter	setter
make it private name it perfectly and give getter and setter public

589591
children	parent
if you want to get the parent along with whether all its children are active

589618
filtering	grouping
for my purposes i predict that most nodes are visible to most users so i feel that it is acceptable to simply to make the grouping by use the index as the filtering doesn t need it so badly

589619
firefox	safari
jquery takes a lot of the pain out of coding for the incompatibilities and quirks between ie firefox and safari

589625
integer	unsigned
if you need fixed size types use types like uint32_t unsigned integer 32 bits defined in stdint.h

589664
put	get
then when i put this code into my cvs clearcase i notice that these files get hijacked when a call is made to my service

589684
range	minimum
the c++ standard does not specify the size of integral types in bytes but it specifies minimum range they must be able to hold

589684
range	minimum
you can infer minimum size in bits from the required range

589684
range	minimum
minimum range required by the standard page 22 are

589684
unsigned	short
unsigned short 0 to 65535

589685
int	chars
that meant iirc that sizeof int was also 1 because both chars and int were 32-bit

589698
google-chrome	firefox
this is working well in google-chrome ie but causes a problem in firefox when i right click on an element my function that handles the left click is surprisingly called and then my function that handles the right click is called

589709
cobertura	emma
for code coverage i use cobertura but emma works too emma had an annoyance that cobertura didn t have.

589727
pdfbox	jpedal
pdfbox and jpedal also offer text extraction methods

589728
perforce	accurev	perforce	plasticscm	accurev	plasticscm
try accurev www.accurev.com or perforce www.perforce.com or plasticscm www.plasticscm.com

589836
free	malloc
i decided to try it out myself and it looked like all i had to do was change a few malloc statements to new statments and replace free with delete

589841
daemons	systemd
i know that ubuntu and fedora uses upstart istead of the classical systemd v init daemons sysvinit

589857
free	malloc
the last line could also be some error with your imagedata but since you said it worked in c and you only replaced malloc free with new delete it s unlikely that something is wrong there anyway you should check this too

589866
puts	gets
if the compression puts a heavy load on the server and or the compression ratio is poor a 20k page gets compressed to 19k then i would consider switching it off

589909
getter	setter
for a bean it is expected to have getter setter for all member variables

589962
portrait	landscape
s the best way to handle landscape portrait differences in ib

589968
serializable	deserialization	getter	setter
this is a good approach for me because it means i can call my getter and setter with the type and token methods during serializable deserialization

589974
queue	fifo
do you know any good examples or would you write your own lexer using regular expressions and parsing them using a fifo queue for the embedded messages

589976
accessor	properties
the dataset tables properties also got an accessor by string instead of int

589988
serializable	deserialization
the following url shows examples of serializable deserialization of json in c# by scott gu and the .net 3.5 framework

589988
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization

589990
getter	setter
so you can say x name or name and they will both be accessing the getter setter from the frameworkelement

590006
wordpress	joomla
i ve used wordpress and joomla to build a couple of small websites and done some hacking about to get them running exactly as i want

590006
wordpress	joomla
more bonus points if it provides an easy method to import data from joomla and or wordpress

590020
int	double
numeric types int decimal double byte 0

590044
postgresql	mysql
all major database engines that is oracle ms sql postgresql and mysql should should in theory support sql-92

590051
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
the integral value types byte 1-byte unsigned integer short 2-byte signed integer integer 4-byte signed integer and long 8-byte signed integer

590060
subtraction	multiplication
you can solve this with a program exactly the same way you solve it by hand with multiplication and subtraction then feeding results back into the equations

590060
multiplying	subtract
they are the same equation multiplied by two so you cannot get a solution from them - multiplying the first by two then subtract leaves you with the true but useless statement

590070
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
thanks to web standards all the other browsers you might want to target ie7+ firefox2+ opera safari google-chrome konqueror are generally close enough to intercompatibility that you will rarely need to do much browser detection

590074
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
most unix like platforms support the posix api some more some less and if you limit yourself to posix functions the solution will work in linux bsd mac os x solaris and similar oses

590107
postgresql	mysql
you will find that some database store datatypes differently for example mysql stores booleans as 1 and 0 and postgresql stores them as t and f

590108
postgresql	mysql
as for dbs popular with php it not that hard make sql portable between mysql sqlite and postgresql

590119
onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup
how can i get the id of a html control just by specifying the coordinates of a triggered event like onmousedown onmouseup onclick etc..

590129
wordpress	joomla
it has a lot of plugins support towards wordpress joomla and whatever you need

590147
postgresql	mysql
you don t mention which database you are using so here is a link about information_schema support in mysql postgresql and mssql oracle etc

590148
actionscript	mxml
edit if you re writing the class in actionscript instead of mxml you can apply the metadata tag directly to your class

590216
cpython	ironpython
one of the pros of ironpython is that unlike cpython ironpython doesn t use the global interpreter lock thus making threading more effective

590231
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i d like to guarantee that these variables get overridden assigned something useful in the subclassing that inherited from this superclass at compile time

590257
implements	extends
when i implements an rmi server implements an interface that extends java.rmi.remote is there a way to get information about the current rmi request context specifically the remote client s ip address

590300
rss	feed
personally i would install db first - the reason is that if you install db second the default feed for the start page is set to the sql teams rss feed and not the msdn one

590309
firefox	safari
i m doing something similar dragging from the parent doc to drop targets in the iframe and can see the onmouseover events fire for the targets in ie and firefox but not safari

590317
128bit	64bit
for example you can take advantage of the new 64bit general-purpose registers r8-r15 and new floating point and 128bit sse sse2 floating point registers xmm8-xmm15

590324
hide	show
but if you want to show only accordion heads then hide only contents dd or div or whatever did you use with display none

590345
opera	firefox
the page looks the same to me in firefox 3.0.6 and opera 9.62

590395
folder	directory
under the c users user appdata directory if found the folder that sql express was using and deleted them

590405
superclass	subclassing
the thing i want to do is to create a static method on a superclass so the subclassing can be converted to xml

590410
int	double
some improvements operations with double on 64 bits compute equally fast as floats on 32 bits as well as operations on long at 64 bit compared to int

590412
cpython	ironpython
while there was some consideration the official stance as far as i know is that cpython is not only a python implementation but it s meant as a reference implementation and it won t include stackless functionality because it can t be implemented by jython or ironpython

590480
bgp	ospf
our ospf implementation made use of red-black trees our bgp implementation made use of skiplists

590493
mp3	flv
as we re about to start planning an application that will handle media files mp3 flv pdf images i m thinking about how to handle the file storage

590517
tunnel	packets
and yes it uses head and not get but do note some not http standard servers send different results for head and for get the python environment zope is a typical culprit. also in some case network problems for instance tunnel + broken firewalls which block icmp prevent big packets to get through so head works and not get.

590526
fortify	veracode
you may want to check out veracode and fortify contrasting styles that automate the process

590527
outputstream	inputstream
the easiest way is to replace the inputstream outputstream from a socket in one of the programs with a proxy implementation that either prints logs or tees to the original and a print log stream

590535
mp3	flv
when storing mp3 flv and pdf files subversion might not be the optimal solution

590546
width	height
protected void layout int width int height

590602
width	height
jquery has height en width functions that returns the height or width in pixels as integer.

590620
httphandler	httpmodule
we have a performance measurement module that relies on httpmodule and httphandler and works like this

590634
post	get	post	put	put	get
it is suitable for performing basic http requests and interacting with rest-based services get post put delete

590686
margin	height
compare outer and inner height widths to get the total margin and padding

winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	jnetpcap	jnetpcap	libpcap
jnetpcap - wrapper around the native libpcap winpcap libraries exposing all of their functions and structures

590698
serializable	deserialization
so in essence as long as you know the proper type upon deserialization then the serializable of the proper type is trivial

590755
post	put
problem was solved i put the connection in the service config file however all post were helpful

590782
cpython	ironpython
feature lag since cpython is the reference python implementation it has the latest and greatest python features whereas ironpython necessarily lags behind

590785
builtin	isinstance
i don t work with django but it looks like you want the isinstance obj type builtin python method

590867
versioning	upgrade
the last versioning of wordpress 2.7 branch have auto update for core and plugins making it really easy to upgrade when a fix is available

590886
boost	stl
the only argument for increasing productivity with stl i can think of would be a possibility of integrating other libraries easily - boost arabica soci etc

590974
sqldatasource	detailsview
i am trying to use stored proc to insert record using detailsview and sqldatasource

590974
sqldatasource	detailsview
what i dont understand how the input parameter interacts between sqldatasource detailsview etc

590990
debian	centos
this is probably going to be platform and version dependent but on the platforms i use centos debian top normally displays the last part of the command run as the id

591046
subtraction	addition
i have implemented addition succesfully and i thought that subtraction was just a special case of it but it seems i am making a mistake somewhere

591046
subtract	add
we follow the same method as with adding float numbers except when we add the mantissas we convert the negative one the one we subtract into two s complement and then add them

591058
cos	sin
to verify if theta 0 this leaves the coordinates unchanged otherwise if xc yc 0 it maps 1 0 to cos theta sin theta and 0 1 to -sin theta cos theta

591099
rss	feed
is there a ruby class or project that processes rss atom feed and keeps a track of the items i have already processed

591147
pop-up	dialog
if a rich modal pop-up is really what you want though you can use jquery s dialog feature and put whatever you want in there

591176
serializable	deserialization
no time to work through this in detail right now you might have a look around google or so using the words serializable and deserialization

591202
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
another process either from a cron or running as a daemon executes the jobs as they show up

591265
subtraction	addition
if your addition code is correct and your subtraction isn t the problem is presumably in the two s complement and addition

591265
subtraction	addition
is it necessary to do the two s complement and addition rather than subtraction

591265
subtraction	addition
it seems possible to me that the handling of the hidden bit is proper for addition but not subtraction

591271
min	max
my guess from what you describe is that your hotspot will probably be branch prediction failures resulting from min max calculations using if else

591271
min	max
therefore using simd intrinsics should allow you to use the min max instructions however it might be worth just trying to use a branchless min max caluculation instead

591276
int	boolean
the best way is to choose a random generator that specifically emits boolean or int with range

591291
versioning	upgrade
however the problem doesn t arise on my own machine when i upgrade the same windows versioning to 4gb of ram

591314
awt	swing
the first obvious thing to always say is confine usage of swing components to the awt event dispatch thread edt

591322
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
throws illegalargumentexception instead of nullpointerexception

591323
post	get
i suggest you break the rest of your question down maybe post separate questions - you ll need to be a bit more specific to get many usable answers

591342
caanimation	calayer
my next step was to look into using calayer and caanimation to do it but after a quick glance at the docs they don t seem to indicate that it s meant for animating between images note i m not changing position or anything else just images

591345
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
for example if an exception breakpoint for runtimeexception is configured to suspend on subclasses it will also be triggered by a nullpointerexception

591361
disk	ram
i talked them into setting up a read-only database with de-normalized r o data and setup sql server running on a desktop machine cost around 2500 for the hardware and the 2500 off-the-shelf desktop pc blew away by a magnitude of 10x the performance of massive compaq quad processing server with gobs of ram and gobs of disk trying to serve the oltp batch processing and reporting needs of the unit

591389
floating-point	integer
if the integer rng produces 0 1 2 and 3 the floating-point equivalent will be 0.0 0.25 0.5 and 0.75 so the answer is to test 0.5

591441
put	get
if you put a bit more work into the modelbinder you could get it to work with the binder being globally registered - but the implementation i gave you above should work for cherry-picking values out when needed

591470
put	get
the get and put principle in section 2.4 is a real gem from java generics and collections

591470
put	get
the get and put principle use an

591470
put	get
when you both get and put

591538
unix	solaris
can t reproduce easy in test environment but in commercial env under unix solaris the core occurs but libumem shows nothing bad

591591
handwriting	icr
for handwriting you have the icr module

591600
inherited	properties
turns out it does have an enabled properties inherited from control

591644
int	chars
the issue comes when you use the value types like int chars or float

591674
folder	directory
on your web server the folder you copied your files into needs to be set up as an application or a virtual directory

591727
kde	gnome
if you re using a desktop environment like kde or gnome i d check the alt+f2 launching apps gnome-open is the one for gnome i don t know the name of the kde app and see if you can pass them the command to launch as an argument

591727
daemons	launchd
also if your intention is to launchd a daemons you should check the nohup documentation

591759
public	protected
essentially you make a wrapper class that exposes the private protected methods of the class under test via equivalent public methods pass an instance of the class under test to the wrapper and then use reflection from the wrapper class to invoke the private protected method on the class under test

591810
int	boolean	subtraction	addition
if you re looking at only int boolean and i think longs you have some options for atomic reads writes and addition subtraction

591844
disk	ram
it can make much better decisions than a static cache having awareness of ram usage by other programs and the position of the disk write head

591851
prefuse	flare
note that prefuse now has the flare package which uses flash

591861
children	parent
so when your mouse moves out of the parent menu item into its children the parent is still considered having the mouse hovered over it

591862
hide	show
will hide the part you want to show instead of generating the popup on the fly leave a small part already made and hide it in the begining when you need to show unhide and add the information you need to

591900
codeigniter	cakephp
i ve been using codeigniter myself after using cakephp for some time

591904
eruby	erb
as i understand it eruby is like erb - it lets you stick ruby code into html

591925
bazaar	git
maybe a bit off-topic but how about trying a distributed version control system like git bazaar or mercurial

591936
innodb	myisam
does this only pertain to myisam tables or also for innodb

591949
firefox	safari
the exact same code works great on firefox and safari outside of the iphone but once in the embedded webkit it fails

591950
versioning	upgrade
working out when and how code upgrade work the incantation to get a gen_server to upgrade to the latest versioning of a callback module code load mod sys suspend pid sys change_code pid mod undefined undefined sys resume pid

591960
put	get
just put this running somewhere in your window and associating it with the session guaranteing this is in all pages you get exactly how much time some user was in your page

591965
jqmodal	blockui
looks like both blockui and jqmodal can do this

592008
button	checkbox
does someone knows a way in javascript to download selected files for example i select through checkbox 2 files and then i click on a button in order to download these 2 files choosing the route where i will save the archives

592015
openbsd	linux
it works as expected on linux and openbsd and fails as you describe on os x

592024
post	get
once i clean my code up a bit i will try to post it somewhere where folks can get at it because i m sure this must be a common use case for people migrating existing apps to gwt

592070
put	get
all you need to do to load rails and get access to all your models etc is put require .. .. config environment.rb at the top of your file then you re away

592087
gridview	repeater
probably inelegant but i did this by replacing the gridview with a repeater

592090
tpagecontrol	tpanel
guy had a good idea but it didn t handle child control tpanel tpagecontrol etc

592100
getter	setter
however if you want to perform the formatting in the model you can use wrapper methods for the getter and setter and avoid having to use the value option entirely

592104
profiling	debugging
the debugging book for .net has some info on profiling but it is not very deep

592112
clang	llvm
to add another layer of certainty to this bug i would consider running the llvm clang static analyzer on your code

592112
clang	llvm
the llvm clang static analyzer is a standalone tool that find bugs in c and objective-c programs

592125
vim	emacs
having said all this i find emacs meta keys approach a little uncomfortable and a little daunting plus i have spent a lot of time learning to do things in vim

592125
vim	emacs
and if so has anyone else made this switch or used both vim and emacs and have an opinion about which they prefer and why

592127
gridview	rowdatabound
if that option is undesirable then i recommend that you use the gridview s rowdatabound event to selectively set the row s e.row visible property to false

592231
versioning	upgrade
at work we upgrade a tool when our versioning reaches end of support lifetime

592231
versioning	upgrade
we upgrade to the next-older versioning

592250
post	get
fiddling with http get and post requests to make sure validation is handled properly

592256
freebsd	linux
however some simple benchmarking shows this is dramatically slower than the pid_exists function on unix-based platforms linux os x freebsd where we re using kill pid 0 with a 0 signal to determine if a pid exists

592265
vim	emacs
using emacs doesn t mean you have to stop using vim

592265
vim	emacs
you will always be using the best editor for the job if you re able to choose between vim and emacs

592265
vim	emacs
the only way to know if you like vim or emacs better is to invest time in both so you can make an informed decision

592292
emacs	aquamacs
a very good emacs for mac os x is aquamacs

592319
folder	directory
you might want to at least consider putting them in a new folder in the documents directory

592409
mouse	keyboard
similarly for input we just substituted the event loop that checked for keyboard and mouse events with the corresponding windows event loop

592420
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i am using a javascript called facelift 1.2 in one of my websites and while the script works in safari 3 4b and opera omniweb and firefox it does not in any ie version

592455
pascal	delphi
part delphi 1 part turbo pascal

592479
innodb	myisam
just checked myisam locks innodb doesn t lock

592495
authorization	access-control
on windows you ll have to use the various authorization functions to make an acl access-control list with the proper permissions

592496
post	get	post	put	put	get
ideally i d post to a servlet get the loginid build the user and put it directly into the managed bean

592504
profiling	debugging
i can step through my code line-by-line while debugging and watch sql server profiling for every query executed but i can t figure out where all those sql commands are coming from

592536
filtering	grouping
if there will be null values of theese fields in table that will became an issue to filtering out useless grouping

592562
submit	submission
i solved this with another way using a button rather than a submit and using javascript to check the value before submission

592576
ssl	https
if you d like to read more on flipping over from http to https and vice versa - do take a look at at my writeup on selective ssl -

592592
udp	tcp
it supports tcp and udp alike

592618
firefox	safari
alas css does not support rotating images in any way shape or form unless you count css transforms which are only supported by safari 4 and firefox 3.1

592618
svg	vml
your best bet is to use raphael s image and rotate which should support all semi-modern browsers using svg and most versions of ie using vml

592640
kerberos	ntlm
kerberos is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site

592640
kerberos	ntlm
for a low traffic site the huge tokens that kerberos send across the network actually makes it slower than ntlm

592640
kerberos	ntlm	rss	feed
sure there is some functionality that will only work with kerberos rss feed cubes in excel services authentication of web service calls in custom code due to double hops but trust me when i say that ntlm will do a very good job of running your moss also

592655
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
but any update to any of my templated columns datagridtemplatecolumn or combobox columns datagridcomboboxcolumn don t work the underlying data source never gets updated

592677
spweb	spsite
it is considered a good practice to always check for null and dispose both your spsite and your spweb explicitly even though spsite arguably will dispose your spweb for you

592716
button	checkbox
using this jquery ui plugin you can customize radio button and or checkbox to look however you want

592722
treeview	tabcontrol
in vs 2008 i am attempting to design a windows form that is similar to a set of property pages but uses a treeview to select the page rather than a tabcontrol

592757
put	get
i am happy to put this text data in the datatable or in the datagridview after binding but i can t see a way to put this text data in either as the column formats for both require numeric data - i get a can t put a string in a decimal error for both

592770
post	get
the get and post values are passed as separate collections

592783
gridex	janus
i ve used the janus gridex for this type of non-standard behaviour

592828
post	put
usually i ll put the actual update fields in the post data with query data used to format the response

592830
opera	firefox
i have tested this on firefox opera and seamonkey

592860
post	get
are you requesting the ajax call via http get as opposed to http post

592860
post	get
ie tends to use cached results of ajax calls unless you use post instead of get

592913
put	get
the get and put principle that julien cites is a great answer to this question but i don t think it makes much sense unless you see it in the context of an example. here s my take at an expanded version of the get and put principle for when to use wildcards

592922
background-image	background-color
they define their own background-color but not background-image overriding the color in the body

592932
pull	push
there are only two secure ways that i can think of use svn by way of an ssh tunnel or use svn to pull push via ssl-enabled http via a web server

592936
disk	ram
creates mounts and formats a ram disk

592936
disk	ram
exports the trunk of the repository into the ram disk

592936
disk	ram
calls rsync to upload any changed files from the ram disk to my hosting provider

592936
disk	ram
unmounts the ram disk

592957
background-image	background-color
background-image and background-color are sub-properties of the background property

592957
firefox	safari
css3 allows you to set the opacity of the background using the rgba expression but ie doesn t support this firefox 3 and safari webkit do

592962
filesystems	ntfs
some filesystems offer special functionality that can be used for metadata - like ntfs alternate streams

592963
versioning	upgrade
one of the other good things about the abl is that it is extremely backwards compatible no vb6 nightmares when we upgrade versioning although some may say this backwards compatibility is a fault

592976
configobj	configparser
for the revised question of how to read in configuration parameters i d strongly recommend saving yourself some time and effort and use configparser or my preferred tool configobj

592983
readonly	temporary
i am constrained to what i can do with one sql statement and i have readonly access so i can t create a temporary table or anything

593094
lift	wicket
however i strongly prefer wicket and or lift especially the latter

593147
uiview	subviews
a uiview may not overlap its siblings so i can t make it a subviews of the window

593147
uiview	calayer
should i roll my own progress indicator that animates a calayer instead of a uiview

593160
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
while the sqldatareader is being used the associated sqlconnection is busy serving the sqldatareader and no other operations can be performed on the sqlconnection other than closing it

593160
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
thus i donâ t see how or why sqlconnection should still be serving sqldatareader object

593174
opensuse	linux
it is on my opensuse 11.1 linux laptop

593184
equals	gethashcode
you should override equals and gethashcode method

593200
uiview	subviews	uiview	uiwindow
uiview objects are arranged within an uiwindow object in a nested hierarchy of subviews

593200
children	parent
parent objects in the view hierarchy are called superviews and children are called subviews

593224
yacc	bison
you can use normal context-free parser generators such as yacc bison to generate regular language parsers even if the atoms are not characters

593253
post	get
it uses post to perform a data-handling process instead of using get

593265
union	distinct
this is probably not relevant but the list values is a list of distinct integers with the property that for a given value of asofdate the union of values over all values of key produces a list of distinct integers

593332
serializable	deserialization
its easy to use and a natural choice for serializable and deserialization of c++ data structures

593345
rss	feed
have you tried using feedity - for creating a custom rss feed from any webpage

593424
asterisk	pbx
asterisk the open source pbx uses the spandsp library to implement faxing

593458
joomla	vbulletin
it s the most popular method among php applications like joomla vbulletin gallery and numerous others

593459
vb.net	vb6
visual studio did all of the necessary service plumbing setup for the framework and i found c# very easy to learn migrating from vb6 vb.net and c

593461
firefox	safari
alas they re not yet present in all released browsers i think the latest betas of safari firefox and ie have support for some of these features but i m not sure which browsers support which apis

593483
onreadystatechange	onload
you can use the onload and onreadystatechange event to understand when the tag is loaded

593487
width	height
you may get 0 for the width and height if the image is not visible

593508
int	double
you are taking two int values and storing it in a double without typecasting.

593531
installshield	orca
it provides invaluable low-level knowledge using visual studio setup projects and orca that applies no matter if you re using wix installshield or any other tool to build msi files

593577
cos	sine	cos	sin
for instance instead of sin a or cos a if your application doesn t necessarily need angles to be very precise maybe you represent angles in 1 256 of a circle and create arrays of floats sine and cosine precalculating the sin and cos of those angles

593591
jqmodal	blockui
i did proof of concept modal dialogs with both jqmodal and blockui and i can say without a doubt that blockui is the thinnest of them

593605
firefox	safari
i m using some asp.net controls in my project especially webcombo grid for inline editing and i face t working good in firefox and ie6 but not in safari throwing exceptions

593733
children	parent
in general i would probably popen a number of communications sessions in the parent before spawning the children

593738
ant	maven
visualvm 1.1.1 is a nice alternative to using netbeans being a standalone app so you don t have to bring a maven ant eclipse project into it s project format

593738
profiling	debugging
run btrace scripts to add run-time profiling debugging advice to your code

593764
switching	screens
screens provides several virtual ttys you can switching between without having to open new ssh telnet etc sessions

593790
cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
in terms of changing the amount of cpu resources a process can use if you don t mind the granularity of per-core limiting of resources task manager can change the processors affinity of a process

593790
affinity	processors
if the development machine has many cores but the user machine only has one then rather than allowing the process to run on all the available cores set the process processors affinity to only one core

593830
bmp	png
java can display png jpg a some other picture formats but i have to display a bmp file in a jlable by getting the file path

593830
gif	png
imageicon support the typical png gif jpg images

593866
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
the common theme is wsdl.exe sharetypes and svcutil.exe reference

593879
getter	setter
how do i unit test a property with a setter and a getter like surname in the example

593879
getter	setter
writing a test that uses the setter to test the getter and vice versa is not good because if there is a fail i won t know which method to blame

593898
put	get
this will be combined with a bigger query but for now all i need is this to get started i ll try to figure out how to put it all together on my own

593901
put	get
the only problem with that is you can t put in something like hibernate without qualification as you get too many false positives

593903
getter	setter
don s waste your time on writing silly tests for getter and setter

593924
profiling	debugging
the debugging and profiling system of the xdk is also an amazing tool which is not available using xla

593931
boost	stl
stl and boost may seem logical to some and should be part of most but i worked with mfc for years before ever using templates

593932
maple	sage
they mostly use maple and mathematica but most of this work translates to sage

593943
google-chrome	firefox
both work fine in firefox and google-chrome

593945
getter	setter
testing getter and setter is an absolute waste of time unless there is something complex going on behind them....which is rarely the case

593989
getter	setter
if we had setter for name and surname but only a getter for fullname the test could look like this

594019
sorting	filtering
i want to have different sorting and filtering applied on my view

594019
sorting	filtering
i figured that i ll be passing sorting and filtering params through query string

594019
sorting	filtering
i want when user pressed sorting link after he applied some filtering - filtering is not lost so i need a way to combine my params

594027
fgetc	isspace
save the value of fgetc stdin to an int variable then test it to make sure it s a blank using isspace reporting an error if not

594027
int	chars
use an int not a chars because fgetc returns eof at end of file which cannot fit inside a chars

594094
kde	gnome
it could probably be done using a canvas or text box component in a full-screen window on whatever window manager you are using kde or gnome

594127
gridview	sqldatasource
here s a good sample how to easily insert row in gridview with sqldatasource

594246
post	get
you can do that in javascript - give them one class name and get them all into a collection and loop through the collection and then simply post the values using ajax

594262
google-chrome	safari
also my javascript focus request is currently not working with safari google-chrome browser so what is most compatible way to request focus and keep it

594264
disk	ram
if the rdbs server has enough ram all the data will be in ram and just saved to disk so as to allow recovery

594391
put	get
my activex control is coded in c++ and i already know how to create properties by implementing hard-coded c++ get and put functions

594428
inherited	properties
i ve tried using the prototype properties and various methods of real inherited but i can t quite get my head around what is going on with ie6

594436
int	double
in this case there is an implicit cast from int to decimal or double - because there is no loss of precision when you do the cast - so the compiler doesn t complain but the value you get is always 0 presumably since trackbar.value is always less than 5000

594444
mouse	keyboard
using the mouse and keyboard rather than watching is what builds muscle memory and ingrained responses

594446
mouseleave	mouseenter
ajax bind functions to the mouseenter mouseleave events of every main cell there you use ajax to get the detail table from the server and display in a positioned preferably on a fixed place or maybe a few pixels to the right of the cursor if it s a small table

594466
int	double
so i asked myself can a double be faster than a int

594500
int	double
about int vs.double may be gpu does faster arithmetic with double then regular cpu but i doubt it does double arithmetic faster then int since int arithmetic is just registers arithmetics

594552
int	double
you could say that adding two int takes this many cycles adding two double takes this many cycles etc

594561
int	chars
if you subtract a from the chars the user enters you ll get an int 0 for a 1 for b etc

594573
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately i don t know enough about integration with safari or google-chrome to help you with your second question

594582
cout	cin
i m taking some c++ tests and they are littered with cin and cout s

594583
int	chars	multiplying	subtract
you convert the chars insertered a b or c to int subtract 70 multiplying it with -1 and display the value in the messagebox

594590
cout	cin
yes as long as console applications exist cout and cin will exist

594601
cout	cin
no such questions are not very relevant but yes people use std cin and std cout all the time

594615
cout	cin
if you only ever write gui or web applications in your career you probably won t have much use for cin and cout

594635
getter	setter
i prefer field access because that way i m not forced to provide getter setter for each property

594665
micro-optimization	benchmarking
and ditto to what daniel said - don t go looking for micro-optimization like this until you have benchmarking your code and discovered that it s worth doing

594670
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
in the first we needed a consistent valuechanged event so that we could easily implement a dirty flag on our forms without a massive switch statement to choose between a textbox s textchanged event or a listbox s selectedindexchanged etc

594670
put	get
all three have the same effect in the end you get a new type of button to put on your forms

594730
inherited	subclassing
if i subclassing it to create a class f for example i want f to use the inherited drawing routines from a but to use the static class-wide path object declared in f

594768
sorting	filtering
your data sounds quite relational and the data stuff has a lot of filtering sorting linking functionality

594778
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are

hide	show
i was looking for that as well and i now just got used to using full screen shift+alt+enter which hide a little too much which you seem to think as well but does in fact still show the menus

594821
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this code works 100 ok with firefox and ie7 but google-chrome and safari do not seem to move the focus at all

594822
put	get
overall i think you need to put your foot down and get them to code it right without stifling their creativity

594881
decoder	encoder
one reason you may choose the numeric escape sequences would be if a transport mechanism in between your encoder and the intended decoder is not binary-safe

594881
decoder	encoder
just use utf-8 unless your method of storage or transport between encoder and decoder is not binary-safe

594916
post	get
looks fine to me - except i d probably have thankyou as a view - the register get perhaps uses a different view to register post

594957
min	max
note how the gauges are remarkably similar they all take a scalar value from somewhere and represent it by moving a needle to a position between min and max

594970
post	get
if you can post a url to download the workbook assuming it is not a trade secret you would be more likely to get an accurate answer

595048
apache	lighttpd
apache for dynamic and lighttpd for static content is one typical example

595049
binutils	glibc
also the reason i don t want to use any of the gazillion already build i386 compilers is because i plan on mixing and matching glibc binutils gcc versions depending on my testing needs

595084
haskell	ocaml
my understanding is that haskell ocaml etc

595125
button	checkbox
i have form with button and checkbox

595179
public	protected
can someone please explain to me what is the difference between protected public inner classes

595179
public	protected
but from what i can tell there is no difference between using protected or public modifiers

595179
public	protected
all of this compiles and is valid whether i declare innerfoo protected or public

595179
public	protected
please point me out a case where there s a difference in using protected or public

595186
public	protected
in the example shown the public and protected will have the same effect as they are in the same package

595204
installation	upgrade
upgrade your installation to the latest 8.2.x which right now is 8.2.12

595224
post	get
i ll post an update when i get my hands on something more concrete

595234
pascal	delphi
this applies to many languages including object pascal delphi

595345
yacc	bison
looks like it shouldn t be too hard to generate a simple parser using yacc and bison and integrate it into your code

595351
cout	cin
i ve worked on many professional applications and we ve not used cin or cout on any of them even for logging debugging

595351
stateless	stateful
one thing i ve learned over the years is that stateless trumps stateful for maintainability

595359
joystick	keyboard	mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick
simple directmedia layer is a cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide low level access to audio keyboard mouse joystick 3d hardware via opengl and 2d video framebuffer

595365
firefox	safari
iâ m assuming itâ s a windows bug rather than a browser bug since firefox and safari both support it as long as itâ s not on windows

595421
getter	setter
for classes that have several setter and getter besides other methods is it reasonable to save time on writing unit tests for the accessors taking into account that they will be called while testing the rest of the interface anyway

595426
solaris	bsd
is there anything alike for free net open bsd solaris windows

595439
struts	stripes
web client write once any mvc framework will work stripes struts even grails if you are brave rememder to keep it thin..

595443
getter	setter
if the accessors are simple getter setter i d say testing them is wasting your time

595451
accessor	properties
if there s a bug in an accessor and the rest of your unit tests don t catch it indirectly then i d start questioning why that properties is there at all

595455
union	distinct
i would try a distinct query and do a union of the two tables

595461
awt	swing
stick to updating swing components and swing text objects in the awt event dispatch thread edt

595471
uitableview	reloaddata
i m curious just how expensive in as far as resources go is uitableview s reloaddata

595476
getter	setter
is the getter setter accessing anything on the dal data access layer

595476
getter	setter
is it forseable that the getter setter will throw an exception

595477
getter	setter
when they are not simply generated getter and setter

595505
post	get
i ll edit this post if i get a chance to fiddle a bit with silverlight

595507
getter	setter
i m working in vs2008 and c# and i m looking for a free code generator tool to generate a property with getter and setter as well as the backing private field to go with

595537
getter	setter
how to generate getter and setter in visual studio

595638
udp	tcp
if a few bits were flipped in the ip header during transit and a packet changed course but the ip checksum was still correct the tcp udp stack of the redirected receiver can still know to reject the packet

595646
for-loop	loops
which is better practice - a for-loop with a break or a conditional loops

595649
accessor	properties
everything else is handled by the bindings and kvo systems behind the scenes and by your properties accessor

595649
accessor	properties
you must only change properties of your model objects by their properties or by accessor messages never by direct instance variable access

595660
unix	solaris
on linux and i believe solaris and other unix operating systems java s file.renameto method will overwrite the destination file if it exists but this is not the case under windows

595667
super	extends
it s also super easy to use and super easy to extends

595690
goto	break
break is considered a structured goto and should be used sparingly

595693
for-loop	loops
i would choose for-loop when there is known number maximum number of iterations before loops starts

595694
pop-up	dialog
say you want to pop-up a confirmation dialog before sending an email

595701
tabcontrol	tabitem
i am using tabcontrol and tabitem as navigationpane and navigationpaneitem

595714
loops	while-loop
note that i would still avoid using break in a while-loop however as this can muddle loops condition and make it confusing

595714
loops	while-loop
if you ll allow me to use a foreach loops i consider the code below to be a lot easier to read than its while-loop brother

595729
put	get
coming back to your actual question that of a deep copy you need to get the sub-elements of every element and put them in each element s dictionary

595731
for-loop	arrays
but in your example you want to walk an arrays of bounded length and using a for-loop makes it easy to do that and guard against running off the end

595734
pop-up	dialog
if your users dont read the dialog pop-up and they say ok i might consider asking a second time

595738
qsort	bsearch	qsort	strcmp	bsearch	strcmp
you might also look at the parameters for qsort and bsearch which require compare functions much like strcmp

595741
pop-up	dialog
you can make the pop-up dialog on unload to save form automatically even before the dialog is displayed

595766
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
and it does work fine in firefox but not in ie google-chrome safari opera they return all properties methods of the native array object as undefined using this test

595767
getter	setter
in interest of full disclosure i am one of those people that only adds a setter or getter when it is proven necessary

595768
firefox	safari
been working on this site for some time now works perfectly on mac and pc firefox as well as safari

595771
for-loop	loops
and it s nice to have everything you need to know grokwise about the loops rules in a single line at the top of the for-loop

595792
vim	emacs
the problem is if you want to open the executable in say emacs or vim or whatever it s not a matter of the executable so much as the editor doesn t know any other way to interpret it

595860
goto	break
the thought of not using break since it is just as evil as goto is pretty nonsensical

595863
int	chars
it supports matching of not only strings of chars but also arrays and lists of int and arbitrary objects

595870
persistent	transient
query cache locks are transient and don t persistent for any length of time

595882
post	get
if you are using a get method instace post in the ajax call the problem is the limit o characters you can receive

595899
postgresql	mysql
sqlite supports limit mysql postgresql

595899
interbase	firebird	informix	firebird	informix	interbase
interbase firebird support select first and skip like informix

595905
pop-up	dialog
pop-up suck use a modal dialog instead especially for something as simple as a notification

595930
unsigned	short
well you could pack it all in an unsigned short that s 2 bytes 5 bits for day 5 bits for hour 6 bits for minute .

595930
unsigned	short
edit use unsigned short - not signed short .

595936
hash	salt
my research so far has turned up this which essentially says salt your authentication token hash with the ssl session key.

595959
unsigned	short
6 bits for the minute equals an unsigned short

595966
multiplying	modulo
if you want to get the fields in and out by multiplying adding dividing modulo multiplying together the number of possible values for each field and take log2 of that divide by eigth and round up

595969
division	multiplication
do a bit of multiplication division to convert the values using the following formula as a guide

595969
integer	unsigned
so you need 20 bits minimum to store this value as an unsigned integer

596019
background-image	background-color	background-color	transparency
another way if it s all the same color is to make a background-image in gif that is more and more transparency and set a background-color of your choice

596054
config	ini
i use zend config ini for this and other settings are stored in sql db

596075
getter	setter
and the answer is when you don t need a setter getter for the field

596121
put	get
right now help tickets get put in for issues questions etc and they get assigned to the appropriate person pc tech help desk staff or if it s an application issue they can t solve in the help desk it gets assigned to a developer

596129
filesystems	hfs+
at least on the mac you can re-format the filesystems as hfs+ with case-sensitivity turned on

596129
filesystems	ntfs
i m not a windows user but there may be a similar option in windows native filesystems is it still ntfs

596129
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you don t control the developer s environments enough to force them to format with a case-sensitive file system then i think your only options are a pre-commit hook that checks for duplicate case-insensitive comparison obviously file names in the same directory or to modify your project to not use files with the same name and different case in the same directory

596150
children	parent
the element may not have an id and i can t assign it a random one for reasons beyond this so i can t apply my selector to the element s parent and look for children with the same id as mine

596154
allocator	stl
however for nearly all of the stl classes users do have a choice of where things are put in that they can specify an allocator

596154
allocator	stl
here are some details on writing your own stl allocator

596155
getter	setter
when you are binding to a particular field you have to use reflection to find the setter and getter for that field of the personobject

596170
mouse	keyboard
from a physical point of view he is comfortable with a keyboard mouse and can put together lego sets with relative ease so following directions with a fun outcome works for him

596171
width	height
maybe put a canvas inside another canvas and set it to 100 width and height to fill the outer canvas and give the inner canvas a max height and width

596178
rsa	aes
most of our applications are a good fit for 112 bits of security so that corresponds to triple-des or a small bump up to 128-bit aes for symmetric ciphers and a 2048-bit key for rsa

596187
width	height
each image can have different width and height and there are different formats ranging from black and white 1 bit per pixel over 2 4 2 8 2 16 2 24 or even 2 32 gray values or colours

596187
width	height
and of course it is much easier to simply create a tbitmap and assign its width height and pixel format

596209
ready	each
each one of those systems in turn has a redundant pair of systems ready to take over if both fail

596298
put	get
so my solution sort of sucks in that regard but it s kind of nice being able to use carray for a lot of different scenarios and it turns things like stringlists and datasets into things you can put a watch on and check for when you get to a specific value

596302
put	get
whether you put it on the second server or not what cf could do if you can get away with it you could put report requests into a queue and email them to the users as they get processed

596327
gentoo	linux
i run the synergy server on my mac and the client on both a vista machine and a gnu linux gentoo box

596389

activemq rabbitmq and it s publisher consumer system is something i m looking for

596444
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
in the latest rc1 release of asp.net asp.net-mvc how do i get html.actionlink to render as a button or an image instead of a link

596477
allocator	stl
i had an interview once where a programmer was testing my knowledge of the stl which i used extensively and was trying to get me to answer that a custom allocator was needed

596479
firefox	safari
how compatible is the ms report viewer control with browsers like firefox and safari

596507
superclass	subclassing
if you extends a class and add a couple of innocuous methods to it then check to see whether some object of the subclassing is equal to an object of the superclass even if the objects are equal in all important aspects you will get the surprising answer that they aren t equal

596507
superclass	subclassing
if you put a member of the superclass in a hash table as the key and then look it up using a subclassing instance you won t find it because they are not equal

596528
firefox	safari
i have not noticed any real issue with it being displayed in firefox or safari

596593
ienumerable	idictionary
microsoft.jscript.jsobject implements ienumerable but not idictionary

596593
ienumerable	idictionary
if i create a .asmx in jscript.net when i try to return a jsobject it gets serialized as an array because it implements ienumerable but not idictionary which means that only the property names in the object get serialized

596603
children	parent
element s parent and look for children

596645
updatepanel	onclientclick
clarification i can t call the js from onclientclick event because the page is inside of the updatepanel and i only want the js to execute when ajax request ends and it was triggered by one particular button on the page

596746
maven	cobertura
i ve got some projects that are already doing site generation via maven and i want to integrate cobertura reports in them but no maven goal i seem to run will generate a local preview for me to look at that includes the cobertura reports in the site

596746
maven	cobertura
below is what i ve added to the maven poms parent and module but the site i see when i run mvn site run does not include the cobertura reports

596746
maven	cobertura
what maven command should i use to generate the site with cobertura reports

596764
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up is working well but after dragging it to a different location then clicking the test partial postback the dialog is recentered to its default location

596797
srp	principles
should we worry about the srp principles in the case of viewmodel class or not

596828
superclass	subclassing
the latter essentially implies that no subclassing must extend the superclass s state but can only add functionality or fields that are irrelevant for the object s state and behavior such as transient or static fields

596828
superclass	subclassing
implementations using getclass do not allow comparison of sub- with superclass objects not even when the subclassing does not add any fields and would not even want to override equals

596829
folder	directory
when the command is called the destination folder files are wiped and replaced with the result of the new build assembly file are created as well as some marker files .as my website is getting bigger and bigger i have to transfer to the server all the assemblies in my bin directory and keep in mind which other files i may have modified

596832
hide	show
there is a jquery onchange event that fires and generates the list for step 2 and hide the step1 div and show the step2 div

fiddler	charles
charles and fiddler are http proxies that can throttle your speed among other things

596988
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
if you go further you might come to pylons or turbogears or django after that maybe zope but it grows bigger and maybe the pain as well as you always buy into the opinions of that framework

596994
avr	microcontroller
i haven t used myself but bascom is quite popular for avr microcontroller

597073
google-chrome	safari
it works on all other browsers i ve tested osx windows google-chrome safari ie7.

597138
x86	64bit
vs.net is extremely unhelpful in this case if you add a c++ library and c# library to the same solution and the c# and c++ libraries have both 32 and 64bit targets your solution will contain an any cpu target a mixed platforms target a x64 target a x86 target which is what c# calls 32-bit a win32 target which is what c++ calls 32-bit and maybe more

597140
vim	emacs
of course the emacs crowd says the same thing regarding emacs-style thinking but i gave up on learning emacs because vim was simpler and did the job for me

597152
vim	textmate
i m personally a very happy textmate user now after years of using vim gvim

597152
vim	emacs
if you do nothing else learn the basic navigation controls for both vim and emacs since they pop up all over the place

597236
ssl	https
to get urllib2 to open https urls you need python with ssl support

597238
debian-based	linux
the message also naturally occurs if the public key on the server has been explicitly changed which can happen for a number of legitimate reasons - a vulnerability in debian-based linux distributions in the not-so-distant past necessitated key regeneration for many people for example

597240
rss	feed
also get the rss feed for sites like ruby inside ruby flow and rails inside

597248
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
for most accessors mutators getter setter you do not have to

597248
getter	setter
or use getter setter if you like them and don t mind bit more verbosity

597248
post	get
and finally sending receiving requests plain old httpurlconnection works ok for get and post requests construct using say url.openconnection

597256
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie and firefox have solved this problem for the most part but google-chrome and safari are both based off of webkit which does not have a solution

597265
division	multiplication
for example a lot of people that started at a higher level have no idea why shifts are so much faster than multiplication and division or the impact of branching etc

597268
google-chrome	firefox
the function is below works in firefox and google-chrome

597312
datamapper	activerecord
i don t know the size of the project but it might behoove you to put queries in a common place or develop some layer based on a common pattern like activerecord datamapper table row gateway

597316
stdout	fflush
try a fflush stdout

597343
stdout	stderr
think about it - in some shape or form the names stdin stdout and stderr refer to global variables too

597345
accessor	properties
instead you d specify accessor for the properties assuming this is objective-c 2.0

597356
bash	zsh
now i use either bash or zsh

597384
listview	gridview
how do get the paging functionality like we have in asp.net gridview in listview control

597425
equals	gethashcode
the first thing i would look for is to make sure that you have explicitly implemented equals and gethashcode

597429
hide	show
this method is also helpful when you want to hide a column that is in the bound datatable but you don t want to show then you set width 0

597460
vim	emacs
it s definitely worth learning either vim or emacs

597467
post	get
i can t say about rapidshare in particular but if you see what the manual download is doing you can get curl to post the same forms for example

597548
getter	setter
use the getter setter to access the requesttimeout property of your remoteobject

597608
put	get
if i remove the which i was told to put there i get an invalid escape character error on the s

597620
apache	nginx
you ll need to run a web server on the vps such as apache or nginx

597620
apache	nginx
with regards to pointing it to the proper directory you ll want to set up an apache virtualhost or nginx server block

597627
post	get
and then i would implement a javascript call tying into the form s onsubmit event which would check before the form was submitted and only submit the relevant data to the server possibly through a second form on the page with the id needed to process the thing as a hidden input or refresh the page location with the data you need passed as a get request or do an ajax post to the server or...

597704
opera	safari
there are debuggers in opera and safari that i use if either browser is having particular issues

597709
typedef	struct
i think you d be better off defining your own types and then mapping them to the api types with wrapper struct classes and typedef

597737
folder	directory
then in vwd express 2008 i created a new tab in the toolbox i chose the .dll from the unzipped folder i used the control all is fine try it i recommend it but when i backed up my code copied the site and tried to run it on another computer i got a bunch of error all indicating that its looking for the dll file on my desktop but when i checked under my bin folder in my website directory the dll is there..

597741
postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql	interbase	firebird	informix	firebird	informix	interbase
the php version currently supports an amazing number of databases thanks to the wonderful adodb community mysql postgresql interbase firebird informix oracle ms sql foxpro access ado sybase frontbase db2 sap db sqlite netezza ldap and generic odbc odbtp

597741

the sybase informix frontbase and postgresql netezza ldap odbtp drivers are community contributions

597770
uilabel	uibutton
and if it s not a uilabel it may be a uibutton which contains a uilabel etc

597799
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
the .net system.componentmodel namespace comes with an ieditableobject interface you could also use inotifypropertychanging and inotifypropertychanged

597808
firefox	safari
this isn t guaranteed to work as __proto__ isn t a standard variable but it works at least in firefox and safari

597813
ubuntu	linux
note i d like this to be cross-platform but since from the first answers this doesn t seem to be possible i m working under macos and ubuntu linux so bash

597815
post	get
i would not use a http get method to delete records from the database i would use post

597846
button	checkbox
the form has a text field some checkbox a set of radio button and two text boxes

597846
post	get
what are the pluses and minuses of using get over post and vice versa

597846
post	get
i always thought you should use get for retrieving the form and post for submitting but i ve just learnt you can do both

597847
northwind	adventureworks
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind

597850
post	get
the html specifications technically define the difference between both as get means that form data is to be encoded by a browser into a url while the post means that the form data is to appear within a message body

597850
post	get
as a simplification we might say that get is basically for just getting retrieving data whereas post may involve anything like storing or updating data or ordering a product or sending e-mail

597852
post	get
both get and post hold intrinsic meaning if you re making an html-based api

597852
post	get
but in general get is used for fetching data post is used for submitting data

597852
post	get
the biggest difference is that get puts all the data in the url which can be limited in size while post sends it as a data part of the http request

597852
post	get
in addition no browser will warn the user if they refresh a get page that does data entry which would make a duplicate entry if you re not careful but on a post most browsers will show a warning

597854
post	get
get requests are always added to the url where as post is submitted with the body of the request

597858
post	get
using get for critical data such as sending password over a get request will expose the password more than post because it ll be stored in browser s history cache proxy caches server logs etc

597879
dbf	dbase
the dbf might well be a dbase file which is easy enough to read and the .bak is probably a backup of one of the other important files or just a backup left by a text editor

597879
hex	binary
if this doesn t give you a good result try opening them in a binary editor that shows side by side hex and ascii with control characters blanked out

597934
kde	gnome
there s no single standard terminal command on linux - the ones available depend on which gui is present whether kde or gnome etc

597936
gtk	vte
edit2 maybe your needs can be served by vte which is a gtk component for embedding a terminal

598013
width	height
you have forgot to put the width and height d put this for ex

598072
dbf	dbase
as others have suggested i recommend a hex editor if you can t figure out what those files are and that dbf is probably dbase

598092
inherited	properties
in order for properties to work correctly you need to use new-style classes instead inherited from object

598093
width	height
in ie6 when you dynamically generate an iframe via javascript the iframe sometimes doesn t fill its container automatically even with width and height set to max

598193
mouseup	mousedown
to draw a selection rectangle from the mousedown mouse move then remove it on mouseup i currently do the following

598193
width	height
i update his width and height related the the mouse move position

598213
paradox	btrieve
.dat was used by btrieve and iirc paradox for dos

598221
versioning	upgrade
if you use common language idioms then you ll see all the benefits of fast prototyping and clean design and your code will naturally run faster as new versioning of python are released and the computer hardware is upgrade

598257
ready	each
assuming there s a 1 cycle latency between each it ll take 3 cycles from 1 is complete until the result of 4 is ready and we can call the function

598276
mouseleave	mouseenter
so mouseenter and mouseleave are fired twice

598276
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
in internet explorer 7 firefox 3 opera and safari both events are fired only once

598376
content-disposition	content-type
we ve alternated between forcing the download using content-disposition attachment + content-type application octet-stream and actually returning the proper mime type

598408
disk	ram
the database pages that needed to be read were only loaded from disk the first time - the second time they were still cached in ram

598449
scons	autotools
but if you compare to make alone not autotools scons alone is superiour

598507
hide	show
you might not need to show it all at once let me expand areas if i want more hide stuff i don t want to use

implements	modifiers
to access your members functions implements in custom code of ssrs report you should set the access modifiers to public

598518
postgresql	mysql
at the database level by enabling appropriate logging or by looking at the database statistics show table status like my_table on mysql select sum avg_width from pg_stats where table_name like my_table for postgresql etc. for the average row size of the tables of interest provided that the database supports it you need to specify the database you are using otherwise you can compute your own statistics from a database dump

598599
installation	upgrade
not only does this make installation simpler the application remains stable and working the way you expect it to even when other components on the system are upgrade

598682
google-chrome	firefox
here is an example tested in firefox google-chrome and ie7

598699
firefox	safari
i am trying to load an xml file using javascript and i have yet to find a good function that works in ie firefox and safari

598723
multiplication	modulo
for integers to be a group under multiplication you have to be modulo a prime number

598723
addition	multiplication
for floating point values simple multiplication or addition saturates to + - infinity and there are no values which are the inverses of infinity so either the set is not closed or it lacks invertibility

598723
multiplication	modulo
if on the other hand you want something similar to integer multiplication modulo a power of 2 then multiplication will do - there are elements without an inverse so it s not a group but it is closed - you always get a floating point value back

598735
ant	maven
i am working on a fairly large project with a number of modules a bunch of external libraries etc. and we are now considering switching from ant to maven

598735
ant	maven
there are a lot of resources on the web describing how to migrate from ant to maven but i haven t found that many that say why -

598736
cruisecontrol	teamcity
continuous integration tools like cruisecontrol teamcity or hudson can work with version control repositories to extract latest versions of source code build that code execute and archive test results and package stuff for deployment

598773
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systems

598774
ant	maven
first like i m sure a lot of people will mention ant and maven are not exactly intended to solve the same goals

598774
ant	maven
since you said you understand what each provides i won t get into the details of that so suffice it to say that ant lets you define the details of how to build individual components while maven manages the dependencies between components plus maven lets you define a complete project build cycle from compile through test and deploy in a programmatic way

598774
ant	maven
there are plenty of articles on the net that compare ant and maven so you can look at those but from my experience its always worthwhile to consider how you can improve a project

598779
maven	pom.xml
now with maven in place we re relying on artifact repositories to hold those versions and we let our pom.xml dependency declarations be the official means of defining version dependencies

598779
ant	maven
use ant build.xml files to incorporate maven task

598779
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
the nice thing about the maven task for ant where you specify all dependencies in a pom.xml file is that it involves just modest modification of the existing ant build.xml file to incorporate maven for this

598779
ant	maven
from the ant file s perspective maven is just a means for defining classpath definitions which are subsequently used by the various ant build task

598779
ant	pom.xml
other definitions in the pom.xml can also be accessed as ant property definitions

598779
ant	maven
this hybrid approach of having maven manage all the dependencies and leave the bulk of the ant build.xml file as is is most pragmatic

598788
fast-forward	merge
that way the rebase --onto does not introduce conflicts during the merge since it rebases history made after the last commit b to be squashed into the initial one which was a to tmp representing the squashed new initial commit trivial fast-forward merge only

598847
cvs	svn
the great aptana studio has support via plugins for svn cvs and git via this plugin

598850
getter	setter
you have to have getter and setter

598850
getter	setter
under d2009 didn t check other versions the parameters to the getter setter can t for some reason be const

598882
tinyint	boolean
boolean in mysql is tinyint 1

598885
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know a lot about how the protocols work something that you definitely need to research or much about what goes on in a browser but a great place to start would be the source of the open-source browsers primarily google-chrome and firefox

598920
google-chrome	safari
webkit used in safari and google-chrome 0-27

598920
opera	google-chrome	webkit	blink
blink used in google-chrome 28+ opera 15+ webkit fork

598920
opera	google-chrome
v8 google s javascript engine used in google-chrome and opera

598922
pull	push
stuff get s added deleted renamed automatically and basic syncronization tasks push pull work fine.

598936
rss	feed
keep in mind that would affect everything -- sidebar blocks build with views rss feed etc

598948
g++	gcc
question 1 how do i create static library using gcc g++

599022
int	boolean
if these are not actual boolean but just an int column you only store 0 or 1 in then you should fix your schema

599034
boost	stl
don t write any templates unless you re writing a very very generic library stl and boost are two prominent examples

599053
memset	malloc	memcpy	malloc	memcpy	memset
e.g memcpy malloc memset

599070
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files

599070
ant	maven
and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy

599070
ant	maven
prior to adopting maven as our flagship build tool i had a developer attempt to use ivy in combination to existing ant build.xml files

599070
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
however i went back to the ant legacy projects and started using the maven ant task to define classpath definitions and occasionally other ant property definitions pulled in from the pom.xml

599070
ant	maven
the existing ant build.xml files need only be modified slightly to use maven ant integration to define any classpath that were in use in the build.xml file

599070
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
all dependencies required by the project became defined in an accompanying pom.xml file that gets processed by maven via the ant task incorporated into the build.xml files

599070
ant	pom.xml
also pretty much any element of something defined in the pom.xml file can be referenced as an ant property within the build.xml file

599070
ant	maven
really with the ant task for maven there is no viable reason for ivy to even exist

599086
post	get
for the successful use case the post redirect get prg work flow is pretty simple simply redirect client-side to the desired page

599118
getter	setter
tests for getter and setter

599122
base	fractions
double uses half as much memory as decimal and double will be much faster because of the cpu hardware for many common floating point operations but it cannot represent most base 10 fractions such as 1.05 accurately and has a less accurate 15+ decimal digits of precision

599124
getter	setter
to clarify the set and get methods referenced above are not getter and setter methods

599134
cpu	processors
cpu is the processors what runs your code against your data

599219
folder	directory
i created a new extension folder under my development firefox profile s extension directory

599235
haskell	sml
sml which is also functional but not lazy can use arrays more naturally than haskell but lists are still more common because they map well to recursive algorithms

599255
affinity	processors
what you re interested in is smp processors affinity

599309
udp	tcp
tcp ip as well as udp packets include some reference to their size

599309
udp	tcp
using the standard run-of-the-mill sockets in windows whether you re using the system.net.sockets namespace in c# or the native winsock stuff in win32 you never see the ip tcp udp headers

599309
serializable	deserialization
from what i can tell it is a binary serializable deserialization scheme for wcf i m sure that s a gross oversimplification

599322
profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
i ve not used netbeans profiler but tried jprofiler yourkit and jprobe

599375
ant	maven
i hate maven less than i hate ant and for java you need to choose one of those evils

599377
public	protected
however the biggest difference between an https connection and an http connection protected by digest auth is that with the former everything is encrypted with public key encryption while with the latter content is sent in the clear

599393
ubuntu	linux
note i am new to rails and fairly new to ubuntu and linux in general

599421
jms	jta	jndi	jta
list of features ejb 3.0 and 3.1 jta jax-ws jms j2ee connectors jpa jndi

599421
openjpa	openejb
openejb uses several other open source frameworks such as openjpa to provide jpa and cmp persistence activemq for jms mdb and apache cxf for jax-ws features

599421
jar	war
deployment types collapsed ear war jar

599421
openjpa	openejb
limitations openejb uses openjpa to provide jpa and cmp persistence and openjpa currently requires a javaagent to function properly

599424
button	checkbox
i use a model to define dynamic forms made from group frame labels textboxes numberboxes option button and checkbox in wpf

599438
aptana	rubymine
i d recommend netbeans ruby edition obviously or jetbrain s rubymine over aptana

599471
vim	emacs
our developers either used emacs or vim and no one wanted to switch to anything else so we fortunately sticked with that

599528
int	double
for example with widening coercions int - long float - double

599535
hash	md5
i guess i could make four md5 hash and merge them but is that really effective

599558
hash	md5
try uniqid - and perhaps combine with an md5 hash as given in the examples

599638
nodevalue	nextsibling
nodename nodetype nodevalue firstchild lastchild nextsibling previoussibling data value htmlelement.getelementsbytagname all htmltableelement members most cssstyledeclaration members simply do not exist

599651
kate	kde	kate	kdevelop
kde seems to have a drawers-like functionality as seen in kdevelop and some other applications kate the editor uses them too but i have never tried to use them in anything i ve written and so would have no idea how to write them

599680
width	height
if you compare the width and height of the flash movie on both pages you ll see that it s the same

599743
cvs	svn
vim can work well with cvs svn make debuggers etc

599743
vim	kate	vim	notepad++	vim	jedit	notepad++	jedit	kate	jedit
infact kate or notepad++ or jedit have gui and features you may miss in vim

599773
freebsd	linux
the project is a set of c libraries so no ui or user interaction testing is necessary and aimed at being cross platform with linux freebsd and windows being my first priority and os x planned once the first release is out the door assuming i can get a hold of a machine running os x to test on

599795
vim	emacs
the advantage of using either vim or emacs as an editor is precisely that it s available on virtually any decently configured unix platform and this includes more esoteric systems as well darwin os x

599796
vim	textmate	notepad	textpad
fwiw i use textmate sometimes vim on osx textpad sometimes notepad or even edit on servers not under my direct control on windows and vim on linux

599818
google-chrome	firefox
this could take you years but anyway there are many open source browsers out there firefox google-chrome

599826
mouse	keyboard
i have a timer program that count for inactivity of keyboard mouse

599873
int	double
since some of the numbers will be small and some large the question is whether it is worth checking the length of the number and if it is small use a regular c# int or double and if is is large use the other classes i have or if i am already using the large int and large float classes i should just stick with them even for smaller numbers

599919
squash	branch	git-merge	git-rebase
squash a and b into a new commit ab would result in two distinct trees which in most cases is not desirable since git-merge and git-rebase will no longer work across the two branch

599929
pop-up	dialog
when the authentication fails i would like to pop-up my plugin s settings dialog and retry

599934
boost	stl
this works for nested containers but this is for their implementation for stl only and does not work if you are putting a stl container in a boost container

599971
children	parent
as an example let s say we have a blog and we want to show the blog articles as the parent and then any comments made to each article as children in a hierarchical ultrawebgrid

599984
post	get
i would like to select 5 latest records from the post table get their related tags and return the ilist where each post has their tags property filled
