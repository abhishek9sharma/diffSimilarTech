folder	directory
in this folder there s a snapshot of yesterdays file structure and thus it has directory with the same name in the result

4500073
maven	pom.xml
the whole point of maven is that you describe all dependencies of your project in pom.xml rather than add them as jars in your ide

4500073
m2e	pom.xml
when you have dependencies configured in pom.xml you can easily generate eclipse project with the corresponding dependencies by running mvn eclipse eclipse or add them to the existing project with m2e plugin

4500194
post	get
when php gets the data by get or post it doesn t know the id of the input that was associated with a given piece of data

4500194
client-side	server-side
since you have control of both server-side and client-side code you can determine what the id will be by choosing a naming convention as i suggested above

4500195
google-chrome	firefox
we use it to test in ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox google-chrome right now

4500199
serializable	deserialization
there s a huge amount of activity surrounding rdf.rb with over a score of database adapters serializable deserialization plugins and interfaces to other libraries

4500272

and give a fixed position with a height and width of 100

4500293
vb.net	vb6
there s a difference between vb6 and vb.net and visual studio 2010 includes vb.net

you might want to use visual studio 2008 to help upgrade your vb6 to vb.net and then migrate to visual studio 2010 later

4500293
vb.net	vb6
upgrading vb6 to vb.net can be a large task

4500309

4500523
pem	pkcs#12	pkcs#12	pfx
you should note that pem format is not natively supported by windows or .net libraries so you need to convert it to pfx before deployment and then import a pfx or just create a store in memory based on pfx you will find plenty of information by looking for pfx or pkcs#12 on stackoverflow

4500525

4500677
hide	show
you can extend mx.controls.button to add a show hide label function

4500699
post	get
the best way to test is to have your html form element test with a get instead of a post this way you will see the key value pairs in the address bar when the form is submitted to the method by the action

4500708
accessor	properties
i then declare the properties dynamic to let ca create the accessor override +needsdisplayforkey and implement -drawincontext to pass the current value of the scenecenterpoint properties to the renderer and ask it to render the scene

4500749
cpu	hyperthreading
it might differentiate if it s using hyperthreading where a four-core cpu has hyperthreading and thus exposes 8 cpu s but even then i doubt it the framework will probably just see 8 cpu s

4500749
cpu	hyperthreading
a dual-quad-core system with hyperthreading would therefore potentially expose 16 cpu s

4500771
glassfish	resin
your web host runs a servlet container like tomcat jetty glassfish or resin

4500793

but now i have this abstraction which is just a bunch of getter and setter

4501043
post	get
however when i go onto the post 2010 12 site or any other date i get that amazing

then make some super interface itextfield that extends ipositionable iresizable and ialignable

4501097
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari and opera show 1 2

4501111
post	get
i did some experimentation and it seems that when the post is submitted you will get two callbacks dialogcompletewithurl and then dialogdidcomplete

4501111
post	get
so if need be you could even peek at this value to further confirm your success although i expect that if the post really did fail as opposed to a skip you will get one of the fail callbacks instead

4501196
client-side	server-side

if delimiter are mixed and or you have to treat consecutive spaces as one using text parsewords might be easier

4501369
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
what i found in my tests is that the corners plugin loaded but using jquery 1.4.4 and testing with google-chrome 8.0.552.224 safari 5.0.3 firefox 3.6.13 and internet explorer 8 that only safari and fireefox showed the corners

4501418

also if you want super light php editing you could go with notepad ++ and take a look at webstorm which is a like a php-less subset to phpstorm designed to handle html javascript css etc

4501538
accessor	properties
no you re not doing anything wrong because you are using the properties accessor method self.aboutviewcontroller to set it to nil

4501546
for-loop	loops
in the first example where you declare str inside of loops all references to that string are going to be lost after the for-loop completes allowing java s garbage collector to remove all instances of the strings from memory

4501559
google-chrome	firefox
the text shows up fine in firefox and google-chrome however i can t seem to get this text to display in ie8

4501580

implements	extends
and if at all someone needs those abstract methods and method x they can extends a and implements the new interface

4501621
int	chars
the initialization function takes a chars array but utf8_decode_next returns int

4501621
int	chars
the function is dealing with chars data and how can that be assigned to a int

4501642
int	double
if you are using some numerical data type you could just get a count on the rows and multiply it by the size for instance 4 for int or 8 for double

4501659
stringbuilder	off-by-one
that the logic outlined above has an off-by-one bug if the length of the output read by beginread is exactly equal to the length of your buffer then this logic will store the output in the stringbuilder and block while trying to see if there s more output to append

4501752
subclass	abstract-class
as to which of your two methods to use that depends entirely on what the abstract-class and your subclass are and what they re supposed to be doing

4501752

if you only need read access to this variable and the superclass methods don t modify it you can just add another completely separate private field of the same name type to your subclassing

4501814
mspec	mstest
typically the only choice offered is mstest but i want to use mspec

4501818
min	max

superclass	subclassing
if you want to have some methods from your superclass and some methods from your subclassing to access the same state you need to change visibility

4501832
google-chrome	firefox
i m sort of at a loss here i typically debug in firebug but this works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

4501851
int	chars
on some implementations most importantly windows which uses surrogate pairs for chars outside the basic multilingual plane it still isn t big enough to represent any unicode chars which presumably is why the decoder you reference uses int

4501851
int	chars
wprintf deals in wchar_t so if the wide chars set is unicode and if wchar_t is int on your system as it is on linux then wprintf and friends will print the decoder output without further processing

4501858

4501980
getter	setter
i am trying to implement a custom java widget using gwt.this requires me to copy a class from the gwt api and pasting it in my own new class. i am not sure if this is a right approach.suggest me if its wrong to copy the api in my new class .the reason why i am doing this is i need to make modifications to the api because the api does not provide me getter setter s for a object

4501981
int	chars
since unicode is a 21-bit chars set it cannot return anything smaller than an int and it can be argued that technically it should be a long since an int could be a 16-bit quantity

4501990
gridbaglayout	miglayout
as an alternative you can use gridbaglayout or miglayout which can span columns

4502017

the nodes provide a generic interface - you would have to watch any of them that correspond to a mouse or keyboard

4508736
swt	swing
fixing bugs in swt is much harder than in swing most classes in swt are final or contain hostile checks in the constructor to make sure no one extends them the package is signed so you can t simply replace classes and so far i tried several times to compile swt from sources - and failed

4508736
swt	swing	swt	nebula
there are lots of custom components for swing swt just has project nebula which isn t very active

4508736
swt	swing
while it s possible to mix swing and swt components that s not for the faint of heart

elapsed doesn t need to be double just keep an int count of milliseconds instead

4509290
inherited	properties
if i want to copy t including its inherited x properties from thingy but not including the foo properties it inherited from object i could use that to skip those

4509290
inherited	properties
what if it inherited a value for the properties but not the value from object something in the middle mdash

4509298

but a plain object inherited some the properties from object.prototype

how can i reduce the width and height of the buttonfield so it matches the original image size of 41 x 41

4509531
post	get
i don t see why you would need it though a post ajax call is just as visible as a get ajax call

4509540
setinterval	settimeout
firstly when using setinterval or settimeout don t pass the method in as a string as this calls the infamous eval which is poor coding practice

4510012
prng	random
once you have 128 truly random bits you can use them in a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator prng which will produce as many random bits as you need at a high rate limited only by the local computing power on a smartphone prng bandwidth will be in megabytes per second not kilobytes per second

4510012
prng	random
some say that getting true random protects you from any future cryptanalytic breach on the prng

4510012
prng	random
a stronger case for continuous entropy gathering can be made about seed storage the fear that an attacker getting hold of the prng could look at its entrails recover internal state and retroactively guess random bits which were previously emitted

4510085
width	height
and in some browsers to crash the browser by setting a huge width and height combo

4510097
hide	show
i don t show hide it even though it would work faster

4510153
gdal	ogr
in basic terms gdal is used for reading writing and transforming raster data while ogr can do the same with vector data

4510153
gdal	ogr
i am not as familiar with fdo but it appears to be an api used to access from database sources manipulate and analyze all kinds of geospatial data and relies on gdal and ogr for those purposes

4510156
fortran	ada
ada strings in fact all ada arrays are not 0 based like c or 1-based like fortran

4510171
mouse	keyboard
the nodes provide a generic interface - you would have to watch any of them that correspond to a mouse or keyboard

4510196
actionscript	mxml
i was under the impression that the mxml is compiled down to actionscript

4510199
width	height
second i don t see you setting the height or width of the image anywhere

4510252
inherited	properties
now that hasownproperty test in there is to make sure you don t stumble over properties inherited from the prototype

4510327
int	boolean
in other words the method name is compare not equals it returns an int not a boolean and it compares two values that can be promoted to the type given by the type parameter

mp3	ogg
decoding audio via mp3 ogg etc.

4510456
actionscript	mxml
mxml is compiled down into actionscript

4510456
actionscript	mxml
mxml components are classes just like actionscript components are

4510456
actionscript	mxml
however if you use mxml to generate actionscript then the actual component that is running has a different code base

4510466
width	height
the javascript would be fairly simple you would animate the width and height of the a tag or image depending on what you used

4510470
width	height
this is also assuming the width and height are already defined

4510526
portrait	landscape
our application could support landscape mode without any problem but it is such a pain that we are thinking about forcing portrait mode

4510537
width	height
the path in works fine the preloader works fine and i can see the width height is being grabbed in the getwidthandheight function

4510555
ready	each
each feature when ready will need to get assigned to a release branch and merged to it

4510632
portrait	landscape
i changed the code to start the app in landscape the app opened in the simulator but the app was still in portrait mode in a horizontal simulator

so now - in ie 8 i have the problem that on mouseover the links jumps up and down on mouseout because of the border-bottom i think

4510791
base-class	derived-class
however i recall that c++ also allows you to use the using keyword which can come in handy in a derived-class function which frequently accesses a base-class variable

4510808
width	height
normalise your stored points such that the x y positions are relative to a surface of size 0..1 0..1 divide the x y by the width and height of the current surface

4510808
width	height
then whenever you want to change the size of the underlying surface multiply each point by this new surface s width and height

4510808
portrait	landscape
note the above will scale going from portrait to landscape the y will be compressed and the x expanded

4510879
width	height
in moss 2007 when you edit a web part you can set width and height using predetermined units of measure from the drop down list

4510902
int	chars
create a structure to hold the meta data about each file name 255 chars size 64-bit int date and time and permissions

4510935

4510977
superclass	subclassing
will move a method or property or variable from a subclassing to it s superclass

4510987

the right thing is that if we have 10 table rows the first 3 are white because the gradient from darf blue to width has only a height for about 7 rows

4510994
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers safari google-chrome and opera will only animate span elements in certain positions within the parent element

4511010
put	get

i have a uicontrol subclass which follows the uiaccessibilitycontainer informal protocol it returns no to -isaccessibilityelement delivers the correct -accessibilityelementcount and elements in the accessor

4511241
profiling	instrumentation
i started profiling in instrumentation xcode 3.2

4511244
subtraction	addition
i ve a number between 10 and 30 i need to present this number in 4 operation addition or subtraction but both should be present at least one time so always we need to use addition and subtraction at least one time

4511249
width	height
if i have one background picture bg.png width 900px height 3000px i want to get this effection when open the page loading and show the background image from top to bottom

4511251
comparator	comparable
i believe the answer to the question about why you end up calling the comparator object method instead of the specific one is because your class definition says implements comparable without any type parameter

4511289
width	height
jquery can write width height attributes to image tags but it requires the browser to know their widths and height - and to know these the browser must have already loaded enough of each image to get these stats - so not very useful in your case

4511334
subtraction	addition
write those numbers as addition or subtraction

4511366
libs	buildpath
add the class to a jar file then right click on your project navigate to buildpath configure build path then on the libs tab ad your jar

4511573
hide	show
if the window height is tall enough to display two rows the table is reformatted and filled out with the extra stories i assume with ajax although it would cost little to have the content on the page and show and hide the stories as needed

stdout	stderr
separation of summary + detailed build info get stdout + stderr of all build commands to redirect to a designated output file build-summary.txt but leave output from scons itself going to stdout stderr

4511713
stdout	stderr
structured build output using xml get stdout + stderr of all build commands to redirect to a designated output file and do so in an xml format as below

4511713

contents of stdout and stderr would need to be escaped for inclusion in xml obviously

4511718
free	malloc
does the manager need to have the same semantics as malloc free

4511761
maven	pom.xml
add them in your maven pom.xml then regenerate your project as you did originally

maven	m2e
as a better alternative use the m2e plugin instead and then your eclipse and maven environments will be actually integrated

4511795
hide	show
i need to hide show table columns with jquery

submit	submission
rather than submission the same job to multiple machines and wasting cpu to cover the failure case just submit it once and let the framework handle restarting the jobs that actually fail

wordpress	joomla
to put it in simple words a cms provides you with a back-end with a host of plugins and components like joomla drupal wordpress etc so that you can manage front-end where as a frameworks doesn t

4511857
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	cakephp	kohana
a framework such as codeigniter kohana cakephp symphony etc provides you with ready-made classes and libraries but you have to use them and build your site yourself

looks like people just need to use a standards-compliant browser like ie8 firefox opera safari etc

rspec	capybara
here are the gems included in my gemfile cucumber cucumber-rails rspec rspec-rails capybara capybara-envjs database_cleaner launchy

4511901
google-chrome	safari
the workaround simply tells asp.net ajax that safari 3 and google-chrome are a new type of browser instead of the old safari for which workarounds had to be programmed

then when that dropdown changes i hide show the relevant rows in the table

4512350
rss	feed
i like to use syndicationfeed class to read rss feed but there remark about that for windows server 2008 r2 server core role not supported

4512477
width	height
i have many square images with different sizes and i want to first resize them so they are inside a 150pixel area so the images are not distorted so since most images are not exactly the same size on both height and width one of the sides would be smaller proportionally

vb6	vba
i ve worked a lot with asp classic vba access and vb6 so i have programming experience but little to no experience real programming - oop php or frameworks

4512506
int	chars
i ve got records from a table in sql server containing both int chars and text fields

4512508
postgresql	mysql
the native provider for linq2sql is naturally for sql server but there are now 3rd party providers for oracle mysql and postgresql

4512524
rss	feed
in my experience it is common that these fields contain no values out of 130 rss feed i pull into a custom rss reader only 11 feed have valid values

4512535

how then would i get it into a form i could put into the style settings for a div

4512537
put	get
when you put your string into the sql you get a invalid syntax

4512581
setcontentview	findviewbyid
after you have called setcontentview r.layout.your_layout you can call findviewbyid r.id.compview and than use setvisibility like you mentioned it above

4512615
equals	gethashcode
at most you can compare implementing iequalitycomparer vs overriding gethashcode and equals methods because indeed they re two ways to get the same thing and i would say they re equals to me

4512623
explode	implode
in addition to explode you ll need implode and probably array_unique

4512651
rss	feed
i was trying to find a jquery plugin to parse an rss feed and found that jfeed was the most recommended option for quite some time but judging by the broken links on its plugin page and the fact that it hasn t been updated since 2008 i m guessing this is no longer the state-of-the-art in jquery rss parsing

4512653
stdout	fflush
std endl instead is an object that will cause to append the newline character n and to fflush stdout buffer

4512705
wordpress	joomla
but the real question here i guess is what type of website would you build in wordpress concrete5 joomla or drupal

4512825
stdout	fflush
something else to try would be to fflush stdout after the printf call

4512845
getter	setter
hibernate does use proxy objects but the data is still stored in your object and hibernate will use the getter setter implementations you provide so your solution should work if you want to set the lowercase version although i m not clear why you need a separate instance variable to store the lowercase version

4512853
post	get
i don t have the excact usercontrol code here but i will edit this post when i get home..but here is the simplified idea

4512859

the events render perfectly in ie but in google-chrome firefox and safari the items do not show except for on the initial load

post	get
this is not an issue but a design decision in http empty get url like an empty image src means redio the request that get you on the page that could be a post

4513007
post	get
the file is encoded and then included in the get or post request when it is transmitted to the server

i thought that from here i had something that was essentially the same as the view-based template but when i add in a segmented view controller add the iboutlet ibaction in code and then hook up the outlets and received actions in interface builder the app crashes as it launches every time

4514393
portrait	landscape
if you use the width device-width value for the viewport my guess is you shouldn t then have a fixed width in your design but better use widths in having in mind that in most recent mobile devices your css total width will be somewhere around 320px portrait or 500px landscape at a scale of 1.0

4514399
spaces	delimiter
if you specify it in your charset table even spaces as u+0020 it will no longer acts as a delimiter and will be part of your token strings

the code is updated on each server and the webserver apache or nginx mostly usually uses a plugin like passenger

4514763
min	max
while relatively simple there are flaws to this method though other than the fact that it is an approximation for example the algorithm may think the two sides are converging when in fact it is just a local min max and will diverge after the difference falls just below your threshold

4514773
put	get
if i put the master plugin back into the plugins folder i get the mef composition problem again

4515744
serializable	deserialization
there are good reasons to use a serializable deserialization technique like this

4515744
serializable	deserialization
but an efficient use of declarative serializable deserialization is a great approach in my experience

4515772
for-loop	loops
for example i added a second sphere directly above the first by putting a for-loop around the code block that creates the sphere and using loops variable to determine the origin y value and extended the simulation so it runs long enough for them both to reach the plane

4515774
addclass	removeclass
this is causing some weirdness with addclass and removeclass

4515787
width	height
as far as converting height and width from pixels to is concerned you would have to create a custom new tool part and remove the existing one from webpart tool part

4515813

subnet	packets
no this is fundamental property of broadcasting - every host on the subnet including the sender will have to process the packets all the way up the network stack

4515884
cout	cin
in c++ why we go for cout and cin

4515894
rational-numbers	base	subtract	add
just like complex or rational-numbers numbers or address book entries or dictionary entries or any other non-basic type for that matter should be self contained in a class that knows how to add subtract or otherwise manipulate them separately from the base language the printing of those objects should also be left to the class as well

4515922
ddms	adb
however whenever i try to load the helloandroid example adb and ddms hang

4515922
ddms	adb
i make sure that only one ddms and adb are running

4515952
cout	cin
along with the ability to overload insertion and extraction operators for classes of your choice cin and cout are type-safe which scanf and printf are not -- a mismatch between the conversion format and actual type with printf is fairly common

4515959
range	min	range	max	min	max
the solution is to make a first pass over the data to find the min max of your range

4515959
min	max
there s really no quick fix to this and most libraries will ask for min max up front

4515976
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii	cakephp	yii
yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

4516008

for-loop	arrays
let s say i have a for-loop and i want to initialize multiple arrays in that loop...can i go like this

4516191
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
i ve tried all the usual methods of capturing an nsview into an nsimage using -datawithpdfinsiderect nsbitmapimagerep s -initwithfocusedviewrect etc. however all these methods treat the calayer-backed nsview as if it doesn t exist

4516193
width	height
i m not sure where it s pulling those values from height and width the slide not expanding vertically to reveal the content and the slide being out of position horizontally

4516243

but note also that racket like many other lisp has a rich numeric tower with exact rationals etc

4516278
x86	64bit
if you re on a 64bit platform change your build target to x86 - that should run on both architectures

4516333
vim	emacs
saying you want c b to act like a compiler makes no more sense then saying you want vim emacs or visual studio to act like a compiler

4516360
mouse	keyboard
you could use a global keyboard mouse hook and just reset your counter to 0 when you receive an event from either

4516380
for-loop	arrays
i am fairly new to programming i can t figure out how to get the names of the java.io.file arrays for-loop in the createchildren function

4516383
persistent	transient
another approach would be to use an asynchronous job dispatch daemon such as beanstalk which would allow you to have a persistent service talking to the arduino and have transient web requests queueing jobs to manipulate it

4516414
pop-up	dialog
i want to get the file open dialog to pop-up via javascript

4516438

4516468
apache	nginx
1 using a popular web-server like nginx or apache - and invoking it through the application and running it as a process with

4516472

to assign uniform height width use wrappanel s itemheight itemwidth property

4516472
width	height
avoid assigning explicit height width to individual items

4516509
width	height
the only time i ever use inline styling is to declare the width or height of an object and maybe one more thing

4516586
hash	salt
3 you can definitely store credentials in a cookie but you should always hash and salt the password

4516618
mousemove	mousedown
you need to execute your code in the mousemove event as well as the mousedown event

4516642
width	height
the idea is that the user specifies the window width and height by typing in the two edit dialogue boxes within the window i have created

4516642
int	chars
but as you can imagine i can not use the xval or yval in the createwindow because i get a compile error stating i can not convert from int to chars

4516668
mouse	keyboard
if the focus is in the last required edit box the user has two ways to close the window either point the mouse and press it or just press the keyboard return key

4516688
min	max
the fist table contains the min and max value that a param may be

4516752
put	get
people get married or put silly nicknames for themselves which some people change frequently

4516761
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this solves the custom action problem but other problems may occur since this approach has many restrictions the components need to maintain their names and guids between versioning your custom actions should be aware that the upgrade is performed at installation end etc.

4516826
post	get
i don t want to change my form method from get to post

4516851

it want to be work in both safari and google-chrome

4516993
int	chars
is int silently casted to chars

4516999
int	chars
i am trying to read a file in xcode which contains string of unicode characters.my code will traverse through string pick up chars one by one and prints its corresponding int value

4516999
int	chars
as it is obvious there is ambiguity for same int value chars differs depending on format specifier and also for same unicode chars their int value differs

4517048
int	chars
when your colleague only used int literals these will be converted to chars - you will however see a warning if the value of the int is too big

4517048
int	chars
funnily enough there is a definition of operator+ for string and chars but only when using the int literal is converted to chars i have to pass a chars literal or value for operator+ to be used

4517066
background-color	transparency
on an element without any background-color set you ll get transparency

4517146
extjs	smartgwt
now window builder supports gwt extjs gwt and smartgwt design

since doing this does not enter the compareto method neither does it enter the equals method so i m at a loss atm

4517247
min	max
can i depend on nhibernate 3.0 built-in linq provider to perform complex queries contain aggregate functions such as max and min and contains string operations such as contains startswith or endswith

4517283
icomparable	compareto
if you implement icomparable than you implement the compareto method

4517283
equals	gethashcode
you should also implement the equals method simply call the operator and the gethashcode

4517289
mdpi	hdpi
will that always be 12px in mdpi and so 18px in hdpi

4517291
vbscript	jscript
i think the key is having a pair of functions to translate between the jscript date object and the vbscript date type

4517291
vbscript	jscript
the jsdatefromvb in my example is a very crude function that translates from vbscript date to jscript date

4517340
min	max
group by columns max columns min columns etc

4517340
min	max
edit turns out that min and max work on string values and ignores null values taking the first and last values alphabetically

submit	submission
you can disable the link or submit button - but this is frustrating for the user in the case where the submission fails for some reason my bank does this and tbh it scares me that they don t realise they should instead program round the double-submit issue as you described it

firefox	safari
that s the case in ie8 firefox and safari but in ie7 this shows up like

4517613
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
if you have control over the clients computers for an internal application that will be used from specific computers and you know which browser s will be used you could write a browser plugin or an extension in case of firefox google-chrome opera and install it on those computers - these have a much higher privileges of access to the rest of the os almost like normal processes

ganglia	nagios	ganglia	metrics
the fastest way would be log on the machine via ssh and use cli tools like htop or top to check the current load however if you have multiple servers that performe different tasks it would make sense to install some kind of monitoring to collect metrics and getter informations about load usage there a lot of sophisticated tools for that like ganglia munin or as mentioned nagios

4519102
width	height
note that though you can force a specific size through the width and height fields in general the correct way to do this is let the window do its normal layout and determine the window size automatically that way

if i put top 10 in each seperate query i get 20 results total

4519320
folder	dir
the dir command doesn t appear to return folder size

a better solution is to let them upload it check the width and height of the picture and if isn t what you want then present a message to the user like error picture is too big decrease picture size

4519362
superclass	subclassing
then in your main method polymorphism allows you to assign a subclassing instance callmeimpl to a superclass or superinterface reference - in this particular case the me reference of type callmeifc you have a typo here btw

int	double
for example in vb.net there are value and reference types while in c# there are only references and also int double are treated as objects they are objects while in vb.net a value type is not a object and there is a split in types for this reason

4519802
websphere	ibm
c program files ibm websphere mq tools dotnet samples

4519804
jar	war
the problem you may be running into is that maven can guarantee on some plugins like the jar and war plugins but others plugins like your proguard plugin it may not

4519804
jar	war
i think if you changed the execution phase from package to prepare-package that should get the jsp files obfuscated before they are packaged into the the jar file and subsequently into the war file

4519805

with java these are covered by jax-ws and jax-rs

4519875
expander	grid
1. when i click my expander button and it expands it should stretch down to the end of the grid

4519889
int	double
this means that in most scenarios you do not need to specify that variable is an int double or any reference type like you would in c#

4519900
setinterval	settimeout
one more note many people might rightly suggest that instead of a timer driven by the browser s setinterval mechanism it might be better to use settimeout and do the work of setting up each subsequent timer yourself

4519968
folder	dir
for example when you move a file from one dir to another the file can carry an acl that is not the inherited acl you would expect if you just create the file in the folder originally

4519982
width	height
then it outputs a small empty image 1 pix width and 1 pix height transparent

4520009

the image loaded is larger than screen on both width and height

4520009

the most close i am getting now i manually resize imgview in loadview portrait mode would display correctly since app always starts with portrait mode but in landscape mode the width fits correctly but image is centered vertically rather than top aligned

4520101
accessor	properties
a properties is actually a method the get and set accessor for an indexer get compiled to get_index and set_index methods

can i use an xmpp server have not looked into this yet but does it work with regular standard http post get

4520316

4520346
int	chars
parsing in int parsing in chars parsing in string

4520391
equals	gethashcode
if you have a list of a given class to use distinct you need to either a override equals and gethashcode inside your class so that appropriate equality comparisons can be made

4520391
equals	gethashcode
this will also allow you to specify the equals and gethashcode implementations without having to modify the source of the actual class

4520433
folder	directory
so that works but the problem if i m not mistaken is that this adds the parent directory of foo to sys.path and thus searches all of the sibling folder of foo for python modules

4520443
short	base
in short it will help you track all versions and you can create official builds base line

4520448
pyopengl	pyglet
obviously for 3d games you are going to have to muck around with opengl functions anyway in which case i recommend pyglet over pygame + pyopengl

4520452

4520568
xul	xbl
within a xbl method the only way to access the element that was defined in the xul file the gui description file without using this as it may not be the this i expect is with getelementbyid and this makes the code not reusable so i m looking for alternatives

so the problem appears when i pass from another scene to main menu in portrait mode the app doesn t rotate to landscape automatically and i can t find a code method to manually rotate it

4520743

client-side	server-side
when add service reference is performed it uses that metadata to create a client-side class that looks like your server-side class

4520902
width	height
and you also have a vector from the center of the rectangle to your point you can project that point onto your width and height vectors

4520902
width	height
p point vector h height vector w width vector

4520902
width	height
correct me if i m wrong but if the magnitude of the projection of your point on the height vector is less then the magnitude of the height vector which is half of the height of the rectangle and the magnitude of the projection of your point on the width vector is then you have a point inside of your rectangle

4520902
width	height
if you have a universal coordinate system you might have to figure out the height width point vectors using vector subtraction

4520911
multiplication	modulo
projective transformations in 3d have an associated 4x4 matrix modulo a constant multiplication

4520930
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
inotifycollectionchanged isn t thread safe unline inotifypropertychanged so you should use the dispatcher to add items from the ui thread instead when adding items to your linklist from a worker thread

4520995

free	calloc	strlen	calloc
you will probably find functions such as strlen calloc free and strcat useful

4521252
unsigned	short
what this means is that instead of wchar_t being a typedef for some internal type __wchar_t i think it becomes a typedef for unsigned short

4521255
min	max
by crafting a nice linq query you will get only the stuff you need you can select group by count min max whatever you like

4521282

i need to upgrade a product that could be installed in per-user context to a new versioning that is always in per-machine context

4521402
versioning	upgrade
whether the old versioning was installed in a per-user no matter who or per-machine context should be completely seamless to an administrator user that performs the upgrade

4521402
versioning	upgrade
the msi upgrade should succeed without the need to know the password of the user that originally installed the previous versioning of the product in a per-user context

4521402
versioning	upgrade
if before running the msi the previous product was in per-user context findrelatedproducts will look at the cache and not apply the upgrade and remove the previous versioning because the new product is in per-machine context even though the previous product versioning is already configured to per-machine context in the registry by that time by my custom action

4521409
ceil	floor
but floor or ceil should cut it i think

width	height
you need to have an algorithm for determining where to place the next element given a set of existing elements and a bounding box the container width height

4521488
width	height
once you have that you ll use the jquery width and height functions to get the sizes of the elements to position and i believe you ll want the css function for setting the top left

width	height
i fixed one of my problems - in the manifest file the os i was targeting was set up incorrectly - switching it to 4 ie 1.6 seemed to fix the values i was getting for height and width at least for the htc

4525744
width	height
if i can get the absolute width and height i can write my own code for loading the correct assets and using the correct scaling for screen positioning - dpi isn t an issue so hopefully that won t stray too far from suggested guidelines

4526927
sorting	filtering
my needs for nsfetchedresultscontroller nsfrc are the ability to perform filtering and sorting after the objects have been fetched mostly because the filtering and sorting require querying the fetched objects themselves and is therefore not possible with nsfrc

4526927
sorting	filtering
so i wrote my own class bsfetchedresultscontroller which aims to replicate the functionality of nsfrc delegate notifications automatic sectioning and caching but with added hooks for the user to set their own blocks for filtering and sorting

4527030
filtering	grouping
and then do the grouping filtering yourself in python

4527030
filtering	grouping
again this is perhaps more clear than using raw sql and only requires one query but this one query could be very large it will return all items and their categories and doing the grouping filtering yourself is probably less efficient than letting the database do it for you

4527040
concave	convex
i m guessing that i ll have to do some sort of tessellation and will have to deal with concave convex polygons

4527063
inherited	properties

4527378
fink	macports
the best way to manage packages on os x is fink not macports

4527378
fink	macports
because fink is reputedly more stable than macports and has many more packages

4527386
min	max
i agree with roman that his idea would work if you use a class field to hold the min and max selection

4527407

4527495
stdout	stderr
stdout pipe and or stderr pipe and the

4527609
getter	setter
my question is beside the setter getter methods what are the other methods do i need in these classes

4527610
getter	setter
your property is correct but you ve written your own setter and getter that do not retain the object

4527610
getter	setter
you don t need to use both property synthesize and supply your own getter setter

4527625
post	get
when sending data you can use post or get methods to send data using http protocol

4527625
post	put
post tells your browser to build an http message and put all content in the body of the message a very useful way of doing things more safe and also flexible

4527650
getter	setter
for these getter and setter might be all you need

4527650
getter	setter
using getter setter rather than public fields leaves open the possibility that you may change the representation later without affecting callers

4527663
vbscript	vb6
i was asked to convert some vb6 vbscript code to javascript so after googling it and not finding anything i can use i wrote a small javascript function to help me do the conversion

webkit nightly now supports elliptical gradients these will eventually find their way into safari and google-chrome

4527735
firefox	safari
we have an elliptical gradient with noise that works on both safari and firefox

4527753
put	get
first you get all the ids an put them in a comma separated list using group_concat if you like

4527759
post	put
to the point i want to put post has_many comments but i do not want to create a separate comment controller and subsequent views

4527783
google-chrome	safari
this doesn t work in safari and google-chrome because they are webkit based

4527795
thunk	trampolines
i would like to implement a trampolines in java by returning a thunk whenever i hit a stackoverflowerror

4527803

how can we hide the error messages and show only the x sign image and on mouse over we show the error message

4527854
implements	extends
the base class extends the staticact must implements all methods defined in staticact

4527980
superclass	subclassing
i ve never seen anything like this in other languages where a method is concrete in a superclass but becomes abstract when it is subclassing

4527992
folder	directory
i want to be able to load ruby files in the folder directory even the ones in the sub-directories

4528031
margin	height
instead of giving the parent fixed height you can try to give padding to the child and as the upper and bottom margin will be the same it will be in the middle of the container

4528057
virtualenv	setuptools
further update you should be able to use pip distribute instead of setuptools and just plain python setup.py install with virtualenv

4528072
qwebview	pyqt
i have a pyqt gui script which consists of a qwebview widget

4528147
vaadin	wicket
i have tried wicket and vaadin both and if you really try both for some time with in a month you will know that vaadin is the way to go and not wicket period

4528151
post	put
however assuming you just put that in there as an example if you own the page your trying to post to have it reply with an access-control header

4528250
width	height
you may need to make use of an ivalueconverter to deal with the way in which you are binding as well as setting the width and height to a fixed size to guarantee your 8x8 representation but the uniformgrid as a container should suffice to meet your goal of an 8x8 table

4528280

4528314
int	double
passing an int or double fixes the problem but why doesn t float work

4528318
int	boolean
one example where an int could be more efficient than a boolean would be in a relational database

4528318
int	boolean
keep in mind that depending on the use and on the system using it while a boolean takes less space because it s just a single bit depending on the implementation an int is the native word size of the hardware

4528318
int	boolean
in high-level programming languages the choice between a boolean and an int is really more of code readability supportability than one of efficiency

4528318
int	boolean
it will never be a third option. if on the other hand there are currently two options but there could be more someday it might be tempting to use a boolean even just for now but it would logically make more sense to use an int or an enum

4528318
int	boolean
sure it may look sleeker and cooler to do some quick int math instead of using a boolean but what does that do to the readability of the code

4528349
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
also while you can use the same api as with normal ajax requests in most browsers in ie8 you will need to create an xdomainrequest object instead of an xmlhttprequest

4528353

4528407
qlayout	qgridlayout
removewidget is inherited from qlayout that s why it s not listed among the qgridlayout methods

4528426
min	max
now on my website i publish min max data for day and for the entire existence of my weatherstation which is around 1 year

4528426
min	max
now i would like to know if i would benefit from creating additional tables where these min max data would be stored rather than let the php do a mysql query searching for day min max data and min max data for the entire existence of my weather station

4528426
min	max
would a query for max min or sum need sum to sum rain accumulation for months take that much longer time then a simple query to a table that already holds those min max and sum values

4528443
post	get
and that s what i get when i look at my post in wireshark

4528443

4528578
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome when you press ctrl+mouse wheel to zoom in and out

4528578
google-chrome	firefox
in ie it shows zoom percentage but no idea if i have correct resolution in firefox or google-chrome

4528583
google-chrome	firefox
in my example it breaks nothing because it s in a separate block. which brings us to once again google-chrome lags behind firefox --edit

4528627
illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
i also suggest breaking on arrayindexoutofboundsexception illegalargumentexception and illegalstateexception

4528630
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you may also want to consider using a case-insensitive comparison instead of a case-sensitive comparison

4528632
put	get
since you put those arrays in an array what you get is an array with arrays

4528798
rss	feed
i am parsing an rss feed and then caching the images from the rss feed and then displaying them in the cell s imageview

4528798

width	height
an outer with a fixed width and height

4532863
width	height
an inner with a fixed height and a very long width

4532863

what this is doing is basically altering the left offset of the view with a huge width .wizard and scrolling a new form into the view with a fixed width and height .wikiform

4532870
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
note that i don t take any 3rd party componant libraries like primefaces richfaces icefaces into account in this answer it would then be impossible to write a reliable answer since it basically boils down to it depends

4532870
versioning	upgrade
in general it s sufficient to just upgrade the component library to a -by themselves verified- jsf 2.0 compatible versioning as per their instructions

4532907
mongoid	cancan
just recently cancan added support for mongoid and renamed candefinition to rule so the error you are getting indicates you are using the latest cancan code from the git repo

opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
...alerts the browser type in every other browser google opera firefox ie but it completely locks-up safari and i have to go in and end program to stop it

4532913
inherited	properties
i see that the story entity inherited from the card entity you created but you don t know why you have product_id and sprint_id properties in the story table schema since they re virtual properties in the card class

4533001
for-loop	loops
calling a loops index variable loops is really no more expressive than calling it i and using a in a for-loop instead of a is certainly uncommon in my experience

4533045
twitter	myspace
if you just want to send the user to myspace to confirm a status message you can very likely do that with just a crafted url the way twitter does -- no special protocol or library required at all

4533051
submit	submission
all i m trying to make is a simple page containing a textarea box with a submit button and to have user submission appear below the box as they are submitted

4533093

i ve had the same problem but this should sort it out it s the same function the event to listen to is changed from move or drag to center_changed works like a charm

4533103
box-sizing	border-box
on supported browsers set box-sizing to border-box css3 only

4533103
width	margin
this causes the browser to calculate the width of an element as content + padding + border + margin as opposed to content-box in the css1 2 box model

4533111
srp	principles
however i am trying to understand each principles and it s not clear to me how srp applies

4533176
mouseup	mousedown
one could mousedown on the document then mouseup outside the browser and on this case the browser would still be thinking the mouse is down

4533262
put	get
you get an error like this if you try to put a too long string in a database column like abcd in varchar 3

in my experience pl pgsql has less overhead than say pl perl pl python or pl tcl if what you want to do is easily expressde in pl pgsql

4533401
width	height
wrap the div with a parent div then give a static width and height to parent div then set width and height the target div

4533419
skip-lists	union-find	skip-lists	tree	union-find	tree
known structures that can be used are b+ tree avl tree skip-lists hash table union-find rank tree and of course all the basics like arrays and such

4533562
qicon	qstyle
from what it looks you have to subclass qstyle and override pe_indicatortabclose and return a different qicon path

4533568
integer	unsigned
i m now thinking about adding an id as autoincerment unsigned integer to the user table

4533593
int	chars
this is commonly true with all dbms int are always faster than strings you compare it using artithmetical ã¼ber fast cpu operations instead of comparing strings chars to chars

4533625
width	height
to get the current size of it you use winfo height and winfo width in the other dimension

4533641
codeblocks	kdevelop	codeblocks	anjuta	anjuta	kdevelop
fedora already has codeblocks and other popular ides such as anjuta and kdevelop included as official packages

4533645
int	chars
chars byte short or int

4533689

4533720
icmp	tcp
other protocols such as icmp used by ping can run over ip but have nothing to do with tcp

4533745
width	margin
i think it is better to use fill_parent with a padding margin instead an exact width value

4533750
width	height
if you want the buttons to fill the space but divide it among themselves use a linearlayout give each button a height or width depending if column or row of 0px then use android layout_weight to allocate space between them on a percentage basis

4533766
udp	tcp
connectionless protocols like ip and udp are used for example with the video conferencing when you don t care if some packets are lost while you have to use a connection-oriented protocol like tcp when you send a file because you want to insure that all the packets are sent successfully actually we use ftp to transfer files

4533770
rdf	owl
is there any tool that can generate rdf document from owl file

4533771

4533993
post	put
it doesn t cover the body of put requests or the body of post requests that aren t form submissions

4534029
post	get
since under most circumstances a successful post invalidates a cache entry it s probably simply the case that the browser caches you re looking at just don t implement caching post responses since this would be pretty uncommon--usually this is accomplished by formatting things as a get which it sounds like you ve done

4534133
put	get
however you can put a broadcastreceiver in your manifest which will allow it to get control when the rest of your app is not running

4534135

autoboxing and implicit upcasting is only performed if there s no method which can be called without casting autoboxing

4534203
hash	md5
in my current project i have to compare 128bit values actually md5 hash and i thought it would be possible to accelerate the comparison by using sse instructions

4534252
int	boolean
however instead of using an int for true false you should use a boolean

4534288
rss	feed
you can read their rss feed and just display them on your site it will be live updating too

4534313
typedef	typename
edit i corrected the wrong keyword typedef to typename

4534374
google-chrome	firefox
why does the following code work in firefox and not google-chrome

4534396
nstextfield	nstableview

4534415
implements	extends
create a class that extends android.telephony.phonestatelistener and implements its oncallstatechanged

4534459
setinterval	settimeout
the source of that page is actually and if you look at the javascript it s obfuscated but i suspect some settimeout setinterval function that increases the number by an amount every period of time

4534459
cpu	processors
simple arithmetic does consume cpu but modern processors like my 3.4 ghz dual core can blast through them in no time and you don t even see that cpu usage spike in task manager

4534459
cpu	processors
oh and as an added side note running on the x64 version of firefox is lowering the cpu usage on my x64 processors

4534475

4534593
128bit	64bit
sse4.1 added vector 64bit integer comparisons pcmpeqq and pcmpgtq but because of the way they are implemented it is not straightforward to piece two of them together into a 128bit comparison

4534593
128bit	64bit
the preferred way to accomplish a 128bit comparison on x86_64 is to use a 64bit comparison on the high word then an additional 64bit comparison on the low word only if the high words compare equal

4534607
put	get
everyone - you rent from - will put their profit in the price you get so it is possible to create a service this way it would just be too expensive to sell

it doesn t rely on any other pear pecl or php files

4534824
width	height	portrait	landscape
you ll need to fix your cells frame width assuming the height is same in portrait and landscape mode within your cellforrowatindexpath method

4535037
put	get
does the table all get put into the cache thereby causing the query to slow as more and more rows get added or would the number of rows of the table not matter since the query uses the primary key

4535043
post	get
so here s a rather complete example of the service implementing a get and a post request and the client

4535056
post	put
basically i m sending all request via ajax jquery - for post it works like a charm but when i m sending data with put the parameters are empty not processed

4535119

4535603
google-chrome	firefox
any ideas why this wouldn t work in google-chrome or firefox

nstextstorage	nstextcontainer
i m using an nstextstorage an nslayoutmanager and an nstextcontainer

4536059
children	parent
is this parent child relationship requirement just for the purpose of closing all children when the parent is closed

4536071
width	height
the result of this step is a map from integers to width height pairs

4536071
width	height
save the mapping from codepoints to x y width height to another file

4536071
width	height
the in-memory representation could be a few arrays that contain x y width height

4536071
width	height
and probably you only need 8 bits for width and height anyway

4536090
for-loop	loops
i ve already converted my foreach loops to a for-loop but i want to know the details on why this error occurs

short	base
you should really read up on object-oriented development and what method overriding actually means but the short version is that you have a function in your code that has the override modifier attached to it but none of its base classes define a function with the same signature marked as virtual in this specific case they don t define a member with that signature at all

4536664
swift	objective-c
use the related tags objective-c and swift for issues specific to those programming languages

i am creating subviews of uiview of small dimensions and adding it to the view using the statement self.view addsubview myview

4536804
post	put
and then you would be able to write the plist file on server.and more over you could also use the method for parsing like post put and you can also send asynchronousrequest to the server that depends upon you

4536860
versioning	upgrade
in my case there were 2 different sdk settings in the project file due to 2 separate versioning of xcode editing the file this could be very likely if you restored from backup and had upgrade sdks in the interim

4536862
int	chars
array of chars or simply a string and not in an array of int

4536875
printf	strlen
when you use functions that operate on strings like strlen for string-length or using printf to output a string then those functions will read through the data until a null is encountered

4536879
printf	strcpy
this is baked into the language in the form of interpreting string literals and is adopted by all the standard library functions like strcpy and printf and etc

4536902
ceil	floor
you can then choice to ceil or floor this value to get a whole number or you could just use the value returned depends on your logic really

4536902

it works perfect on firefox google-chrome etc.

4536992
width	height
the scrollviewer could only work when it is smaller than which it contains either width or height

4536992
width	height
if you do not indict the width or height of the scrollviewer it will be stretched to fit its content and as a result the effect would not be perfect

salt	md5
i know md5 s safety is under question lately and this is the reason a lot of people are using salt i dont understand this at all btw but i was wondering if you wanted to easily implement a safe system in php can you just md5 something twice

4537059
hash	salt
you use a salt to make it more difficult for the attacker to get at your passwords because then he would need to know the salt so that he can use it in computing the hash for your passwords

4537074
fgets	fread
you have to call some function to request data to be read anyways and if it hasn t done it by the time you call fread fgets read etc.

4537077
width	height
i do not know exactly what is this option or configuration is there a property like window size or width and height in web configuration files like web.config and machine.config

4537082
hash	md5
if you don t believe in md5 you can try a higher algorithm by using the hash function

4537160
hash	salt
the salt is not normally kept secret but it s relatively random so an attacker who s doing a dictionary attack can t just hash each word as-is but has to take each possible salt value into account

put	get
in order to further put constraints on the mesh i get i will supply a list of fix points which must lie inside the polygon so that they must be connected by the triangle elements generated

4537167
concave	convex
i tried delaunay command but it can t work on concave polygon because the delaunay command will always return me a list of elements that encompass a convex area

4537265
concave	convex
as you noted this will create a triangulation of the convex hull even if you have a concave polygon so you would have to remove triangles outside of the constrained edges using the method inoutstatus also illustrated in the answers linked above

4537265
concave	convex
for example if you re faced with triangulating a concave polygon you can create a mex-file to interface one of the convex partitioning routines in cgal in order to break the concave polygon into a set of convex polygons

4537265
concave	convex
then delaunay could be used to triangulate each convex polygon and the final set of triangulations grouped into one larger triangulation of the concave polygon

performance points aside i consider boolean and int to be two fundamentally different concepts in programming

4545595

innodb	myisam
in my opinion myisam use to be faster than innodb now they are pretty much the same in speed

4546410
innodb	myisam
one of advantages of myisam over innodb is support of full text indexes it might be helpful if you planing to use full power of search queries

twos-complement	ones-complement	twos-complement	modulo
fortunately all current processors i m aware of use twos-complement for integer representation rather than ones-complement or sign-magnitude so integers at least have the same binary representation modulo byte order

4548645
installation	upgrade
if you consider a fixed installation of tomcat 6 as the deployment platform then a single application can not just upgrade to servlet 3.0 from tomcat 7 since this will effect all other applications running on that same tomcat

i just found out that if you set a breakpoint on a keydown event in the chrome developer tools javascript console the corresponding keyup event is never sent

4548672

so use console.log instead of breakpoints to debug keyup keydown events

4548684
put	get
in python how do you do reverse gmtime where you put the time + date and get the number of seconds

4548688

abc	subclassing
you can formalize python interfaces to some extent using the abc module which allows you to declare that a given class is a subclassing of a given abstract base class interface using any criteria you desire such as it has attributes color tail_length and quack and quack is callable. but this is still much less strict than static languages having an interface feature

4549266
put	get
basically the approach is to break you server requests into whatever operations you need to get data and each one can put data into different parts of a model

4549271
min	max
to get the bounding box you need to look at the four resulting points and find the min and max for y and x

opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the nice thing about douglas crockford s reference implementation is that it will use browser-native json parser if available fast efficient - available on ie8+ in standards mode latest opera google-chrome safari firefox - that s what felix s link talks about only falling back to javascript implementation slow in browsers where native json parser is not available

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it works great on opera google-chrome and firefox 3.6.13 but in newest version nothing happens

hash	md5
if you just need to check if the e-mail is in the system you should probably store a hash of some sort md5 or sha both of which mysql supports natively instead of the actual e-mail address

4549655
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
you can hash the values using md5 and a salt - a salt is just some extra stuff in this case a string to add a little more randomness to the results

4549655
hash	salt
then if you want to see if an email address already exists - take the one provided add the salt do the hash check if that value is in the db

4549655
hash	salt
if they do that they can see your hash function and salt

4549659

upon the viewdidrotate event you will have to adjust the table views width and height now uitableviewcontroller did that job for you before

4549668
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
update also for those wondering why i chose to multiplying by 0.5f rather than divide by 2 the arm processor doesn t support division in hardware so there is a minuscule performance bump by going with multiplication

4549710
google-chrome	firefox
this ide comes with an ie control webbrowser but the content that i want to display is broken on that browser xhtml+css also i want to remove the dependency of an external ie dll so the only solution that comes to my mind is use an engine of other browser like firefox or google-chrome

i have an iphone app that i ve been working on and have recently upgrade my versioning of xcode

4549857
post	get
you are confusing get and post in php

4549863
javassist	cglib
this solution isn t easy either but it could work using javassist or cglib you can insert code at the beginning of each internal method the ones presumably being called by the main run method to check if the thread is alive or some other flag if it s some other flag you ll have to add it as well along with a method to set it

4549863
javassist	cglib
i m proposing javassist cglib instead of extending the class through code because you mention it s external and you don t want to change the source code and it may change in the future

rss	feed
an rss feed is xml and so you d use something like the xml_parse_into_struct to begin parsing this feed

4550721
rss	feed
the blog page will have a link tag pointing to this xml file in its header so that browsers can allow users to subscribe to those rss feed

4550721

floating-point	integer
thus 1.0 i will be a float and multiplying a float by score which can either be an integer or float will result in another floating-point number

4551014
rss	feed
one of the issues i ran into fairly early on in the development of the project was that some of the feed i was using as test cases namely the hacker news rss feed used improperly formatted http headers and the httpwebrequest class in .net 1.1 and up promptly throws an unsafe header exception whenever you receive one of these headers in a get request

4551020
put	get
also tried the old rest lib first get a list of your friends from the console and then add your id and put them in the test console of the users.getinfo method uids looks like your_id friend_id friend_id friend_id friend_id and fields timezone you ll only get your timezone

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it would appear that safari google-chrome and firefox all utilize some pixel font hinting

udp	tcp
once you know who to connect to you simply open a tcp connection or use udp if it is time-critical and you re done

4551201

my idea is to 1 get the original collision bounding rectangle 2 transform the texture pos rot scale 3 factors changes of item into a matrix and then use this matrix to change the original collision bounds of the item

4551324
width	height
however my textures contain a lot of transparency transparency that affect the overall height width of the texture i do this to maintain power of two dimensions

fadein	fadeout
i am trying to load an external page as a popup using jquery fadein and fadeout functions

4551578
width	height
the reason why the height could be changed is because the footerview s height doesn t have the same mandatory stipulations as the width does so you can change the footer s height all you want just not the width

4551586
width	height
my designer have given me an image which is of the same height of imageview but the width is 1 10th of the imageview

4555486
udp	tcp
when you increase the number of tcp connections or data over tcp on a connection that s lossy enough you ll end up increasing your udp packet loss as your tcp connections will end up re-sending their data more and more and or reducing their window causing your 10 packet loss to actually be more like 90 udp packet loss now

4555486
udp	tcp
those are interdependent testing 10 udp loss and 10 tcp loss is no different than the above

4555521
pull	push
project a must point to x y z via git links instead of ssh if we want users to be able to check it out without ssh access so we can t make changes directly to x via the a x copy if we want to be able to push -- we have to clone it out separately commit push then pull from the a x copy

i was thing the way to do this was use the jquery droppable script and have the items draggable option disable when it is dropped in the droppable div

4564865
draggable	droppable
the problem is that i can t figure out how to make the droppable function work only for each particular draggable

i have a method that i would like to always run before the get accessor of a properties

4565102
google-chrome	firefox
using the same idea as clã udio silva s solution to this google-chrome issue the following javascript will work in firefox

4565779
lisp	scheme
in real lisp or scheme one can use one or more of the following

4565913
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
if the interactions are using touchesbegan and touchesmoved then use a uiview instead of a uibutton

4565936
move	drag
when you start out and each time the user move a handle determine the set of horizontal and vertical lines that the other handles cannot pass and enforce those boundaries during a drag

typedef	struct
please don t typedef struct in c it needlessly pollutes the global namespace which is typically very polluted already in large c programs

4566358

4566358
typedef	struct
if i have to maintain your code i will remove your typedef d struct

4566359
equals	gethashcode
this is somewhat costly as it involves overloading the equals method and gethashcode as well if you follow what microsoft recommends and using equals to iterate over the two collections comparing the properties of both objects and determining which records are new based on records that don t exist in your session object but do exist in your database object

4566361

you d want to use some sort of wsgi-compliant framework eg django web2py as you mentioned or webapp the simple framework provided by google for use with gae

4566361
django	web2py
i have no experience with webapp but i have some limited experience with django and web2py

4566361
django	web2py
as i understand it web2py supports gae better out of the box than django

4566361
django	web2py
personally i prefer web2py because i found myself fighting against the framework more when i used django eg can t write python code in django templates

however i m having a compatibility issue between firefox and google-chrome as clicking the checkboxes works just fine but clicking the labels somehow it s handled very differently as firefox will apparently not trigger the change when shift-clicking

4566586
google-chrome	firefox
obviously there s a trouble with firefox and the label i ve tried triggering the checkbox s change but it works backwards the behavior of the checkbox i ve tried resetting the label events with preventdefault and then triggering the change event and the issue seems to be the same but now google-chrome has this bug which i think it s somehow the correct way first homologizing

scheme	racket
ptl scheme has been renamed to racket but it s still pretty much the same

4566590

4566644
width	height
i use a simple grid partitioning system where the whole screen is divided into cells that are the width and height of the largest ball s diameter

4566645
width	height
in your case you are not using it often enough to have some significant impact on performance but it is much faster to assign same width and height to canvas object

4566647
hash	salt
5 char password is very low it should be hash and salt so probably end up 32 chars

4566659
hash	md5
i would use some hash of it maybe the md5 of it along with a check on the far side that the session person is the owner of that coupon and the coupon is valid.

4566669

submit	submission
the user has asked to save the fields automatically this will suppress the need for an extra action of submission - if you think about it - he is actually asking to submit every field when it looses focus

of unexpected parent or children

4567066
children	parent
i think i would also measure how many unexpected parent or children were discovered in each iteration of the loop and would compare to a preset constant that i am comfortable with ex say no more than 2

4567066
children	parent
if there are 3 or more unexpected parent or children iterations before the discovery of my desired anchor link i would assume it s not what i am looking for

packets	pcap
you can capture packets in promiscuous mode or non-promiscuous mode not sure if there is a better term for that .if your interface is in promiscuous mode pcap will show all packets that are received on your interface even if the destination of the packets does not match the destination of that interface

4567223
packets	pcap
lastly it will not show you packets that have not been sent yet since they have to be sent out an interface before pcap can see them

the synthesize directive will work too so you do not need to create your own getter and setter methods unless you want to do something else at the same time

4567644
width	height
suppose i have some arbitrary input image with width w1 and height h1

4567644
width	height
what i need then is to determine the canvas size width w2 and height h2 that can be used for all rotated versions of the input image

4567644
width	height
the other thing to consider is that objects such as squares will have corners that will stick out so just using the max value of width or height for both dimensions also does not work

4569734
stdout	stderr
stderr is not redirected to stdout

4569734

in order to actually redirect stderr to stdout you have to issue

4569743
stdout	stderr
like stdout stderr is usually directed to the output device of the standard console generally the screen

4569743
stdout	stderr
that means stderr is not redirected to stdout but they share a common file descriptor

so yes with dynamic the compiler does not check resolution of method calls properties accessor etc

4569915
ironruby	ironpython
this applies to all languages that offer dynamic typing in .net ironruby ironpython c# vb etc

4570096
width	height
i have a popup and wish it to be 75 of the height and width of the screen

4570156
openbsd	linux
linux doesn t currently have them to my knowledge but it s easy enough to bring those functions in from say openbsd

4570195
children	parent
the standar solution for your task is to select the parent and iterate over them getting the children with any dom api method

4570203
mousemove	mousedown
you need to attach to the picturebox s event not this and to the mousemove event not mousedown

4570209
google-chrome	firefox
so i madean html5 video for google-chrome and firefox .

4570209
google-chrome	firefox
the problem im having is that the video is working on some google-chrome browsers while it doesnt on others and the video is not showing at all on any firefox browser keep in mind that all browsers that were tested on were fully updated meaning they support html5 video here is my source code

4570236
switching	screens
for example application starts with splashscreen that will run for 3 seconds then automatically switching layout to application s first screens layout

4570242

in your activity s oncreate -method or even later you can then get the textviews or whatever you want by calling findviewbyid r.id.textview

4570336

for both case i think that you have to encode c coordinate as a path in an octree if you are using 3d or quadtree if you are using 2d

4570353
firefox	safari
the problem does not occur in firefox and safari

4570359

in a toy 4 kb javascript demo i wrote for fun i used an encoding for the result of compression that stores four binary bytes into five chars chosen from a subset of ascii of 85 chars that is clean for embedding in a javascript string 85 5 is slightly more than 8 4 but still fits in the precision of javascript int

4570422
ubuntu	linux
i have downloaded the installation for both windows and linux ubuntu

4570422
yaws	inets
with erlang yaws mnesia inets mochiweb e.t.c i have no problem so even if it requires me to develope an erlang application with a few gen servers on top of ejabberd that wont be a problem

4570426
ienumerable	idictionary
i guess there is some other interface that expandoobject implements like ienumerable as well as idictionary so the serialize method treats it as an array

4570427
stdout	stderr
it just happens that both stdout and stderr are typically mapped to the same output stream usually the console

4570427
stdout	stderr
if you redirect stdout to a file for example you will find that stderr remains directed to the console

4570435
width	height
you can play around with text fontfamily emsize width and height until you get the result you require

4570441
width	height
interestingly you never check to see if the drop is out of the screen interms of it s x co-ordinate you check the height but not the width you could save yourself some calculations and rendering time if you did this check as well

4570457
serializable	deserialization
least amount of serializable deserialization

4570553
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but not in google-chrome changing the css property background-image via jquery

4570554
width	height
you can use winfo_width and winfo_height to get the width and height of the window

4570565
outputstream	inputstream
i am not familiar with .dd as a file type but once you have the stream of data you can then use other inputstream or outputstream subclasses to manipulate it such as fileoutputstream to write the data to a file

4570583
accessor	properties
in addition to that 1 that forces me to specify names twice i already did so in the properties accessor names and in a manner that is invisible to refactoring tools 2 it is wrong -- the quotes aren t part of the name 3 it forces me to fix quoting at pojo level when it is actually a specific trait of the database system i am using

4570631
gif	png
draw a png jpeg or gif on your

4570671
sorting	filtering
this object is passed to service methods in by business layer which can use the information passed to apply appropriate sorting filtering

4570678
post	get
after deployment the api will use exclusively http post so my question is whether its possible to specify the data types that get sent via post individually for each parameter say i have a uid which is an integer and a name which is a string or do i need to cast them within ruby before passing them onto my database

4570751

4570954
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox and opera can handle it correctly whereas google-chrome and safari throw a console error saying inref is undefined

4570955
accessor	properties	getter	setter
the only way a function call could be triggered by your assigning to the id properties of x would be if you were using a browser that supported properties accessor getter and setter which is very unlikely and there s nothing in your code doing so

4570955
setinterval	settimeout
as jonathon pointed out in his comment on the question this could be something you ve set up with settimeout or setinterval or in an even handler on mouse move for instance etc. but it s nothing in the quoted code

4571051
interpolation	splines
bicubic splines interpolation

4571130

4571130
width	height
set width height to the dimension of the background image

4571134
width	height

vsto	add-in
ms vsto makes it look as though writing an office add-in is a piece of cake.

4571312
16-bit	64bit
16-bit arithmetic is generally believed to be inefficient on 64bit computers and 32-bit arithmetic should perform faster or just as fast as 64bit arithmetic but like i said your mileage may vary especially with future cpus

4571323
serializable	deserialization
i suggest that you design a object model which will cater for this structure and logic and use the xml serializable deserialization to persist or hydrate

4571436
int	double
so instead of generating struct_int_double you might generate sid struct int double or si32f64 struct 32-bit int 64-bit float or whatever

4571437
hide	show
you can show a loader image by putting it somewhere im tag and use below js code to hide it later on when all images are show

4571490

4571622
filesystems	ntfs
update this question has evolved into a question about the ntfs filesystems filter driver how to use the win32 api in backup applications and other programs that need to know what a file really is on disk

4571622
filesystems	ntfs
junctions and reparse points are key concepts that i needed to consider and are the most confusing thing in the ntfs filesystems

4571666
try-catch	exception-handling
will hide the exception-handling and since dealing with exception-handling is heavier compared to a simple if t why isn t the normal new t not considered less good practice considering we will have to use try-catch to check if a simple allocation succeeded and if we don t just watch the program die

4571704
width	height
how can i set a height and width of a imageview

4571736

4571783
post	get

mp3	ogg
it was because of the conversion of the files from mp3 to ogg

4571793
mp3	ogg
mp3 files were of higher bitrate and when converted to ogg ended up in the loss of quality which resulted in the noise

4571813
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am running this function as part of another function on window.resize and it is causing performance problems on firefox 3.6 that do not exist on current safari or google-chrome

4571909
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
is there a good way to find a named control in a form from the viewmodel when using caliburn.micro

4571927
submit	submission
you could move the add form outside of the parent form and hide it using css then as another poster said replace the submit button for the add form with a button with a correct id and finally hook into both onkeypress on the input and onclick on the button to simulate a submission of the actual add form

4572007
translation	transliteration

4572018
sudoers	visudo
access your sudoers file by using the command visudo

4572031
hash	salt
any good login system however should also hash and possibly salt every password before it goes into an sql query so is it still necessary to worry about sql injection attacks in passwords

hash	salt
i would never ever use just a hash against a string without a salt added to it

4572088
mouseover	mouseout
you ll have to disable the mouseover and mouseout events to see the effects of the click event handler properly

4572088
mouseover	mouseout
uses a flag to enable continuous scrolling on when the link s mouseover event handler is called and disable scrolling when the link s mouseout event handler

google-chrome	safari
it works great in safari 5 and google-chrome 8 except that google-chrome completely ignores the preload attribute and starts loading not playing the file after page load

4572125
google-chrome	safari
is there a way to make google-chrome behave like safari 5 ie

4572179
setinterval	settimeout
the setinterval method will run a function every x milliseconds unlike settimeout which only runs it once

4572179
setinterval	settimeout
you should never pass a string to setinterval or settimeout

4572186
versioning	upgrade
in the most recent 2.0.1 snapshot releases there are some further fixes to issues arising in upgrade from older versioning

4572212
int	double
i hoped that the implicit operator would have ensured that the double be converted to class a or the int to class b and the error avoided

4572248
implements	extends
upd the idea is that i don t want any explicit implements or extends classes

4572252
rss	feed
i m writing an test app that retrieves data from several outside sources think twitter rss feed etc. and under certain circumstances it stores that data in a db or presents it to the user

4572276
public	protected
however you could accomplish this by mapping the integer value for the enums as a protected field in the base class and use public properties in the extended classes to cast to and from the appropriate enum

4572302
rss	feed
i want to create a rss feed for a windows network folder something like acme test

4572345

the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars

4572430
folder	directory
netbeans creates resource files in the src directory by default default package so i added the src folder in step 5 above

4572462
traceback	attributeerror
the traceback should alert you to the attribute access that raised the attributeerror exception

4572464
inherited	properties
another interesting thing to note the current version of odata wcf data services does not support querying on properties of inherited classes so i had to move the start end date properties up to the base class in order to be able to restrict my search on them

4572496
button	checkbox
if i have a set of checkbox or radio button they might fit well if i stack them vertically when the user holds the phone in a vertical orientation

4572497
multiplying	subtract
if you look at the left child subtract multiplying 4 etc you see it is also a tree

4572497
multiplying	add
and so is the left half of that multiplying 2 add etc

4572506
width	height
upper bounds - the worst case is that each rectangle must be packed on a separate row so for each input rectangle calculate min width height and sum those pretend input rectangles are stacked upon one another using the minimum width or height of each input such that the other dimension of the input does not exceed the width of the enclosing rectangle

4572533
voip	sip
i have developed a voip application that uses pjsip to communicate over sip channel

4572549
visualvm	jhat
and you can analyse the heap dumps using a variety of programs such as jhat or visualvm both of which come with the jdk

4572554
glut	fltk
fltk provides modern gui functionality without the bloat and supports 3d graphics via openglâ and its built-in glut emulation

4572561
getter	setter
this way you can use self.myarray as both the setter and getter while retaining the variable

4572566
visualvm	jhat
then you can use some heap dump reader and analyze the results visualvm or jhat for example

4572568
explode	substr

rss	feed
i have quite a bit of experience with xml but no experience parsing rss feed

4572624
rss	feed
in some browsers when you try to view an rss feed it only shows the text

4572674
min	max
i can live with some fairly basic features drag and drop to configure dimensions sort by a column allow totals min max for a column and optionally expand collapse or drill down to sub-categories

4572677
integer	fractions
ieee 754 recommends the round half to even approach if the fractions part of d is 0.5 then round to the nearest even integer

4572677
integer	fractions
so you have to round a fractions 0.5 up half the time and down half the time hence the round to the nearest even integer bit rounding to the nearest odd would also work as would flipping a fair coin to determine which way to go

4572685
yourkit	jprofiler
jprofiler and yourkit are non-free and more useful

it happens in google-chrome 8.0.552.224 firefox 3.6.12 ie 8.0.7600.16385

4572934
mvp	presenter
i think the main point of gwt mvp is that presenter activities in 2.1 do not depend on view implementation so that you can easily swap in mock views for easy testing

4572962
post	get
except for firefox which according to my server logs tries to do both the get and the post leaving me with a page that s rather confused

4572993
integer	unsigned
the 1.8 documentation says that u is for a 32-bit unsigned integer and you re seeing it on a 64-bit unsigned integer so that behavior is off

4573005

post	get
but wouldn t it be easier to just accept json object through regular post or get that would contain method name and all parameters and then respond in json as well

4573305
xml-rpc	json-rpc
ok - after digging through various api s and learning a lot about xml-rpc json-rpc soap rest i came to a conclusion that this type of api is sound

4573320
put	get
whenever possible you should use idempotent methods such as get head put and delete which can t have side effects and are therefore less error prone easier to control

4573345
free	malloc
if your user has a different compiler then you can t free the string even if they did use malloc

4573372

another option would be to have an upgrade routine that during installation copies their old document replaces it with the new and then traverses the old copy for new sheets and what not to bring over

4573426
post	get	post	put	put	get
http uses get put post and delete for the requests

4573426
put	get
get put and delete are idempotent

4573432
inherited	properties
however they donâ t share the same namespace as declared properties which means that a class can declare a properties named somedata or inherited it from one of its superclasses have the backing instance variable with some other name and the implementation of a method of that class can also have a parameter local variable named somedata â the compiler wonâ t give a warning in that case

4573576

move	drag
an answer can either literally indicate how a view can leave and re-enter its superview during a drag operation or perhaps more elegant an alternative way to move a view to the foreground other than

4574101
put	get
the only problem i have now when i put my derived jpanel class onto the cardlayout using the choose bean function from netbeans netbeans always sets a new layout for the panel so my original layout from the jpanel class gets overridden and all i get is a blank jpanel

4574107
codeigniter	kohana
one downside of codeigniter is that it is built for php4 compatibility and so does suffer in a number of structural ways when you come to push the framework kohana is a fork that addresses this issue

4574126
decoder	encoder
this assumed you have flv decoder filter and h.264 encoder filers installed as mft or dmo

4574238
glfw	sdl
another is that other wrappers glfw sdl are not only under active development but generally more powerful

4574238
glfw	sdl
i mean it works and it is certainly possible to use it but both glfw and sdl want you to write the main loop of your program yourself sdl also has platform-independent yet explicit message handling which at least in my opinion results in much more clear and flexible code

4574246
versioning	upgrade
can i upgrade the gcc versioning or the clang versioning somehow

4574256
jar	war
i am looking for a tool where i can search several jar war .

4574306
jar	war
i don t know about a standalone tool but if you create a simple java project in eclipse and add the jar war etc files to that you can use the java search search dialog in eclipse

4574327
getter	setter
your property getter is returning itself and the property setter is assigning itself

4574338
for-loop	arrays
i want to make check of arrays by using for-loop

4574363
min	max
max min values are here

4574375
pull	push
with a plugin like hg-git you can at least push to and pull from a git server repository from mercurial allowing you to pull from the github repo to your local mercurial repo

4574375
pull	push
that makes senses if both repos have been developed separately you cannot push pull 2 mercurial repos one into another

4574376
google-chrome	safari
p.s - i am using a mac so theres no ie for testing yet this looks good in safari and google-chrome

4574387

4574443
hide	show
watch the focus and blur of the comment box and change the css class of another element to show and hide it

4574454
glut	sdl	sdl	freeglut
i find freeglut better then glut different license and provides better flexibility but it should be fairly easy to switch from glut to qt or sdl

4574479
getter	setter
the thing is that also from what i have seen and it seems logical is that using private fields but using getter and setter to access them is also not good as it defeats the point of using private fields in the first place

4574479
getter	setter
or do i really have to use private fields with getter and setter

4574479
getter	setter
conclusion getter and setter are fine as long as they are used smartly and only used when needed

4574486
post	get
i decided to point every form tag s onsubmit event to a js function to post stuff using ajax and to get results and i got to know this is not possible with asp.net as every time where is a button click there will be post back so it s hard to let page know what button was clicked

4574488
getter	setter
private fields and setter and getter is indeed your best way to go

4574488
getter	setter
all in all go with setter and getter it s just good practice even if you find options

4574494
rss	feed
i am parsing a rss feed using php but the problem is that is has some names like

4574495
sysml	uml
i suggest you to use topcased for modeling it is based on emf and provides you a good ide for uml sysml modeling

4574507
getter	setter
in java using private fields with getter setter is the recommend practice provided external clients of your class really need access to those fields

4574507
getter	setter
otherwise keep them as private fields and simply don t provide a getter setter

4574507
getter	setter
there is something called the javabeans specification that requires you to use getter setter

4574512
getter	setter
it s common to use getter and setter instead of giving other objects permission to change your fields directly

4574512
getter	setter
that might not make any sense when you see that 99.99 of your getter and setter don t do anything except what you could have done with direct access to the fields

4574512
getter	setter
you either have to hunt down all the places in your code where you modify the fields or if you used getter and setter you make the changes entirely in the class

4574514
getter	setter
getter and setter are part of the public interface of your class

4574514
getter	setter
when you define getter and setter you should be committed to maintain them in future versions

4574515
internationalization	translation
to translation taxonomy terms you should use the taxonomy translation module part of the internationalization package

4574523
getter	setter
if you have a private field with a method get and a method set that don t do anything other than retrieve and assign the value you should just make the field public as the field isn t really private and the getter and setter only hurt performance

4574523
getter	setter
if the getter and setter check the value being set or if the value is allowed to retrieve then go ahead and use getter and setter

4574523
getter	setter
this would be a good use of getter and setter

4574523
getter	setter
use getter and setter when doing anything other than retrieving or assigning a value

4574529
getter	setter
an advantage of using getter and especially setter is that it is much easier to debug write access to the fields

4574531
getter	setter
which also means this -- when you make a field private that does not automatically mean that you should make getter and setter for the field

4574531
getter	setter
private fields does not necessitate getter and setter

4574531
getter	setter
getter and setter are usually a way to directly affect a field that an object has maybe with some validation to prevent bad input from making your object have a state that it shouldn t but there are going to be times where the object itself should be in charge of affecting the data rather than an outside entity

4574549
rspec	capybara
i use rails 3 capybara 0.4.0 akephalos selenium-webdriver and rspec 2

4574553
getter	setter
the thing is that also from what i have seen and it seems logical is that using private fields but using getter and setter to access them is also not good as it defeats the point of using private fields in the first place

4574553
getter	setter
the main problem is that many developers automatically generate getter and setter for all private fields

4574553
getter	setter
but you should hardly ever exception value objects assume that all private fields will have getter and setter and let your ide generate them all

4574566
width	height
this is not a google maps related issue the thing is you need to set a specific width and height for your map canvas your code could be rewritten like

4574568
scheme	common-lisp	lisp	scheme
common-lisp and scheme are both dialects of lisp

4574605
ubuntu	linux
i wrote a simple python script using the socketserver it works well on windows but when i execute it on a remote linux machine ubuntu it doesn t work at all.

udp	tcp
for udp and new tcp connections there can be data loss

4574688
subtract	add
to rotate about a point you can subtract the pivot point before rotating it and add them after the rotation again so the rotation is virtually around 0 0

4574694
onkeydown	onfocus
you wouldn t be looking for the onfocus event though you would be looking for the onkeydown or similar event on the select box which could look something like this

4574708
button	checkbox
2 right mouse click on the friday jtextfield drop down a menu with either button or checkbox that let me choose then close the menu and get the value

4574715
width	height
an image has a certain width and height in pixels

4574717
prepare	execute
the os doesn t know how long the new process will be aware so it must prepare itself as if the entire process will be long lived thus it sets up the virtual clone of all 240gb before obliterating it with the execute call

4574724
curb	libcurl
you need to install libcurl not for curb gem but for taf2-curb gem just looking carefull in error log

4574741
jedit	scite
jedit and scite you may like it

4574759
pthreads	fork	waitpid	fork
if you are working with pthreads compliant systems of which macos and unix generally are use fork execv and waitpid instead of system .an example can be found here

4574791
move	drag
any idea how can i force the maplayer to keep track of the push-pin location during the drag and redraw it properly as mouse move

4574800
post	get
the new action expects a get request but the create action expects a post request

4574865
pylons	pyramid
choose any wsgi-compatible framework like already mentioned pyramid django or pylons to name a few and you will have plenty of deployment possibilities

4574883
post	get
for example when you post and you get to the next page and go back you will get all given information in the fields before you post it

4574912
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 3 and google-chrome 8.0 the following works as expected

4574914
min	max
loop min max func

4574914
range	min	range	max	min	max
this loop should perform the func between the range min and max integers

4574967
sudo	passwd
alternatively you can override the error by prefixing the last command with sudo and entering your admin passwd

4574968
srp	principles
one might also consider that dry can violate the single responsibility principles srp

4574990
min	max
what you want this to do is to execute fn min and then loop + min 1 max fn afterwards

4574990
min	max
what it actually does do is it executes fn min then loop + min 1 max fn and then it tries to apply the result of fn min to the result of loop + min 1 max fn

4574990
min	max
to get what you want do begin fn min loop + min 1 max fn

4575012
folder	directory
often there is an asset folder within the root directory with an image js and css folder within it

4575043
superclass	subclassing
but i am unable to obtain subclassing harddrive.cs methods only the superclass abstract deviceinfo methods such as .named

post	get
to make it simple for them i thought it will be better if they just send a mail to post mydomain.com and that will get posted to their respective web pages created by me

4575097
post	get
i am working with wordpress and trying to get the information from all the post created the current day

4575097
post	get
i know that there is data there because when i do a print_r on the post array i get the following

4575126
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest api - why use put delete post get

4575126
post	get	post	put	put	get
but i still don t understand why we need to utilize different http requests delete put post get in order to build nice api

4575128
content-disposition	content-type
the content-disposition header appears to be right however the correct mime-type content-type for text files is text plain

4575192
free	malloc
but if those language are different why is it still possible to use function like malloc or free

4575209
integer	unsigned
i think your problem may be that standard c will compare a signed integer and an unsigned integer by promoting -1 to an unsigned quantity value preserving instead of sign preserving which in turn means that x is never greater than the converted -1 and the comparison is always false

4575231
free	malloc
if c++ didn t have malloc free you couldn t compile existing c code as c++ because you d have to pay some poor shmuck to go through and find all the malloc calls and replace them which is expensive

4575246
put	get
hope this helps its should also get rid of the cannot modify header info if you put it before the doctype and html tags

4575257
put	get
in sql server management studio put both queries in the same query window and get the query plan for both at once

4575265
free	malloc
it would be silly to exclude part of the library like malloc and free just because there are more idiomatic c++ alternatives if you want to do stupid things c++ gives you the power to do so

4575266
textarea	textbox
how would i find if a textbox or textarea currently is in focus

4575270

the scriptmanager and updatepanel controls will make you task easy and fast to convert to and ajax enabled website

4575363
fastcgi	scgi
is it possible to maintain multiple django actually fastcgi scgi projects on one ip address and distinguish them by port

4575420
put	get
however you can still get the behavior you want inside the column by putting a framelayout into the column which stretches the width of the column and then put your button inside there

4575477
hash	salt
take a salt hash and forget the plain text password immediately

4575496
decoder	encoder
you have an encoder and a decoder for bmp

4575498
put	get
for example if you have domain objects which you want to transport then these can be retrieved via a get updated via put all through a standard url

4575553
getter	setter
but if you can t come up with any better names than getfoo and setfoo for the methods it s a good clue that your getter and setter are probably worthless

firstly memory tables can t don t use b-tree indexes hash indexes only so queries which could otherwise use an index for ordering or ranging operations resort to sorting filtering manually exhaustively

4575596
post	get
i know how to redirect with redirect function on other asp.net page and read parameters from url from request but i don t want get i need post i am sending ids over url so user doesn t need to see that

4575602
iboutlet	ibaction
go ahead and create an iboutlet property in your view controller for the segmented control and then hook it up to the control you create in interface builder may as well create an ibaction method as well for responding to changes in the control

4575616
prepare	execute
you established the connection and prepare the query but you didn t actually execute it

4575632
post	get
a redirect by definition is a get you can t do a 301 or 302 redirect with a post

4575648
post	get
your php script will send mail in some way and likely expect a few parameters sent through an http request using either a post or get method

4575650
google-chrome	firefox
it works on godaddy and fails on both ipage and startlogic on my network at work using firefox ie and google-chrome

4575652
int	double
if you use double then the mantissa is easily large enough for a 32-bit int and an expression like i double int_max should be sufficient obviously allow for unsignedness if you need to

4575663
for-loop	loops
when x 1 it breaks out of loops and doesn t get included in the contents of the for-loop

4575674
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however in this case all browsers print the same page ie google-chrome opera safari and firefox displays it in another way

4575705
ubuntu	linux
i am not seasoned with vmware or linux so i may be missing something obvious here -- it seems like somewhere along the way either ubuntu or the vm has a networking issue

4575709
apache	nginx
please comment on apache if you think nginx etc

4575874
vbo	normals
then set vertex normals and texcoord pointers - they point at the beginning of vbo plus their offsets in vertex structure

4575874
vbo	normals
one suspicious place is setting vertex normals texcoord pointers - they get set only once - and set to the beginning of the vbo

4575875
apache	nginx
personally my preferred setup is still nginx - apache - mod_wsgi with multiple apache servers for heavy sites

4575879
bresenham	dda
using either digital differential analizer dda or the bresenham algorithm will yield the same results you see for gdi+ but if you look at the standard gdi line drawing implementation you will notice that the standard gdi lineto implementation actually draws the line one pixel shorter than what you specify to quote the msdn

4575956
pop-up	dialog
if the server returns a url or something distinguishable from no messages then you ll get the pop-up and if they hit ok are sent to the url using a basic confirm dialog in javascript

4575965
hide	show
possible option to deal with it - hide elements before they are pimped out with jquery ui and show them with js after load

4576019
mouse	keyboard
it would be also great to be able to handle simple keyboard mouse events for this program but it isn t my primary target here maybe some other third party libraries will help with it

4576019
allegro	sdl
otherwise how does allegro sdl create window

4576033
post	get
hmm thanks but i want to get the total number of all post but only one post of each category also the categories are fully trimmed

4576044
allegro	sdl
i recommend sdl small probably exactly what you need allegro similar or qt largeish

4576059
glut	glfw
i suggest you to try opengl coupled with either glfw or glut

4576059
glut	glfw
personnal note go for glfw because glut isn t maintained anymore i think.

4576087
allegro	sdl
otherwise how does allegro sdl create window

4576091
width	height
i want it transparent and width 60px and height 40px

4576102
cakephp	kohana
if you think you need a less complicated framework i suggest toro it has nothing to do with frameworks such as kohana or cakephp

4576115
dictionary	map
let s say i have a list a in python whose entries conveniently map to a dictionary

4576118
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i add the uitabbarcontroller like this as subview to my uiviewcontroller view

4576122
nemerle	boo
adding caas to a language like c# or even macros to boo is not nearly enough to reach nemerle s level of metaprogramming for which the language has been designed from the start

4576122
nemerle	boo
boo primarily integrates with sharpdevelop while nemerle has visual studio 2008 integration

4576123
maven	pom.xml
i am guessing maven is trying to install the artifact proivded in the parent pom.xml

4576125
post	get
it seems that every get or post is causing the debugger to stop there and i have to push continue multiple times to get the site to show anything

4576148
organization	naming
organization of naming namespaces folders assemblies database s

4576176
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller should never be embedded in a uiviewcontroller because as it descends from uiviewcontroller it already is one

4576176
uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
make the uitabbarcontroller s view the subview of your uiwindow in the app delegate

4576221
folder	directory
i deleted the web applications obj directory and bin folder and rebuild but it still occurs

4576227
fileoutputstream	filechannel
java nio filechannel versus fileoutputstream performance usefulness

4576267
dxcore	coderush
check out coderush xpress and dxcore from devexpress they are both free and dxcore gives you some easy ways of hooking into things like that

4576275
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
and in your say appdelegate you would have your normal call to show the main uiviewcontroller in your case it sounds like a uitabbarcontroller

4576278
viewdidload	viewdidappear
put the same code inside viewdidappear and not viewdidload since the view cannot be initialized yet

4576304
pascal	delphi
delphi is from mid nineties so that probably means delphi s ancestor turbo pascal not delphi

4576350
google-chrome	firefox
go into portable firefox s view menu and turn off all of the google-chrome - the navbar bookmark bar status bar etc

4576356
getter	setter
if it is a custom getter you want then you might look into using getter and setter in javascript - they are not supported by ecmascript prior to es5 but many engines support them nonetheless

4576421
width	height
if you remove width 350 from the textblock then the canvas and the rectangle will have 0 height and width on the stack panel

4576421
width	height
you need to set the height and width properties of the textblock manually since the other two elements depend on it

4576477
actualheight	actualwidth
the changes were in onvisualchanged i added an eventhandler for layoutupdated and changed rendersize to actualwidth actualheight

4576495
int	chars
index arrays such as your that you d have to cast from chars to int smell of a weak type design

4576521
slideup	slidedown
i have a simple question about jquery slidedown slideup

4576536
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception are known as unchecked-exception meaning you don t have to check for them occurring by way of a try catch

4576560
move	drag
i am using the drag gesture to move elements on a canvas

4576565
children	parent
the problem is however that in ie not 9 the white spaces isn t part of the children list of the parent node rendering the method useless in ie

4576619
debian	linux
another possibility although probably more complicated is to install a full-blown linux distribution on your phone for example debian which has everything you d need to install a compiler -- there is a guide on how to do that here and you can search for more on google

4576654
free	malloc
malloc and free are required so that you can call into c language libraries from c++ code

4576654
free	malloc
the c language library might return a pointer to memory allocated with malloc that must be free by the caller with free

4576654
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
or less commonly it might require a pointer to memory allocated with malloc that it can internally reallocate with realloc or free with free

4576657
hash	md5
you could also store passwords in a stronger hash encryption hash instead of md5

4576661
hash	md5
you appear to be storing passwords hash - good - though using md5 not so good arguably but with no salting of any kind - this means that if someone s gotten hold of your password hash then they could use rainbow tables brute force to try to crack passwords

4576661
salt	md5
i d recommend having a read of which will explain why a per-user salt will help and the real reason md5 is probably not the best choice for a password hashing function any more

4576681
codeigniter	cakephp
you need to compare php and ruby or compare codeigniter cakephp etc php frameworks to rails

4576736
quicksort	mergesort
if you are counting duplicates then do a quicksort or a mergesort first that would then make your comparison operation an o n operation

4576750
hide	show
i assume you are currently using jquery s show and hide methods to work with the those divs

4576750
fadein	fadeout
instead jquery has a fadein and a fadeout function which do exactly as they sound you can find the docs for fadein here

4576806
codeigniter	cakephp
what advantage does using a framework like codeigniter or cakephp or zend provide over using plain vanilla php

4576837
wordpress	joomla
hi i am using joomla and wordpress both and i use a single sign-on plugin which is joomla based

4576837
wordpress	joomla
what i mean is when a user logs into joomla he automatically gets logged into wordpress and similarly when a user registers into joomla his details are automatically replicated into wordpress

4576837
wordpress	joomla
so i wanted to know is there a way to display the joomla login module in the wordpress pages so that when a user logs in from a wordpress page he gets his credentials checked from the joomla database and the rest is handled by my joomla single-signon plugin

4576854
equals	gethashcode
the items are required to have a valid equals and gethashcode implementation

4576865
put	get
i was thinking if i put them into ints that would get rid of the decimal but it did not look right as the decimals were just dropping off

4576870
ceil	math.h
use math.h function ceil number

4576898
getter	setter
entity objects shouldn t contain business logic so i think you d be okay having a service class use the xmlreader to perform operations on the data and then use the getter setter to manipulate the data in the object

4576928
hash	salt
hash hash vs salt hash

4576928
hash	salt
many hash iterations append salt every time

4576928
hash	md5
what happens when old apps still using md5 sha-1 need to migrate their hash to a more recent implementation

4576940
folder	directory
was i supposed to create some sort of file within the new directory or folder i created called mydb

4576955
width	height
i think the ie5 box model is more similar to human s logic about box s concept withing including padding and border.it can defined the box width and height directly

4576970
awt	swing
it is similar to the graphics class in awt swing if you are familiar with that

4576973
r-tree	quadtree
depending on the data type and usage pattern either an r-tree or variant r r+ or a quadtree or perhaps even a kd-tree

4576993
ant	maven
if you re using ant the best way to use maven repositories to download jar dependencies is to use ivy with ant

4576993
nexus	artifactory
it works with nexus and artifactory if you use those as your local maven repositories

4577004
folder	directory
however i have multiple applications which all use some common assemblies and my goal is to relocate these particular assemblies to the common files folder in the program files directory

4577057
innodb	myisam
i ve read various threads about which is better between innodb and myisam

4577057
innodb	myisam
therefore certain tables which are often read can be set to myisam but tables that need transaction support can use innodb

4577122
children	parent
.htaccess files are hierarchical in scope any such files in parent directories apply to their children

4577138
submit	submission
what this does is never submit directly but if the check is ok calls the native submit method submission the form and not running this handler again

4577139
innodb	myisam
you don t choose innodb or myisam on a database level but instead on a table level

4577139
innodb	myisam
so within the one database you could have some tables running the innodb engine and some running myisam

4577139
innodb	myisam
as you pointed out you could choose to use innodb on the tables that require transactions etc and myisam where you need other features such as fulltext searching

4577167
nscoding	nsmutablecopying
here is the .h file--- it cut off nscoding and nsmutablecopying protocals and my imports but they are there

4577179
ready	each
then using that stored data we can attach a single handler to the #mail-in-inbox container one time on dom ready rather than one to each each time this function runs it should look like this

4577202
superclass	subclassing
it does refer to the correct class it s just that unless redeclared or otherwise the reference set is broken static properties in subclassing are in the same reference set as in the superclass

4577225
calloc	malloc
use calloc instead of malloc to initialize the contents of buffer to 0

4577241
innodb	myisam
you can have both myisam and innodb tables in the same database

4577241
innodb	myisam
innodb can be slower at searches because it doesn t offer full text search like myisam but that isn t a big problem when you compare it to table-level locking of myisam

4577251
ubuntu	debian
now to wait for debian and ubuntu to upgrade.

4577283
move	drag
and then you can handle this manually when the user clicks the label a popup menu will open and when the user drag the label the window will move

4577306
versioning	upgrade
it looks like the latest versioning of monotouch i had to upgrade to ios 4.2 first to get it now implements a strongly typed delegate for handleevent and a new nsstreamevent type so it can be more easily handled

4577360
put	get
i ve been wanting to put out an app with ads in it but have been reading you need to initially pay at least 50 to get started

4577373
submit	submission
if it really submit the form then you ll want to handle this server-side because submission the form will tear down the current page and replace it with what you return from the form submission

4577385
mouse	keyboard
with no keyboard or mouse and the front panel switches disabled she is enough of a luddite that i don t think that she will think of pulling the cord out of the wall socket

4577394
hash	salt
you should either take care to avoid the hash extension issue or include a salt value into the data to be hash either by communicating the salt across the link or having differing vales for each code path

4577398
public	protected
the naming guidelines for fields apply to static public and protected fields

4577398
public	protected
you should not define public or protected instance fields

4577411
kde	gnome
for example a scheduler might be 2000 lines of code but linux is about 50 million lines of code and if you add stuff like apache x gnome kde mozilla etc on top of that then you can imagine how much potential for gritty work might be involved in an entire os.

4577430
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i was prepared to file this as a bug but then i found that the behavior is identical on safari v5 google-chrome v8 and firefox v3.6 and v4.0b

4577446
integer	unsigned
use 0xc0000000u for an unsigned integer variable

4577450
post	put
in this example something triggers the get_items javascript function which fires off the ajax call a post request to ajax-handler.php with parameters get-store-updates true which satisfy the if isset _post get-store-updates i put in the php

4577453
ubuntu	linux
i am attempting to build fastcgi on a linux ubuntu 10.x machine

4577460
boost	stl
of stl and boost into that layer

4577464
int	double
the group key in the pattern should match the data followed by an int value and the if there exist a comma then the next string i.e a double value

4577469
post	get
the request is the same except after the blank line that terminates the get is the post data

4577476
dictionary	map
the map can keep track of which chunks are loaded using a dictionary

4577517
pop-up	dialog
15+ jquery pop-up modal dialog plugins and tutorials

4577530
children	parent
goldberg s low-level operators alter how children are formed from the parent and the high-level operators are modifying how selection chooses the parent

4577542
bluetooth	usb
i don t think you need to worry about the specifics of usb bluetooth more so it should be a process of connecting the scanner to your computer and then opening a serial stream which is exposed through usb bluetooth

4577542
bluetooth	usb
i suspect that all of the scanners are programmed via rs232 over some standard where that standard could be bluetooth or usb

4577546
width	height
setup open excel 2007 set the width of the first column to 15.0 110 px the height of the first row to 30.0 40 px split the widow pane in four at the first cell and save the file

4577546
width	height
when you open the file with the open xml sdk 2.0 productivity tool the column width is 15.7109375 and the height is 30 yet the xsplit value is 2040 and the ysplit value is 795

4577568
jqgrid	datatables
but if you are further interested you go deep into some other plugins like datatables or jqgrid which are quite good grid data frameworks using jquery

4577592
switching	screens
as soon as i touch the screens this will switching to 0

4577606
subset-sum	np-complete
i believe this problem by itself to be np-complete based on similaries to subset-sum problem

4577699
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 534.10 khtml like gecko google-chrome 8.0.552.224 safari 534.10 browser system.web.mobile.mobilecapabilities host 67.142.173.27

4577736
rss	feed
i am trying to build a rss feed parser using rssutil.jar

4577737
devise	cancan
hi i m wanting to do some functional testing of my rails 3 app that uses devise and cancan

4577758
photoshop	paint.net
with the release of the .net framework however the preferred development language is less of an issue and c# vb.net c++ cli and other .net languages may be used but few major consumer applications that i am aware of yet use .net and if you compare the performance of say the excellent but slow paint.net with photoshop elements for example you can probably see why

4577796
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
other business sectors prefer either the java environment or the microsoft programming world vb6 vba vb.net c#

4577814
pong	pacman
after implementing pacman and snake i m implementing the next very very classic game pong

4577815
hash	md5
if they don t remember their security passwords for example your server could store an md5 hash of their password to match up their mobile device with their record on your server so you can send them a key to reset the app

4577824
nginx	lighttpd	g-wan	lighttpd
even lighttpd or nginx with natively pre-compiled c++ is slower than g-wan s c scripts

4577838
boost	stl
i am aware of c++0x and boost libraries but for now i would prefer to stick to a stl approach

4577862
post	get
i assumed that a predefined set of form elements whose names are in process_form_field hash get translated into xml elements with the same name all stored flatly under a parent element and that your perl web framework has a method process_form_data which translates from form data query_string or post data into a hash mapping form s input element names to submitted values embperl has a built-in fdat hash that automatically achieves this

4577874
pull	push
this is extra annoying because if i later do a git push on master it says that non-fast-forward updates were rejected on the tracking branches since they weren t fast-forwarded on the initial git pull

4577885
binutils	glibc	toolchain	binutils
i would like to compile only the toolchain binutils + gcc + glibc for a specific target ar71xx and also the kernel

4577890
implements	extends
if you find a douglas-peucker algorithm implements in your language it might have some 2d vector math implements and you ll need to extends those to use 3 dimensions

4577894
jar	war
since tomcat 6.0 obviously comes with all of the tomcat 6.0 jar files it stands to reason that you won t have any conflicts if you just use a fresh tomcat 6.0 install and then move your war file applications to the new tomcat 6

4577899
vim	notepad++
use a decent text editor like notepad++ or vim

4577941
addclass	removeclass
but in my real problem not this analogy i want to use addclass and removeclass which only functions with jquery objects

4577941
addclass	removeclass
it is to cumbersome to use other functions than addclass and removeclass

4577950
fast-forward	merge	pull	push
git pull on master will merge files on master meaning the next push will be a fast-forward one

4577950
fast-forward	merge
when set to only only such fast-forward merge are allowed equivalent to giving the --ff-only option from the command line

4577967
equals	compareto
fields which make up hashcode equals compareto should be immutable

4577985
range	minimum
that way it would simply a case of returning the minimum for that column within the date range you re interested in

4577998
put	get
now when looking at the hashmap javadoc page they only really speak about the get and put methods

4578008
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
can anyone tell me how to get track information from the musicbrainz database from an audio file mp3 wav wma ogg etc... using audio fingerprinting

width	height
width 184 height 52

4578029
mockito	jmock
unit testing which is traditional junit+ jmock or mockito etc

4578074
mouseover	mouseout
then your two functions one for mouseover one for mouseout that change the url based on the image

4578074
mouseover	mouseout
off-topic #2 the mouseover event happens repeatedly when the mouse is passing over the element and both it and mouseout bubbles up the dom

4578074
mouseleave	mouseenter
this means that for hover effects like yours if you can t use css and you can t on ie6 you re better off using the mouseenter and mouseleave events most of the time

4578074
mouseleave	mouseenter
- they ll emulate mouseenter and mouseleave on browsers that don t support them directly

4578117
google-chrome	firefox
if you re interested you can find the implementation for free software browsers such as firefox and google-chrome

4578161
folder	directory
images is the folder or directory residing in the application folder please help me i have

4578176
typedef	struct
in that case you need to either write struct node in each declaration or use a typedef

4578231
post	get
when i run python manage.py dbshell command i get this error the solution is partly hinted at in the second post of this thread

4578249
boost	stl
i m looking for a way to find the longest word base on length in a text document using stl and boost

4578257
wordpress	phpbb
a similar example i have is a site running wordpress for content management and phpbb for a forum both styled to look the same

4578291
allegro	sdl
how does allegro or sdl create window for windows and how to do it by myself

4578369
ant	maven
after you manage to exactly understand everything happening by all means - switch to netbeans and in a parallel thread learn ant then maven

4578379
google-chrome	firefox
has anyone idea why cell border on this page is well rendered in firefox but not in ie and google-chrome

4578386
pow	sqrt
if you are not using mysql you may need to change either the pow or sqrt functions

4578386
cos	sin
also be aware that sin cos functions take there inputs in radians

4578391
hide	show
i am wondering whats the way to use zend_acl to show hide parts of view

4578425
google-chrome	firefox
make the firefox effect like the google-chrome

4578431
hash	salt
what i am wondering about how do you salt a hash and work with the salt hash

4578434
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
you can also forge the asp.net-mvc framework to be restful but that requires a fair bit of work compared to openrasta which works out of the box

4578440
hash	salt
you need to store both the hash and the salt that has been used to calculate the hash

4578440
hash	salt
if you then want to check if an input is equivalent to the original input value you can re-calculate the hash with the same salt and compare the stored hash with the new calculated one

4578448
min	max
now if you want to find the min and max values of each subtree you should use a container i used an arraylist and store a triplet of node min max which represents the root node and the values obviously

4578448
min	max
now this is a method which finds the min and max values of a given node

4578471
submit	submission
if i submit a form as soon as i am logged in then it works ok but if i keep submission data again and again then after a minute or so one of the submit will happen as a logged out user and not as the user who was logged in which all the other submit worked as

4578472
hash	hmac	hash	md5	hmac	md5
for instance in tls used pseudo-random function which is based on sha1 and md5 hash over shared secret dh key exchange value string label to distinguish different cases for which key is generated hmac cipher and so on and shared random parameter both client and server generates his own half of random parameter

4578484
nginx	cherokee
i think scalability and multi-core support can be handled with an nginx or cherokee in front

4578585
oncreate	ondestroy
so i want to write 2 static methods -- oncreate and ondestroy -- then mark them as stored procedures

4578603
width	height
lets say you have an x and y coordinate to start from and then a width and height of the crop

4578668
entity-relationship	diagram
database design using entity-relationship diagram by sikha bagui and richard earp should be a good starting point

4578679
jobs	cron
some days after i see high server loads that cant be coming just from the cron jobs that i run every now and then to grab feeds from other websites for my blog website

4578683
subtract	add
request scoped managed bean used on view calculator.xhtml with actions add and subtract

4578692
google-chrome	firefox
i have packaged the code to work with firefox and google-chrome and those are both working well and i can run the code for ie in bookmarklet form without problems but i would like to learn how to package javascript as an actual .net .msi addon plugin that will install for the current internet explorer 8 9

4578753
portrait	landscape
on my app when i first press ctrl+f12 the screen changes to landscape from portrait

4578781
datalist	repeater
asp.net repeater or datalist

4578781
sorting	filtering
i ve been trying to implement the example on n-layered web applications with asp.net 3.5 part 4 sorting paging and filtering the database paging section and ignore the rest

4578786
width	height
on the other hand window coordinates describe a point somewhere between 0 0 and width height of the window

4578791

in ios4+ you can use an image mkoverlay to overlay whatever you want on top of a mapkit map

once you ve sent the wm_gettext message as i suggested above to get the text that is displayed on the control you can get the position of the mouse relative to the control using a combination of getcursorpos and windowfrompoint and check that against the width and height of the text string returned by gettextextentpoint32

4582151
komodo	aptana
from my part i have not used aptana and komodo edit

4582170
width	height
the xaml image will re-size depending on the width height of the bitmap itself and how much space is available

4582170
width	height
wpf uses a two pass layout system - in the first round each control is asked how much space it desires in the second each control is assigned a width height

4582170
width	height
before binding the bitmap and if none of the ancestors of your image control have a fixed maximum width you cannot retrieve the image height simply because there is none set yet

4582170
width	height
one approach would be setting the width height of the image based on an ancestor via binding again this would require some set width height on the container

4583907
iprincipal	iidentity
it s possible to store data in session and to overwrite the iidentity and iprincipal with that data but this does means that the user identity will have some data for the events before session is available and different data for the events after session is available which may or may not be a problem

i was planning on open sourcing the code put haven t had time to get it ready

4585386
width	height
so now the code runs and logs the touch events to logcat but nothing appears to happen i m guessing you want 3 spaces which can be dragged and repositioned on the screen - some initial problems i think the snap_velocity value of 1000 seems a bit high to me for some dragging gestures none of the layout xml files appear to be used and if the current screen is the full width and height of the device where does it get dragged to

4585405
width	height
the size is a complex datatype that requires two numbers width and height to be initialized

4585405
width	height
you need to seperate the width and height and store them in two seperate keys see my previous post

when i click the button to collect all the visible checkbox on the page i want to make sure that it is not already in the ol list

4586536
put	get
to get the exact output you posted put it in a loop like

4586595
folder	directory
since i m running tomcat will the classes be loaded based on tomcat s directory where it compiles the java folder to class files

4586596
domxpath	domdocument
it may be worth looking into php s domdocument and domxpath this will allow you to query html and xml using xpath s query language

4586613
installation	upgrade
it isn t clear to me if your concern is with having to develop all these upgrade paths or with getting this integrated into your installation upgrade procedure

4586613
versioning	upgrade
so for each new versioning you only have to follow this convention and implement the upgrade from the previous versioning

4586654
versioning	upgrade
at the end of this you only have to build an upgrade script to take you from the immediate previous versioning to the current one

4586678
rss	feed
we do something sort of like this with rss feed using python -- we use elementtree since rss is usually guaranteed to be well-formed

4586678
eventlet	gevent
scrapers are usually i o bound -- look into coroutine libraries like eventlet or gevent to exploit some i o parallelism and speed up the whole process

4586763
client-side	server-side
rest apis are generally stateless therefore you should avoid the use of server-side sessions or client-side cookies

4586782

how can i use xjc s -enableintrospection with jaxws-maven-plugin

4586937
textview	listadapter
just use the link above to create a custom listadapter that takes in an array of your searchresult objects and inserts the necessary data into the corresponding textview

4586962
unsigned	short
due to default promotions which are required by the standard to be applied for variadic functions it is impossible to pass arguments of type char or short or any signed unsigned variants thereof to printf

4586962
unsigned	short
short int or unsigned short int argument the argument will

4586962
unsigned	short
be converted to short int or unsigned short int before printing

4586962
unsigned	short
if the argument was actually of type short or unsigned short then promotion to int followed by a conversion back to short or unsigned short will yield the same value as promotion to int without any conversion back

4586962
unsigned	short
thus for arguments of type short or unsigned short d u etc

4586962
unsigned	short
as far as i can tell the only situation where the h or hh modifier could possibly be useful is when the argument passed it an int outside the range of short or unsigned short

4586962
int	chars
note what s going on is that the original type was chars which gets promoted to int and converted back to unsigned chars instead of chars thus changing the value that gets printed

4587003
gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
a class compresses and decompresses files using gzipinputstream and gzipoutputstream

i am developing testing on linux ubuntu 10.x

4587021
implements	modifiers
another idea would be to implements these properties just as regular floats or vectors and create special modifiers -types binding to these properties

4587091
h.264	webm
i vote for webm as a better quality and freer alternative to h.264

4587093
g++	gcc
using gcc instead of g++ on my system turns that error into a warning on my system mandriva linux 2010.1 64-bit and allows the compilation to complete

4587102
unsigned	short
a negative short displayed as an unsigned long in hexidecimal will therefore on any machine be padded with f due to implicit sign extension in the promotion which printf will print

4587124
subtract	add
subtract the target position from the camera position then scale it then add the target position in again

4587140
accessor	properties
note that i m caching the length value as the array s length properties is actually an accessor which is marginally slower than an internal variable

4587144
post	get
it s basically just presentation of data information that is able to transfer data to the server either as get post delete put...

4587144
post	put
postbacks wouldn t even work unless you d put a submit button on it because there s no __dopostback client side functionality that would make a post request to the server

4587149
ready	each
each object should be in its own file and can be instantiated perhaps multiple times or perhaps as a singleton once the document is ready

4587174
prepare	execute
originally the audit logging was done with a custom audit handler class that extends java.util.logging.handler and the publish method would open a database connection populate a prepare statement from the logrecord and execute the insert

4587213
free	malloc
i was reading this how do malloc and free work

4587231
xtext	graphiti
i d suggest to look into the xtext for a textual editor and graphiti for a graphical editor projects

4587273
width	height
what i am trying to do is animate + and - 20px top and left on some absolutely positioned divs and then add 40px to the width height returning to the original position width height on mouse out

4587286
division	modulo
keep in mind that the modulo is the remainder after integer division

4587286
addition	modulo
the addition adjusts the negative modulo so that it is positive but of course moves the positive values above 7

unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
and preferably work across all unix based systems including linux solaris hp-ux aix

4587413
hide	show
i know a little bit about json soap and http requests but the only way that i know how to do this right now would be to create a page in my project that i could request from each returned result and have that page validate the user from the cookie query sql for the answer and finally return a true or false to the client on whether to hide or show the favorite icon

4587479
sum	floor	multiplying	subtract
alternatively you can see if you can figure out a closed form for the sum in principle sum the numbers from 1 to floor max n multiplying this by n do this for both your ns 3 and 5 but then you ll have to subtract the double-counted numbers but that s essentially subtract the same for n 15

4587504
g++	gcc
you could try setting lang see selecting message language in gcc and g++ for a detailed description of related environment variables

4587529
put	get
you put all these components together and you get class definitions which are harmful to the ocular nerves

4587545
bottle	flask	flask	django
for python the best solution would be a wsgi compatible framework such as flask bottle or django

4587555
cvs	svn
this is usually a directory you most definitely want checked into svn cvs git etc as it will ensure that all users who check that project out into eclipse use the right project specific settings

4587579
width	height
the height and width are used to center the pop-up below the selected row in the grid

4587591

you might have to tweak this a bit but here s some slightly modified from the original code that redirects stdout and stderr for a process

4587610
codeigniter	cakephp
the python way to do web applications has more in common with something like codeigniter or cakephp

4587615
margin	height
just make sure to not place margin and height in the same tag

4587635
multiplying	add
converting to time_t should be easy multiplying by 86400 and add a constant offset then you can use the localtime function

4587748
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
now the modern browsers google-chrome firefox safari opera bahave like so if you open the select element and hover over its items option elements the div box will keep its red background - which means that the hover state is still active

4587789
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome firefox safari and opera the box is red which means that the hover state is still active

4587826
hash	whirlpool	hash	md5	whirlpool	md5
also want to add that you can also store a hash md5 is a function readily available in php you can opt for something like whirlpool as well but you ll have to find a library for that of the data on a separate database and check against it when you access it to ensure that your database hasn t been compromised

4587827
ssl	https
as long as you re not using ssl https the main disadvantage is

4587853
unsigned	short
ul is an unsigned long in the c implementation but you re using an unsigned short

apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
on the first tier simply have the front-end servers apache lighttpd nginx etc connect to fastcgi servers on the second tier

4587904
cpu	affinity
fwiw i concur with the times peter lawrey stated if latency is really critical then you need to think about busy waiting with appropriate cpu affinity dedicate a core to that thread

4587916

lisp	scheme
that said it is a scheme which has fewer batteries included as compared to common lisp

4587918
lisp	scheme
scheme has fewer libraries than common lisp

4587918
lisp	scheme
however gambit scheme has smoother access to c c++ code libraries which far outnumber common lisp s libraries

4587918

explode	implode
similar to php implode explode functions

4588000
put	get
right now once again i can put a name in a1 a name in a2 and get the value in a3

4588044
g++	gcc
gcc has driver programs like gcc g++ and gfortran which call the language compilers named cc1 cc1plus and f951 to generated assembler code then calls the assembler to create object files and then the linker well this last step is a bit more complicated because it involves determining the correct order of object files and libraries which is done by a program named collect2

4588064
nsmatrix	nscell
i would like to track a mouseover event of a nscell in a nsmatrix

4588066
int	chars
the variadic arguments to printf et al are automatically promoted using the default conversions so any short or chars values are promoted to int when passed to the function

4588092
versioning	upgrade
for this last group applications written in an earlier versioning than the latest framework do not get upgrade

4588108
multiplying	addition
in addition you might also want to review your constraints since these can be used by the optimizer to eliminate joins if a table is not used for any output columns when the optimizer can determine there will not be an outer join or cross join which would eliminate or multiplying rows

4588136
stdout	stderr
the first one redirects all stdout and stderr to nul

4588136
stdout	stderr
but the second line redirects the stdout to nul and stderr to the empty stdout

4588152
versioning	upgrade
for the most part i try to keep my teams on the cutting edge since we have learned through experience that maintaining various versioning of frameworks can create a lot of confusion and ultimately requires the same or more costs as just doing a one-time upgrade

4588154
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller is inside of a uitabbarcontroller

4588158
versioning	upgrade
if it were up to me we would upgrade as soon as a new versioning of .net and visual studio is released

4588159
mockito	easymock
i really like mockito but this is the one place where easymock wins out

4588188

int	double
since coordinate ranges are well-defined you can add a few digits of accuracy compared to double by using a 64 bit int representation or even multiple

4588274
subtract	add
edit i have an angle from using math.atan2 which i then want to add or subtract values from

4588274
subtraction	addition
however this addition and subtraction sometimes means the angle is greater that pi or less than -pi and i m looking for a way to get one of these outside angles back into the correct range

4588277
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
however when i abstracted out the header and footer contents into server side includes the layout changes marginally in firefox opera safari but in ie the layout changes makes the page look broken

i am using python s beautifulsoup which i am new to but seems easy to use for easy tasks such as this any better suggestions like lxml or mini-dom

4588412
firefox	safari
works in firefox and safari # form#ajaxform trigger submit

4588435
put	get
it can get a bit tedious specifying each directory but you could put shell and batch scripts in the root of the working directory to help you in this endeavor

4588436
lxml	beautifulsoup
yes you use beautifulsoup or lxml

4588443
post	get
so please can someone post the code how to get the source code from website

i m currently trying to to get my unregistered question merged with this account after which i ll be able to accept eichin s answer and edit my post to include my solution

4588673
bottle	flask
as was suggested in your other question flask and bottle are good contenders

4588735
getter	setter
i m pretty sure the propertychangelistener mechanism only works if you set the properties through the propertyeditor mechanis not through getter and setter

4588770
explode	implode
reference trim explode array_reverse implode

4588793
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
you need to declare the variable that is being accessed from the subclassing as protected or public by default the variable is private so only accesible by the superclass

4588793
superclass	subclassing
btw did you mean change the superclass variable from the subclassing instead of change the subclassing variable from the superclass

4588835
maven	pom.xml
the problem is that we need the jar to be pluggable so that we can replace it or add more jar as more plugins to the project without having to change the original code base including not changing the maven pom.xml file for each new jar plugin so i cannot hard code the dependency on this jar in the pom.xml file

4588916
prepare	execute
you could very well prepare statements with pdo and then get the query string form it and execute them using mysql functions

4588945
subtract	add
if you don t have a 400-year range starting on 1 1 xxxx where you need to manipulate the date slightly different to get the right result instead of adding 1600 to the year add x 400 where x is an integer such that some of the dates will be in the range then add or subtract 400 to the year for those dates that are outside of the range

4588956
put	get
the reason i asked is i have purposely put an invalid file and when i run mvn -pl abc -am -amd option i get successful result and i m confused why maven is not complaning about the errored file

4588966
hide	show
user clicks the div and my script grabs the html of the element and puts it into a var show the form and dumps the html var into a textarea and hide the element

mp3	flv
from asp.net i am using ffmpeg to convert flv files on a flash media server to wavs that i need to mix into a single mp3 file

4589031
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
once you have your connection string defined you will probably use the sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader classes for all interactions with the database

4589046
free	malloc
it s safe to pass a null pointer to free but passing any pointer not allocated by malloc or one of its relatives will cause undefined behaviour

4589051

is there a way to get the raw post content from the curl api so that i can compute an md5 on it before it is posted

4589202
uilabel	uibutton
here is the correct solution to add an uilabel to an uibutton to align the button text to better control the button title

4589245
getter	setter
one potential disadvantage to something like lombok is that with the setter getter missing source tools may not recognize aspects of the resulting object that give it bean qualities since those qualities only manifest in the compiled class

4589258
post	get
the problem is i m not sure how ef are going to handle lookup table how will i get the tags of a post or a collection of the post when i select a tag

4589261
getchar	isspace
...you would convert it to the wide character version by changing c to a wint_t getchar to getwchar eof to weof and isspace to iswspace

4589277

i understand more or less what these 3 mean what llvm and clang are and so on

4589362
verilog	hdl
my instruction set simulators these days are actually written in a hardware design language verilog for example not the hdl i use but it converts to verilog then use something like verilator with a c c++ wrapper

4589362
verilog	hdl	verilog	vhdl
if you happen to be working on a project where this new instruction set is realized in vhdl or verilog i highly recommend a hybrid hdl simulator plus software solution either through vpi if it is a commercial hdl simulator or through other simpler methods if you go with verilator or icarus verilog or ghdl or others

4589376
profiling	benchmarking
my team has done a great deal of profiling and benchmarking in this area

4589384
integer	unsigned
remember that although the width of an unsigned integer type is equal to the amount of value bits the width of a signed integer type is one greater â 6.2.6.2 6

4589384
integer	unsigned
also note that while it is easy to get a compile-time constant for the maximum value of an unsigned integer type imax_bits unsigned type -1 at the time of this writing i don t know any way to do the same thing for a signed integer type without invoking implementation defined behavior

4589399
groupbox	panel
if you remove the height from your groupbox which as far as i understand is what you want to do then it will fill its container unless there s a panel upstream that imposes its own sizing rules

4589399
groupbox	panel
headeredcontentcontrol isn t a panel so it doesn t do any layout of its own and its descendant groupbox doesn t have this same problem

mp3	wav
i am listening to music using javasound for the wav and jlayer for the mp3

4589477
french	persian
utf-8 seems to be fine and certainly will be for german french but you ll need to set the text direction to rtl right-to-left for persian

4589555
clang	llvm
the standard xcode 3.2.5 install contains llvm-1.6 not the latest so i d recommend either running some speed tests to see if there s a noticeable difference between gcc and llvm or compiling clang from source and getting the latest version

4589555
clang	llvm
essentially there s no need for gcc any more llvm + clang is more than enough

4589579
hide	show
rows should only hide or be show when the apply filter button is pressed

4589607
fadein	fadeout
the fadein 200 should be placed inside the callback otherwise it is running before the fadeout completes so there s no fade effect at all

4589614
unsigned	short
the only use i can think of is for passing an unsigned short or unsigned char and using the x conversion specifier

4589637
qmainwindow	qwidget
assuming you have a qwidget or qmainwindow derived class for your gui you could add the following to it

if you implements your own database backend that extends the postgresql backend than you can change it

4589681
subtract	add
edit as suggested by one of answers java.math.bigdecimal is a good example with its add subtract etc methods

4589689
min	max
let s alternate between a min and max property for each level making it every odd row is less than its children and its grandchildren and the inverse for even rows

another way to force user login or to do any other actions on the login screens is switching to the winlogon desktop full name winsta0 winlogon

4589789
move	drag
as you can see if you drag the new cloned objects it move the original not the cloned one

4589804
oncreate	ondestroy
seems the best known solution is to create a public static boolean in whateverservice set to true during oncreate or onstartcommand your choice and false during ondestroy

4589813
post	get
i know there are some other post about this on so but it seems like these apis get outdated pretty quickly

4589862
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
you can only free memory allocated by malloc or calloc or realloc

4589870
temp	tmp
some quick research shows that a clean method would be to redefine the tmp constant by default define tmp app. tmp .ds in app webroot index.php to point the whole temp directory someplace else

4589871
onfocus	onblur
you could probably emulate the desired behavior probably with less issues than detecting tab key by onfocus onblur events of the relevant input elements

4589881

hide	show
you can put the detail popup inside the hover trigger hide it and show it in a css rule targeting a.trigger hover div.detailpopup

4590146
min	max
in your case the meet operator was max or min and since they satisfy the laws for meet operators described above the above code will correctly compute the max or min

4590146
min	max
if you use max instead of min then the top element would be int.min_value since

mvvm	delegatecommand
i use observableobject and messenger from mvvm foundation and delegatecommand and commandreference from mvvm toolkit

4590340
mvvm	delegatecommand
the only real overlap between mvvm foundation and mvvm tookit is that they both have an implementation for icommand mvvm foundation has relaycommand and mvvm tookit has delegatecommand

4590340
mvvm	delegatecommand
why does mvvm light use relaycommand rather than delegatecommand

4590340
mvvm	delegatecommand
here is the code for delegatecommand from the mvvm toolkit

4590384
put	get
and if i should be using the stock textview and handling it in java before the tweet gets put into the view how do i get it linkify the text my only guess is using something like .fromhtml but i m not even sure if this supports the tag

4590402
post	get
once your php script has been properly configured you can use http post or http get to send values from actionscript

4590419
boost	stl
the overall design isn t that bad don t need to rewrite it from scratch however there are many things that i don t like this is mostly because i wrote it in a hurry no comments and magic numbers everywhere ... and because the way i use c++ tools is changed i d say improved in the meanwhile i tend to use much more references smart pointers stl boost ...

4590441
portrait	landscape
the scripting needs to resize uploaded images regardless of whether they are portrait or landscape and regardless of proportions to adhere to these dimensions without getting stretched

4590443
free	realloc
a lot of time i ve seen people write realloc when they mean free

4590443
realloc	malloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc	free	realloc	memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc
if used correctly with growing data in a way that avoids worst-case o n 2 performance for growing an object to size n growing the buffer geometrically instead of linearly when you run out of space realloc has doubtful benefit over simply doing your own new malloc memcpy and free cycle

4590443
realloc	calloc
if you like to zero-fill new objects with calloc it s easy to forget that realloc won t zero-fill the new part

4590443
free	memcpy
but this can actually be harmful additional allocation and memcpy on implementations that strictly segregate chunks by size and in other cases might increase fragmentation by splitting off part of a large free chunk to store a new small object instead of using an existing small free chunk

4590492
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint

width	height
i know the width and height of the screen in window coordinates i know the z-coordinates of the quad in 3d

4590588
width	height
i want to find out the width and height of the quad in 3d coordinates that will fit exactly onto my screen

4590588
width	height
i would like to put a quad along the z-axis at the specified offset z i would like to find out the width and height of the quad that will exactly fill the entire screen

4590588
width	height
though it s similar it is still different because i remembered in that working formula they do make use of screenwidth and screenheight which are the width and height of the screen in window coordinates

4590588
width	height
it s not some gl calls it s just a math formula that can find out the width and height in 3d space that can fill the entire screen if z offset width in window coordinates and height in window coordinates are known

4590600
try-catch	exception-handling
in other word if you know that the initialization of a variable in using may throw a particular exception-handling i wrap it with try-catch

4590901
udp	tcp
the protocol must provide reliability so i m going to simulate something like tcp retransmission over udp

4590901
pthreads	fork
this can be done using pthreads or fork but i believe that s an overkill and consumes a lot of system resources

4590939
rfcomm	l2cap
you need to perform an sdp search to determine the port actually channel number for rfcomm or psm for l2cap of the remote service

4590969
oncreate	setcontentview
what you can do is take all of your initialization code out of your activity s oncreate method including setcontentview and move it to a separate method loadui

4590973
min	max
in addition the logic can do partial ordering of the list - return first k min or max in o klog n time

4591017
width	height
returns only the width height and

4591087
freebsd	linux
this is basically similar to matthew s suggestion of using select but using the most efficient interface which select is not on freebsd linux and macos x actually their page now claims windows support as well but i m not too familiar with that

4591154
allocator	stl
about string and vector and other stl containers you should not worry because they use dynamic allocator internally

4591170
width	height
this will shrink any images down proportionally based on whichever side is longer width or height to the maximum size

4591170
width	height
it will also blow up any images smaller than max which you can stop with a bit of checking on whether or not both width and height are less than their max

4591202
crypt	salt
using characters outside of this range in the salt will cause crypt to return a zero-length string

4591202
hash	salt
returns the hash string or a string that is shorter than 13 characters and is guaranteed to differ from the salt on failure

4591202
hash	salt
but as shown in the reply by dereleased if the input salt string is valid the output consists of the input salt padded out to a fixed length with characters with the 32-character computed hash value appended to it

4591202
hash	salt
this is shown by the last three lines in that reply where we see one for 20 digits no for 21 and when there are 22 base64 digits in the salt the first character of the hash result replaces the 22nd digit of the input salt

4591202
hash	salt
here s a little snippet showing that the 22nd base64 digit contributes just two more bits to the salt actually used in the computation there are only 4 distinct hash produced

4591202
hash	salt
in light of the comments it seems clear there is no bug just incredibly taciturn documentation - since i m not a cryptographer i can t say this with any authority but it seems to me that it s a weakness of the algorithm that a 21-digit salt apparently can produce all possible hash values while a 22-digit salt limits the first digit of the hash to only one of four values

4591217
post	get
one for the get initial display of the screen and one for the post when the user clicks submit button

4591374
width	height
namely get the bounding box circle of the path calculate the predefined rectangular ratio of height width compare that to the same value of bb stretch the bb accordingly e.g if predefined ration is less than 1 the bb is stretched horizontally and vertically otherwise to match the same ratio finally scale the whole thing to the predefined rectangular size

4591374
width	height
the scale factor is now just the minimum between predefined height divided by bb height and predefined width divided by bb width

4591407

width	height
to be explicit but by default it should be the whole height and width of the td provided the td and table have a height

4593612
unsigned	short
i was able to delve fairly deeply into that logic but was stalled on two problems the #ifdefs reference a bunch of tokens that are not actually defined anywhere in perl code that i can find - and i don t know how to find out from within perl what those define s values were and the ultimate default value assuming i m right and those #ifdef s always end up with the default of #define perl_ushort_max unsigned short unsigned 0 the actual limit is gotten by removing 1 bit off that resulting all-ones number - details below

4593612
unsigned	short
which seems to imply that it s set by default to #define perl_ushort_max unsigned short unsigned 0

4593612
unsigned	short
how to extract that value from perl side i have no clue - it s basically a number you get by bitwise negating a short 0 so if unsigned short is 16 bytes then perl_ushort_max will be 16 ones and perl_short_max will be 15 ones 2 15-1 32767

4593613
post	get
there are two common methods used to send data to a php application get and post

4593613

4593992
jpql	hql
hql documentation describes the following syntax it also works in hibernate s jpql

4593996
memcpy	strncpy
you need to understand null-termination before you understand the difference between memcpy and strncpy

4593996
memcpy	strncpy
the difference is that memcpy will copy all n characters you ask for while strncpy will copy up to the first null terminator inclusive or n characters whichever is fewer

vim	textmate	vim	bbedit	textmate	bbedit
other editors like textmate vim bbedit ... work well

4594163
post	get
this would make things considerably easier as the android library has native support for json serialization and making http get requests to restful urls is much simpler than http post requests it s not a huge deal but just less stuff you have to worry about

4594179
width	height
does box 1 1 1 means the length width and height of the cube

4594207
min	max
min expr and expr max

4594260
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i tried ie 8 google-chrome 10.0.612.3 dev firefox 3.6.13 safari 5.0.3 and opera 11

4594323
getter	setter
if your second example had both a getter and a setter they would be functionally equivalent

4594346
implements	extends
yes because you re assuming that getcontent returns something that implements multipart and in this case it does not imapinputstream extends inputstream

4594367
unix	aix
i have two unix machines both running aix 5.3

4594370
range	max
i don t know if this is a standard statistical approach so what i was considering doing was splitting the x-axis data into small range calculating the max for these range and then trying to identify a function to describe these points

4594392
copying	overwrite
since you re just going to overwrite the memory with a new executable why bother copying it

4594422
magento	oscommerce
having used oscommerce magento and prestashop i can say that prestashop is by far the better choice in terms of being easy to install and get running

4594475
maven	pom.xml
i am very interested in how i can find out what are the jars that the dependences in the maven s pom.xml depend on

4594552
int	double
this means you can add an int or a double etc

4594605
int	chars
int and int chars and chars

4594666
put	get
a http text request get put etc arrives at iis - what happens here

4594697
range	min	range	max	min	max
for each variable compute the min max by starting off with the range -inf inf and update it for each inequality

4594708
any	set-intersection
you just need a .any in the lambda to check if the set-intersection contains any elements

4594749
minimum	max
so in your example you d expect the minimum var1 to be 4.5 and the max to be 6

4594749
minimum	max
the max of the gt and gte arrays would be the minimum value with or depending on which array it came from

4594749
minimum	max
the minimum of lt and lte arrays would be the max value

4594756
versioning	upgrade
in order for two setup projects to be considered the same application they should have different product codes identical upgrade codes and different versioning numbers

4594756
installation	upgrade
it s hard to tell from your question if this affects you but there is a serious issue in the way visual studio 2010 setup projects handle upgrade installation

4594766
hash	salt
if you sent the parts and the hash but not the salt anywhere just to be sure

4594766
hash	salt
so send your hash and your codeparts and recreate the hash from the codeparts and salt secretstring and you re set

4594787
public	protected
with regards to your requirements password protected public key authentication + ssh-agent still seems to fit

4594824
min	max
once you zoom out a bit the max value is always a positive integer and the min value is always a negative integer

4594824
min	max
so you need a function that scans the waveform data in chunks and keeps track of the accumulated max and min for that chunk

4594824
min	max
this is slow process so professional audio editors keep a pre-calculated table of min and max values at some fixed zoom ratio

4594824
min	max
its worthwhile to write code that handles all of the channels of the file in an single pass when doing this scanning slowness here will make your whole program feel sluggish it s the disk io that matters here the cpu has no trouble keeping up so straightforward c++ code is fine for building the min max tables but you don t want to go through the file more than once and you want to do it sequentially

4594824
min	max
once you have the min max tables keep them around

4594824
min	max
you want to go back to the disk as little as possible and many of the reasons for wanting to repaint your window will not require you to rescan your min max tables

4594824
min	max
then you draw the waveform by drawing a series of 1 pixel wide vertical lines between the max value and the min value for the time represented by that pixel

4594824
min	max
this should be quite fast if you are drawing from pre built min max tables

4594830
client-side	server-side
what you need is a server-side or a more robust client-side language to access the remote server

4594843
background-image	background-position
i d suggest using background-image on your div instead of a separate tag and background-position right

uiview	subviews
to add subviews within the uiview

4595127
uiview	subviews
i cannot find a way to load subviews within a uiview using a nav controller hence the use of insertsubview

4595127
uiview	subviews
could someone a method to either use nav controllers to load subviews within a uiview or suggest a way to retain data values between the loading and unloading of subviews

4595161
hash	md5
i would then run that through an md5 hash and get.

4595209
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome reject it as an xml document but their source viewers strip out the leading bytes so it looks fine

4595214
caliburn.micro	mef
i use mef in caliburn.micro for export view models classes

4595226
floating-point	integer
neither floating-point nor signed integer values are clamped to the range 0 1 before the current color is updated

4595266

to display it in the format you created it in you will either need to use string.format or you can even use tostring with a pattern

4595418
hash	md5
if you then want to make this a string to pass to your md5 hash

4595454
maven	pom.xml
best way to share portions of a maven pom.xml across unrelated projects

4595458
versioning	upgrade
the renames should be atomic so that the old versioning won t be touched until the upgrade is complete

4595471
django	turbogears	turbogears	pyramid	pylons	pyramid	pylons	turbogears
pylons repoze.bfg and turbogears recently merged into one umbrella the pyramid project which makes that project the front-runner to challenge django s dominance in the python framework world

4595471
pylons	turbogears
unfortunately you can also read that in another way pylons and turbogears admitted that their projects respective approaches weren t working particularly well and shifted focus to helping develop repoze.bfg

4595473
put	get
the only alternative would be to put something in the get parameters of the redirected request

4595511

this will open a dialog pop-up using jquery based on a dropdown completed earlier in the form

4595511
pop-up	dialog
what is the best way to show a dialog pop-up using jquery different depending on a dropdown box on the page

4595541
innodb	myisam
edited to add i realize that you re using innodb rather than myisam but i haven t found anything to contradict this in the innodb case

4595566
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i didnt get chance to check on opera google-chrome and safari will try it later

4595585
primefaces	richfaces
and i recommend you to use richfaces primefaces as lightweight jsf components

4595594
superclass	subclassing
on your superclass that is it will call the method2 on the object you re using which is the subclassing

4595606
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in google-chrome and firefox but in ie the stopstretch event is not firing and i have to click again to actually stop stretching the element

4595646
imagemagick	magick++
i use the imagemagick magick++ library is it possible to do the decoding with this library too

4595654
ant	pom.xml
even if it s in french i put my ant stuff and the play s pom.xml i wrote

4595670
config	ini
it would be easyer to save the routes to a config file or an ini file or database or xml or whatever will make you re life easyer in to long run if you need to edit add delete new routes

4595677
put	get
this seperate database.properties file gets filtered but since it is a test resource located in src main test it doesn t get put into the final artifact

4595686
mouseout	mouseup
when you add an event handler you used for mouseup and for mouseout these two are different

4595707
equals	gethashcode
chances are you haven t overridden gethashcode in a manner consistent with equals

4595707
equals	gethashcode
iirc you ll get a compiler error or at least a warning if you override equals without overriding gethashcode

4595710
jython	jacl
2 writing a wsadmin jacl jython script that could be run each time after the plugin file is regenerated

4595712
equals	gethashcode
you might want to take a look at why is it important to override gethashcode when equals method is overriden in c#

4595715
hide	show
this makes for a max of 2 show hide if they are just wildly moving over things and doesn t have a stutter when you use .stop i wrote the following real fast but you should get the idea

4595723
equals	gethashcode
when you override equals you must override gethashcode as well else dictionary won t work for you

4595749
free	malloc
first of all in the standard there s nothing that guarantees such a thing free ing a non- malloc ed pointer is undefined behavior

4595768

convert the regular expression into a nondeterministic finite automaton nfa and reduce it down to the minimal determinsitic finite automaton dfa

4595843
folder	directory
it s probably the directory from which you started eclipse or maybe the folder in which eclipse is installed

4595880
submit	submission
off the top of my head to prevent the enter button from submission the form don t use a submit button rather use a to call javascript to submit the form

4595884
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png	tiff	bmp	tiff	png
the desired process will take an existing jpg gif png tiff or bmp and do the following

4595915
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome display strange chars but report the page to be utf-8

4595936
free	malloc
the start-up routine initializes the crt creates the crt heap so that malloc free work initializes standard i o streams etc.

4595981
packets	multicast
by default the android wifi stack filters out multicast packets

4596107
int	chars
entities in the xml code are parsed and transformed to a chars int value before they get checked by candisplay

4596117
x86	64bit
for this specific activity you need to create and activity project change it from .net 4 client profile to .net 4 and reference microsoft.build.framework and microsoft.build.utilities.v4.0 from the gac and then microsoft.web.publishing.tasks from programfiles msbuild microsoft visualstudio v10.0 webapplications programfiles x86 if you re on a 64bit system

4596141
put	get
if i take _this_object .tostring inside the try block and put it into dior -i i get this

4596143
required	placeholder
i had this exact same problem and worked out it was because the i was not using html.beginform to create my form resulting in the required input attributes and the placeholder for the validation was not being injected into the page even though i had the inserted on my view page

4596177
submit	submission
assuming that you want to do this because the submit button has a click handler you d like to happen for every form submission you should instead move that code into a separate function and invoke it from a the form s submit event

4596199
listview	gridview
i realized then that the columns and such where not set in the itemtemplate but at the gridview itself and listview of course has no templateselector for itself

4596199
listview	gridview
as i have learned a little bit more about listview and it s view property i m pretty sure i could define the gridview in a staticresource

4596214
daemons	launchd
a daemons or a launchd agent can do that

4596234
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
i d like to have a left arrow in my uinavigationbar as a back uinavigationitem

4596239

4596242
hash	salt
salt is only meaningful for hash

4596247
post	get
make sure that you are retruning stream only to full page request get post issued by browser itself not by some script on the page that expects some particular type of responce

4596265
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works perfectly in ie in firefox it s a gamble on each refresh and in safari google-chrome opera not at all

4596326
thin	unicorn
the headers x-forwarded-for x-forwarded-proto and x-forwarded-port are a way for http reverse proxies such as nginx squid or varnish to communicate to the back-end http application server your rails application running in thin or unicorn who the user actually is and how the user actually connected

4596327
maven	cobertura
the workaround i use works in hudson 1.391 is to configure cobertura in separate maven profile and run it in a hudson job as a post-build step

4596361
hash	salt
the salt prevents dictionary attacks aka rainbow tables where people have gone through and pre-calculated the hash values for several inputs

4596436
width	height
when the textbox is single-line acceptsreturn false i need the width to be 150 and the height to be 22

4596436
width	height
when it is multi-line acceptsreturn true obviously i need the width and height to stretch and take up the entire space

4596436
width	height
when using the multilineintrigger style the textbox will have the height and width set statically regardless of acceptsreturn but when using the singlelineintrigger style the controls will be stretched regardless of acceptsreturn value

4596456
int	boolean
i can t see how you can use formula mapping other than to map strings int and boolean

4596469
try-catch	exception-handling
i would like to know your opinions of what is the correct way of applying the try-catch block to capture exception-handling

4596503
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you should use an uinavigationcontroller in order to pop push uiviewcontroller on your screen

4596530
opera	firefox
this link shows a way to use the domparser interface in webkit opera firefox as well as the activex dom object in ie

4596547
hash	salt
so if you use the same key and iv for all the password encryptions the scenario is the same as when using a hash functions and using salt has the same advantages

4596558
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the form on google-chrome and firefox both gave the same result

4596571
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu it would be apt-get install libboost-system1.45-dev -- but this package does not exists while writing this

4596603
parsley	mate
good choices are swiz parsley or mate

4596603
parsley	mate
however most are moving to swiz or parsley now away from mate and caringorm

4596640
pop-up	dialog
if a user tries to open a document which is already opened in another instance i need to pop-up a dialog to tell them and allow them to switch to the other app instance if required

4596646
internationalization	localization
internationalization and localization is a good place to start

4596718
salt	md5
you could use the macaddress with an md5 function around it with a salt that was only known to the system owners

4596718
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
md5 hash with salt for keeping password in db in c#

4596762
post	get
use a messaging infrastructure like activemq behind your webservice - get the webservice request normally take the request message and post it to an inbound queue in activemq and respond with an acknowledgement synchronously

4596792
uiview	calayer
if the lines need not be updated you should as richard and nacho4d suggested draw all of them in one object by a custom uiview or by a delegate of calayer implementing the drawlayer incontext method

4596812
ubuntu	debian
this will work for ubuntu debian

4596842
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to make a pop-up dialog form with jquery ui but the buttons that are generated do not have any text in them

4596916
ffmpeg	libavformat
i ve recompiled ffmpeg with debugging info and from the backtrace the offending line is libavformat mpegtsenc.c 800

4596916
free	malloc
tried efence but it doesnt seem to work with ffmpeg cause they use their own malloc free routines to get the memory aligned blocks

4596920
free	malloc
you apparently have determined that you re done with an object that you currently have a pointer to and if that object was malloc ed you want to free it

4596920
free	malloc
whenever you hear people complain about properly pairing each malloc with free each new with delete and each with etc. you know that they are making their lives harder than necessary by not following a disciplined memory management regime

4596925
subclass	abstract-class
1 if classa and classb can be treated in a uniform fashion make deriveddata an interface abstract-class then subclass classa and classb from deriveddata jzd already pointed out that

4596929
ienumerable	iqueryable
even though my example was instantiating the var as iqueryable my actual code was doing so as ienumerable

4596929
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable handles where differently apparently such that only the first expression will get executed against the db and all subsequent ones do so in memory unlike iqueryable

4596973
put	get
if you put a clustering index on these you will encounter performance problems due to the high number of page splits you ll encounter as rows get moved around in the index

4597017
vb.net	vb6
there is nothing we could do about this - this was done automatically by the visual studio vb6 -- vb.net converter

4597108
int	chars
chars above 0x7f 127 are probably converting to negative int values

4597160
put	get
one option might be to create a blank .aspx put the user control on the .aspx page and then get that page via jquery and dump the result on the page

4597167
client-side	server-side
links is a lisp-like functional web programming language framework that makes it easy to write a single piece of code that is compiled to server-side code client-side js and html thus making it much easier to write web applications

4597167
client-side	server-side
note that i don t just mean writing server side and client side code in the same language but writing server-side and client-side functions that can call each other and generate the html

4597206
post	get
http provides two methods post and get

4597212
mutators	setter
if you declare a setter aka mutators using attr_writer or attr_accessor or be careful of calling it from inside the class

4597232
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i m sending the data wrapped in a class through an objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

4597254
profiling	debugging	aqtime	madexcept
you could do a lot with jcl debugging madexcept and other profiling and logging tools but codesite and aqtime are the two best for their respective tasks

4597268
ilist	iqueryable
iqueryable also works but i cannot get ilist to work and i have no idea why

4597268
ienumerable	iqueryable
using iqueryable doesn t work nor does ienumerable

4597268
ienumerable	iqueryable
neither iqueryable or ienumerable allow you to add or remove objects

4597268
ilist	icollection
instead an icollection or ilist must be used

4597315
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i haven t found any differences in ie 6â 9 google-chrome safari and firefox

4597340
min	max
apparently the namespace trick does not work because min max are macros and the preprocessor does not look at namespace scope

4597344
hide	show
if you want to be able to show hide based on context you can use toggle

4597367
hide	show
the bar had a button to show hide filters which would animate down from the top

4597415
portrait	landscape
it means the transition from portrait to landscape on an iphone is really smooth with no zoom problems at all.

4597490
stdout	stderr
doesn t output anything to stdout or stderr

4597507
ienumerable	iequalitycomparer
have you tried enumerable.distinct ienumerable iequalitycomparer

4597551
firefox	safari
here is another upload script which uses xhr when possible firefox safari and falls back gracefully to iframe if necessary ie

4597587
stdout	stderr
then use that to redirect both stdout and stderr to it

4597595
x86	64bit
in order to #import the correct version of ado for my 32-bit program i need to know whether i m compiling on a 32-bit windows os meaning the file is in program files or a 64bit os meaning the file is in program files x86

4597643
pop-up	dialog
the only thing which is being displayed is a blank pop-up window which is part of the code dialog and it set to modal and visible

4597653
pull	push
on a sidenote you can see that each of the approaches above either use a push or pull model the tcp one can be implemented in both ways this might affect your final decision of which way to go

4597653
pull	push
push lv signals the c app directly pull c app has to poll a flag or ask lv for the value

4597659
centos	linux
i ve created an amazon ec2 ami running centos linux 5.5 and postgresql 8.4

4597662
pull	push
the other options would be to declare said second developer as a collaborator on your github project he would be able to push directly but that wouldn t change the fact that a pull first is necessary to ensure the push will be straightforward

4597699
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
can anyone tell me why this also available live at renders a symbol before the blockquote in firefox but not google-chrome safari

4597723
google-chrome	safari
why is it that all webkit based browsers safari and google-chrome center this div 10px to much to the left

4597723
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome + safari - padding must no be included to center correctly

4597723
opera	firefox
firefox ie opera - padding must not be included to center correctly

4597743
maven	pom.xml
this command will install this shaded parent without running shade plugin pom.xml -alwaysactiveprofiles option supress shade plugin execution and after that your maven dependent projects will work

4597749
int	chars
if i put ansi in notepad it works int parsing and there are no weird chars as in the picture above but of course my special chars aren t working

4597842
pull	push
you can both push and pull directly to your repo without forking on github and without your collaborator having to constantly submit github pull requests

4597842
pull	push
if you continue to have conflicts push and pull more frequently so the differences are smaller and easier to handle

4597856
int	double
change the types of a through h from int to float or double and change the corresponding conversion specifiers from d to f in the printf and scanf calls

4597862
width	margin
depending on your implementation you could contain the element that needs to be centered in a div that is 100 width and absolutely positioned and then with the current element that you have use the margin 0 auto to center it within the absolutely positioned element

4597894
children	parent
from the link here i have an example of a hiererchical cte a little massage and it will represent the parent rather than children

4597911
gdal	ogr
you can use the python bindings to the gdal ogr toolkit

4597963
hide	removeclass
i ve used a variable to hold a settimeout to delay firing the hide method in your case the removeclass

4597963
mouseover	mouseout
i d also add a mouseover listener to the children that would clear the timeout if it exists which would prevent the mouseout from executing

4597966
labwindows	cvi
i m an employee at national instruments and i wanted to make sure you didn t miss the network variable api that is provided with labwindows cvi the national instruments c development environment

4597966
labwindows	cvi
you can obtain this api by installing labwindows cvi but it is not necessary to use the labwindows cvi environment

4597975
onresume	onpause
the correct pattern is to register in onresume and unregister in onpause

4597986
put	get
by far the easiest way to get this right is to remove the surrogate key from the db generate the edmx and then put this model on your original db

4597992
for-loop	arrays
the way i ve done this is to do a double for-loop like you would for looping through the 2d arrays normally

4598110
jquery	nyromodal
i m using the nyromodal jquery plugin

4598114
hash	md5
anyone experienced enough to crack binaries would likely just disable the call to your verify the md5 against a file code anyway eliminating the need to replace the saved hash altogether

4598151
datamapper	activerecord
finally it may be worth considering the use of datamapper which i believe is more suited to existing brownfield databases than activerecord because it allows you to map everything but of course you will need to learn that api if you don t already know it

4598284
post	get

4599649
dlsym	dlopen
my reasoning for this is that ldd on b does not show c and objdump -x b shows references to dlopen dlclose dlsym

4599649
dlsym	dlopen
normally i d use dlsym for this but i need to pass it the handle returned from dlopen which i don t have since b does not expose this

4599649
dlsym	dlopen
edit after writing this i realized i can probably just do another dlopen on the file in my code and the symbols returned via dlsym on that handle should be the same as received via the original dlopen if i m reading the dlopen man page correctly

4599684
serializable	deserialization
i think the topic you need to understand is serializable and deserialization

4599684
serializable	deserialization
serializable briefly is the act of transforming a data structure or object into another format such as xml json binary that can be then turned back into a data structure or object through deserialization

serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization from that message instance to actual parameters for a call is usually done by an idispatchmessageformatter iclientmessageformatter

4599790
serializable	deserialization
notice that an ioperationinvoker wouldn t help all that much since that presumes you ve already done message serializable deserialization so it s not really all that useful and the rest of the functionality is fairly simple for basic use cases if you want to roll it yourself

4599800
unix	bsd
some of the original unix commands or rewrites of them are available with bsd licenses and you will run into many of those on true unix bsd and on the mac

4599803
int	boolean
zend will automagically turn int floats and boolean into their respective types with json and yaml

4599816

4600735
cvs	svn
perhaps with an eye towards distributed scm tools like git vs svn cvs

4600737
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
probably the easiest way to do it would be to utilize the sqldatasource control to use parameterized stored procedures in leu of the linqdatasource

4602508
accessor	properties
properties set in the usual fashion via the set accessor or via attributes in xaml are the next highest priority but you can see that templates styles and triggers all provide other sources for when there s no local properties value

4602508

4604316
maven	m2e
do i have some clash between the versions of eclipse maven and m2e

4604324
free	realloc
if you were lucky and the same block was used you just continue writing otherwise you are writing to the old place and end up writing in a place you shouldn t because realloc free s the old block internally

4604357
free	realloc
the problem is that after realloc the memory pointed to by d_array is considered free so the code actually writes to the free memory

4604363
folder	directory
the database has the same about of free space as before the mdf file is the same in size and there s no additional files in the directory with the mdf and ldf files so it looks like the data has been moved between tabled but have not been migrated to the blobstorage folder as i expected

4604418

you probably have a copy of the jpa jar s in your war

4604492

without the clearfix the parent div wouldn t have a height due to it s floating children

4604492
children	parent
the clearfix will make the parent consider the floating children

4604505
sorting	filtering
note that this gets very complex if you re doing other things to the table such as client-side sorting filtering etc

4604517

4604721
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 9

4604801
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you can either use a different container than the primitive array anything that implements inotifycollectionchanged liked should do or you have to call raisepropertychanged statuses each time you update the statuses array or as metioned in another answer use one class that implement inotifypropertychanged that contains 4 properties

4604804
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

4604876
caliburn.micro	mef
i use mef in caliburn.micro on creation new screen - wpf window

4604884
coalesce	nvl	coalesce	isnull	isnull	nvl
as for coalescing an expression to a certain default in case it is null there are functions that do this in all major databases ex. coalesce nvl isnull ifnull

4604891
m2e	pom.xml
use the dependency hierachy view in the eclipse m2e pom.xml editor and find your jar on the right hand side...then click on it

4604891
maven	m2e
if it is gone from the project specific maven dependencies library and yet still within the deploy directory then you have the honor of filing a bug with m2e

4604893

i create zipfile using zipoutputstream

4604919
hex	binary
if your assembler compiler output is binary code you need a bin2hex utility to convert the binary code to hex format

4604925
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
what i m asking is would it be worth it to md5 each element in a char array obtained from a password field by which you add a salt to each char element to be hash with md5 upon completing that add all the hash from each character and then add a separate salt to that and md5 it again

4604930
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m not that concerned with a solution that works in ie--just one that works in safari google-chrome firefox

4604968
hash	md5
if you want to be as secure as possible you should use some different hash algorithm md5 is known to have some collision attacks

4604975
getter	setter
the best way is to use getter and setter - for example

4604976
hash	salt
adding a salt to each letter would achieve nothing more than adding the same salt to the whole string and could possibly reduce the entropy of the hash rather than increasing it

4604978
implements	extends
i ask this because i have like 10 of them that implements the same interface but they also have the same implementation for some methods so i would like to reuse the code by placing all the same implementations in middle object that extends enum and it is also the superclass of all the others i need

4604993
hash	salt
a better hash algorithm and a good salt would be a good start

4605003

this in brief states that every instance of a subclassing should be acceptable whenever an instance of a superclass is expected

4605019
superclass	subclassing
and generally a proper subclassing is a specialization of its superclass

4605019
superclass	subclassing
in other words the set of valid subclassing instances is should be always a subset of the superclass instance set

4605033
width	height
i would think since the canvas uses data points and not screen coordinates that i should still be able to use my salary to determine the height of the background element but still use the chart width to make sure the rectangle goes all the way cross screen

4605034
put	get
to get a helpful answer to your question you might want to put some more effort into phrasing it

4605093
implements	extends

4605302
console.readline	console.writeline
console.writeline console.readline and console.readkey are your friends

4605433
for-loop	loops
you could use a different loops for-loop

4605440
put	get
i could put the field into a base class and use the crtp to create a new instance per type and then the specialization wouldn t get in the way but why doesn t this direct field initialisation work

min	max
if you need to pull a particular name or surname that won t be pulled by min max or any of postgresql s aggregate functions then you ll want to filter your results rather than selecting everything from the table

4605992
versioning	upgrade
if any bugs are identified and the vendor wants to deliver a new versioning you should ideally roll back the cloned environment back to when you took the snapshot and have them perform the upgrade scenario again

4606026
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your php versioning - 5.3.5 and 5.2.17 once released probably today include the fix

4606027
opera	firefox
this code is more robust and if firefox or opera supports one of the api s you don t have to check for their browsers anyway

4606042
wan	lan
it even has ethernet ports lan wan which are fairly easy to use

4606045
put	get

the second ellipse s height works using a staticresource but width doesn t work using the templatebinding approach

4606286
min	max
given the large change and the min and max values of the scrollbar how does .net use these to calculate how much it should scroll when you click on this area

4606306
ubuntu	linux
some more info we re compiling on linux we use ubuntu lucid maverick on intel x86-64 machines

4606311
width	height
plus with a separate rooms table you will be able to add additional room fields that make sense later like width height color floor level etc. which would all be very hard if the data were just globbed into a single field

4606364
pop-up	dialog
i have a jquery dialogue that pop-up another jquery dialog

while it s not the same effect the fadein and fadeout jquery methods work properly on tables

4606422
hide	show

i am writing a fastcgi application using the fastcgi development kit on linux ubuntu using apache 2.2 + mod_fcgid

4606457
freebsd	linux
this won t work on anything but linux 2.6.20 onwards but at least if you re on freebsd instead it s described in a man page

4606459
converter	multibinding
sounds like you re looking for a multibinding with a converter capable of evaluating an expression

4606503
google-chrome	firefox
try testing this on 2 different browsers firefox and google-chrome as they will not share the session as the session id is normally stored in a cookie

4606512
stateless	stateful
in java the difference between stateful stateless web frameworks is usually described as the difference between action-based and component-based frameworks

4606542
hash	salt
if the hash was salt this will become troublesome ofcourse

4606571
hash	md5
i wrote an app a few years back that brute-forces md5 hash against wordlists and previously-cracked md5 hash it finds via search engines see if it comes up with anything for you

4606597
cvs	svn
take for example any version control system svn cvs git etc.

4606624
draggable	droppable
you could give each of your draggable and droppable a reference to their parent model and access the property this way it s up to you

4606653
accelerometer	gyroscope
the emulator has accelerometer and gyroscope enabled in config.ini but it uses api 8 android 2.2

4606653
accelerometer	gyroscope
when i list the available sensors i only get the accelerometer no gyroscope or compass

4606668
uncaughtexceptionhandler	runnable
is it safe to call pool.execute runnable from within the uncaughtexceptionhandler set on the dying thread

4606728
width	height
my problem is canvas is too much big i would like automatic resize stretch canvas on window height width

4606728
width	height
so set width and height is not solution because this canvas consist other canvas

4606733
junit	testng
to test a rest service you can try rest assured which makes it very simple to test rest services and validating the response in java using junit or testng

4606806

converter	multibinding
the code worked just fine when i wasn t using a multibinding and converter but i need the multibinding so i can pass some extra information to the command

4606815
implements	extends
why is extends jframe implements actionlistener a bad design decision

4606823
width	height
how about removing specified width and height

4606847
google-chrome	firefox
when running the following block of code firefox and google-chrome output while ie7 8 output

4606865
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
in this case it doesn t really matter what exception type you use because you should never see it in production anyway - argumentexception if the problem was with name or invalidoperationexception if the problem was with the state of the object defining mymethod would be fine choices in that situation but the specific exception type shouldn t be documented or else it becomes part of the api

4606914
portrait	landscape
i have this code set to make the clockview appear when the phone is rotated to landscape and then to make it go back to the mainview when it s returned to portrait

4606914
portrait	landscape
but when it does go back to portrait the portrait view is in landscape mode

4606918
submit	submission
i would suggest not allowing a submit at all and submission it via ajax and not using a blank action attribute

4606960
mouseup	mousedown
instead the problem is that if the element is changed between mousedown and mouseup the click does not fire

4606960
mouseup	mousedown
the click event will occur after the mousedown and mouseup events

4606960
mouseup	mousedown
ie8 fires mousedown for first node mouseup for updated node but does in fact fire click using the updated node as the event source

4606990
min	max
none of the elements have their max occurs or min occurs value set

4607007
daemon	cron
i need to invoke my shell script every two days i read about cron daemon that it can help me invoking scripts periodically so can you give an example how can i make my script able to be invoked by cron daemon

4607016
multiplying	add
you can copy one into 1 or 2 channels of the other you can use logical operations like and or or xor you can use arithmetic operations like add multiplying and multiplyscale these operations will saturate values larger than 255

4607027
typedef	struct
typedef struct queue list

4607034
integer	unsigned
casting an ns u integer to an unsigned int runs the risk of truncating it on some architectures x86_64 for instance

4607036
implements	extends
elimination of the need to extends a base class implements an interface

4607037
strcpy	strcmp	strcpy	strtok	strtok	strcmp
forgot to check for null on strtok it will return null when done and you cannot use that null on strcpy strcmp etc

4607037
strcpy	strtok
note that you do a strcpy right after the strtok you should check for null before doing that using p as a source

4607059
salt	md5
how about an autonumber field and having a 2nd field that s an md5 of the id + a secret salt

4607080
strncmp	strcmp
if you insist on using c strings i d suggest using strncmp instead of strcmp

4607092
google-chrome	firefox
support for the scoped feature was added to firefox in version 21 and added in google-chrome behind a flag in version 20

4607121
daemon	cron
note it s actually a bit ambiguous if your cron daemon will run that every two days on even days 2 4 6.. or odd days 1 3 5.. and it may switch these depending on how many days are in the current month

4607160
range	max
will flag -1 if a number can t be chosen within the max range and not in the disqualifying list

4607168
width	height
as some height width info is farther out in the header

4607168
width	height
return array width width height height

4607168
width	height
return array width width height height

4607168
width	height
return array width width height height

4607180
min	max
progressbar wants you to enter min value starting point and max value ending point and wants how much step will passed at performstep function

4607182
hide	show
you can ideally program it to show hide elements based on the current section and also toggle certain classes based on the section

4607210
libxml2	tinyxml
you could use libxml2 included in iphone sdk touchxml tinyxml or tbxml

4607240
suppressfinalize	finalizer
if there s no finalizer why would you need to call suppressfinalize

4607285
width	height
let s say the camera is at the origin and z units away from the box the screen is one unit away from the camera and the box was depth d width 2w and height 2h

4607285
width	height
therefore the width of the outer box on the screen is 2w z the width of the inner box 2w z+d and analogously for the height

4607287
google-chrome	firefox
or can we control the client browsers ie firefox google-chrome etc to disable the view source option in the tasks menu when web site a loaded in them

4607310
lisp	scheme
i imagine scheme and perhaps lisp could be made more user friendly by using a different syntax

4607324
nullreferenceexception	argumentexception
throw argumentexception if you have reason to think that the caller might have screwed up nullreferenceexception if you think that the getobject author might have a bug in his code

4607327
google-chrome	firefox
users are not logging into this site and users are using anything from ie to firefox to google-chrome

4607342
disk	ram
this is the basis for virtual memory from the point of view the process has some ram but the kernel has moved it to the hard disk in swap space

4607353
public	protected
public methods are intended to be used by other objects while protected private methods are to be hidden from the outside

4607353
public	protected
addendum correction for controllers you should mark the helper methods as protected private and only the actions themselves should be public

4607353
public	protected
the framework will never route any incoming http calls to actions methods that are not public so your helper methods should be protected in that way

4607360
google-chrome	safari
the resource tracking tools in safari and google-chrome are great for visualizing load times of various page components but the view is totally obscured when keep-alive pings take place periodically in my case chartbeat sends a ping every 15 seconds so all the other load times are compressed into a tiny unhelpful section while the chartbeat pings are stretched out across the view

4607403
accessor	properties
declared properties fundamentally take the place of accessor method declarations

4607403
accessor	properties
when you synthesize a properties the compiler only creates any absent accessor methods

4607457
valgrind	callgrind
valgrind includes the callgrind tool that can profile your code

4607460
content-disposition	content-type	content-disposition	content-length	content-length	content-type
that said the text csv content-type header you were using is correct although you may also want to output the content-length and content-disposition headers

4607474
mouse	keyboard
i have an alternate language installed but it can only be switched via the mouse i have disabled the keyboard shortcuts

4607509
int	double	int	chars
i was able to create safearrays with arrays with fixed size elements like double int chars arrays and it works fine using something like this

4607511
jlabel	jprogressbar
i have a progress dialog window which contains 3 jcomponents jlabel jprogressbar jbutton which is used as default dialog window in different parts of the application from different threads

4607533
rss	feed
this is the kind of problem rss or atom feed were designed for so look for a link for an rss feed if there is one

4607533
rss	feed
if you re lucky they ll provide many different rss feed for different aspects of the site the way stackoverflow does for questions for instance

4607550
rss	feed
sounds to me like you re referring to rss or atom feed

4607562
dictionary	map
i like to use a datatemplate defined in a resource dictionary within app.xaml or elsewhere to map a viewmodel to a view like this

4607565
children	parent
but then selects from those ctes in parent ctes using children ctes doesn t use nolock in presumption that it is already nolock d

4607574
onresume	onpause
your onstart method just enables the timer while the onstop method disables it onpause and onresume can do likewise if you want

4607579
gif	png
unfortuantely actionscript doesn t support gif encoding so when dealing with a gif with transparency we have to png encode it in actionscript before posting it to php

4607583
width	height
notice they are coping a buffer of width height 3

4607609
google-chrome	firefox
i am using the latest syntaxhighlighter within my app and for some reason the toolbars do not show in ie firefox or google-chrome

4607610
post	get
you will pass all the information of your customer service and invoice across pages via form post or get

4607625
int	chars
and not as int with lookup table or mapped string constants or chars or anything like that

4607654
post	get
any other variables passed would be available via the get request or post

4607654
post	get

dataformats listed at this particular sites are csv georss html json kml opml opensearch php rdf rss text xml xspf yaml csv georss

4607805
mouse	keyboard
i still want to be able to use the mouse wheel to scroll as well as use the keyboard shortcuts that i have written

4607806
public	protected
it would be impossible to prevent protected methods from being public if the derived class wanted it so as you could just write a minor wrapper and done

4607835
getter	setter
the proxy derives from the object under test and doesn t hide or override any behavior but it does provide internally-visible getter setter and or methods that make calls to non-public members of the object under test allowing me to tell the object to perform certain actions of which i can then view the results without requiring the test to also depend on proper integration within the object or making the method or some other member of interest public in production code just for testing purposes

4607856
post	get
so how do i get the post back to work

4607897
folder	directory
however if you are planning to deploy assemblies a b c separately from assemblies d e f for one reason or another keeping the output directory separate will ensure that the correct assemnbly and only its dependencies are in the output folder

4607900
uiview	subviews
i have many views in my nib and most of them contain subviews uiview s uilabel s etc.

4607922
implements	extends
so soon i decided to extends my main object class to implements a parcelable one as shown below

4607929
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this looks fine in google-chrome firefox safari

4607931
firefox	safari
if you add a negative margin to the button span it will move half the distance in firefox than it does in safari

4607997
versioning	upgrade
the previous stable versioning of nhibernate was 2.1.2 and as far as i can tell there hasn t yet been a 2.2 although in the future there might yet be one -- as i understand it nh 3 targets .net 3.5 and i d imagine there are a lot of people who can t upgrade yet

4608039
swt	swing
has anyone embedded a swing video feed in an swt view

4608039
swt	swing
has anyone embedded a swing component in an swt view and specified the size of the swing component

4608058
paradox	bde
probably written using some borland tools i guess it uses bde and paradox as its database

4608059
mp3	speex
it would likely be far easier to convert speex to mp3 server-side

4608073
put	get
1 the simplest way to get custom class data in intent is get the data to primitive types then put this data by putstring or whatever data type then add a constructor to corresponding sent data to activity from set in custom object in activity

4608105
width	height
edit make sure you set the height and width of the div s to match your image size

4608126
rss	feed
i have added an rss feed on a zen-cart store php 5.2 apache2

4608126
rss	feed
is there any way of better dealing with large rss feed

4608141
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

4608158
public	protected
there are 3 modifiers private protected default and public

4608173
rss	feed
you could set a cron to write the rss feed to the filesystem every 5 10 ..

4608190
decoder	encoder
i m looking for an aac encoder decoder library that works on linux and windows for a c c++ app

4608291
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
i guess it s a good idea to always use private but i ve never bothered in the past because i generally use properties accessor for almost all ivar access except in init and dealloc methods

4608293
put	get
my web application will need to be able to tell my daemon to do list get put delete move and rename files to a given ftp server for a given user account

4608362
post	get
so the best recommendation one could get you if you append your question with the current jqgrid definition define which is the best id for the data row and post the test xml data

4608375
put	get
just put a hack together to get the

4608451
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
with regards to the second part of your question how to vary the width of the line depending on the speed of writing you should be able to achieve this by taking advantage of uitouch s timestamp property in your touchesbegan withevent and touchesmoved withevent method

4608472
public	protected
and i found in my current workspace intellisense can only show the public methods it cannot show me the protected methods but it can compile and the app runs well

4608472
public	protected
if i create a new workspace it s the same that the intellisense can only show me the public methods not protected methods

4608527
move	drag
whenever the drag helper move sortable runs through its list of elements and uses this method to determine whether the drag helper has passed over one

4608557
implements	extends
i have a base class that extends listactivity that i want to use to implements a lot of common code used on multiple different activity implementations

4608633
mouse	keyboard
three models - keyboard mouse monitor

4608635
min	max
for example if max is set to 100 and the user slides min to 150 you can set max at 150 as well

4608638
nscoding	nscopying
it s a nice sanity check since it will error if you try to do it outside the class -- pretty much the only place to use direct structure access is when implementing nscoding or nscopying and those will still work -- but it doesn t really buy you much

4608642
post	get
you ll need to post the error messages you get if it doesn t work out or consult someone with solid dotnetnuke experience

4608694
post	get
this is a valid pattern also known as gpg get post get pattern

4608717
awt	swing
i would also just drop the desktop application stuff awt swing

4608721
hash	hmac
if you want integrity not possible to tamper with the content of the cookie you should use a keyed hash hmac for example

4608730
awt	swing
i m able to use fullscreen exclusive mode with normal swing components but for some reason when i use awt components i only see a black screen in fullscreen mode

4608730
switching	screens
upon switching back into the application i get a black screens again

4608733
client-side	server-side
to be clear my goal is to register a click on a button server-side not just client-side

4608736
sum	floor	ceil	floor
for a fixed value of m the numbers to choose are ceil n-m m+1 and floor n-m m+1 in whatever combination makes the sum work out

4608741
daemon	cron
another way to go about this might be to run your script as a daemon and instead of having cron run it every five minutes put your logic in a loop

4608771
put	get
i won t go into details but you really want to put your extensions into an initializer or a gem since they get reloaded between requests in dev mode

4608771
put	get
if you put the code into a plugin it won t get reloaded and you ll get very mysterious errors such as a copy of xxx has been removed from the module tree but is still active

4608790
qgraphicsview	qgraphicswidget
i have an application that makes extensive use of the graphicsview architecture in qt4 and i would like to start automated testing of the ui components but i cannot find any resources related to what i should be testing or how to test qgraphicsview qgraphicswidget based classes

4608863
ubuntu	linux
my system is linux ubuntu 10.10

4608864
uibutton	uinavigationitem
but you don t specify a uibutton for the leftbarbuttonitem property of the returned uinavigationitem

4608885
jobs	cron
i agree with what other people have said above basically cron always runs the job at the specified time there is a tool called at which lets you run jobs in the future so you could batch a job for 5 minutes and then at runtime decide when do i need to run again and submit a job to at for whatever time you need it to run again be it 5 minutes 10 minutes or an hour

4608889
children	parent
unfortunately the order of the db elements is not guaranteed but what i d like to do is have the information displayed sort of like in windows explorer with the children directly underneath the parent

4608913
google-chrome	firefox
my code works perfectly in google-chrome and ie7 but fails in firefox 3 and presumably firefox 2 but for different reasons - notably the lack of a paste event

4608913
put	get
set a timeout to get the html from the new div clean it and put it into the old selection which i grabbed in step 1

4609003
rsa	3des
i would take 2 or 3 of the fields - memberid datecreated and perhaps email and concatenate them together with a random secret key and use an encryption algorithm like rsa or 3des to encrypt the whole string and pass it as a parameter in the link you include in the activation email

4609037
jlist	jtable
try using a jlist or jtable that contains items in your queue

4609069

4609137
pop-up	dialog
below i have extended the command to pop-up a dialog for the commit message and to give a nice warning if no git repository was found

4609142
int	chars
my guess would be that since you didn t enclose it in quotes and the column was a chars varchar column mysql tried to do an implicit conversion of the varchar column to an int

4609176
profiling	benchmarking
they seem like the sort of thing which would be more useful to a webgl browser implementer with a profiling than to someone trying to choose between webgl implementations platforms to decide which is likely to run apps best c.f the history of opengl benchmarking where all sorts of nonsense used to be claimed for synthetic polygon-per-second numbers until specviewperf came along and imposed some realistic real-world test cases

4609179
post	get
i get an access token and try to post to the page s wall

4609182
boost	stl
the point that bugs me the most is that not only those simple a and b structs are binary compatible but about any container is if you use it with types you can expect to be binary compatible i ran some tests with gcc 4.5 and clang 2.8 on both custom containers and stl boost ones

4609187
int	chars
i want to know if there is some kind of typeof operator to see if you re dealing with int float long chars unsigned chars long long or whatever

4609231
objectcontext	transactionscope
using transactionscope in your controller service is a good start since the objectcontext respects it

4609241
hide	show
in the function where you are implementing the hide and show template put

4609258
subtract	add	onfocus	onblur
it d probably be cleaner to add and subtract a class with the onblur and onfocus

4609284
ndepend	fxcop
i m thinking of things like stylecop fxcop and ndepend all of which allow the creation of custom rules with varying amounts of pain

4609302
fadein	hide
#prod_div hide .html data fadein

4609319
pull	push
so pull from the client rather than push from the master

4609337
multiplying	multiplication
when performing compile-time multiplication you should probably multiplying 32-bit numbers having 64-bit results

4609351
pop-up	dialog
which works fine but if i run the same compiled app on a different computer where google chrome is renamed chrome i get a pop-up dialog asking where google chrome is

i m attempting to parse an rss feed to display images only

4609380
post	get
i found this old simplepie forum post but was unable to get the code working

4609426
ilist	iqueryable
where repository returns iqueryable and services returns ilist

4609426
ilist	iqueryable
and then get the ria services domain service methods to always return ilist or domain class and mark all these methods as invoke so that we don t need to return iqueryable

4609475
hide	show
what i need to do is when a user checks unchecks the permission_check input then it should show hide the radio_option elements for that list item

4609550
fadein	fadeout
i m not sure if i got your fadein fadeout exactly the same but you see where to change it

4609607
google-chrome	firefox
i am not worried about this working on ie 6 but currently am on my mac and have only tried firefox and google-chrome at this point

4609617
rss	feed
rss feed - we use rss feed a lot at my company to integrate existing site s data with our apps

4609617
rss	feed

cvs2svn -s repo svn my favorite project src repo cvs my favorite project src

4609959
cvs	svn
the basic idea is to just use svn or git instead of cvs -

realloc	malloc
by examining the output of the above code you should be able to determine when realloc actually does return a different pointer than the one it was passed my guess is to make space for the last integer read in in your example because malloc probably rounded up to 16 bytes for the first allocation -- also because realloc didn t abort probably since it was never passed the invalid pointer

if this is not your case then you should use the xpath expression to select the parent elc and after that use simple dom method to get the children

if you really can t refactor the erroneous business code in your jsp s into fullworthy servlet business classes there where they belongs then your best bet is to increase the http response buffer size in the server config and pray that nowhere a fflush is been invoked before the exception occurs in the jsp and you don t get outofmemoryerror failures when it gets busy on your webapp

4621512
qlocalsocket	qtcpsocket	qtcpsocket	qiodevice
in theory this ought to work because both qlocalsocket and qtcpsocket inherit qiodevice

4621512
qlocalsocket	qtcpsocket
i suppose there is the nuclear option of getting the constructor to take a void pointer plus an extra variable to tell it what it s being sent so it can then recast the void pointer to either a qlocalsocket or qtcpsocket but i feel uncomfortable resorting to reinterpret_cast on what looks like it ought to be a straightforward bit of c++ polymorphism

4621550
versioning	upgrade
instead people now have to write code supporting both versioning of this function or forcing upgrade

4621581
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this code works well under ie firefox google-chrome opera of course

4621634
integer	fractions
the bitwise or operator only operates on integer types so the fractions component is silently stripped off the number

4621675
textview	imageview
i have a custom listview made up of an imageview and a textview

4621695
width	height
sounds like ie is computing the width and height attributes for #bigimage when it is created and then not updating them when the src is changed

4621695
width	height
if you do then set the width and height attributes explicitly when you change the src

4621714
integer	unsigned
which should then promote its argument of whatever integer type to unsigned long long standards pedants pick me up on this but i assume it would and run the code as given which gives the same result as it would in your templated case

4621728
boost	allocator
so i decided to roll my own thread specific memory allocator based on boost pool and boost threadspecificptr

4621728
allocator	stl
i had what sounded like a very similar problem with std multiset allocator and wrote the program you can see here parallel reads from stl containers

4621729
zoo	xts
i think that for xts timeseries na.locf.xts is invoked which doesn t document maxgap and not na.locf which is from zoo

4621729
zoo	xts
should i convert the xts ts to a zoo ts then call na.locf with maxgap and the convert back to xts

4621745
post	get
that query is examining the database catalogue to see if the primary key of the post table is attached to a sequence or not rather than trying to get a value from a sequence

jar	war
this usually means that the class file has a different package name than the directory structure in the jar war

4621774
lisp	scheme
note i m not trying to write a lisp scheme parser this is just an easy example of nested parentheses.

4621828
children	parent
-- basically blocks have children which are wrapped within the parent block

4621828
children	parent
as you can see at the bottom i am checking if parent has children and if it does i call a completely seperate function to output the child blocks outputchildchildblocks -- so instead i would like to have the function recognize the depth of the current location and when it gets to the if statement at bottom if it does have children run itself again add a counter for each level and then instead of

4621830
profiling	debugging
xdebug works great for tracing profiling and debugging

google-chrome	firefox
update as hradac showed in comment below on newer browsers with faster js engines google-chrome firefox string concatecation is faster than array joins - proof

4621996
svg	vml
ext js is focused on desktop web apps that can work all the way back to ie6 so there s not much room to be html5 y although where we can we are our new charting stuff uses canvas svg or vml depending on the browser it finds itself on

google-chrome	firefox
as the respected members said above also if you have a plugin such as firebug on firefox or in your google-chrome browser right click the blockquote and choose inspect element

4622243
hide	show
then you will see all the rules i.e effects applied to that element and you can show hide them to see their effect on the element which will give you a better understanding of what the rules are doing to your element

4622272
accessor	properties
but i used a homegrown object framework that uses onmissingmethod for accessor and cfproperty with lots of custom metadata to define properties of the objects

4622272
getter	setter
the cfcs all extend a base model which has validate serialize deserialize and virtual getter setter methods

4622272
put	get
then i have a persistence layer that knows how to get and put objects from into the datastore

4622272
getter	setter
you just need a base object which knows how to serialize and deserialize models and you getter setter stuff

4622272
puts	gets
write a simple persistence layer that gets and puts documents to from the datastore

4622297
qicon	qimage

if a lot of your emails get reported as spam then your emails will get put in spam folders

4623381

the problem isn t that the loop is shadowing the class field the named is already used by the parameter

4623387
config	ini
see the ini file config docs

4623389
inline-functions	inlining
then you use the preprocessor to conditionally include the implementation as part of the header when you want inline-functions so the implementation will be available to all modules but don t include it if you re not inlining so you follow the one definition rule in that case

4623511
superclass	subclassing
but anyway a constructor of a subclassing should always invoke a constructor of the superclass super in your case or super my viewframe for a titled frame

i already added rus folder in directory application languages

4623761

but the problem is still the if i need to use different layout for both landscape and portrait mode each have a listview with progress bar in each row

4624045
qtreewidget	qtreeview
since qtreewidget inherits from qtreeview you can use

tex	mathjax
i m trying to add tex support to my application and i would like to use mathjax to render mathematics formulas client side since i gave up the

4624172
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest is slightly easier to grasp but phpunit is the best in my opinion at least so if you want to start learning and using a framework start with the one you re going to use when you ll be a master in tdd

4624172
phpunit	simpletest
don t look at if it s easier or harder now because if you start with simpletest for example then you start using zend framework because your boss tells you so you ll have to use phpunit with zf

4624173
hide	show
for starters how would i make it so i can hide it once its up and then show it again via double clicking the bottom of the app

4624178
post	get
is the post and get data a data source and should that kind of data be handled by the model or should it be by the controller

4624198
perforce	svn
so think hard if you really need to branch or if you just do with and live with svn or perforce

4624203
post	get
the reason its not working is because performs a http get and does not post your form

4624243
put	get
when you put the url default.aspx geteventos in your browser what do you get

4624369
post	get
in my approach the controller just makes sure the data sent is using the right method post get and complete via setting defaults or validating forms before sending them to the model

in high performance mysql from o reilly i ve read that myisam could be a good alternative to innodb for logging situations

4624426
innodb	myisam
could myisam really be a good choice to innodb which we are currently using

4624451
post	get
of course there s a lot more to it you can make use of request method get or post in the requestmapping you can define a method annotated with initbinder etc

4624452
children	parent
this is what im after the idea of a parent solution which has many children models that will always be loaded together then if one fails it all fails so the feedback on the breaking tests are given before its too late

4624452
maven	pom.xml
my other problem is also different developers use different ides i.e intellij eclipse netbeans so if this sort of project structure is possible using a maven style pom.xml approach then i need it so different ides should recognise this without manual steps of having to include other modules etc.

4624573
post	get
remember that post implies potential data changes that get request should nt imply

4624577
pylons	pyramid
i d recommend pylons pyramid because it s in python and because i agree with the design decisions and thirdly because you can run it on google app engine as well as on other servers

4624687
google-chrome	firefox
remove this if your browser is not firefox or google-chrome or it will crash

i run a program which looks at the listings a decides whether to hide them from being show on the site

4624717
apache	nginx
you often set that website behind apache or nginx used as a proxy but it doesn t call an external progam in any reasonable sense it forwards the http request to the proxied server

4624717
apache	nginx
this is mostly done so you can have multiple sites on the same server and also so you can have apache nginx protect you against incorrect requests

4624717
apache	nginx
most of them are platform language dependent and the only one that is platform independent is really to make a complete webserver and then use apache nginx as a proxy in front in which case the apache nginx strictly isn t necessary any more

4624733
getter	setter
browsers are not obliged to provide a prototype for host objects and neither are they obliged to allow you to override getter and setter for host object properties or respect any attempts to override default behaviour

4624762
google-chrome	safari
but safari and google-chrome complain that the file input is blank

4624762
google-chrome	safari
but why is safari and google-chrome acting differently

4624762
google-chrome	safari
perhaps safari and google-chrome finds it as illegal syntax to rewrite the file input after the form element is loaded

4624775
post	get
how do i get the submit to post to my login action in my account controller

4624925
tinyint	boolean
if you do use a bit boolean tinyint field for this

4624958
apache	nginx

serializable	deserialization
i had been trying to do an object serialiation deserialization program.when i am giving the file name directly in the fileinputstream my program runs quite finely and i was able to deserialise the object successsfully.but when i tried to use filedialog the serializable program runs finely but the deserialization cannot be done

the controller is instantiated but the method isn t found if we just post the file without the additional params it works fine and we can also get it to work with the file and the someint param but nothing else

4625545
post	get
i assume you have an action for this form and either a post or get method

4625545
post	get
from the two inputs i can see your values should appear in the _post variable as _post textfield222 and _post textfield2222 for the post method and _get textfield222 and _get textfield2222 if the form is using the get method

4625557
ienumerable	iqueryable
and it should work the same way for iqueryable and ienumerable

4625587
des	aes
the problem is that you are encrypting in c# with aes also known as rjindael but trying to decrypt in java with des

i ve made a two small examples on jsfiddle the first one using sortable and the second using draggable droppable

4625589
calloc	malloc
alternatively you could use calloc instead of malloc

4625619
maven	m2e
you can configure this in project properties build path order and export or use maven and m2e

4625670
hide	show
to show a div on textbox click i would use the jquery show and hide methods

4625670
hide	show
create your content in asp.net and use 1 jquery function to hide the div when the page loads on browser not server and another to show them

4625740
width	height
updatedisplaylist will give you the height and width of the container which you can use to recalculate size and position of the rectangles

4625750
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you cast an iqueryable to an ienumerable and then call one of the extension methods where ... in your question then the one on enumerable version will be called not the queryable one

4625765
inherited	properties
note no versions of internet explorer including ie8 support the properties values inherited or collapse

while and until and admittedly if look at the exit code of the test not at any text that may or may not be generated on stdout or stderr

4625809
post	get
the url for both is meetings but when i get meetings i am routed to the def index action and when i post meetings i am routed to the def create action

4625821
x86	64bit
and on top of that 64bit sp1 needs to be installed like this install x86 file and then install x64 file on 64bit machine

4625830
typedef	typename
however i d suggest that you make moopack a typedef or nested class called pack inside moo itself in which case you can easily access it by typename x pack inside the template

4625887
jboss	glassfish
note the above code is jboss specific but same can be achieved for glassfish

4625892
longlistselector	silverlight
it looks to me like your trying to display grouped data in a single control from a single nested data source in which case you should consider using the longlistselector control from the silverlight toolkit for wp7

4625892
textblock	itemscontrol
for the itemscontrol the datacontext will be an individual categoryitem so you can add a textblock header that binds to the name property if necessary

4625909
phpunit	simpletest
i m really really baffled that simpletest still is considered an alternative to phpunit

4625909
phpunit	simpletest
subjective phpunit provides much nicer code coverage reports than simpletest

4625954
client-side	server-side
however i m trying to figure out a way whether server-side php or client-side jquery to do this without changing anything in the database

4625992
put	get
on win 7 with uac on writes fail i can do a write followed by a read and not get the value i just put in there

4626006
post	get
you can make sure it is executed in the page_load regardless of get or post

4626024
post	get
i believe that working with post and get data falls under the responsibilities of the controller

4626046
firefox	safari
this however does not seem to work in i.e. safari and firefox when the image is hosted on my local machine

4626047
equals	compareto
treeset normally uses the compareto method of the elements not the hashcode or equals

4626047
equals	compareto
a compareto method or a comparator.compare method must implement an order which may be a bit trickier than a simple hashcode -and- equals but this usually not hard either

4626047
int	boolean
conceptually there could be a hash equivalent of comparator for hashset an interface hasherandequalizer with int hashcode object obj and boolean equals object obj1 object obj2 methods

4626109
datamapper	activerecord
two popular ways to handle this are activerecord and datamapper

4626109
datamapper	activerecord
doctrine 1 used activerecord pattern and doctrine 2 uses datamapper

4626150
qstring	qbytearray
i really need to print a qstring variable not a qbytearray or other object

4626160
equals	gethashcode
that will work except that you need to override equals and gethashcode to make the names compare by value

4626187
centos	linux
i m using centos 5.5 linux same as rhel and have just copied the .wine directory from my home and changed the owner recursively

4626194
dreamweaver	fireworks
i am planning to use macromedia dreamweaver flash fireworks mx 2004 just because i have them and have installed the apache with php and mysql servers on a windows computer

4626205
width	height
usually it happens when modalbox doesn t know the width height of the content that it s loading

4626205
width	height
1 wrap the content that will be shown in modalbox in a div and set the height width css properties for it

4626205
width	height
2 make sure that if there are images in the modalbox content that they have the width height also set

4626222
filtering	grouping
variable filtering is an array of floats that never changes it s values stays the same for all work grouping and for all kernel calls

4626231
config	ini
if it is yours it may be wiser to use an other config file format json ini yaml etc

4626285
implements	extends
you should really implements options too and use this.setoptions options instead of your current extends

4626317
superclass	subclassing
to be possible if x is either a b or a both subclassing of a and superclass of b

4626325
justmock	typemock
you d have to use typemock or maybe telerik justmock which have this capability but also cost money

4626388
onclick	onfocus
use the onfocus event rather than the onclick event

4626400
observer-pattern	mediator
if you want to use the mediator pattern instead of observer-pattern it would be fairly trivial to do this using qt

4626404
hash	md5
this needs a cryptographically secure hash function hence sha-256 avoid md5

4626404
prng	random
using a random 16-byte iv generated with a cryptographically secure prng is still the safe way and the one i recommend

4626407
goto	break
such a construct is used as a kind of goto to be able to jump after the end of the loop using a break statement inside

4626423
put	get
as an example if you were to set a 500 error internal server error you could put a further description in to allow invokers to get additional information relating to the error that occurred

4626458
hash	md5
hash it md5 should be available on both

4626466
folder	directory
it is a bad practice to have a wc spanning the branch tags directory you should only have a checkout of the directory repository trunk then use branch tag to branch tag the files folder as you need and if in the future you need to access those files make a switch to the branch changing your wc to that branch tag

4626494
subtract	add
the easiest way to get these expression is to first add the expressions for x and y and solve for column then subtract them and solve for row

many-to-many	one-to-many
note not a many-to-many reference just a one-to-many on a single table

4626558

doing so in order to pretend that goto is written as break is abusive

4626611
inherited	properties
this button is a properties of an object which inherited from tablelayoutpanel

4626612
multiplying	addition
addition multiplying addition8bitsat etc

4626685
post	get
i could be way off here but is there some sort of regex or setting i missed in iis that any .php file with post variables is just not assigned to get picked up by php

4626689
post	get
i will post any updates here in case i learn anything new or get a response from the ie team

4626692
oncreate	setcontentview
if i create a new class mypainter which extends view hook mypainter.ondraw and then setcontentview mp in oncreate from the activity all i get are the drawn lines

4626712
switching	screens
currently when i try to open the window on the secondary screens based on window position or by dragging it there cpu usage jumps by about 10 which seems to indicate that windows is switching to a software fallback rather than the hardware accelaration

4626729
ant	maven
if you re using ant or maven i would suggest seeing if there is a way to force a copy of the jsp files regardless of modified time

4626753
auto-generate	edmx
i have a table like and auto-generate edmx model

4626791
folder	directory
the one piece of the puzzle i m missing though is how to change the default logging directory from systemdrive inetpub logs logfiles to my own folder that s not on the boot drive of the server

4626794
sqldatasource	detailsview
suppose i have a detailsview which is bound to a sqldatasource

4626842
nsstring	nsdata
one method would be to obtain a nsfilehandle using filehandleforwritingatpath method converting your nsstring to nsdata and then calling writedata on your nsfilehandle after moving the file pointer to the end of the file

4626856
int	boolean
you could have 1-bit boolean and 4 and 2-bit int

4626871
put	get
in words that would look like get me all unique user emails from table1 and table2 that are not in table3 and put them in 1 list

4626873
post	get
if i get far enough on my own i ll post it for future reference

4626933
width	height
so when the biggest item in your list shrinks and therefor the listbox itself could shrink because now there is unused space the listbox width and height for that matter will still stay the same because of virtualizationstackpanel doesn t shrink properly

4626943
udp	tcp
unless i misunderstand your question you should be able to just use standard sockets tcp or udp depending on your needs for communication between any all devices

4626964
piston	tastypie
in backbone.js methods that call the server fetch create destroy etc. should you be using a proper restful api such as one provided by tastypie or piston

4626964
piston	tastypie
then again i m probably not leveraging tastypie piston functionality to the fullest

4626974
getter	setter
in fact using getter and setter is considered a best practice

4626989
min	max
starting with mysql 5.0 we can bundle the computations of the min max pairs together with the select in a convenient stored procedure

4626998
url.action	actionlink
when they click on the link that is created by url.action edit new with .id item.id i m not using actionlink because i need to add html content inside the link the id shows up as a querystring parameter

4627000
public	protected
a tool that blindly extracted all public protected elements and blindly built an interface hierarchy to mirror an implementation hierarchy is far from smart and the end product wouldn t be pretty

4627019
pop-up	dialog
on click i am just opening jquery dialog pop-up window

4627073
hide	show
now the idea here is that if you have this action or event based on selection of option using toggle will show or hide toggle-menu depending on the selection ie i selected it once it will appear i deselect or select it again menu disappears

4627073
hide	show
using show will make the toggle-menu appear but not hide it if deselected in which case you would want to use a hide in all other event selections to hide the toggle-menu

4627089
required	placeholder
i put scripts and styles which are used on every page in the master and then leave a content placeholder so that every page has the possibility to include required scripts and styles

4627110
slideup	slidedown
i observe a click event on one in order to slideup slidedown sub_ul

4627125
ubuntu	debian
so in the meantime i have installed steel bank common lisp sbcl as easy as on ubuntu debian

4627134
gitorious	gitosis
finally a plethora of frameworks exist to simplify this gitosis gitorious ...

4627144
superclass	subclassing
in this version different subclassing of foo all share foo as a superclass but to hold the return value of bar2 or the parameters to bar1 or bar2 in a setting where all you know about your object let s say it s named obj is that it s a foo you need to use the type obj.t as the type of the variable

4627147
put	get
to put it another way i suspect that fixing the definite assignment rules to allow a local variable to be read within a lambda expression only where it would be safe to do so where the lambda expression is part of assigning the variable and the delegate doesn t get executed until after the assignment has taken place would add more complexity than the relatively small amount of benefit

4627183
fflush	gets
basically index writers have a virtual index in memory until it gets fflush to disk

4627199
post	get
however when i try to post my form i get the following error

4627219
public	protected
this isn t too daunting you ll have to copy all classes in the class hierarchy back to adapterview and fix the copied adapterview class mainly use of private package level member variables that have protected public accessors functions

4627242
cstdio	iostream
however i m not using cstdio style functions here -- i m using the iostream s library

4627267
ienumerable	icollection
i guess not at all unless dictionary implements ienumerable or icollection

4627273
hibernate	gilead
the application is a gwt application using gilead with hibernate on the back end

4627293
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the login works great on firefox ie safari and google-chrome

4627303
children	parent
you have a parent that has a reference to its children and each child has a reference back to its parent

4627303
children	parent
when you var_dump the root object it iterates over the children to print them and since each child has a reference to the parent it walks back up

4627320
awt	swing
5 what awt swing classes support hardware acceleration and which ones should be used

4627329
hide	show
basically i am trying to show hide divs and links but having some trouble

4627376

it basically gets the native hbitmap width height and the pointer to the location of the pixel data using getobject and the bitmap structure and then calls the managed bitmap constructor

4627402
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring are immutable so you ll have to create a new nsmutablestring from it and mutate this copy or to allocate a buffer copy data from the nsstring perform the correction and then recreate a new nsstring from the result

4627420
apk	dex
an apk is just a modified jar file that includes the dex bytecode classes.dex

4627433
width	height
i dont want to download the whole file to memory just get header info to determine height and width

4627438
hide	show
my problem is that i need feedback on this click so i wanted to show a loading message provided by jquerymobile and then hide it once the image loads

4627480
post	get
it is vital that you do this with an http post and not a get which is what a simple link would do because get requests should never have a side-effect to their main function of retrieving data from a server

4627484
put	get
get in touch with them and they ll happily put you on their community edition i know they ve already got 7-8 open source projects and are wanting more in exchange for feedback

4627492
hide	show
the code that should be able to read the value is used to show hide a label depending on the values of each bit of the enum

4627492
put	get
as a side node when debugging the code if i put the expression in a watch expression i get the correct value

4627555
squash	merge
you can also try to squash your merge in progress git squash save but i don t know if it is possible to push a squash reference on a server

4627586
hide	show
you don t need to hide show divs

4627591
firefox	safari
i faced the same issue it seems to be a browser bug tested in firefox and safari

4627615
width	height
and my solution was a bit of a hack i called toolkit.getscreensize determined if i was in a multi-monitor situation by comparing the height to the width and assuming that width twice height indicated multi-monitor then setting the initial x and y position of the frame

4627660
prepare	execute
i am able to run through my queries using prepare and execute function while using

4627660
prepare	execute
i am trying to see what would the query look but all i get is the statement that has been passed into the prepare statement but not the query that would be execute

4627660
prepare	execute
i tried to var_dump the result- execute and result- fetch but the execute statement gives me my prepare statement s sql with place holders while fetch statement gives me the result of that query

4627693
pthreads	fork
if you can access the server over ssh and can run your own scripts you can make a simple fifo server using php although you will have to recompile php with pthreads support for fork

4627695
getter	setter
that is i understand that we don t want domain objects to be merely bags of publicly-accessible getter and setter

4627730
mdpi	hdpi
i have copied these icons directly from sdk to the specific folders for hdpi mdpi and ldpi

4627739
jgit	egit
as one of the developers of egit and jgit all i can say is that the projects are still in beta incubation in eclipse.org terms

4627742
opencart	magento
i would suggest opencart and magento

4627763
webchromeclient	webviewclient
i assume there are some methods i need to implement in the webviewclient or webchromeclient to give my webview full browser ability

4627780
redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	trac	mantis
any bugtracker that is well integratable within svn jira trac mantis redmine .. should do the job

4627780
pull	push
short answer when ever you are uncertain use the trunk and do not merge sync push pull at all

4627792
xna	spritebatch
if you go the xna route you will be drawing sprites using the spritebatch you tell them where and how to draw and that s where they will go

4627812
pdostatement	bindvalue
you ve probably thought that pdostatement bindvalue does something like

4627847
width	height
it would have a fixed height but the width would depend on the contents of the flowdocument

4627911
width	height
or why doesn t onresize pass in the new width and height

4627940
portrait	landscape
for a given video asset i want to determine whether it was shot in portrait or landscape mode

4627940
portrait	landscape
maybe this is to be expected all videos are up right but a portrait video is represented in mpeg-4 as a landscape video turned 90 degrees all videos are actually landscape try the mediainfo app on the mac if you don t believe me

4627940
width	height
which always yields a width height so for iphone 4 width 1280 height 720 and the transform a and d values are 1.0 the others are 0.0 regardless of the capture orientation

4627940
portrait	landscape
i have looked at the meta data using mediainfo app on the mac i have done a hexdump and so far have not found any difference between a landscape and portrait video

4627940
portrait	landscape
but quicktime knows and displays portrait videos vertically and the phone knows by rotating a portrait video if you are holding the phone in landscape orientation on playback and correctly displaying it if holding it in portrait

4627941
post	get
another question is the decision between post and get form submission

4627944
post	get
however if you really want to have nice urls all the time you ll have to send a form get post - doesn t matter and redirect user

4627965
post	get
thats a good and classy one about the subject basically get is the way to go if the resulting url coresponds with content for an example don t use get to pass information you want to save don t use post do transmit a id of content you want to show the user

4627985
post	get
i ve seen other post on this subject and have fiddled with variations but still cannot not get the json model binding to work correctly

4627990
post	get
the php frameworks i ve used typically exclude get data and rely soly on post data

4628000
awt	swing
a java program that does frequent swing awt painting animation but nothing more advanced than g.filloval ... runs at a consistent 60fps in netbeans and at about 6fps when ran in eclipse or executed as a jar file from a unix terminal

4628036
integer	unsigned
i need an algorithm that converts an arbitrarily sized unsigned integer which is stored in binary format to a decimal one

4628036
division	modulo
i currently use the maybe or obviously somewhat naive way of continuously calculating the modulo and remainder through division through ten

4628046
post	get
how do i set up my repository so that for every user it returns a list of post and for every post i get the poster

4628061
floating-point	integer
if targetweight height and targetcalories are floating-point or integer values they don t need to be surrounded by quotes in the sql statement

4628078
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you view www.skyambitions.com in safari google-chrome or firefox it displays correctly

4628088
rvm	bundler
usr local rvm gems ruby-1.8.7-p302 bundler gems prawn-89ba0ebf7ac3

4628144
stdout	stderr
there are three standard streams stdin is a pointer to the standard input stream stdout is a pointer to the standard output stream and stderr is a pointer to the standard error output stream

4628144
stdout	stderr
in this example stdin now points to inputfile.dat stdout points to output.txt and stderr points to errors.txt

4628152
width	height
the left column a b c is a fixed width and the cap pieces a c e are fixed height

4628182
google-chrome	firefox
everything works well in firefox google-chrome etc

4628183
min	max
i get stuck using functions like min max etc and grouping in linq and would appreciate any help i can get

4628267
move	drag
then move drag and drop will do it all of your data flow tasks into the container

4628274
atomic	interlocked
there is also a decrement and several other useful atomic operations defined on the interlocked class

4628302
hash	md5
you have the formsauthentication.hashpasswordforstoringinconfigfile method youc an use for generating md5 and sha1 hash for comparing later

4628322
opencart	magento
i am developing a new e-commerce enabled site for a company that sells two types of products which i will call 1 widget items which are minimally customizable and 2 cars which are highly customizable so complex that cms s i have reviewed including magento opencart etc

4628353
many-to-many	one-to-many
i m trying to convert a one-to-many relationship in entity framework to a many-to-many

4628387
for-loop	arrays
so if you want to iterate over an arrays in javascript always use the classic for-loop construct

4628452
int	boolean
in that environment it made a lot of sense to pack as many boolean into an int as you could and so we would regularly use operations to take them out and put them in

4628510
width	height
appleâ s frameworks make use of them â for instance nssize cgsize is a simple structure that holds two attributes width and height and there are a few functions that operate on them

4628524
range	min
in excel i have the following formula that is supposed to return the min of a range and divide it by the current cell 1 h18 then multiply by 10

4628549
implements	extends
and even at that you wouldn t replace array with stdclass you d replace it with a custom class one that likely extends arrayobject or at least implements iterator and arrayaccess interfaces

4628569
division	modulo
i currently use the maybe or obviously somewhat naive way of continuously calculating the modulo and remainder through division through ten

4628638
client-side	server-side
you should always perform validation server-side to begin with and only afterwards do client-side validation

4628643
bmp	png
i m assuming it works with a bmp but not a png jpg

4628681
slideup	slidedown
i am familiar with slideup and slidedown s callback functionality and have used this to achieve the changing of classes after animations have completed

4628689
draggable	droppable
you can accomplish this by using a combination of draggable droppable options

4628689
move	drag
every time you move the draggable div the drag event is called which determines if the red boxes are inside the green ones and assigns a valid class to the draggable div

4628689
draggable	droppable
the droppable object only accepts valid draggable

4628691
telerik	radcombobox
i am trying to convert typedview class from llblgen to array.i am trying to bind this array to radcombobox from telerik

4628702
google-chrome	firefox
does google-chrome extension api has similar function to the firefox evalinsandbox

4628710
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie both report this being the active element but google-chrome always says it s body that is active even though click fired on the button element

4628724
post	get
i have added it as a subreport and linked up all of the parameters but when i run the report in bids i get the error message in the subject of this post

4628751
clang	llvm
llvm compiles code faster than gcc may create code that runs faster and the clang frontend provides more accurate error messages than gcc â so there are definitely reasons for switching

4628768
nsmenu	nsstatusitem
i have an nsmenu which opens when a user clicks an nsstatusitem in the status bar

4628880
hash	md5
one wonderful way you can check is to compare md5 hash

4628880
hash	md5
while md5 hash doesn t mean they are the same either it is better than checking the length albeit a longer process

4628882
width	height
i used setbounds method in windows.forms instead of left top width height properties assignment because each time i assign value that changes location property - window changes it s position

4628882
width	height
left top width height assignment causes window to move 4 times while setbounds move windows once better ui experience no window hesitation

4628894
accessor	properties
what kind of properties should i write if i want an attribute not be modified by its accessor return by copy and be set by reference retain

4628913
webclient	httpwebrequest
you could skip the ie window and just use one of the web classes webclient httpwebrequest httpwebresponse to load up a object version of the page

4628920
getter	setter
in such case you should write getter and setter by yourself

4628929
firefox	safari
ps i ve tested in safari and firefox

4629478
min	max	width	height
i assume you are using lineto s the only way i could think of would be to keep a min max stored for the height and width as the user is drawing paths

4629478
min	max
the main thing to remember is set the min max vals to the coords of the first path a user creates

4629483
width	height
what happens is that once i rotate a nonuniform sprite for example a rectangle the width and height are no longer correct because they assume they are in an nonrotated state

while you can assign an iidentity to the iprincipal.iidentity property........you should be more interested in the iprincipal your custom concrete version rather than the iidentity

4629939
iprincipal	iidentity
i would create a single iprincipal your own version ex mysupercoolprincipal.cs an abstract iidentity your own abstract version like myabractiidenity iidentity

4629939
iprincipal	iidentity
and i think will help with the iidentity vs iprincipal stuff i mention above

getter	setter
for instance you might want to validate the value in the setter or lazily load the value in the getter

4630148
getter	setter
the second form allows no customization except accessibility of the getter and setter

4630148
getter	setter
if you don t need to do anything specific in the getter and setter the second form is usually more convenient

4630152

atoi	atof	strtol	atof	strtol	atoi
i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10

4631310
atoi	atof
but i m still curious about something man atoi or atof on os x though not on linux

4631310
atoi	atof
mentions that atoi atof are not threadsafe

4631310
atoi	atof
i frankly have a hard time imagining a possible implementation of atoi or atof that would not be threadsafe

4631310
strtol	atoi
and if they are why on earth wouldn t the library just define atoi in terms of strtol and therefore be safe

4631329

4631377
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux 10.04

4631384
hash-collision	key
i think the reason random hashing isn t used much is that hash-collision when a small hash value is computed from a 32-bit hash are apt to be rare unless there s something wrong with the hash function and in that case there s a fair likelihood that all 32 bits of the hash function will match because only part of the key was used in computing the hash

4631578
superclass	subclassing
you re creating an instance of the superclass and trying to assign it to a subclassing pointer

4631586
do-while	break
also by having the keyword exit be your break condition there is no need for extra code to check input before you call system because exit will kill both your shell and your program if you use strcmp as the do-while conditional statement

4631604
strtol	atoi
though atoi always has been a wrapper around strtol which also sets errno and should then have the same thread safety

4631607
google-chrome	firefox
i think the best idea is to use jquery to do the flash embedding and calling here s simple html code i happen to use that works on ie firefox and google-chrome

4631652
int	double
the problem here is that you are performing int division which gives the answer 0 and then afterwards converting the result to a double

4631690
inherited	subclassing	nsmutablestring	nsstring
it is possible to subclassing nsstring and nsmutablestring but doing so requires providing storage facilities for the string which is not inherited by subclassing and implementing two primitive methods

4631690
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the abstract nsstring and nsmutablestring classes are the public interface of a class cluster consisting mostly of private concrete classes that create and return a string object appropriate for a given situation

4631745
width	height
it takes hwnd x y width height since there s no swp_nosize flag it s actually more complicated to use it to just move the window since you also have to fetch the size

best features from lisp and scheme

4632102
gridview	detailsview	gridview	formview	formview	detailsview
if it is going to be a single record you can use detailsview or formview else you use gridview

slider	jquery-easing
if i have the jquery-easing plugin called in my head fpr the coda slider the fancybox doesn t work

4632403
atof	strtod
the atof function has been deprecated by strtod and should not be used in new code

4632449
width	height
we eant to distort it into 150 height and 200 width triangle

4632497
ami	rightscale
i know i can look into the script and folder and see what they do but since a lot of user here recommended using rightscale centos ami in ec2 i hope may be there is already some gurus here know what those mentioned script and folder doing and could advice me

the problem is that in tcp only the server needs to do port forwarding for communications to work both ways since you establish a connection while in udp you d have to use recvfrom -- which afaik needs the ports to be opened in the first place on the client side which i do not want and is not needed if you look at any multiplayer game or voip client

4634780

since the http server can only send one type of request get or post your form will send a post request

4635570
post	get
i recall that depending on the browser and also your php configuration get variables might be ignored when using post requests

using hmac to prevent collisions is useless because a we use hash not for mac b to make probability of collision 50 for sha-512 you need to calculate about 2 256 values

4636152
width	height
for determining the width height of many image formats you only need some bytes at the beginning of the file so you could start with that - as mentioned it depends on the actual image format though

4636156
width	height
you can get the file size using the content-length header but you would need to at least start downloading the image to get the width height

4636156
width	height
once the image starts downloading you could parse the stream and as brokenglass and ed swangren suggest try to find the image width height that way

4636156
width	height
having said that it sounds like an awful lot of work given that you can quickly find the image width height using available libraries if you download the entire image

4636160
vim	gedit
your text editors gedit vim do some encoding detection - you can check which encoding do they detect i don t know how - i don t use any of them and use that as -f iconv option or save the open file with your desired encoding using one of those text editors

4636206
oncreate	findviewbyid
so while you assign the local variable to the view instance located by findviewbyid it falls out of scope and ceases to exist after oncreate returns

width	margin
in the first case you could create a cell or multicell for text that splits across many lines with no borders background with zero width so that it reaches the right margin of the page and centre alignment

4636290
width	height
would restrict the maximum width and height to 150px and it can be anything from less than 150 up to 150 and anything that doesn t fit inside that will be clipped off and hidden from view

4636290
width	height
you can also just use height and width to specify a fixed size if you don t want the table to expand or shrink at all

4636319
width	margin
this will set top and bottom margin to 0 and left and right margin to auto which will let the div auto-center itself when its width is known fixed

4636321
put	get
i put a test view in place to pass the path to on iis6 i get

4636329
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
you may also want to look at backbone.js a javascriptmvc framework

4636335
rtp	rtcp
here you can find description of widely used protocols for voice over ip - rtp for data transmission and rtcp for coordination and qos

4636371
calloc	malloc
reading large files into memory might not be desirable either but if you must then you should maybe look into first using the stat and fstat functions to find out how large the file really is then allocate the buffer dynamically using malloc calloc or use mmap

4636407
google-chrome	firefox
i m serving an xpi to firefox users and a crx to google-chrome users

4636424

the width + height appear in the following code in 3 places

4636453
google-chrome	safari
navigator.plugins does work for me in safari google-chrome

4636464
getter	setter
and if technique 2 uses a better performing getter does it follow that technique 1 uses a better performing setter since title gets an explicit and presumably immediate release

4636526
children	parent
say we have a typical parent-children type relationship where each one parent could have many children but we need to keep track of the parent s single gasp favorite child.

4636572
nswindow	nsapplication
i build with make and only added a few .mm files to access the necessities from nsapplication nswindow and nsopenglview

4636622
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
we have an old legacy asp application that stored customer passwords as salt md5 hash

4636622
hash	md5
my thoughts were to hash the existing md5 hash using sha1

4636622
hash	md5
it means i d still need to hash with md5 and then hash again with sha1 when customers logon and when they reset passwords but i can live with that

4636722
hash	md5
default to md5 since that s the current hash

4636722
hash	md5
if you can t spare another column then widen the existing one to support prefixing with some indicator of the hash - old hash will not be prefixed and can assumed to be md5

4636726
implements	extends
you can solve your first problem by extends focuspanel to implements the requiresresize and providesresize interfaces

4636767
mdpi	hdpi
so if my widget is 72dp x 294dp what size bitmaps do i need for my ldpi mdpi and hdpi drawables

4636770
shadowing	named

4636787
post	get
this is my add.php the file that get the post information from the form in the main.html

4636854
int	double
the idea is to use the normal int divison but adjust for negative results to match the behaviour of the double floor double function

4636913
subtract	addition
because the -- and ++ operators map to inc rement and dec rement instructions in addition to adding and subtract in the cpu and these operators are supposed to map to the instructions hence why they exist as separate operators

4636990
width	height
i cannot figure out the height and width of the table cell

4636998
post	put
then again while the idea for pre post increment decrement operators might have been influenced by machine operations it looks like they weren t put into the language specifically to take advantage of such

4637000
int	chars
so some fields in the database which i would like to represent as enums in my application are of type int and some of type chars 2

4637001

opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for most of the conforming browsers read firefox safari opera google-chrome you have to give html5 elements a display style before they will be shown

4637041
width	height
the problem is using the middle x and y and subtracting adding the half of the windows width and height is not enough

4637041
width	height
so i start it at 10x10 then i take the full width and full height of the window and subtract 20 of it because 10 on the left side and 10 on the right side

4637041
width	height
but the right and bottom side of the rectangle is out of the window so the width and the height given to the drawrect method is too high

4637041
width	height
this means the left border has 8px width and the top bar showing the windows title and close minimize buttons has 30px height

4637061
mongodb	bson
but is the bson objectid better more efficient for mongodb to use than just an integer fb user_id

be aware that this code does not compile i have just pulled together various code snippets that i have in my own list results framework which includes paging sorting grouping and caching

4637451
nsurl	nsstring
i think you need an nsstring not an nsurl object to pass to the parser so the extra part you are doing with changing the nsstring to an nsurl is the issue

4637454

we would simulate a get post or put method to a particular controller and check the acceptance criteria

4637568
width	height
when you ll change the value .change event will kick in and if selecteddiv isn t empty then it will change the width and height

4637573
width	height
then all i m doing is setting the width and height based on the browser width height multiplied by .25

4637578
width	height
in order to find the size of the graphicsbase i added width and height properties to graphicsbase which are set in the constructor of graphicsrectangle

4637608
folder	directory
my app creates a directory file folder on c drive since i don t want to expose all the data in it and i don t want to encrypt all files in it i wonder if there is a way to lock the folder up so only my app can access it no other person through windows explorer or another program can open the folder doesn t matter if my app is running or not is it doable

4638207
getter	setter
it s probably what will be in the final recommendation but i try not to predict the future in these things -- too easy to predict in haste and regret in leisure. some browsers have implemented this using essentially the getter and setter you note just with native functions implemented in the browser to back them akin to how say document.appendchild is a js function with a native browser-provided implementation behind it

4638207
getter	setter
others have an entirely different approach for dom getter and setter than for user-definable getter and setter

4638207

but if i put the same code into the main function for the nsoperation i get sporadic exc_bad_access errors

4640062
width	height
this works fine is both the width and height are large

4640062
width	height
however if width is over 604 and height is under 453 604x300 m then this will skip the resize procedure

4640062
width	height
the opposite is the same width is under height is over

4640063
int	double
i am using only int s in this example but get the same result testing with float or double

4640087
vb.net	vb6
unfortunately i am converting someone else s vb6 program into vb.net

4640105
width	height
if i get your question correctly then if width 605 and height 300 then it is false and nothing in the if block will be executed

4640119
width	height
if you want to set a maximum height or width you need to use || instead of in your conditional

4640169
icmp	udp
how do i know if i got an icmp host unreachable after trying to send some data to a udp port

4640204
required	placeholder
if your translations required strings with variables placeholder use blocktrans instead

4640232
put	get
not only does it make more sense to put the entire sentence in one translation string it may be impossible for translators to get the sentence correct when it s split into pieces

4640249
hide	show
note that modern browsers will hide the real full path showing something like c fakepath realname.txt so to show only the name which is real change to

4640274
versioning	upgrade
i strongly suggest you upgrade to the current versioning 1.6.0_23 at time of writing this

4640308
folder	directory
the easiest way to start developing an extension is putting a pointer file in the extensions folder in the profile directory

4640323
ssl	https
https is simple http with ssl the implementations of which is the point of openssl

4640334
fast-forward	merge
the two tree version is best if the remote branch is a fast-forward of your current head if not then the three way merge option may be better

4640336
put	get
i want to put the current and oneyear values for each date into the calc sheet and get the result into the result column

4640336
put	get
i also tried writing a udf but like i said it needs to put in the values and get the result which means the udf will modify the sheet

4640371
postgresql	mysql
postgresql or mysql will cost you nothing or ms-sql server if you ve got cash rattling around

4640380

4640443
rss	feed
given a standard rss feed being consumed in an xmldatasource what would be the best way of filtering the rss feed to show only items where the rss feed item description contains a particular term

4640443
rss	feed
e.g i wish to filter the following rss feed where the description contains a certain team name say liverpool

4640538
ati	nvidia
metaphorically speaking ati has a good engine compared to nvidia

4640539
floating-point	fixed-point
in practice this becomes more tricky in the general case due to the limitations of fixed-point or floating-point

4640575
rss	feed
think about a service like a rss feed aggregator

4640587
multiplying	add
let me add some example code and sample data which you can multiplying until getting 7 million entries

4640615
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller attached to the window the rootcontroller in this navigationcontroller is a uiviewcontroller that presents a tableview

4640617
for-loop	loops
we can use for-loop and while loops for same purpose

4640650
erd	diagram
i m not really sure if erd is the proper term but occasionally i see diagram created where the line in between two entities is labeled with text to describe the relationship

4640651
for-loop	loops
in general a for-loop might be preferable for simple loops since the logic of loops is contained in a single line

4640680
unsigned	short
short to unsigned short is a conversion thus having conversion rank

4640689
ocl	uml
has anyone tried creating uml profiles for design patterns with stereotypes and ocl constraints

4640692
for-loop	loops
scope of loops variable s for example with the for-loop i has local scope with a while this has to be defined before which means it is available after of course you can do that with for as well..

4640692
for-loop	loops
frankly if you need to increment decrement a for-loop makes sense if you don t know the bounds and there is no real increment decrement a while loops makes more sense

4640755
cos	sin
you d probably want either setlookatm with the lookat point calculated from your camera angles using sin cos as you are doing in your code - i assume you know how to do this.

4640770
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
as per marc_s s comment it makes sense to wrap all the disposable components sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader in a using block to make sure they are disposed of properly rather than my original solution that only wrapped the sqlconnection with a using block

4640794
ubuntu	linux
this is on linux - ubuntu 10.04

4640799
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
you may notice the use of the using statement which ensures that the sqlconnection and the sqldatareader objects are properly disposed

4640822
jms	jta
a full spring stack typically still uses jpa jta jms and servlet from java ee

4640822
jsf	wicket
wicket on its turn only replaces jsf or when used with a spring stack replaces spring mvc

4640822
jsf	wicket
wicket by itself is a very nice web framework but in practice it isn t used as often as jsf

4640822
jsf	wicket
i won t go into the discussion whether wicket or jsf is better this is mostly a religious battle anyway but due to the popularity of jsf there are simply more people experienced with it and there is a large community offering many things for jsf like component libraries and extensions

4640949
post	get
when i post the form i get only the header fields

inline	inlining
namely inlining you can t inline something if you depend on the caller nor on the function since the code might have just put somewhere without the function around it

4641059
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
in short you convert the float to unsigned integer sort them and then convert them back to float this is required otherwise the negatives values would be incorrectly sorted after the positive ones

4641110
post	get
method post - which defines how the data from the form will be sent as you already send some data with get method that s the stuff after

4641220
inherited	properties

lisp	scheme
i always hear about c or assembly being the language of choice for viruses and i wonder if any of the more arcane languages like lisp or scheme can be used for it too

4641531
width	height
if you want to see empty tags you can give them width height and a background color with css

4641532
calloc	malloc
the difference is in calling convention and effect - calloc initialises all the memory to 0 whereas malloc does not

4641538
ddms	adb
on the nexus s running android 2.3 the data folder is not visible in the ddms file explorer or the adb shell but it is visible in the emulator

portrait	landscape
i am doing some rejigging of various views from portrait to landscape in my iphone app

4641566
portrait	landscape

integer	fractions
to get all of them you also have to take the semi-convergents mediants â â fractions of the form for some integer nâ 1

4641669
instances	transient
if so it seems preferable to make this variable transient and re-fetch the cache instances each time the instances is restored

4641690
int	chars
luckily even with 5 chars that s only bits total so you can completely pack the entire string into a 32 bit int and won t even need to fiddle the sign bit so you ll have a very fast completely lossless zero collision hash code that uniquely identifies each string.

4641690
int	chars
below is your new function to pack 5 chars in the range 0-9 a-z + - into an int

4641714
usergroups	administration
i have a class employer which contains a collection of usergroups but it also has another usergroups called administration

4641791
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
disadvantage only runs in modern browsers like firefox google-chrome safari

4646491
width	height
width and height make much more sense as getters

4646491
width	height
you can also set width and height and there s some slightly awkward code that runs behind the scenes to make it work

min	max
forgive me for being fastidious but the solution suggested by the majority min + rng.nextint max - min + 1 seems perilous due to the fact that

4647255
min	max
max - min may cause overflow when min is negative

4647255
min	max
a foolproof solution would return correct results for any min max within integer.min_value integer.max_value

formview	detailsview
like you could load bookings in a listbox and when a user selects a booking display the ferry and flight details in a formview detailsview

in fact if you trace it through the execution of the loadview function the array never gets a view with subviews in it even though i called addsubview uiview view which the documentation says this about this method retains view and sets its next responder to the receiver which is its new superview

4647453
uiview	subviews
to be more clear why don t the uiview that are passed to the array have subviews when the local variables for them do

clang	llvm
llvm is automatically a cross compiler so you do not have to compile a compiler to get started the msp430 backend to llvm is experimental but should work or be close the arm and thumb backends are fine use -m32 in clang to avoid 64 bit integers on a 64 bit host

int	chars
what you probably want is to correct the endianness of the int chars etc

4649331
int	chars
in order to do so you must first identify the bytes which constitute the said int chars etc

4649331
int	chars
simply flipping reversing the whole array may not work unless the whole array represents one single int chars etc.

some features of note include type inference generators multimethods optional duck typing macros true closures curry and first-class functions

4649994
hash	md5
one of the java developers has a function that computes md5 hash for the string with hardcoded key and offers to use it everywhere else which means importing java code to c# and multiplying over the apps that need it

that is why the authenticity token is generated during an initial request to the application and then passed back during post put and delete requests

4650091
comparator	comparable
implement the comparable interface on the card object add a comparator function that determines whether another card should be before or after this one in the sort order

4650104
post	put
each objects has somekind of post comment structure the unique thing though is that it is more or less static so i figure out it would make no sense to put in every single post and comment into my database because that would cause more database load

4650121
ssl	https
the exchange are done over https therefore encrypted with ssl

4650121
ssl	https
since the zend application is doing a lot and when i say a lot i mean it we are asked to use a pool of https connection in order to avoid the renegociation of the ssl encryption for each request

4650139
hash	md5
md5 doesn t really have a key as it s a hash not an encryption

4650144
submit	submission
as far as submission form values is concerned you can either submit directly to script via form attribute or if you choose to employ ajax you can use javascript or use jquery s

seems to me if your interference app were using new delete malloc free then the interference app s would interfere with the non recycle test more

4650200
128bit	64bit
note you will have to go to 128bit struct for 64bit os

4650247
post	get
i will just transmit that stuff via get or post to my

4650252
hash	md5
i m not sure what are you thinking about but the correct way to validate a elf binary is to use a hash like sha-1 md5 etc

4650252
hash	md5
when you create the elf file then you also create the signature file using this hash algorithm md5 and validate the result

4650298
wordpress	joomla
if you want to copy and paste the chart manually to a cms joomla wordpress site than you could do it from the gvis object s html list

4650319
versioning	upgrade
use css3 or html5 i assume there s something within these to easily do what i want and hope everyone upgrade their browsers asap while the older browsers just get a slightly uglier versioning of the page

4650327
ubuntu	linux
assuming you re using linux and probably ubuntu if you re in that part of the instructions on the page you linked -- but that info in the question would help too.

4650367
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval may be required but those always make my head hurt

4650370
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
unlinke getelementbyid getelementsbytagname has an s at elements because it returns an array array-like nodelist of the matching elements

4650393
wcftestclient	basichttpbinding
actually as is stated by marc_s the problem is that my service was configured as rest service so answer is yes to get those services accessible for wcftestclient application additional endpoint basichttpbinding is required

4650420
submit	submission
while i would expect my ajax to submit three characters and filter in javascript from there i can t assume that the input will be three characters - non-javascript users will be submission a string of arbitrary length

4650428
free	malloc
you should not need to do malloc or free on it

4650428
int	double
you would use a struct such as cgrect or audiobufferlist the same way you would use an int or double

4650433
post	put
actually i will put minus point to anyone who will post it as answer

4650460

4650686
selecteditem	selectedindex
you can listen for the datagrid s itemrollover event and then select a row in the other datagrid by using it s selectedindex or selecteditem properties

4650697
inherited	properties
when you create a new instance it inherited all the properties from the prototype in fact it has a reference to it

4650724
serializable	deserialization
with this at least the serializable works just fine note either specify xmlinclude attributes for the types that can be in the original list or hand over an array of types in the constructor of the serializable however if the object is deserialized the children collection ends up empty because the set block is never reached during deserialization i am quite clueless as to why this is

4650736
int	double
the standard float and double are 4 and 8 bytes so you can t directly pack two of them into one int 32 object as it is only 4 bytes

4650739
public	protected
you can specify access to the properties as public or private or protected

4650769
hide	show
edit now you use a lot of show hide events you want to show a message and then do the redirect

4650796
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript msi customactions suck

4650827
free	malloc
yes you do need to malloc free the memory

4650837
width	height
you probably already know that as you draw inside a sprite the sprite s width height will reflect the farthest bounds of your drawing

4650860
versioning	upgrade
my crystal ball says you didn t just upgrade to win7 you also got the 64-bit versioning

4650897
google-chrome	firefox
it s working in google-chrome firefox and ie

awt	swing	swt	swing
i am currently toying with the idea of converting a small medium sized project from awt to swt although swing is not totally out of the picture yet

4650978
apache	nginx
does anyone know about a way to load a library in memory and then use its functions - from a web server like nginx lighhtpd or apache

4650992
fancybox	colorbox
this time i used colorbox and put this code oncomplete event of fancybox

4651018
folder	directory
via cydia apps installed into another folder that s why you are getting different directory

4651060
integer	unsigned
doesn t that look like a unsigned integer stored as a signed integer

4651076
versioning	upgrade
i am working on a greasemonkey script that will actually upgrade the versioning of jquery used on the page

4651088
post	get
on another slightly related subject to send requests manually you can send get requests manually on your browser and use javascript or php to send post requests

4651115
swing	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swt	windowbuilder
i would suggest importing it into a windowbuilder project as windowbuilder gives you the ability to parse existing code and create a gui mock-up then morph components to either swt or swing

4651127
post	get
blog post such as model binding to a list are good reads as well to get acquainted with the proper syntax that the default model binder uses

4651146
hash	salt
btw there is already a pretty simple and powerful c# salt hash class library they ve also included a small demonstration of how to use the library out there - link

4651146
hash	md5
it also provides a verification mechanism so you can verify the user s input as a valid password and you can choose the hash algorithm yourself sha1 md5 etc.

4651193
mouse	keyboard
i figure that they might be binding to the mouse move events + keyboard events since i don t know any out of the box event that gives you that ability

4651198
width	height
i am assuming that your root visual item is stretching to horizontally and vertically to fill your window with auto height width

4651198
width	height
get rid of the auto height width

4651253
wordpress	joomla
the usual open source solutions -- these days joomla wordpress and drupal are popular -- are written by thousands of people and while you might loose a little flexibility by using on that s ready made this is by far offset by not needing to redo everything from scratch

4651259
getter	setter
in any case i expect that if you read the rest of the code you ll find that there are getter for -audiochannel and -sessionpreset that have been written as well as a setter for -setsessionpreset

4651286
accessor	properties
by overriding the session properties in an unnamed category before synthesizing it a set accessor will also be synthesized but the header file says it is readonly so other classes don t know about the set accessor

4651286
accessor	properties
retain means that the set accessor should retain the value of the properties and the assign keyword tells it to set the properties without retaining it

4651291
getter	setter
this means you want the compiler to generate the appropriate setter and getter for the session and orientation properties and that you want those properties to store their values in the _session and _orientation instance variables respectively

4651291
getter	setter
this means that the implementations for the setter and getter will be provided at runtime

4651297
post	get
global script protection administrator setting which applies a regular expression against post and get form and url variables to strip out and several other tags

4651322
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have problem with google-chrome not firefox ie opera or safari

4651323
children	parent
if you could have multiple exitstrategies for a single entrystrategy then you would have two tables with the entrystrategy being the parent and the exitstrategies being the children and the exitstrategy records would have a foreign key pointing to the entrystrategy parent record

4651323
children	parent
if you could have multiple entrystrategies for a single exitstrategy then you would have two tables with the exitstrategy being the parent and the entrystrategies being the children and the entrystrategy records would have a foreign key pointing to the exitstrategy parent record

4651326
serializable	deserialization
on deserialization the serializable uses your property getter to get the collection instance and then calls add on it for each item

4651329
swt	swing
if you re thinking of using a mix of swt and swing in the same application this eclipse corner article will be immensely useful

4651333
width	height
yes i have a simple fancybox with specified height and width

4651333
width	height
on this requestâ s success i wish the fancybox to change height and width

4651364
hash	salt
as mentioned above security should be provided by salt hash for passwords

4651378
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you can either put this in your viewdidload or viewwillappear delegate

4651406
swt	swing
we are preparing the same step swing to swt jface

4651406
swt	swing
this will require major refactoring in the swing application before using swt

4651406
swt	swing
we now refactored our swing application to always create components with their parent as in swt

4651423
appkit	nsprogressindicator
if you look up an appkit class such as nsprogressindicator for example in the apple documentation there will often be sample projects supplied by apple and you can use them to discover how they used the appkit class

4651441
textview	imageview
i have a control that supposed to render 3 android standard controls imageview and a textview

4651543
edifact	x12
biztalk supports several standard edi formats such as edifact x12 and rosettanet and there are plenty of adapters available for facilitating connections to several platforms including sap and peoplesoft via various protocols such as http ftp and smtp

4651565
opensuse	debian
i can t say where the build environment is located in debian or its offsprings but in opensuse there would be a kernel-default-devel package for example to contain utsrelease.h and autoconf.h as well as - via dependencies - the static header files required

4651587
hash	salt
and even better approach is to not keep passwords in the database instead keeping the salt some unique value and hash of password+salt

4651598
google-chrome	safari
this isn t possible for all browsers but it is supported in newer ones google-chrome safari

4651615
post	get
when i try to write a postfix prefix in decrement followed by a post prefix in decrement i get the following error invalid argument to operation ++ --

4651647
wordpress	joomla
so really take other advices on this page and have a look at wordpress drupal joomla and ezpublish

4651690
post	get
however when you try to use these urls in a form the form does a post request and because you ve defined all of these as get -only requests rails will not be able to find a compatible route

4651724
post	get
does google provide anything for this what is the ideal way that app engine would solve the problem of having users get and post data to persistent storage through app engine

4651736
firefox	safari
i remember firefox and safari both being a pita when trying to do this 2 years ago

4651779
google-chrome	firefox
the page loads and works fine in ie firefox google-chrome

4651815
maven	cargo
if you aren t using an application server there are probably some ways to get cargo and maven to deploy it for you but you may be better off just using some shell scripts to deploy and run the application

4651815
jboss	glassfish
however as your application grows you may find a need for an application server like jetty jboss glassfish tomcat etc

4651815
maven	cargo
when this happens take a look at the cargo plugin for maven because it will allow you to do something like

4651832
dlsym	dlopen
in linux you use dlopen open library dlsym look up a symbol function or value usually and friends

4651836
maven	cargo	nexus	artifactory
use maven cargo nexus or artifactory hudson and probably jira in conjunction of product release

4651841
dlsym	dlopen
you are looking for dlopen analogous to loadlibrary dlclose analogous to freelibrary and dlsym analogous to getprocaddress

4651850
dlsym	dlopen
the posix equivalents are dlopen and dlsym

4651860
implements	extends
i m implements some kind of combobox control by extends spark.components.supportclasses.dropdownlistbase

4651864
portrait	landscape
the youtube app is an example sometimes switching between portrait and landscape can result in the status bar being in the worg position pic provided

4651894
updatepanel	onclientclick
when the child page is submitted there is an onclientclick event that triggers a javascript function that clicks the button in the updatepanel on the parent page the button s click event being the trigger for the panel as well as the event that updates the image url

4651894
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox i have to refresh the entire page

4652052
filtering	grouping
see the working grouping s page although only filtering not masks are mentioned explicitly there

4652068
post	get
my get method has the setid parameter and because it is in the url of course this will also be in the post and therefore requirerequestvalueattribute was returning true for isvalidforrequest for both methods

4652100
folder	directory
you have to make sure that you added the folder and files to your test project and have set its copytooutput directory appropriately

4652120
children	parent
alternatively is it okay to have rows reference themselves as a parent for purposes of aggregating their own data with those of their children

4652125
kerberos	ntlm
the integrated security is windows sspi which can either be kerberos or ntlm depending on how your machine is configured

4652206
rtos	qnx
qnx neutrino rtos -- a microkernel with a few variations that runs on x86 arm ppc etc

4652209
cakephp	lithium
there s also the lithium framework which is quite similar in design to cakephp

4652233
google-chrome	safari
the type is good in google-chrome and safari mobile

4652264
width	margin
it is likely that your body element has some kind of default padding margin and therefore it s box is bigger than the max width

4652273
rss	feed
i ve got a couple rss feed i need to parse for my app and i followed the excellent tutorial here

4652273
post	get
so i went to integrate it into my app and consistently get a force quit every time i try to display the list of post

4652278
hash	md5
from there i can compute the md5 hash and set the header

4652279
many-to-many	one-to-many
i would make it a one-to-many relation for member purchaseorder and a many-to-many relation member project as the membership appears to be the primarykey for it all

4652305
draggable	droppable
using jquery and jquery ui i have a draggable and droppable area the draggable item has the following helper

4652348
int	chars
once indexed int and small chars string don t have much read negligible performance difference

4652381
portrait	landscape
after the user has tapped through the welcome screen i d like to show another screen that can be used in both portrait mode and landscape

4652425
int	double
i just use int and double by default unless they are in a time critical part of the code then i am more careful in chosing

4652437
int	chars
start with gregsansom s idea upvoted but instead of int use the chars 1 datatype with values i j s and d

4652455
int	double
otherwise use int size_t double or larger types as-needed

4652458
cas	shibboleth
or you could go with cas openid or shibboleth

4652487
int	chars
but using a chars instead of an int as a function parameter just because you suppose that the range will be small is a bit silly imo

4652518
range	minimum
alternatively use the jquery form validation plugin which offers a broader range of possibilities like enforcing a minimum length

4652524
children	parent
i have a parent master table that is generic enough to hold the common information of the children

4652526
int	chars
if you are using a resource limited platform such as embedded system it may be valuable and sometimes even necessary to choose a short or a chars rather than an int to conserve memory

4652526
int	double
otherwise stick with the int and double data types

4652540
oncreate	onstart
register this receiver in oncreate or onstart method

4652550
nunit	mspec
specflow is emerging as one of the better .net bdd tools it s true and mspec is great at a unit level though i haven t found much benefit over nunit given the non-technical nature of the audience

4652557
post	get
if it s a form and it post instead of getting you will need to redirect to get around the usual browser back button + post data unpleasantness

4652557
post	get

4653671
onresume	onpause
onresume is when i start driving and onpause is when i come to a temporary stop

4653671
oncreate	onstart
i could put the code that s in onstart into both oncreate and onrestart and not bother to override onstart at all but the more that needs to be done between and the more i m duplicating things

4653671
oncreate	onstart
why can t it be the onresume is invoked after onrestart and oncreate methods just excluding onstart

the form has two three fields two input textbox and one textarea from subject and message

4653789
post	get
if you place an anchor tag with get variables and then use jquery to attach a post onclick the javascript would trump the href

4653789
post	get
you could then check in your php script that is processing the data which one happened post or get and with get do some extra error checking or processing to make sure the data is exactly what you expect

4653789
post	get
edit reading this again i started to think quite honestly if you go with my suggestion and write extra error checking or processing code for the get it wouldn t hurt to run it on the post either

serializable	deserialization
if it is being stored without some form of serializable process then when deserialization is attempted the object may possibly be read back in a strange or inconsistent state

4653830

width	height
height and use that same scale for height and width

4654194
box2dweb	processing.js
for the particular project i m working on processing.js and box2dweb turned out to be the right answer

4654207
int	chars
if it is ascii as using a func that returns chars would imply you would check to see if the first chars is - and then convert each subsequent chars to int with atoi const chars one at a time and multiplying your result value by ten each iteration before adding the new value to it

4654207
fgets	atoi
a better way would be to read several chars using fgets or something and then convert the char with atoi const char

4654224
cos	sin
if so how do i incorporate the variable so i can test it using sin cos and tan

4654236
hash	md5
you can get a shorter string by treating the md5 hash as a number in base 16 that uses characters 0-9a-f and converting it to for example base 36

4654244
folder	directory
however after publishing the compiled war file to the .. webapps folder to the apache tomcat directory i realise that system.getproperty user.dir no longer returns my application context path

4654250
atoi	getline	strtol	getline	strtol	atoi
perhaps a better idea would be to input it as a string as you already know how to do with getline then validate that the string consists of all numeric characters before calling a conversion function like atoi or strtol

4654250
int	double
but if you want to use trigonometric functions you re probably better off working with double with atof rather than int

4654257
awt	swing	swt	swing
if you have a window that opens up create the window in swt but make it s contents the existing awt swing

4654257

4654552
int	chars
q which is better a chars short or int type for optimization

4654552
int	chars
i thought it is better to avoid chars and short because of arithmetic conversion most likely they will be converted to int or longs and this will cause compiler to generate extra instructions

4654569
cpython	pypy
here s the adapted code shared by cpython 2.5 pypy and shed skin

4654569

you could implement it entirely using java swing for example and by making clever use of jlabel jpanels and maybe a gridlayout or perhaps even a jtable you could almost almost

4654792
client-side	server-side
data can be validated server-side or client-side

int	chars
as a further example take a look at this function that takes a pointer to a chars that is 8 bits in size and returns an int in this implementation that means 32 bits

4656514
rss	feed
an rss feed is basically just an xml document which you serve on the internet just like a regular web page

4656526
rss	feed
creating a custom rss feed with php

4656549
int	chars
typically the most-efficient use will be the native int size but it also depends on where the data comes from - it may be more efficient to load modify and store back chars short data than to load and convert to int modify and store back as chars short

4656549
int	chars
second in many many architectures chars and short are as fast as int especially if the calculation avoids implicit conversions to int

4656549
int	chars
note this is easy to mess up in c like x y + 1 - that forces conversion up to int assuming x y are chars or short but the good thing is that almost all compilers are smart enough to optimize-away the conversion for you

4656549
int	chars
this is helped by the fact that in typical processors the overflow wrap-around of a chars short is the same result as calculating it as an int and converting on store or by simply addressing that register as chars short in a later operation - getting the conversion for free

4656549
int	chars
third in some architectures chars short are faster than int

4656549
int	chars
on the other side if the compiler isn t smart enough to hide it from you local chars shorts passed as arguments to other functions especially not file-local static functions may entail up-conversions to int

hide	show
i tried to just put jquery hide before the script but that makes the container-class impossible to close because when toggle hide is equal to show

4656952
client-side	server-side
i ve been thinking about this and in a way it is analogous to the situation we have with server-side and client-side validation

4656952
client-side	server-side
these days it s pretty well accepted that you should have a full set of server-side validation and adding client-side validation is an option you can choose in order to make your application more user-friendly

4656952
client-side	server-side
the client server case is a non-issue these days because so much work has been done to automate it generating the client-side code from the server-side code modelvalidatorprovider in asp.net mvc

4656984
children	parent
i need all child menus collapsed unless there is a current_page_item class on the parent or one of the children

4657148
width	height
pertaining to html how do i make a div container grow with the content instead of manually defining a width and height

4657151
ceil	math.h
you can round it using the ceil function found in math.h

4657177
width	height
if you don t define width and or height the div element grows along with its content

4657205

4657266
int	chars
second unsigned int casts do not extract the ascii encoding of a chars

4657266
int	chars
they merely convert the value of the underlying numeric chars type to an unsigned int

4657266
int	chars
you should convert to an unsigned chars first and then to an unsigned int

4657272
chown	chgrp
take a look at chown and chgrp

4657279
appkit	nsapplication
on the mac you have to use appkit a cocoa framework for mac os x which provides nsapplication

int	chars
when promoting signed chars to signed int a first bit sign bit is taken into account

4657280
hex	binary	int	chars
1 if you have 1x-xx-xx-xx chars in binary x - any binary digit then int will be starts with 24 ones 1...1-1x-xx-xx-xx binary - 0xffffffyy hex

4657280
hex	binary
2 if you have 0x-xx-xx-xx binary then you ll have starts with 24 zeroes 0...0-0x-xx-xx-xx binary - 0x000000yy hex

4657281
ienumerable	ilist
depending on the number of classes etc this is could not be the fastest approach but it will allow you to use the objects very similarly to the linq objects and depending on the type of collections used ilist ienumerable etc you will be able to use the extension methods on those types of collections

4657289
equals	gethashcode
you may also override the methods equals and gethashcode methods of the class of the instances you are trying to filter

4657304
jar	war
i can add the jar manually as an archive from the workspace but that would mean that whenever someone cleans all projects the jar for b would get deleted and not generated as the build only compiles the classes and the deploy packages them into the war

4657316
int	chars
in the code you posted alpha is treated as a value between 0 and 1 which of course doesn t work if you use you alpha channel as an unsigned chars use the following if you want to do it in int space

4657316
unsigned	short
note that while these are shorts the values should all be 0 - 255 the short is just needed as computational space for the char char products you could also use intermediate casts but i just used unsigned short types for all to make it more readable

4657324
post	get
jquery.get and jquery.post on the other hand can only issue get and post requests

4657324
post	get
internally these two functions use jquery.ajax but they use particular settings that you don t have to set yourself thus simplifying get or post request compared to using jquery.ajax

4657324
post	get	post	put	put	get
get and post being the most used http methods anyway compared to delete put head or even other seldom used exotics

4657330
post	get
they do pretty much the same thing but makes it quicker to write an ajax request - makes a http post request and makes a http get request

4657333
serializable	deserialization
as long as you re loading the data set in a memory at the beginning of the program and keeping it in memory and you don t have any complex queries some sort of serializable deserialization seems to be more feasible than a full blown database

4657357
getter	setter
iâ ve left off attributes and n2 style getter setter for clarity

4657371
post	get
post and get differ slightly in the manner in which the data is sent to the server good article about it can be found here

uilabel	uibutton
people who do not want to subclass the view uilabel uibutton etc.

4659322
typedef	struct
in your sample code you are attempting to dllexport a typedef of an anonymous struct - which is going to confuse the compiler on two levels first you re exporting an alias which it doesn t want to do and next the struct itself is anonymous so it can t even export that

4659322
typedef	struct
why dont you just skip the typedef and give the struct the name

4659333
typedef	struct
unlike c you don t need to typedef struct names to avoid typing struct everywhere and can just use pointcg instead of struct pointcg when referring to that type

4659339
uilabel	uibutton
people who do not want to subclass the view uilabel uibutton etc..

4659346

width	height
is the right approach to provide a custom setsize w h method which is used rather than width height setters

4659548
int	double
it indicates 3 is float not int in other case 0.50 is float not double

4659614
unsigned	short
if it is from a fixed palette then a short int or even an unsigned byte might be sufficient

4659614
integer	unsigned
transparency could fit into 32 bit so a 32 bit unsigned integer type would work

4659614
integer	unsigned
however you might want more - in which case a 64 bit unsigned integer might be required

4659647
smarthost	exim
for ubuntu on your pc that probably means using the smtp servers from your isp as a smarthost for exim or another mta

4659651

trying to change two relationships in our entity framework from many-to-one to many-to-many relationships

4659758

get the hell out of the way and put the flag variable in the pacakge spec

4659771
inherited	properties
but i am facing the problem of the properties not being set correctly inherited set

4659787
pull	push
if you don t want a push but a pull model then you can of course use standard synchronization tools an object that has a critical section which is used in all accessors to protect data from concurrent access

4659801
int	chars
the only downside is the cost of the memory but odds are you won t be hanging on to that int for long as you will process it and turn it into a chars or byte

4659831
post	get
ok i saw many post s on how to serialize the value of dragged items to get hash and they tell how to save them

4659833
boost	stl
unfortunately there s no hash map standard in c++ - please see this so question for existing implementations couple of ideas there are sgi s stl hash_map and boost and or tr1 std tr1 unordered_map

4659877
getter	setter
will not care about the generated setter getter methods but instead assign the value directly

4659883
children	parent
you don t always need to select by an id or a class - you can select by tag by type by relation to another selection children parent siblings etc

4659888
folder	directory
i notice the c# dll builds to a folder in its own project directory while cli builds to the solution directory

4659890
pop-up	dialog
from pop-up menu choose table contents.. - this shows a customizer dialog

4659894
gridview	sqldatasource
i m using a gridview with an sqldatasource to extract the data out of the database and display it

4659909
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
if this is showed in firefox or opera the result is the picture you see below everything works fine under google-chrome and ie

4659924
subtract	add
now you can add and subtract changes that are for the release without interfering with the current project

4659937
width	height
what i have here is the which is my container div and the actual content that is 100 of the height of maincontent but only 50 of the width

4659940
x86	64bit
from my recall i can say that the code for the x86 version would be based on the code used on some 80x86 and later processors for the 16 to 32bit versions while the x64 would be different code for the 64bit implementation asssuming it is x64 and not ia-64 or intel64 code

4659984
prepare	execute
why not just use prepare once execute multiple method

4660004
inline	inlining
note that i am asking about inlining eligibility from the standpoint of contract not about when current implementations of the jitter decline to consider methods because of implementation difficulties or about when the jitter finally ends up choosing to inline an eligible method after assessing the trade-offs

4660007
next	except
from one full row to the next the distribution will simply be blurred except for the edges

4660051
x86	64bit	versioning	upgrade
one scenario i can think of where matching upgrade codes may be useful is if you have previously shipped only a x86 versioning that was able to install on both 32-bit and 64bit operating systems

4660051
x86	64bit	versioning	upgrade
in such a case having a x64 versioning with the same upgrade code would allow you to easily handle upgrade from the older x86 to the new x64 versioning on 64bit operating systems

4660052
width	height
if i understand correctly your game world is a child object of your window and its size is always 5000x5000 but you need width and height of the window to refer only to the window itself

4660052
width	height	getter	setter
use a mask as the other comment suggests then override the width and height getter and setter

rsa	dsa
the hash is then signed using the private key resulting in a signature using dsa or rsa algorithm

4660113
super	self
super self tableview

4660117
int	chars
on the arm an unsigned chars which is stored in memory should run the same speed as an int stored in memory but an unsigned chars stored in a register will frequently have to be normalized to the value 0-255 at the cost of an instruction

4660117
unsigned	short
an unsigned short would have to be normalized to 0-65535 at the cost of two instructions

4660117
integer	unsigned
btw it s worth noting that while the c standard requires that adding 1 to a 16-bit unsigned integer that holds 65 535 must yield zero not 65 536 there is no similar requirement for signed integers

4660117
int	chars
a compiler would be free to regard a signed short or signed chars as an int when it s held in a register and as its proper-sized type when stored in memory

4660122
ceil	floor
it may be worth noting that if you wanted an integer result from the rounding you don t need to pass it through either ceil or floor

4660163
textview	imageview
ok so i have a bunch of nested linear layouts each one contains a textview and an imageview

4660175

hash the salt + the new password many times and store the salt resulting hash in your database

4660481
hash	salt
verify password your script looks up salt for the user and hash the salt + entered password many times

4660481
hash	salt
the only thing that should be stored in your database is the salt and the hash digest

4660481
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
assuming you have a database of md5 hash that you need to support then the solution might be to add database columns for new sha-2 hash salt

4660481
hash	md5
when the user logs in you check against the md5 hash as you have been doing

4660481
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if it works then follow the steps in user creates new password to convert it to sha-2 salt and then delete the old md5 hash

4660526

pull	push
data layers are often a simple matter of push in and pull out so lets say you can abtract your data layer into an interface like

4660661
for-loop	loops
in a situation like this you should just refactor this into a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

4661231
inherited	subclassing	helpers	actioncontroller
if your second action is not in the same module controller you could subclassing zend_controller_action into your own base application controller that all your other action controllers inherited from a good practice on zf projects i find and then create another one called _forwardfromurl or something like that which breaks your url apart and passes it to _forward or create an actioncontroller helpers if you just need this one extra thing

repr	human-readable
the main purpose of repr is that it is used in the interactive interpreter and in the debugger to format objects in human-readable form

post	get
use rest or at least get and post and json

4662102
jobs	cron
cron jobs shouldnâ t slow the server always

4662102
jobs	cron
if itâ s your jobs that are so expensive your admin will probably not be okay with working around the closed cron jobs and slowing the server again anyway and may take further action to prevent you from working around

4662113
maven	pom.xml
as suggested in other answer that it is a good practice to write down direct dependencies in pom.xml and let maven handle it

getter	setter
if you are fine with an automatic getter setter implementation this will work

4662203
next	except
you d use a similar pattern for ignoring all lines after a given line match except you wouldn t have to process any more lines so instead of using next you d use last

4662250
innodb	myisam
if it stores them alongside other row data then you could use clustered index pk in innodb alter table order by in myisam to require particular order of data in table s datafile ordered by popularity to create hot area which might improve caching and reduce seeking a bit

based on the error i would say the problem is related with ws-addressing http action header missing header missing in soap message

4662390
maven	pom.xml
as to the purpose of the pom.xml file it s mostly metadata so that maven can figure out dependencies properly

4662396
width	height
play with the width and height of it to suit your needs

4662446
maven	pom.xml
i disagree that this violates the dry principal as maven defines things within the confines of a single project and its pom.xml

4662455
getter	setter
they re basically pairs of getter setter methods although you can have just a getter or just a setter with appropriate metadata

4662455
getter	setter
here the getter is public but the setter is private

4662476
post	get
i will try to get them and update this post

4662490
public	protected
that is wherever you have the word protected change it for the word public

4662490
put	get
if you need access control put it inside in front of the word get or the word set

4662497
put	get
because instead of having a pool you could put your algorithminstances in threadlocal objects thus making sure each algorithminstance is only used by the same thread all the time so the problem should disappear and you won t need to synchronize on the algorithminstance either so you ll get better performance

4662508
post	get
now this works fine with a get or a post from another page because the previous page is stored in the referer header

4662523
accessor	properties
the chapter on declared properties in the objective-c programming language explains what copy does and about synthesizing accessor

4662568
free	malloc
i started by writing my own implementations of malloc and free and then linked this object file before linking in the c c++ libraries

4662568
free	malloc
using the verbose option i could find out that there were object files that used other functions that appeared in the same object file in which microsoft defined their malloc and free functions

4662596

multiplying	add
it stems from the fact that and and or follow a similar relationship to multiplying and add respectively

4662645
qgraphicsview	qgraphicspixmapitem
qgraphicsview was designed to host qgraphicsitems to display an image you should use qgraphicspixmapitem

4662645
qgraphicsview	qwidget
embedding qwidget into qgraphicsview has some overhead and was really designed for complex widgets that can t be easily reimplemented in terms of qgraphicitems

4662650
getter	setter
add a getter and setter for the board field in the view class and call it from the main method

4662696
getter	setter
but just in terms of what the compiler generates the property creates an auto-backing field and essentially two methods a getter and a setter to access it

4662711
getter	setter
the first is a property which means that another backing variable will be created for you along with a getter and setter method

4662711
getter	setter
you should use this method because then you can easily change the functionality of the getter and setter classes although in visual studio converting a field into a property is pretty trivial.

4662766

division	subtraction
except the operator i need is division not subtraction

4663008
division	subtraction
edit what i m really looking for is a way to get the ratio of timea to timeb which requires division not subtraction

4663009
devise	cancan
i would suggest using devise or similar to authenticate users and cancan or similar to authorize their actions

4663009
devise	cancan
but definitely let devise and cancan do the heavy lifting

4663019

4663381
versioning	upgrade
netscape kind of comes to mind - you may want to read this ... you may want to come up with a strategy where you can gradually replace components and frameworks in your application in a way that leaves you free to release versioning upgrade so that each versioning has a little more c# and a little less c++ in it

4663399

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in firefox but not in google-chrome or safari so far i ve just tested on a mac

4663861
google-chrome	safari
the alert works in all browsers so there seems to be something preventing the window.open from executing in safari google-chrome

int	double
just to clarify string is never castable to double or int

accessor	properties
if you don t want to expose the properties you can make it private or whatever and test it using accessor

4664392

mockito + junit is a good combination.

4664442
junit	testng

in google-chrome safari when using the onchange property i get one line of correct data but then it proceeds to overwrite that data with zeros

4664810

4665034
libc	newlib
i have the newlib distribution from sources.redhat.com pub newlib newlib-1.18.0.tar.gz and after poking around i found syscalls.c in newlib-1.18.0 newlib libc sys arm which contains all of the stubs which i have to update but they re all filled in with rather finished looking code which does not seem to work without the crt0.s which itself does not work with my chip

4665034
libc	newlib
should i make a whole new folder in newlib libc sys with the name of my architecture and change the target to match

4665034

4665179
uiview	subviews
i have a piece of code in an iphone app which removes all subviews from a uiview subclass

4665179
getter	setter
the doc is clear on the semantics of copy for setter but doesnâ t appear to say either way for getter or at least itâ s not apparent to me

4665179
uiview	subviews
nsview is clearly returning a pointer to the actual array of subviews and perhaps uiview isnâ t

4665181
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and ie displays the image much smaller and google-chrome show nothing at all

4665260
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
use sudo when you try chown or chmod on files or directory you don t own

4665278
free	malloc
without having the code for your malloc it is not visible if your free would work

4665278
free	malloc
unless in your malloc function you re going through each and every memory address available to the process to check if it is not used by your dictionary merely the assignment would not free the memory and definitely not keep it for reuse

4665278
free	malloc
so with that malloc function no your free does not free the memory

4665278
free	malloc
first of all you re losing the address of the memory so every time you call this malloc you re actually pushing the process break a little further and never reuse free memory locations

4665278
free	malloc
one way to solve this is to somehow keep track of locations that you have free so that next time that malloc is called you can check if you have enough available memory already allocated to the process and then reuse those locations

4665301
xslt	xquery
problems of this kind are much more suited for xslt but it is also possible to solve them in xquery

4665306
min	max
time condition counter min avg max hourly trend

4665392
width	height
i tested on chrome it shows actual height width

4665393
getter	setter
setter releases the old value and retains or copies the new value. this first technique is stated to be more robust but suffers performance penalties on frequently called getter

4665393
getter	setter
the third technique is better for frequently called setter and getter

4665445
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the nsstring returned by md5hexdigest is autoreleased because nsmutablestring stringwithcapacity returns an autoreleased string

4665513
comparator	icomparer
just about all methods that take comparator types should also have an overload that allows you to specify an icomparer to use instead

4665520
getter	setter
the retain autorelease pair in the getter mean that the returned object will remain valid through the lifetime of the current function call technically until the autorelease pool is drained even if the setter is called

mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
in windows forms look at the mousedown mousemove and mouseup events on the control class

4665653
mousemove	mouseup
if you do not capture the mouse then you will not receive the mousemove or mouseup events if the mouse is released outside of the bounds of the control

4665653
move	drag
finally to determine the minimum distance the mouse should be allowed to move before starting the drag operation look at the systeminformation.dragsize property

4665732
inherited	properties
controls is actually a properties exposed by the control class and therefore the form class since it inherited from control and it represents a collection of all the controls that have been added to that particular instance of the form class

4665750
width	margin
the trick is matching the remainder columnâ s margin to the floated sidebarâ s width

4665752

the idea is when the code runs 5 checkbox appear and then once the user clicks on the submit button they get removed

4666870
button	checkbox
i dont know how to make each checkbox have its own identifier because after this issue i will need to identify them individually because i will need to add text to them from the database and then once the user has check a few button i will need to save this into a seperate table

vsto	add-in
i ve also checked the usual suspects cas policy pias installed loadbehavior in the registry reinstalling vsto and the add-in

4668777
vsto	add-in
thus the reason for not loading is not an exception in my add-in but rather a failure of vsto to load the add-in or of outlook to load vsto

4668777
vsto	add-in
instead of more random debugging try this... try that... i d really like to force outlook and or vsto to tell me what s wrong to give me a useful error message instead of just doing nothing when trying to enable the add-in

4670448
int	chars
what i want to ask is how to make sure the value is stored correctly when there s different data type like int and chars use interchangebly

4670846
prefuse	jung
3 this seems easy with both prefuse and jung

4670846
prefuse	jung
4 again both prefuse and jung provides support for user interaction

4670846

7 both jung and prefuse has multiple layout algorithms

4670846
prefuse	jung
but when i tried to display the same dataset using fruchtermanreingoldlayout in both jung and prefuse i get different displays

4670846
prefuse	jung
somehow the layout algorithms in prefuse seem to display a better layout than in jung rendering is also better i think though most of the layout algorithms in prefuse are based on jung implementation

4670846
prefuse	jung
outside of these requirements prefuse has good support for expressions and query language but looks like it is not actively developed unlike jung

4670862

most likely it s due to the ajax.beginform as that sets up an onclick and an onsubmit handler

4671934

i found the issue i had a property on my class that wasn t database backed and was marked as required in metadata so adding a getter and setter to return what the property represented caused the tryupdatemodel to pass but i am still curious as to why the explicit include of properties didn t ignore the field i hadn t included

4672150

that is ambiguous because a pointer is just an address so an int can also be treated as a pointer -- 0 an int can be converted to unsigned int or chars equally easily

4672219
int	chars	unsigned	short
the short answer is to call p.setval with something that s unambiguously one of the types it s implemented for unsigned int or chars

4672219
int	chars
p.setval 0u p.setval unsigned int 0 and p.setval chars 0 will all compile

this example works on firefox 3+ but in google-chrome the height of the body is set to automatically cover 100 of the height of the window

4672873
mxmlc	compc
if you have a really big package of classes you want to include but don t want to write out the class name for every class you can compile the package as a swc using the compc and the use the -include-libraries option of mxmlc to include the entire package

afaik jsf supports only post so if you want a get somewhere you have

4673212
std	ostream	ostream	istream
the first problem is that your sha_output_filter does not meet the requirements for using the non-const overload of push because it is not derived from std istream std ostream or std streambuf so it is not classified as a standard stream or stream buffer type

4673252

4673871
gridview	sqldatasource

4674004
client-side	server-side
client-side validation gives instant feedback - server-side validation does not

4674038
client-side	server-side
while server-side validation is a must client-side validation using javascript is definitely recommended

4674038

acs	adfs
i don t believe it is possible to have adfs rp-sts include a different acs url or acsindex in the authnrequest

4674246
acs	adfs
it seems possible to have adfs as the ip-sts send an assertion to more than 1 acs url based upon the acs url or acs index in the authnrequest as long as they are listed in the relaying party trust endpoints list

4674246
acs	adfs
however per the spec if the acs url is not listed and the sp is not signing the authnrequest then adfs should reject the authnrequest as non-compliant

wan	lan
you still have just your regular outside-facing ip lan or wan and your loopback 127.0.0.1

4674544
post	get
which works by simply issuing a potentially long get or a post and then google generate and serve the graph themselves

4674571
hash	salt
salt are are usually stored in plain text alongside the password hash

4674575
folder	directory
your program would be checking the directory and creating folder if they are missing

4674584
hash	salt
even if the attacker knows the way you compute the hash they have to brute force each salt and hash password -- which takes a lot of time for in general little reward

4674595
hash	salt
the salt is just there to prevent easy reversing of password hash - there should be a unique salt for each user but it s fine to store the salt in the same place as the hash password

4674601
viewdidload	viewwillappear
not sure if you are confusing viewdidload and viewwillappear here

4674767
width	height
in your case you need the image to be loaded so that the browser can properly detect its width and height

i would suggest trying to set the image s width and height inline so the browser doesn t have to wait to download the image though

4674769
xslt	xquery
xquery or xslt are much more suited to this kind of thing

4674787
hash	salt
a salt is a random value to prevent an attacker from just looking up the source of a hash in table generated based on common passwords

when the int result is then assigned to the variable postmt chars 2 it is at that point that the int 1 is converted to 1 note the space due to fixed-width char2

4674841
hash	salt
a salt should be a completely random string that s stored in a user record along with the password hash

4674841
hash	salt
rather than trying to use the password in the select query and see if you get any records you actually need to just select using the username user_id in order to get the password hash and salt so that you can then use those to determine if the user entered the correct password

4674887
punctuation	words
you may then need to loop over the words to pull out any punctuation

4674899

4676418
post	get
as i understand it struts2 action class instances can unlike struts1 be stateful because each get or post to an action creates a new instance of the backing action class

4676418
post	get
because the action is stateful and thus not shared across gets or post and each instance is instantiated just for that get or post the action has no way to know if a particular session has getted the same page multiple times

4676418
post	get
is there a less verbose way to do this to not validate input on the initial get but to validate on the post without having to have two actions for every form

4677463
mouseover	mouseout
there are examples here of a mouseover mouseout working exactly as you describe

4677470
post	get
don t worry about get or post they are just two different methods of sending data to an action if there are parameters regardless if they are get or set then struts2 will try to place that data onto the actions class assuming there is one

4677527
min	max
so i set the max value to 250 and the min value to 0

4677527
move	drag
the idea is that if i drag the scrollbar s button to the bottom 250 pixels will have move for the image right

it works just fine in portrait then when the ipad goes into landscape mode it works just fine as well

4677585
portrait	landscape
the problem is when i go back to portrait from landscape the page is over stretched meaning portions of the page go off the screen in portrait mode

4677604
int	chars
this is a real worry though this considers lpparam a chars then adds two bytes to it which probably positions it half way into the four bytes used by the int member of the struct assuming a 32 bit app then writes over the single chars at that address with a truncated value the least significant byte chars from the chars pointer to your new string incorporating correction thanks to chris s comment

4677614
nofollow	noindex
in addition no-cache seems to be senseless in a rotobs-metatag there should only be index follow noindex or nofollow or a combination of these like noindex follow

note by width i mean the height here i use width because by default bar charts are vertical and flex uses the width property

4677864
getter	setter
compiling property access requires knowing how to translate the property name into the correct getter setter name

4677864
getter	setter
without knowing the type of the receiver the compiler cannot possibly know what the getter setter is called as the property may have overridden the name as part of its declaration like so

4677977
post	get
that is your client will be able to upload files with the content they have gathered or they could just use http get post because you don t have to worry about ui issues you can handle everything probably through one action assuming an action based web framework

4677990

but in case anybody having a same query you can set width of maximum size property to the actual width of the form and the height of maximumsize to 0

4678496
min	max
the issue i have is when using two y-axes y1 and y2 wherein the y1 value is min max zero positive and the y2 value min max negative positive in such case the zero marking of y1 coincides with the max negative value of the y2 axis through the x-axis that is the problem since i want zero point of both y-axis to flush together

4678496
range	min	range	max	min	max
if i knew the value of min and max for both y-axes then this problem could be fixed easily but i only know whether the range starts from positive or negative value not the value itself

4680232
post	get
i also tried both get and post no difference

4680248
ienumerable	iqueryable
you could either change your items parameter to be an ienumerable rather than iqueryable or if that doesn t work create a variable in your method near the top

4680248
ienumerable	iqueryable
you will also have to change your return type from iqueryable to ienumerable

4680311
width	height
using only width means that the image will be scaled proportionally whereas if you set height as well as width the image is likely to be distorted

4680325

httpsqs http simple queue service message queue based on http get post protocol is probably the tool you re looking for

width	height
i have an image view with some default height and width images are stored in db and i want to scale image according to imageview height width

4680499

as i don t want it give default values because when ever i change it s height and width i also have to change it in code

4680499
width	height
i am trying to get the height and width of imageview but 0 is returned to me in both cases

4680499
width	height
this returns me 0 even it has default height and width

4680506
erd	diagram
however those links don t necessarily correspond to physical relationships like in an erd diagram but instead they represent logical connections

4680506
erd	diagram
the erd diagram on the other side is a persistence-specific diagram which display the entities tables existing in a most often relational database

4680506
erd	diagram
the erd diagram can sometimes look similar to the class diagram but that doesn t mean is the same as a class diagram

4680552
matplotlib	mplot3d
have you looked at mplot3d on matplotlib

4680556

google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code working fine on google-chrome and firefox but not working on ie

4680746
google-chrome	firefox
so here is what happens on google-chrome and firefox the output of the span .text for the position variables is correct starting at 0 0 and always showing how much of the content was scrolled in coordinates but on ie it starts on -2 -2 and never gets out of it even if i manually scroll the window until the end of it and try using the right arrow key it will still return the initial value of -2 -2 and scroll back to the beggining

4680746
move	drag
on another note i did other two navigating options for the user in this section of the site one is to click and drag anywhere on the screen to move it

4680746
google-chrome	firefox
the only part of this code i didn t write was the preventing text selection lines these ones i found in a tutorial about clicking and draging objects anyway this code works fine on google-chrome firefox and ie though on firefox and ie it s more often to happen some moviment glitches while you drag sometimes it seems the scrolling is a litlle jagged it s only a visual thing and not that much significant but if there s a way to prevent it i would like to know

4680814
spaces	linefeed
s matches any whitespace which is either a spaces a tab or a carriage return linefeed

4680847
int	double
should it work on int double numeric data type should it have some crazy data structures but it should not take too much memory

4680856
children	parent
but ie ignore children s width to resize the parent s one

4680863
free	malloc
however keep in mind that you must not use malloc and free now - use new and delete instead

4680881
free	malloc
use new delete instead of malloc free

4680918

increasing height width of an image means one of two things

4680927

4681180
width	height
because if not the easiest thing is to set the height and width in the #header #postanad style

4681194
width	height
the w3c specification says that the width and height are implied and not required

4681241
width	height
in my experience not supplying width and height tags will cause the browser to render the image at its original size

4681250
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately it is impossible to specify a customized google-chrome profile with selenium 1 but it is possible to do for firefox in selenium 1 or move to selenium 2 webdriver - see this thread for more information

4681275
width	height
for example if the image you are adding is a banner ad which needs to conform to predetermined height width then by all means hard code the height and width

4681275
width	height
but if the image is something that might change over time i would suggest not coding the height and width as more than likely this means that the new image if not the same exact height width as the old one will now be distorted

4681301
width	height
replace the normal xml with the following code be sure to adjust the width and height accordingly

4681304
postgresql	mysql
it s probably fine for a prototype but you probably want to consider persisting these settings in mysql postgresql mongo etc

4681306
post	get
ok i saw many post on how to serialize the value of dragged items to get hash and they tell how to save them

4681316
textview	imageview
i don t know what s special about the id summary but if you change your ids so that the textview is say +id s and the imageview is say +id s_btn and change the references in the imageview to id s of course then it seems to work

4681338

some of your literals are int use 100.0 100.0 + 20.0 + price to get double precision arithmetic

class.forname throws classnotfoundexception while class.newinstance throws instantiationexception illegalaccessexception hence why you need to throw throwable

4681485
vsto	add-in
given your familiarity with c# i would recommend you look at add-in express costs and excel dna free as well as vsto

4681495
width	height
if you didn t specify an image size the whole page s rendering would get paused or a full-page refresh would get pulled once the image was downloaded and parsed for height width

4681524

4681571
width	height
each of the telerik skins actually have a minimum height and width setting for the radcalendar in order to ensure that the visual styles of the control are not broken

4681571

4681755
getter	setter
i found out that using an entitycollection see list release.releasedescription is not a good idea so in the partial class release i made an extra property releasedescriptionlist which transforms this entitycollection into a through the getter it has no setter

4682191
google-chrome	firefox
the following regular expression works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie7

4682207

i think it should be done using an protected or public abstract static field.

4682228
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
problem has been verified in google-chrome and firefox probably also in safari

4682228
hide	show
the reason for using hide and show instead of hardcoded units in pixels is that i can t foresee the total width of the elements as there can be multiple menu list items with different text length

4682230
put	get
so you have to put all those inside another object which can get awkward

the css way would be to declare a width and height

this does not really have anything to do with the question but you should always escape data you get through get and post before putting it into query

4682573
instantiationexception	classnotfoundexception
in your example should the client that wants to create a rook know and understand the instantiationexception illegalaccessexception and classnotfoundexception thrown by your reflection code

4682573
instantiationexception	classnotfoundexception
in your example you were doing reflection and this can go wrong in many ways the api declares linkageerror exceptionininitializererror classnotfoundexception illegalaccessexception instantiationexception and securityexception

4682608
getter	setter
based on the comments from the question i d say that you should have a in your java class without a setter only a getter

4682609
feedback	review
most libraries are pretty well tested and designed they generally get a reasonably sound review by some excellent programmers compared to by people with home-brew solutions in the same problem space and widely used enough to gather extensive real-world feedback

4682656
gdal	ogr
if not then you need to reproject your data using an appropriate ellipsoid in which case you re going to want to use an actual projection library everything uses proj4 behind the scenes these days such as the python bindings to gdal ogr or the much more friendly pyproj

4682774

now if you -really- need a form that works like they do on the internet - you d have to create an unbound form - then create a submit button with vba code that takes the text boxes you have on the form and inserts them into the table in your database clearing your fields after submission to allow for the entry of your next record

fadein	fadeout
i am trying to implement a fadeout effect in jquery for a div block and then fadein effect on two other div blocks

4683121
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however these effects are only working in the google-chrome browser they won t work in safari firefox opera which is rather perplexing to me

4683121
fadein	fadeout
so when a div tag with the id of videothumbnail_xyz is clicked it starts the fadeout and fadein calls on the other div tags

4683123
accessor	properties
it does not respond to contentscalefactor because contentscalefactor is a properties with the following accessor

4683124
versioning	upgrade
by request a restored link to the d6 to d7 upgrade flowchart -- the original versioning from the first post was redone by an actual designer for a d7 upgrade podcast and now looks less like a tangle of snakes

4683137
google-chrome	firefox
i have implemented swfaddress 2.4 it works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox on mac

4683142
folder	directory
i apologize for the confusion when i say target directory i mean the source folder containing all the files i want to process

4683142
folder	directory
a part of the function of my program is to copy the directory structure of the source directory to a destination directory and copy all valid files to that destination directory preserving the directory structure of the original source directory a user may copy folder containing files to the source directory

4683142
folder	directory
i want to prevent errors by ensuring that if a new set of folder containing more subfolders and files is copied to the source directory for processing my program will not start operating on the target directory until the copy process has completed

4683169
fadein	fadeout
also you might consider putting the fadein calls in the callback function of your fadeout so if you decide to change the duration later on you only have to change it in one place

4683181
int	double
this means that you if you stick with double values you get perfectly good int with a little more than 50 bits giving you about +- 4 500 000 000 000 000 or 4.5 quadrillion

4683337
circuit	nor
first i would like to test my circuit works or nor

4683350
crypt	salt
according to the crypt documentation the salt needs to be 22 base 64 digits from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z

4683350
hash	salt
i would be able to read the salt back out of the generated hash

4683350
hash	salt
question #3 also is it a good idea to read the salt out of the hash when it is time to check passwords

4683350
hash	salt
which seems redundant since the salt seems to be included in the hash

4683354
children	parent
if the parent doesn t have a default constructor neither can its immediate children

4683357
google-chrome	firefox
apologies on not actually looking at firefox google-chrome last time

4683374
ord	chr
you need to import data.char to get the ord and chr functions

4683392
int	chars
can anyone give me some insight into how these primary keys are being generate i believe it s a combination of iterating int date and static chars

4683434
onfocus	onblur
i think you want to get rid of the onblur and instead make it onfocus so the background changes when they enter the box

4683436
getter	setter
it does not seem correct to have setter and getter for last purchase date and last purchased by in product.java model

4683437
daemon	cron
i can t seem to find anywhere that the cron daemon was logging it s errors

4683471
igraph	networkx
you can get the source for networkx here and the source for igraph here

4683514
visualvm	btrace
nominally it is console application but there is integration into visualvm making the experience of working with btrace more pleasant

4683539
for-loop	arrays
each number is the upper limit of a for-loop for example if the arrays is the following code should be executed

4683588
google-chrome	safari
tested and works in fx 3.6 safari 5 and google-chrome

4683618
doc	rtf
i need a library to extract text from documents doc doxc pdf html rtf odt.....

4683625
google-chrome	safari
however in safari and google-chrome webkit browsers the validation message does not appear disappear until the dropdown loses focus

4683666
getter	setter
and then in the contacts backing bean you only need to make and a property of the contact with appropriate getter and setter

4683734
width	height
uimodalpresentationpagesheet the modal view occupies the full screen height but the width is set to the width of the screen in portrait mode

4683734
width	height
uimodalpresentationformsheet both the width and height of the modal view are set to be smaller than the screen size

4683767
hash	salt
regarding your third question yes you should read and check the hash using the embedded salt and cost parameters from the hash itself

4683787
x86	64bit
it looks like it s because you have a 64bit os and you re running a 32-bit x86 application which is handled by windows windows on windows wow feature

4683837
spyware	antivirus
i expect your app will get caught by various spyware antivirus software as a keyboard logger though

4683862
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
but if outlook 2003 machine having add-in installed gets upgrade to outlook 2007 and then if i install add-in for 2007 that result in dual installation neither previous versioning gets uninstalled nor new installation fails and the new versioning also gets installed.i can varify that from add remove programs

4683905
dictionary	map
you have to map the name to a destination from the document catalog s dests entry which is a dictionary that contains a name tree

4683905
dictionary	map
a name tree is essentially a tree map that allows fast access to named values without requiring to read all the data at once as with a plain dictionary

4683937
getter	setter
so i know there are a lot of questions on getter and setter in general but i couldn t find something exactly like my question

4683937
getter	setter
i started learning with c++ and was taught to use getter and setter

4683937
getter	setter
because of this and possibly other reasons we use getter and setter

4683937
getter	setter
also in python it is considered pythonic to not use getter setter and to only put things into properties if needed

4683937
getter	setter
would you use getter and setter for all languages

4683937
getter	setter
for my purposes i am only referring to simple getter and setter just return set the value and do not do anything else

4683972
getter	setter
so if you don t need a setter getter because some language feature allows you to do exactly the same then i really cannot see why you wouldn t want to use the language feature

4683991
getter	setter
i don t generally use getter setter because the presence of them indicates that my class isn t doing enough to be alive

4683997
temp	tmp
you have to use xp_cmdshell or some clr not sure of permissions to read the environment variables temp or tmp

4684032
for-loop	arrays
i m using a for-loop to append an m on to a string arrays then passing each string to a dde connection to download a stock quote

4684036
getter	setter
getter and setter property is just getter + setter allow for better encapsulation checking validity only getter not setter

4684036
getter	setter
in modern efficient languages like c++ there is inlining so there is no performance cost for simple getter setter

4684036
getter	setter
point is use public fields for structural and simple small-scale programming use getter and setter for large-scale oop projects

4684047
coalesce	nvl
i agree with the other posters that the better way to do this is to use nvl or coalesce

4684048
viewmodel	caliburn
i m now porting the application over to mvvm caliburn micro and am now at the point where i have my objects in my viewmodel and need to draw them on the canvas in the view

4684062
rss	feed
how to get rss feed android

4684063
getter	setter
so getter and setter are always important in every language

4684063
getter	setter
properties are getter and setter in a nice layout because it looks like a variable and does some extra checks if needed

4684066
octal	hex
this will also allow you to specify whether you want to allow octal and hex notation of integers

4684067
getter	setter
for example i recently needed a getter and setter in c++ when abstracting a text object

4684067
getter	setter
while i agree that getter and setter over certain kinds of class are pointless there are some cases in which they are necessary

4684067
getter	setter
defining a property over a variable is just a getter and setter with syntactic sugar and while i support syntactic sugar it doesn t change the encapsulation

4684076
matlab	simulink
what is the meaning of legacy-code in matlab simulink

4684081
put	get
now my problem is how or where do i put the value under rel attribute in my javascript to get the same result

4684122
width	height
you may also want to keep other info in the image table as well for instance which user the image belongs to and which is the main image width height etc

4684131
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried this in google-chrome and it works fine haven t tested firefox

4684167
opera	firefox
now this works fine in windows + ie firefox opera etc but for macos i get complains

4684172
mouseover	mouseenter
i think the question is how do you tell what the hover color would be without the users actually hovering - sending mouseenter and mouseover events to the element doesn t trigger the browser hover state

4684181
decimal	ieee
recognizing this the ieee 754-2008 standard for floating-point arithmetic specifies decimal floating-point encodings and arithmetic

4684181
decimal	ieee
this technical report specifies extensions to the international standard for the c++ programming language to permit the use of decimal arithmetic in a manner consistent with the ieee 754-2008 standard.

4684181
decimal	ieee
yes the three decimal encoding formats defined in ieee 754-2008 correspond to the three decimal floating types std decimal decimal32 64 and 128

4684199
hide	show
i have a showcontent function which show hide content

4684225
backgrounding	multitasking
backgrounding multitasking is enabled in this app

4684225
backgrounding	multitasking
however on 3.1.2 since backgrounding multitasking is not supported the app is always launched from scratch

4684251
int	boolean
int boolean and string

4684261
unix	solaris
i will be running this on a solaris 10 server but i believe any unix system should work similar

4684264
cells	tablecell
each tablecell has 1 image that is loaded through jsondeserizer that has a valid link http for the picture and the picture is downloaded and then displayed in that specific cells

4684271
superclass	subclassing
since it s a class cluster meaning nsnumber is an abstract superclass of a lot of subclassing you ll have to declare your own storage if you subclassing it

4684304
google-chrome	firefox
this works okay in firefox but it has problems in google-chrome the image does not always resize it somehow depends on the size of the window when the page was loaded

4684304
width	height
this also works okay in safari but sometimes the image is loaded with its minimum width height

4684309
getter	setter
actually getter and setter as well as public properties hiding these are very little improvement over public variables and a pretty good indicator for quasi classes

4684373
fast-forward	merge
ultimately fast-forward means that the commits can be applied directly on top of the working tree without requiring a merge

4684384
google-chrome	safari
this is the css solution i just add a style width 100 and works for me at least in google-chrome and safari

4684394
mouse	keyboard
it fires anytime the user selects another node either by keyboard or mouse

4684404
fast-forward	merge
git cannot make changes on the remote like a fast-forward merge which a visual git reference illustrates like

4684404
pull	push
see for instance this so question git pull says up-to-date but git push rejects non-fast forward

4684411
width	height
- normal xaml to set the external height and width of the webbrowser

4684411
width	height
- some header tags to achieve some fixing of the web-browser s client height and width - see including the comments at the bottom

4684440
pugixml	rapidxml
i know of at least three light weight c++ xml parsers rapidxml tinyxml and pugixml

4684452
integer	unsigned
it is a typedef for an unsigned integer

4684462
maven	pom.xml
what i could really use right now is a sequence diagram for how maven does a build relating how the pom.xml elements get executed during the build

4684475
hide	show
ok basically i made 2 functions show tooltip and hide tooltip and it can get ajax config or simple config i just show you

4684480
getter	setter
you re right - no need for simple getter and setter in modern matlab oop

4684480
getter	setter
in the new mcos matlab classes the syntax for accessing a class property is the same whether you define custom getter setter or not

4684480
getter	setter
the ubiquity of user-defined getter and setter in java is partially because the language lacks these features

4684480
getter	setter
in old-style matlab classes the inverse is true all fields are private so you must write your own getter setter

4684484
post	get
but it s more common to use the curl library to perform get and post call

4684489
hash	md5
another benefit is the use of md5 hash for the filenames of compiled javascript allowing you to set never expires cache headers for all of your code

4684501
hash	salt
takes the initial hash of the block with the block counter in binary appended to the salt

4684532
width	height
in ie onresize event gets fired on every pixel change width or height so there could be performance issue

4684536
getter	setter
through properties python provides consistency of access using the natural direct-access syntax as well as the ability to add functionality to data member access though hidden getter and setter

4684551
hide	show
with some css classes defined to hide the things you do not want to show just yet

4684559
unsigned	short
edit this follows the discussions for why don t short circuit when the operands are unsigned ints and x is zero

4684565
cvs	svn
with cvs the predecessor to svn there was a .cvsignore file

4684568
move	drag
i have some divs that i clone and can drag and drop in a area now i want to connect by lines the divs and if i move the divs this lines must move too

4684590
put	get
get the data into excel that s usually easy assuming you get column a with prdsize and column b with prdcode in column c put the formula

4684628
accessor	properties
properties accessor categoryname on object nhibernatewebtest.database.person threw the following exception could not initialize proxy - the owning session was closed.

4684636
getter	setter
what i want to do here is to build a generic getmethod that uses field attributes values to fetch the data from the database _underlyingobject and just fill out the getter and setter for me.e.g

4684643
uitableview	nsindexpath
i would strongly discourage you from using this format to create an nsindexpath that s intended for use in a uitableview

4684690
post	get
but in my commentcontroller when i get the posted comment object it comes with cero 0 as a postid so i can t bind it with it s corresponding post

4684717
gif	png
create a transparent gif or png that has a diagonal line running from one corner to another

4684723
nsscanner	nsmutablestring
if you re operating on an nsmutablestring you can then replace the entity with its replacement and continue searching after modifying your location in the case of nsscanner or range appropriately to account for the length difference between the entity and the replacement character

4684767
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to be the strictest but maybe in the html5 features firefox is also as strict

4684771
hide	show
you can of course show it before making the request and hide it after it completes

4684782
folder	dir
with svn you can t add stuff under a folder that is not under version control without adding the root dir

4684782
folder	directory
would ignore any xml files not under version control under the folder directory

4684787
int	boolean
that is you cannot use primitives or basic object types like string int boolean etc

4684799
put	get
one simple way to optimize this is to put a cron script that will run once per day hour to prefill the caches so you will get fast sp

4684802
post	get	post	put	put	get
i will get the data to be uploaded instead with multiple requests and put in base64 data in one of the post parameters

4684821
min	max
maybe store a min max average of x runs if you want to consolidate it

4684833
komodo	notepad++
hi all i use many text editors but mainly notepad++ and i search for functionality similar to komodo edit

4684858
lisp	scheme
i wrote it in scheme which probably won t be immediately translatable to common lisp so i don t feel that it d be a complete giveaway

4684893
getter	setter
if it s predefined why can t you use a getter setter method and proxy access to private var that way

4684911
getter	setter
unless you re planning on instantiating your foo-object through some data repository retrieval method this would require dynamic compilation to inject the necessary into your getter and setter

4684925
width	height
am having one small bar width 50 height 10

4684950
google-chrome	firefox
works for me in google-chrome and firefox

4684975
width	height
the affect i am going for is that the image is always centered and cannot be zoomed out more than the width or height of the image

4684975
portrait	landscape
right now this works fine in portrait mode but when it is switched to landscape the zoom scales are incorrect

4685018
octal	binary
006 octal is 110 in binary so it basically takes the mode bit vector and leaves only bits in 2 3 positions

4685019
textview	imageview
in this instance the textview would be drawn on top of the imageview along the bottom center of the image

4685066
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
the following code in php shows how you can detect if a request is html or xhr request parameter is available in at least ie8 ff3 safari opera google-chrome

4685069
perl	tcl
like c perl tcl java.

4685084
hash	md5
md5 hash based names for the compiled javascript means for great caching

4685089
viewmodel	caliburn
commenting out my canvas object in the viewmodel prevents the error so i m guessing caliburn is trying to map it and raising the error

4685095
mouse	keyboard
is it possible for the datagrid to automatically enter edit mode when the user starts typing on the keyboard without having to hit f2 or double-click with the mouse first

4685118

post	get
i am working with a jsf application that post on every mouse click so if you get 5 pages deep your url stays the same

4685201
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason when i load the page in firefox it hangs works great on ie google-chrome though

4685235
vpn	lan
then i just ask my client to connect over the appropriate port 5900 calls the built-in vnc server for high rez use on the lan 5905 calls vine server for screen update speed over vpn

4685283
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
code that runs fine on safari and opera shows unexpected but reproducible results in google-chrome latest production version 8.0.552.237

4685324
post	get
i dont know if ive got it right but as much as i understood it you need to use get instead of post this time right

4685350
width	height
where width and height in this blurp are the new width and height to be applied

4685396
min	max
i like storing the average of ten runs but instead of storing just the average i d also store the max and min values so that i can get a feel for the spread of the data in addition to its center

4685396
min	max
the max and min information in particular will tell you how often corner cases arise

4685408
google-chrome	firefox
but it does so just in firefox if i try google-chrome it alters the url the slider works but the screen jumps up to the top of the slider container

4685430
post	put
it put up a post about it here

4685445
titlebar	window
as long as you re willing to redraw the entire title-bar contents then you can use the dwm api s dwmextendframeintoclientarea method which involves setting your window to have no titlebar allowing the dwm to draw its glass into your usable area to create a new space that looks like the titlebar but is in fact in your client area so that you can draw buttons onto it

4685456
qsignalmapper	qobject
qsignalmapper is meant for parameterless signals and to relate them with integer id s or pointers to qobject

4685503
width	height
resizes an image scaling down or up to the given width and height

4685503
width	height
if both the width and the height arguments are provided the transform uses the dimension that results in a smaller image

4685503
width	height
just specify the width and the height will be transformed into the appropriate value to maintain the aspect ratio of the original image

4685513
int	double
if you get the values from elsewhere you can use double to turn the int into a double

4685555
post	get
a web service is just an http call get or post so that will always work

4685555
post	get
also lv 6.1 does not have http get post built-in so i used to use winhttp via activex as in the above to perform those actions.

4685570
post	get
this old post shows a way you can wrap your calls to php scripts and get a pid for each process

4685585
perforce	svn
in my opinion reason#1 for selecting between svn and perforce is cost

4685590
memcached	apc
but you have as well the session storage and application caches like memcached or apc

4685605
profiling	debugging
there are a number of techniques available from testing via multiple browser s plugins profiling to inline debugging performance statements

4685633

4685763
punctuation	words
decide whether or not to junk them or try to convert them in the case of words smart punctuation characters

4685763
lxml	beautifulsoup
you could use offline scripting with beautifulsoup or if your html s a bit nicer the faster lxml to pre-process your data set extract those implicit fields and save them into an implicit format

4685763
put	get
the migrate module is excellent but to get really good data fidelity and play more clever tricks you might need to learn about its hook system drupal s terminology for functions following a particular naming scheme and the basics of writing a module to put these hooks in a module is broadly just a php file where all the functions begin with the same text the name of the module file.

4685801
width	margin
the 1st option only seems to affect the width of the visible right margin in the editor the 2nd option affects the wrap width of the auto-formatter

4685813

4685922
folder	directory
this will checkout your repository but without any folder in the working directory

4685922
folder	directory
if you don t mind a bunch of empty folder in your working directory you could use immediates instead of empty

but it looks like contentcontrol s don t inherited the foreground properties from their parent so that doesn t seem to work even if i retemplate the contentcontrol to remove the explicit foreground properties setter

4685960
put	get
if i put the msvcr90.dll msvcr90.dll msvcp90.dll in the same folder as my executable i still get the sidebyside error dependent assembly microsoft.vc90.crt could not be found error .

therefore when someone switches from portrait to landscape i still get the values for portrait and therefore cannot resize correctly

4686240
integer	unsigned
there is no format specifier for size_t in c++03 you have to cast to the largest unsigned integer type you can and print that

i ve seen that pointy had a good point but he deleted his answer you probably want for fadeout load fadein to occur one after another

4686687
button	checkbox
since each link has only one property you probably want radio button not checkbox

4686693
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
the thing that makes setinterval different than settimeout is that setinterval runs repetitively until you tell it to stop using clearinterval

4686723
width	height
note that setting the width and height as xul attributes affects the outer width and height of the window

4686723
width	height

i don t know which spans you want to hide or show so i just assume you are going to toggle the visibility of one group

4687054

if you are going to get the span elements only once like i did then you have to put the script after the content before the closing tag

4687069
bash	zsh
instead it made a file that can be executed in a bash zsh shell

4687070
children	parent
i ve also tried changing all three element nodes to nillable false -- which works fine for detecting an empty parent node but results in both children becoming required nodes instead of remaining optional

4687073
jar	war
but still the jar was not included in the final war thus jetty was not happy and won t load the app

4687074
google-chrome	firefox
as far as working out the rendering issue or maybe some messy overlooked css for example you might consider using something like firebug or google-chrome s developer tools or firebug lite for browsers other than firefox and google-chrome - it lets you inspect the document structure and elements select elements and see which css rules are applied to them and visually inspect the box model

4687096
button	checkbox

4687180
getter	setter
i found the answer some of the getter and setter on the superclasses were marked final

4687180
getter	setter
so the solution is to remove final from any getter and setter in mapped superclasses

4687180
getter	setter
here are the getter and setter that were defined on secureddataobject

4687180
getter	setter
so in summary don t mark your getter and setter as final if hibernate might try to proxy them

4687669
post	get
some people might prefer the idiom you are pointing out and it has a long history - i remember doing some pelr cgi pages in that way centuries ago use a single url and hence a single action mapping for the two steps show the initial form and process the form by guessing inside the action method or in the validator the current step perhaps by checking that some parameter is present perhaps a hidden field or perhaps by discriminating post get

4687698
portrait	landscape
i found plenty of documentation that says the startup images for the ipad should like the iphone ipod touch have the 20px shaved from the height to accommodate for the status bar giving resolutions of 768x1004 portrait or 1024x748 landscape

btw the arrays above are iterated inside a for-loop

4689522
realloc	malloc
your second realloc for allocating new rows should be malloc instead

hash	md5
if you mean the md5 hash of the password what is known is if you give same string and calculate the md5 hash it they will produce the same results

4689536
hash	md5
but if you are asking for the relation between the string and the generated output then the best answer is the algorithm which is followed to calculate the md5 hash and as you are see it is pretty complicated as operates at the bit level to produce the final output

another possibility could be to create an invisible nstextview and delegate each key press to it and then display the nstextstorage associated with it in your own view

4689933
getter	setter
ideally you shouldn t use either you should use getter setter methods

4689948
getter	setter
finally public members should not expose the underlying implementation you should not provide access to members even via getter setter

i believe that should show hide by itself

4690184
maven	m2e	ant	maven
i am currently migrating our build process from eclipse ant to maven m2e artifactory

4690184
maven	m2e
i have migrated it to maven with m2e

4690184
maven	pom.xml
i could deactivate this in the build path and add each corresponding dependency in my pom.xml but i m afraid this would lead maven to deploy them again in my webapp web-inf libs

4690216
inherited	properties
you can write your own typeconverter which does not inherited from expandableobjectconverter and set it as an attribute on your properties to remove the +

4690283
put	get
put the logout url as the image source and it will go off and get it

4690283

4690384
udp	rtp
i have been told to use udp and rtp protocol but due to my lack knowledge of media streaming i couldn t make it work

4690384
udp	rtp
what is relationship between udp and rtp and steps needed for server to listen accept and handle packet transfer between client to client

4690407
division	modulo
the modulo should find the remainder of division of a number by another

4690411
udp	rtp	udp	tcp
rtp generally runs on top of udp to get away from tcp s streaming behavior tcp always delivers data in-order which is not optimal for real-time applications

4690420
uiview	subviews
uiview retains its subviews so when you call -removefromsuperview method then your view object is released

4690425
post	get
calendar post to server to get events

4690445
int	chars
this is an artefact of your compiler s chars type being a signed int type and int being a wider signed int type and thus the chars constant is considered a negative number and is sign-extended to the wider int type

4690445
int	chars
use an unsigned chars to be extended to an int to avoid the negative int value or open a whole new pandora s box and enjoy wchar

4690449
sharepoint	spsite
with sharepoint 2007 spsite s belong to spwebapplications which are associated with an ssp which store the user profile properties

4690462
ubuntu	debian
i have some directions for using rvm with ubuntu sorry not debian but it s close

4690462
jobs	cron
i think rvm gives you some scripts you can use to run ruby scripts with init scripts and cron jobs

4690466
getter	setter
and how does one construct the params since drageventargs has only an empty constructor and its key properties are just getter not setter

4690489
getter	setter
how would i name the getter and setter

4690536
mayavi	matplotlib
in 3 dimensions i suggest using mayavi instead of matplotlib

4690538
telerik	radcombobox
most of the features are supported i think some by integrating other telerik controls in the grid like radcombobox with auto-complete for the rest you should count on your custom coding

4690545
int	double
i m trying to convert a double to float as well as various int types inside a dll which is used as a game maker extension

4690560
nunit	mstest
i also firstly had experience with nunit and later moved to mstest

4690583
postgresql	mysql
i d start with an alternative postgresql but not because of scaling issues but because mysql s support for transactions and referential integrity is worthless

4690613
udp	rtp
as unwind said generally rtp runs on top of udp

4690618
folder	directory
if i just backup the public_html folder will my mysql database info be stored in that directory

4690646

when editing is triggered i hide my displayview and show my editorview

4690653
folder	directory
for now it copies the binaries to a directory in user s home folder

4690715
folder	directory
if i just backup the public_html folder will my mysql database info be stored in that directory

4690804
getter	setter
but the abundance of great refactoring-enabled ides like eclipse and intellij will allow you to easily change field-accessed properties to getter setter access and plenty more

4690804
getter	setter
if you are writing a program that is going to be used by other developers say using version control like cvs then it would be best to stick to writing nicely encapsulated getter setter style classes to avoid unnecessary refactoring causing lots for silly merge conflicts in advance

4690874
hide	show
it will be better to show and hide the flash object rather than crating and destroying

4690885
noclassdeffounderror	nosuchmethoderror	noclassdeffounderror	verifyerror	nosuchmethoderror	verifyerror

you can use the complete statistical power of r using rjava jri

4691009
apache	nginx
for reasons i wont go into not using webservers like apache nginx etc would be preferred

your best bet is to lzma rar zip it up and use scp ssh ssl ftp or mount and unmount ssh file systems sshfs should be possible with cygwin

4691097
range	minimum
i would like to know the minimum and maximum range of accelerometer in android

4691105
google-chrome	firefox
the following example works in ie7 ie8 firefox google-chrome it will not work for ie6 and probably more browsers

4691109
pull	push
in the visit method for simpler objects like your tastbooleanconstant you would call the appropriate method in this case fbuilder.createconstant with values that you pull from the object and push the result of that method onto the visitor s stack

4691123
move	drag	mouseup	mousedown
an example would be a click on windows xp click is mousedown and mouseup event however if you use your finger instead of the mouse you might get a drag motion instead of the click as when you press mousedown you finger might slightly move to the side from the initial position and you will get a drag instead of click

4691166
treemap	linkedhashmap
why not hashmap treemap or linkedhashmap

4691184
int	chars
but when you use it as int with isalpha etc. and the ascii code is greater then 127 then the chars interpret as signed chars and isalpha return an exception

4691184
int	chars
when i need use the chars as int i cast the chars to unsigned

4691187
accessor	properties
you are assigning to the instance variable directly bypassing the properties accessor

4691191
trie	tree
the reason is that a trie is a specialized search tree for sub string search

4691200
accessor	properties
this means that the synthesized properties accessor messages will include an automatic retain when the message is called but only when the message is called see next

4691200
accessor	properties
this is because you are not using the properties accessor message you are just assigning to the member variable

4691200
accessor	properties
+1 for the init not using the properties accessor message so no extra retain

4691206
mvp	presenter
do i need to put some some code to presenter to keep my project as mvp

4691206
mvp	presenter
so once again - do i need to put some some code to presenter to keep my project as mvp

4691221
draggable	droppable
to be able to do this you can t use the built-in accept option because that will not trigger the drop event for the current droppable if the draggable is not accepter and will therefor propagate into the parent droppable

4691225
maven	cobertura
also we run the maven install with cobertura which means that the unit tests are run twice

4691227
uiview	subviews
this is because uiview claims ownership of its subviews

4691232
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
simply delete your uinavigationbar category and implement your own uinavigationcontroller

4691256
range	min	range	max	min	max

4691263
rss	feed
as part of our app user can save some data as xml on server which becomes rss feed for them

4691275
mouseup	mousedown
my example below deals with a single line-drawing operation from mousedown to mouseup

4691286
pull	push
now i am aware that mercurial supports the concept of subrepositories but that doesn t seem like the correct solution as it doesn t actually pull in the lib directory like i wanted as you ll still have to pull and push changes manually

4691298
junit	testng
i know support exists for running junit or testng test suites in parallel but it requires specific configuration such as specifying thread counts for example and most importantly do not prevent race conditions in non-thread-safe code

4691328
pull	push
as for still have to pull and push manually when you pull your main clone it ll pull the subrepos as well but it won t update them to a newer revision which is a good thing you need to do that manually just as you should with subversion

4691405
public	protected
i have a public function which triggers 2 protected methods

4691432
inherited	subclassing
if you are using inherited like vehicle with two subclassing - boat and car then you can have a different field in each subclassing - after all each of these enums is relevant only to the particular type

4691436
int	double	int	chars
the implementation of writevalue have to recognize the built in types and treat them accordingly that s typical things like string chars int double datetime etc

4691469
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox google-chrome and ie7

4691478
folder	dir
the return value will be an array with data pertaining to dated folder which you don t need but you can get the base uploads dir name out of there and then use the info to create your own ticker_data folder to store your data in

4691490
getter	setter
assuming that your selectedemployees property has a getter and a setter then the binding will work two way by default

4691490
getter	setter
therefore all you should need to do is make sure you re implementing inotifypropertychanged on your business object or as a wrapper property on your view model and in your selectedemployees setter do your ordering of the input and set the backing field to this ordered value and invoke the propertychanged event to invalidate the binding and have the ui pick up the updated sorted value via the selectedemployees getter

4691495
hash	salt
that is if we assume that inverting one hash value is doable then the salt makes sure that at least the attacker will have to pay the full cpu cost of a dictionary attack each time and he won t be able to share his cost across several attacks or with other attackers

4691499
outputstream	inputstream
an important thing to know about i o in java is that streams inputstream and outputstream etc. are used for reading and writing binary data you read or write bytes exactly as they are in the file and readers and writers reader and writer etc. are for reading and writing characters

4691502
listview	gridview
in visual studio 2010 create a visual webpart and use the standard asp.net listview or gridview on it

4691538
put	get
there is a method called clearregion string region but that required me to specify a region name on all get put add-methods i use which would require some manual error-prone work

4691549
roxygen	manual
roxygen support for literate programming very handy at package development to automatically generate rd files manual from inline comments

4691611
rvm	bundler
why should i care about rvm s gemset feature when i use bundler

one problem i faced was that safari google-chrome webkit browsers apparently fire the iframe s onload event too early ndash

4691760
getter	setter
i don t really like getter setter for reasons that i won t go into here

4691760
getter	setter
however since you ve asked about them my answer will assume that i use getter setter

4691761
bison	lemon
list of popular tools includes tools that generates parser on different programming languages antlr bison + lex lemon + ragel

4691789
post	put
i can t post the whole solution because it s not ready yet i ll put a zip file if that can help

4691816
versioning	upgrade
inside of this folder you will put your install or upgrade script based on the versioning number of your module such as mysql4-install-0.1.0.php

4691896
getter	setter
best you can do is set it in the constructor you cannot make changes within automatic properties you will need a backing field and implement the setter getter yourself otherwise

4691928
post	put
at this point i could use a reference to a relevant section of a book a link to a relevant post or even just the correct terms to put into a google search

4692011

i found this post which describes the usual way but i don t get how i can override my views layoutsubviews method as the view is just a property of my uiviewcontroller

4692025
put	get
and when i build it i get this but then when i put it in the web i get this

4692057
hide	show
if you re insisting on the sliding behavior i found it best to just animate the navigation bar and hide show the statusbar without any animation

4692074
width	height
since in the actual page error #2124 is centered over the loading symbol it looks to me like either that is the only text that actually ends up in error_txt or the dynamic text s width and height are being changed so that error #2124 is all that fits

4692079
accessor	properties
do i need to declare temp release in dealloc method even though i am not using the properties accessor method in my program at all

4692079
accessor	properties
will that create memory leak as i am releasing something which i haven t retained as i am not calling properties accessor method

4692100
versioning	upgrade
when i bring up a basic image of debian lenny on ec2 actually emr on ec2 i get lenny versioning 5.0.7 and i am able to upgrade r using the method outlined in a previous question

4692170
int	chars
use looping to check each chars in turn is chars int or dash

4692175
accessor	properties
the accessor method created at runtime releases the object first so for me and quite a few other devs this is a better safer way of cleaning up declared properties in our dealloc

4692239
phpmyadmin	heidisql
have you looked into heidisql or phpmyadmin

4692251
ati	nvidia
some systems in use windows directx 3d nvidia cards unknown if replicates on ati using overlapped io for streaming

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in firefox safari and google-chrome but ie 8 - haven t tried others bails out

4692649
free	malloc
you need to use malloc to allocate an array and then free it after you use it

4692666
metaclass	isinstance
you could easily create a metaclass in python that lets you create nested classes that live inside of an instance you can even make it produce proper bound and unbound class proxies that support isinstance correctly through the use of __subclasscheck__ and __instancecheck__

4692671
free	malloc
if you want to use my suggestion above you ll need either to use malloc and free or else declare instead such that the space is allocated

4692679
superclass	subclassing
and also the subclassing contains something about regeneration of the superclass

4692683
equals	gethashcode
if you create your own class you can override equals and gethashcode instead of creating an iequalitycomparer

4692700
free	malloc
the large object heap works like a regular malloc free heap

4692845
getter	setter
my response the data class is a simple pojo and will work like other pojos with setter and getter

4692850
button	checkbox
a couple of things - first of all if you re only doing this to create static button read not as replacements for checkbox or radiobuttons you can always use the html generated by the javascript without actually having to call the .button function on them

4692872
width	height
you will want to do this in the antiquated way of adjusting the width and height of the image in the markup

4692872

i have a single-threaded program that processes folder and files in a source directory

4692981
folder	directory
is there a way to block a folder with files in it within my source directory from being modified by other processes while my program is working on it

4692981
folder	directory
i do not want to block the root source directory itself just whatever folder s in the top level of that directory i might be processing at any particular moment

4692981
folder	directory
i still want to be able to allow outside processes to add folder to the source directory while i m processing other folder

4692981
folder	directory
part of what makes this both challenging and necessary is that i need to recreate the structure of whatever folder s i m processing in the source directory in a separate destination directory

4692985
google-chrome	firefox
this works correctly in firefox and google-chrome

4692987
post	get
there are three general sets of objects that i need to get from or post to a webserver

4693023
google-chrome	firefox
i can tell you that it doesn t happen in google-chrome or firefox on windows 7 but does happen in internet explorer though i m not sure i would have noticed if i hadn t been specifically looking for it so likely a browser os issue

4693034
winpcap	libpcap
i m using libpcap and winpcap on windows in a c application to monitor network traffic

4693051
post	get
i thought that if i could query the list of tags for the current post pass it into a variable and then pass that variable into query_posts argument it would get the job done

4693091
vb.net	vb6
the recordbuilder.someobject was an old vb6 dll i don t have vb6 so i converted it to vb.net 4.0

and another weird thing sometimes a dialog pop-up stating it calculates disk space it has a cancel button but eventually it never closes by itself

4693212
inherited	properties
if you could save your properties via callcontext.logicalsetdata see link above then the properties are flowed to or inherited by any child threads

4693231
portrait	landscape
i might be wrong but my guess would be they use a slidingdrawer set to a landscape orientation in a portrait layout so it comes from the side rather than the top bottom

4693310
typedef	typename
it s similar to how when doing an array typedef you write this with the after the new typename not the original

4693351

4693588
pull	push
when you push and pull on that

4693688
versioning	upgrade
no 5.3 is not backward compatible and by all means it shouldn t be seen as a minor versioning upgrade

4693715
versioning	upgrade
it is doubtful that many contributed modules you are using would survive the upgrade unless there is a release for each of versioning 4 5 6 and 7

4693723
put	get
i get a object as double and tried to put parenthesis on it but it won t let me do it

4693751

4695117

that would require me to subtract the dates then add the days

4695132
inherited	properties
while you could compare the images pixel by pixel that s somewhat overkill i d probably suggest using some other way to store the button state either in an existing button properties or by extending the button into your own class that has additional information using composition or inherited

4695167
children	parent
now i ve read the man pages and i know they say that gettextcontent returns the concatenated string of all the children with the parent

4695167
children	parent
another way i was thinking about doing it was to try and isolate the parent from the children and do the gettextcontent command on just the parent but i don t know how feasible that is

4695211
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
also the oledbcommand doesn t support those named parameters unlike the sqlcommand which does - you need to replace those with just simply question marks

4695223
nginx	lighttpd
since almost all the perl frameworks can run as .psgi now you could run whatever you want on starman + nginx or lighttpd

so far i always manually allocate new buffer and then free it using malloc and free where it s not needed any more

4695371
free	malloc
yes malloc will only call sbrk brk when there is nothing in the free list that satisfies the request

gif	png
on irregular shaped images that are png or gif you may want to consider saving the image with a background color or converting to a jpeg on white backgrounds

4695533
invokelater	invokeandwait
you can also use invokeandwait instead of invokelater

pbkdf2	salt
the key is currently derived via pbkdf2 from a user-supplied password and a salt which is a constant prefix + some data from random

4695631
pbkdf2	salt
i think the pseudo-random data should be good enough for a salt with 10000 iterations of pbkdf2

4695652

g++	gcc
i know that without the ide you just change your exe from g++ to gcc but how do i set this for the current project in codeblocks

4695901
range	min	range	max	min	max
for an enumeration where e min is the smallest enumerator and e max is the largest the values of the enumeration are the values of the underlying type in the range b min to b max where b min and b max are respectively the smallest and largest values of the smallest bit-field that can store e min and e max

4695929
hide	show
i will of course allow the user to hide show the buttons

4695946
int	double
like you can t import int or double

4695947
accessor	properties
objective-c properties default to atomic which ensures that accessor are atomic but doesn t ensure overall thread-safety as per this question

4695947
accessor	properties
the only scenarios i can think of where it s safe to use atomic accessor without a lock and therefore worth using atomic properties at all are

4695949

you could try to make another div within that div which holds the content and has 100 width and height then make the parent div resizable

4695962
uiview	subviews
i have question regarding about finding subviews using .tags in one uiview

4696013
put	get
when i load the resource from the project all works fine but when i put it on a .jar and try to load i get an exception

4696045
put	get
you can accomplish close to the same behavior by splitting the data into separate tables and modifying your application to get put data into the appropriate table as you would today

4696055
uiview	subviews
one thing you could do is have the uiview s in your subviews be of the same type by having each conform to the same protocol

4696065
haskell	scheme
functional --- scheme haskell

4696070
podofo	libharu
should i be looking elsewhere such as 3rd party pdf libs like podofo or libharu

4696161
children	parent
this has the advantage of not requiring that the entire xml be processed with etree.fromstring first and parent nodes are thrown away after the children have been visited

4696161
lxml	celementtree
according to the article lxml with fast_iter can be faster than celementtree s iterparse

4696178
mdpi	hdpi
you just need to convert 72dp x 294dp into actual pixel sizes for ldpi mdpi and hdpi

4696313
post	put
to recap simplify your call to and put the post array into an array in your controller

4696382

to give an idea on how much memory this is using after 4 hours it is using about 420 000k on google-chrome and much more on firefox or ie

4696426
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if you want to execute some code every time the view becomes visible you should have a look at the methods viewwillappear viewwilldisappear viewdidappear viewdiddisappear

4696460
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
what you want is viewwillappear or viewdidappear

4696466
pull	push
i want to commit and push important update1 and important update2 because i want to pull these files to my local repo when i get home

4696478

my first guess is that you re trying to load the x86 32-bit system.data.sqlite.dll in a x64 64bit process or vice versa

4696491
width	height
i was thinking about how to make my css code shorter and was wondering if there was a trick to defining both width and height in the same line

4696491
width	height
is there something like dimension width height

4696525
versioning	upgrade
if the recommendation of the macpython community is to upgrade why does the system versioning remain untouched by the python download of 2.7.1

4696528
implements	extends
this kind of just in case duplication would not be necessary if java allowed using a class as an interface eg class myscanner extends mystuff implements java.util.scanner

4696528
implements	extends
edit for clarification i will copy here striplingwarrior s much better wording of the same questions why can t a class implements another class s method contract without actually extends that class

4696533
hide	show
i have a html5 videoplayer with custom controls that i show hide as needed

4696574
implements	extends
if you try to extends or implements two classes there are potential semantic issues

4696574
implements	extends
you can implements multiple interfaces as well as extends from one class

4696587
versioning	upgrade
you could also compare that information in the fe to a matching versioning in the be to make sure everybody upgrade when required

4696631
primefaces	richfaces
i ve been using richfaces during the last 3 years and primefaces for a few months

4696647
versioning	upgrade
if the recommendation of the macpython community is to upgrade why does the system versioning remain untouched by the python download of 2.7.1

4696647
versioning	upgrade
while they use the word upgrade they really mean to perform a completely new install and not use touch the apple installed versioning

4696666
hide	show
here s the jquery that show hide my divs

4696667
super	implements
with this plugin i can specify different super classes for my generated ones although i couldn t make the auto generated enums to implements a given interface

google-chrome	safari
is there any extension for any of the major browsers preferably safari and or google-chrome that re-renders the page using an updated version of the css file without reloading the whole page itself

4696806
converter	multibinding
i think the easiest way to do this is with a multibinding converter that uses the parent s itemscontainergenerator to determine the zindex

4696808
width	height
their width and height are explicitly set to 0

4696808
google-chrome	firefox
it might not be the best test case but at least for me google-chrome 8 mac os x 10.6 using visible is 45 slower even worse in firefox 3.6.13 75 slower

4696822
inherited	properties
this allows me to keep all of my models from having to inherited from a base class that has a messages properties and gives me more flexibility

4696844
width	height
which will turn your into inline elements--but you lose the versatility of block level elements custom width height floats etc thus the more common alternative is to use

4696849
width	height
divs and other block level elements have a dynamic height and width by default the height is determined by the height of elements that are contained within the div and the width is determined by the width of the element that contains the div

4696875
hide	show
and add remove that class as needed to show or hide the elements

4696936
ddms	adt
this would happen if you were say running eclipse with the adt plugin and the stand-alone ddms at the same time

4696957
client-side	server-side
there are client-side libraries that do this as well as commercial services that do it server-side

4697026
keydown	keyup
therefore you d need to add an extra bit of code for a keydown or keyup event on the checkbox

4697032

i also have a coregraphics blog post that shows how to get touches here

4697036
min	max
actually you should use min rather than max

4697043
dictionary	map
they are sending me a map dictionary element to my method

4697058
post	get
i don t want to fill the dropdown box form.dropdown in the example above static when declaring the form but in the get post method using entries retrieved from a database table when the page is called

4697064
bazaar	git
dvcs is good not only because it enables distributed development is good because all new dvcs systems hg git bazaar plastic... implement merge tracking right

4697089
daemons	launchd
in order for rightscale to properly manage instances in ec2 they use a ruby based daemons called rightlink as a communication device between their core platform and each instance that is launchd

4697089
ami	rightscale
if you re not launching the ami using the rightscale platform this will never properly enroll because they aren t expecting it to as such rightscale will have no communication with the instance at all

4697108
post	get
there are two possible verbs get and post

4697129
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
but only the top layer canvas z-index 2 seems to be catching the mousedown mouseup mousemove events i ve set up

4697160
subtract	add
we subtract 1 due to the way nestwhile works the last element already violates the condition and add 3 because we applied log2 3 times already before entering nestwhilelist

4697178
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
i m using ubuntu but any debian like linux distribution will be similar and other distribution won t have a lot of differences either

4697198
google-chrome	safari
i m not concerned with compatibility in other browsers but it must work in rescent versions of webkit safari 5 google-chrome 9 etc.

passing the gif in an nsimage to the setimage method of the nsstatusitem set the status bar icon as the first frame of the image but was not animated

4697233

however in the htc pro touch phone and maybe this happens on other phones with physical keyboards the application rotates to landscape mode for a few seconds and then returns to portrait mode that happens while navigating on the app

4697264
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
do you have to write a version of the plugin compiled for each platform - win mac linux since a plugin is a binary i assume this is the case so you have one version for ie and then multiple versions for firefox google-chrome safari which share the same plugin setup iirc

4697309
post	put
i would bet it s because your route expects a put and your form is sending a post probably because

4697352
profiler	aqtime
it is an instrumenting profiler like aqtime so it may be better than a sampling profiler for certain optimizations

4697363
freebsd	linux
the trick depends on the gnu extensions to define symbol versions with the .symver assembler directive so it will probably only work on linux and freebsd

4697383
put	get
once you ve put these in the property sheet you can click the add tables toolbar icon to get a list of the files for the particular connect string in the designated folder

4697427
equals	gethashcode
that should work fine provided your point implementation implements gethashcode and equals properly

4697427
equals	gethashcode
make sure it implements equals and gethashcode correctly or better yet use a version of point included in the framework

4697506
opera	safari
mobile browsers have virtual screen resolution they use for zoom and it s 960px in opera mini mobile and mobile safari

4697541

by the way the bstree template is instantiated with typenames int and const chars each with a different compare function that is correctly assigned i think

4697592
coalesce	isnull
in ms sql there s a shorthand function called isnull which is like coalesce but only takes two parameters

4697623
post	get
after several hours running the program starts to get urlopen error timed out all the time and this always happens right after a post request from a server not a certain one might be a or b or c and it s also not the first post request causing the problem normally after several hours running and it happens to make a post request at an unknown moment all you get from then on is urlopen error timed out

hash	md5
it probably doesn t matter much which hash you use for this purpose sha1 or even md5 is probably adequate and you might find that the cksum command is sufficient

stdout	stderr
you have to redirect stderr to stdout if you want this to work

4697808
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think quirksmode has all the answers you need different browsers bubbling behaviour and the mouseenter mouseleave events but i think the most common conclusion to that event bubbling mess is the use of a framework like jquery or mootools which has the mouseenter and mouseleave events which are exactly what you intuited would happen

4697817
post	get
since you re using a seperate php file to process the post and using redirects to get back to the original page you ll need some way to pass the data

stdout	fflush
or better yet stick fflush stdout

4697889
stdout	fflush	fflush	gets
after each printf so the buffer gets fflush regardless of the stdout buffering mode

4697895
stdout	stderr
there is no way through configuration of mod_wsgi to say that all stdout stderr from a mod_wsgi daemon process should go to an alternate log file than that setup for the virtualhost

4697978
button	checkbox
i believe you want to style the radio button to look like a checkbox

you hide the actual radio button see the css input type radio and you style the label for the corresponding radio button to show the custom checkbox from the css sprite in the background image in input type radio + label and switch to a different sprite in the background when the radio button is in checked state

4698003
portrait	landscape
if you want to know if the content currently displayed is in landscape mode or portrait possibly completely independent of the phone s physical rotation you can use

4698222
g++	gcc
you should see the build log invoking gcc now instead of g++

4698235
inherited	properties
to solve this you can either create a base class that all your view models will inherited from defining things that the master and its partial views need and then you d pass the appropriate properties into one of the renderpartial overloads or you can use the untyped viewdata bag to do something similar

4698240
children	parent
note that this only checks the immediate parent if the parent div had nested children then you have to somehow traverse through the elements parent looking for the orginal element

4698252
post	get
in my controller i have an edit get method to display the view and an edit post method to save the changes

4698259
mouseover	mousemove

since i have had most of my experience and happen to like as well i would suggest codeigniter to start cakephp is an alternative too as are others

4698320
integer	unsigned
cast the integer to the corresponding unsigned type and then you don t have to worry about what signed representation is in use

4698334
children	parent
â º this is a bit less fidgety but it can t detect moving from a parent element to one of its children without first moving the mouse completely off said parent

4698618
typedef	struct
in this case you need to also declare the struct node type since the typedef is not in scope within the struct definition

4698618
typedef	struct
note that both names may be the same i m not sure where the underscore convention originated but i guess older c compilers couldn t handle typedef struct x x

4698619
typedef	struct
the first declaration is of an un- typedef struct and needs the struct keyword to use

4698619
typedef	struct
the second is of a typedef anonymous struct and so we use the typedef name

4698619
typedef	struct
the second case wouldn t be possible here unless you abandon sanity and use a instead because the struct is anonymous and the typedef doesn t happen until the struct is defined giving you no way to make a type-safe pointer to the struct type itself

4698619
typedef	struct
in c struct tags are placed in a separate namespace from other names but typedef names aren t

4698643
typedef	struct
observe that this easily allows to use the typedef already inside the declaration of the struct itself and that even for struct that reference each other mutually

4698667
slider	supersized
using supersized 3.0 jquery plug-in and want slideshow to stop on the last slider

4698676

4698696
google-chrome	firefox
the button is aligned to the center in ie7 - and is not aligned to the center in firefox google-chrome and ie8

4698699
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
next to implementing inotifypropertychanged and using icollectionchanged observablecollection and binding to the views you might consider implementing ieditableobject when you want to support the editing of the data

4698713
min	max
i need to use vanilla gl10 so none of the min max equation stuff is available

4698729
wordpress	joomla

int	double
the second problem you ll have to address is that in c++ the complex template exists for float double and long double none of which have lossless conversions to int

4698905
getter	setter
you can use getter setter instead

4698945
put	get
you can get way more fancy do it on the keydown put it in the setup file so it s on the toolbar

4698969
nswindow	nsapplication
your main function should call nsapplicationmain then your initial entries for writing the bindings to the c++ code will likely be event handling nswindow nsview and maybe nsapplication

4698972
post	get
but if a user post how can i get the numeric value in order to save it

4698987
prepare	execute
then in my class i m just calling prepare on the sql and execute on the array parameter

4699075
width	margin
to force a block input originally display inline element to be centered you have to set a fixed width and then the margin to 0 auto

4699089
free	malloc
the simple rule is this exactly one free is required for each malloc

4699089
free	malloc
since you have just one malloc you need just one free

4699098
cvs	svn
there has already been some discussion about the problems the gen folder causes together with version control systems svn cvs git etc

4699105
jobs	cron
i know i m going to need to use cron jobs but i m concerned that processing records of this size may cause the site to freeze up perform slowly or just piss off my hosting company every three hours

4699114
slideup	slidedown
jquery s slideup slidedown and slidetoggle don t work with position relative elements in ie7

4699130
cvs	svn
you shouldn t store gen folder in any version control system no matter svn cvs git or anything else

4699197
hide	show
the next and previous buttons will show hide the corresponding div

4699200
google-chrome	firefox
but maybe clever browsers such as firefox or google-chrome might support something on it

4699283
fast-forward	merge
without the + updates that aren t fast-forward merge will be rejected

4699283
fast-forward	merge
first you might want to check that updating the branch would have been a fast-forward merge and after that update the branch

4699283
fast-forward	merge
you can check that an equivalent merge would be a fast-forward that the history of origin master includes master by comparing git merge-base master origin master with git show-ref master - they should be the same

4699289
webclient	webrequest
as documented here webclient makes use of webrequest in its private implementation

4699303

4699370
google-chrome	firefox
i now have code that works on ie google-chrome as above and used to work on firefox until now

4699399
getter	setter
a validate step i would do the long-running part in a separate method getter and setter should normally be relatively fast

4699400
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
attributes are used for sorting filtering and grouping your search results

4699400
int	boolean
their values do not get paid any attention by sphinx for search terms though and theyâ re limited to the following data types int floats datetimes as unix timestamps â and thus int anyway boolean and strings

4699414
filtering	grouping
if you re trying grouping by poststatusid i suggest you do that explicitly rather than by fetching with lots of different filtering

4699430
google-chrome	firefox
however when one of the partner sites put it in their page 1 it doesn t render at all in ie and 2 in other browsers firefox google-chrome the html of the widget renders incorrectly the closes prematurely before the financial aid glossary

4699439
put	get
so how would i get the php to avoid putting in duplicate tweets that it say put in the day before

4699461
ubuntu	debian
considering f# at least debian upstream and ubuntu need to upgrade 2.6.7 to one of the 2.8.x releases soon

4699504
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu or indeed linux systems in general it seems that the choices are to use a widget framework like wx or qt or gtk+ to create a gui application but all these frameworks feel like they are wrapping something more fundamental

4699511
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
all of the uinavigationcontroller setup examples involve using multiple xib s for different views however all my views are uiviewcontroller in one xib

4699529

you re looking to show hide the content relating to the link clicked

4699583
post	get
use the redirect-after-post or sometimes called prg post redirect get

4699699
int	chars
for example if i set up a rule that an id needs to consist of 5 int only then when i insert a row with id which is made up of int and some chars then it won t accept it and return an error

4699712
hash	md5
if you don t want to rely on any aspect of the client side javascript or even cookies you can calculate an md5 hash of the data submitted possibly by adding information such as source ip and the browser used and reject posts that have the same hash

4699714
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome it loads this page and then redirects to example.com while on other browsers that i have tested ie and firefox it does not load this html page on which this particular code is but directly shows up example.com

4699739
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in gecko webkit-based browsers firefox google-chrome and safari and opera you can use btoa and atob

4699743
post	get
and so your get and post methods would have different signatures

4699752
jobs	cron
also you can look at insert delayed statement and your idea about nightly cron jobs seems reasonable to me

4699766
int	chars
you can always concatenate these columns pk and contacttype on reports c12345 s20000 casting the int to string if you want to eliminate the column in order to save space on the printed or displayed page and everyone in your organization understands the convention that the first chars of the entity id stands for the contacttype code

4699770

4699804
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
my target browsers are firefox and the webkit based ones chromium safari but it wouldn t hurt to have a great fast experience under ie and opera as well.

browsers tested google-chrome 10 firefox 3.6 firefox beta 4.0b9 ie 9 preview 7 opera 11

4699906
gridbaglayout	miglayout
it sounds to me like gridbaglayout would be a better fit for you either that or miglayout though you ll have to download that first since it s not part of standard java

4699947
post	get	post	put	put	get
these methods are most commonly http get post put and delete

4699953
fiddler	charles
i recommend downloading fiddler or charles and using that to determine what the server response was

4699964
getter	setter
why not store the 12-bit words in a byte array and provide a getter and a setter method that read and write the ushort s byte to the correct index in the array

4699971
hash	salt
beware however because this one-to-one routing also leads to security problems people tend to keep all of their executable code within the webroot -- even secure code which may contain passwords hash salt and other privacy-important code

4699984
cassini	iis
works with cassini so it s not an iis express thing
