gridview	detailsview	gridview	formview	formview	detailsview
what is the best asp.net control i can use to do that gridview formview or detailsview

3900171
ssl	https
if you need to protect the session number as well encrypt the http connection using https ssl

3900201
gridview	detailsview
a gridview produces a table showing multiple records while a detailsview shows one at a time

3900204
division	modulo
in java the modulo is used to get the reminder after the division

3900222
codeigniter	yii
codeigniter is dead simple and yii has already built a plugin system into its framework via components and modules

3900233
portrait	landscape
i would like the app to display portrait type images when ipad device is in portrait orientation and landscape type images when ipad device is in landscape orientation

3900233
portrait	landscape
so there would be two versions of every image one cropped for portrait viewing and one cropped for landscape viewing and the app would show the version that is appropriate for the orientation the device is in

3900233
portrait	landscape
ideally the view would change over to the corresponding image staying where it is in the sequence of images when the user rotates the device so from portrait #4 to landscape #4 and vice versa for example

3900270
google-chrome	firefox
and when i enter in webrowser firefox google-chrome ie www.guardian.co.uk it s redirecting me to www.todoist.com

3900293
kerberos	ntlm
it is not of course - because if ad is not available then kerberos authentication falls back to ntlm domain account credentials are cached locally one can login with it even if ad kerberos is not available

3900334
int	double
if you have a double number from 0 to 1 you can scale it to the int

3900385
int	chars
so it s obvious that when i change unsigned chars to unsigned int

3900385
int	chars
why is conversion different for arithmetic between unsigned chars and chars apparently unsigned is converted to signed and unsigned int and int apparently signed is converter to unsigned

3900405
min	max
in my flex air application with systemchrome false showflexchrome false i am using applicationcontrolbar as the title bar with title text close max min button

3900405
min	max
my application shows close max min buttons on right title text on left

3900405
min	max
but my requirement is on windows it should be like it is on mac the title bar should show close max min buttons on left

3900417
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank

3900417
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

3900417
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type

3900417
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type

3900417
int	chars
first both operands are converted to int because an int can represent all values of unsigned chars

3900417
integer	unsigned
an int cannot represent all the values of an unsigned int so rule 3 is used and the signed integer is converted to an unsigned integer uint_max - 1

3900462
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in this situation i d use a normal autoreleased nsstring object however you can also use an nsmutablestring which you release yourself but then you ll have to adjust to code to make use of the nsmutablestring methods such as appendformat instead of stringbyappendingformat

3900513
post	put
well that s easy there is a nice post on that here put this in the function.php file within your theme

3900522
mouseup	mousedown
have you tried sending mousedown mouseup etc

3900522
mouseup	mousedown
i ve seen some flash apps where some buttons work by mousedown and others by mouseup

3900522
mouse	keyboard
also consider disabling the keyboard and mouse just before sending the events and re-enabling after

3900637
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari - webkit inspector ctrl+shift+i to bring it up

3900676
super	extends
super extends classtype

3900690
hash	salt
use a salt hash to store passwords

3900690
hash	md5
if you need your code to be extremely portable or run on old versions of php md5 sha1 is fine too but it will make ignorant people complain that you are using a hash that has been broken .

3900696
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
i have one qgraphicsscene as the main scene with several movable qgraphicsitem s in it and another qgraphicsscene on top of the main scene as an overlay

put	get
are you supposed to iterate the search results and put an appropriate counter whenever they get searched or is there a non-intrusive mechanism by which this can be captured at a lower level than the application layer

3900775
integer	unsigned
each set is a hex representation of a unsigned integer so you can play around with the possibilities

3900798
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
everything works great with firefox 4 google-chrome 7 and safari 5

3900803
textarea	textbox
i want to do this because i will have a button to expand it but if user is allowed to enter multiple lines when the textarea is not expanded only 1 row it doesn look very nice and if i use a textbox for the not expanded state it looks weird when i replace it with the textarea and expand it with animation

3900806
packets	multicast
routers are rarely made and configured to support resending multicast packets to other networks

3900811
textarea	textbox
you can stack the elements then show the textarea first and remove the textbox right away

3900845
google-chrome	safari
internet explorer did something called remainingspace but that doesn t work in google-chrome safari

3900850
getter	setter
like in eclipse for java where it can auto-generate getter and setter for class variables can visual studio 2010 do this as well

3900860
implements	extends
personally i d recommend implements your own adapter most likely in this case by extends simplecursoradapter and encapsulating the updates to distance text and compass heading rotation within that

3900868
awt	swing
i have only found answers to the swing version of this problem setprototypedisplayvalue but i have to stick with awt since this is a homework

3900886
opera	firefox
firefox 3.5+ ie9 beta opera and webkit browsers display them

3900890
typedef	struct
as you can see i ve had to redefine nodehandle_t in caching_storage_t because if i try it with the commented-out typedef line which i d prefer i get an error no type named â handle_tâ in â struct btree_node ... â -- which is obviously incorrect and the compiler knows it since the typedef works fine in btree

3900947
hide	show
how can i hide a winform so that it t will not show in the windows taskbar user do not see it or when the user presses alt + tab

3900974
post	put
how can i detect at the startup of the application that a client doesn t support delete and put verbs and automatically overload the post verb

3900983
portrait	landscape
simple javascript code to make mobile browser display either in portrait or landscape

3901004
folder	directory
i have just one root directory with index.php in it along with two folder img and css

3901004
folder	directory
i am guessing the problem is with url being treated as directory structure and then it cant find img and css folder there

3901005
post	put
also for browsers that do not support put and delete verbs in html forms you could use the httpmethodoverride helper inside your form which will add a hidden field to the form which will instruct the runtime to invoke the proper controller action despite the fact that under the covers a post request is sent

3901020
hash	salt
if it is set hash the password with a salt

3901022
for-loop	loops
i understand the variable j itself goes out of scope when exiting the for-loop but will an integer be locally allocated n times on the stack so that the int objects pointed to by the elements in the vector remain valid outside loops

3901023
hide	show
also i d recommend having both the text in a span and the always present and just toggle them to show hide the proper ones

3901023
hide	show
you simply show hide the and on a delegate click and blur

3901024
querypath	phpquery
therefore phpquery querypath is likely the robuster approach

3901040
awt	swing
also it would be better to spend your time learning swing rather that awt since painting in swing is somewhat different and you might as well spend time learning a more current gui solution

3901058
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchescancelled	touchesended
you ll need to create a view then use touchesbegan touchesmoved touchescancelled and touchesended callbacks to implement your custom behaviour

3901071
int	chars
what you want to do is not to copy a string but to assign a single chars value which conceptually is no different from an int apart from its size

3901071
int	chars
on some platforms an int might be no larger than a chars

3901163
memcached	apc
i am trying to move from the typical combination of apc for opcode and memcached for my userdata to a purely apc based cache

3901163
fflush	gets
or should i try setting lower ttl values for the opcode cache so it always gets fflush first

3901166
equals	tostring
the proxy trait provides a useful basis for creating delegates but note that it only provides implementations of the methods in any equals hashcode and tostring

3901180
bibtex	latex
i m new to latex and bibtex so excuse my ignorance

3901211
rss	feed
there doesn t seem to be a way to control this from the flickr api however i did come up with another site which offers rss of flickr feed precisely because the flickr api is limiting

3901237

3901237
mouse	keyboard
apis and all keyboard mouse

3901244
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to capture a sequence of comands the imacros browser macro recorder addons are very useful ie google-chrome firefox

3901249
std	ostream
for std ostream and derived classes operator is a formatted output function

3901256
min	max
i might use std numeric_limits max and min instead of computing the bytes but then i would have to switch to run-time assert

3901287
postgresql	mysql
open source databases mysql postgresql with entity framework

3901345
getter	setter
if it s a private class that only the parent class will use i usually will just put in fields instead of getter and setter

3901347
swt	swing
some modern gui toolkits like swt oder swing all have simple structured like rectangle or point where the elements are accessed directly and where the classes are part of the public api

3901347
getter	setter
so we can conclude a simple rule where its okey if and only if the class is not likely to change because it is very simple and if it is used very often so that the time gain is measurable and if the attributes are not used in bean binding so no property change event are needed when the properties change then you might omit the setter and getter

3901348
getter	setter
this way when a developer want to use any of the component you provide he won t need to wrap everything in order to access the attributes with getter setter to make it work with the framework he s using

3901364
free	malloc
write a allocator and de-allocator that use the store and only the store and call them from the rest of your program instead of calling malloc and free .

3901373
apache	nginx
your webserver also needs to support this header at least apache and nginx which i ve worked with does

3901382
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
this tutorial recommends making crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml files and putting them in the web root of the service

i ve experimented with combinations of using command-pattern and the memento pattern for my undo redo system

3901471
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
something could break on the next update of ie firefox opera google-chrome safari or it could work fine

3901472
post	get
in addition to changing the concurrency mode to fixed as morteza says you have to inject the concurrency value which you read during the get before updating the entity during the post

3901561
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
is working fine in firefox safari google-chrome etc

3901590
oncreate	setcontentview
basically i am calling setcontentview r.layout.xxx in oncreate as usual so i don t really have a way to pass in references to additional textviews unless i awkwardly retrieve the view after setcontentview and then make calls on it

3901643
width	height
and even b find out the size of the popups since they are hidden normally which means width height 0 until they are shown

3901679
gson	jackson
i don t have gson but jackson another object-to-json mapper prints this

3901728
uilabel	nsstring
you ll need to use the nsstring uikit additions to compute the height you need to set on your uilabel and then adjust the other controls appropriately

3901740
ready	each
this is important for larger features because it means that one can work on a series of commits to implement a feature each commit being small and self contained for easy finding bugs by bisecting history to one own satisfaction and only when they are ready to publish them

3901740
pull	push
a variant of this approach is to have separate public repository with rebasable branch with work in progress and push or send a pull request only when branch is ready for inspection

3901813
width	height
but i want this to do from code rather than xml.i have done everything that i have done in xml like font width height font dynamically through code but not able to set background that i mentioned in xml file

3901819
user-controls	tabcontrol
the only solution i can think is a tabcontrol with invisible tabs to switch programmatically or create a custom user-controls and place it somehow..but the last solution i think sucks because the content i want to display isnt just a user control.

3901889
pop-up	dialog
select in the dialog which pop-up visual c++ - win32

3901930
svnadmin	visualsvn

expression-blend	silverlight
in expression-blend 4 silverlight project i have a usercontrol to which i have added a clr property

3902022
int	chars
again dynamically allocates a single chars with an int value of 10

3902050
prepare	execute
you can build a string with the concat function and then use prepare and execute to run the string as a query

3902125
treeview	tabcontrol
let s say i have a tabcontrol with 2 tabs and a treeview with 2 nodes at the root

3902125
treeview	tabcontrol
i want the application to behave in the following manner if i click on node1 from the treeview the tab1 from the tabcontrol should become active

3902175
weka	libsvm
libsvm has an implementation as does weka

3902181
uiview	subviews
also if it is uiview what method do i add the subviews uiimageview and uilabel in as subviews

3902195
pop-up	dialog
zoom change page - both of these options pop-up with a dialog box a spinner and then freeze the page

3902218
opera	google-chrome
opera on background google-chrome on foreground

3902223
stdout	stderr
granted those could largely be optimized away since stdin stdout stderr etc. etc

3902251
background-image	background-position
i m not familiar with the particular problem you describe and i don t know whether there is some specific fix for it but one workaround is using background-image background-position which is easier to fine-tune

3902286
children	parent
found so php traversing function to turn single array into nested array with children - based on parent id

3902306
width	height
knowing the width and height of the image and the pixels index in sequence how can i convert that sequence back into a 2d sequence

3902309
hide	show
upon the user closing the dialog the view will show hide the appropriate columns i went a step further - as the user checks a column in the dialog it instantly becomes visible in the grid so that the user knows they chose the right one when displaying many tens of columns quite a few could be very similar

3902325
children	parent
whenever something derived from qobject is destroyed qt automatically deletes all its children recursively as well as long as each child was passed a parent pointer

3902398
getter	setter
in other scenarios for example when trying to have public getter and private setter i faced the same problem

3902399
int	double
i changed the int to long int and that did not change anything then i changed them to double and i get the error listed in the title

3902400
width	height
simple math you have n width height and want x y

3902408
int	double
you can t use a double with the operator you must have an int

3902411
pop-up	dialog
the issue is if the login password is wrong i can t just get a 401 status unauthorized chrome pop-up the regular authentication dialog

3902415
entity-relationship	entities
the entity-relationship model defines entities unto themselves and allow the reference of entity-to-entity table-to-table through a separate relation

3902456
width	height
height and width refer to the image dimensions

3902456
put	get	width	height
if i put height and width instead of 500 and 500 above i get an error since they are not constant values

3902467
textarea	textbox
it will probably be easier to do this if you use the basic textbox mode of the html module then you just need to set the value of a textarea rather than figure out where to insert the value in the fckeditor and the technique will be still work if the site is configured to use the telerik provider instead of the fck provider

3902495
stdout	stderr
viewing stdout and stderr

3902495
stdout	stderr
by default the android system sends stdout and stderr system.out and system.err output to dev null

3902495
stdout	stderr
in this case the system writes the messages to the log using the log tags stdout and stderr both with priority i

3902520
post	get
in which case you want to do post updatesettings in your routes file not get

3902520
post	get
this will define a route that responds to post requests vs one that only responds to get requests

3902520
post	get
if you want both then use a get and a post line in your routes file

3902544
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
that will handle webkit browsers google-chrome and safari and firefox 4 but leave ie users stranded or at least restricted to pull technology ajax ajaj

button	checkbox
i took codekaizen s code and dropped it into a form along with a timer and several controls a datagridview panel and a button and checkbox in the panel

3902654
post	get	post	put	put	get
the calls which are causing the issue are a mix of get put post and delete

3902656
actionlistener	focuslistener
you do not want an actionlistener you want a focuslistener

3902687
jqgrid	datatables
my options are the rich datatables richfaces control or the jquery plugin jqgrid

surveys have many questions and responses. i got it to render but when i submit it it sends as a put instead of a post

3902833
google-chrome	safari
i have a mystery 1px bottom border showing up in safari and google-chrome i guess a webkit thing

3902833
margin	height
i ve played around with height border position padding and margin but haven t been able to figure this one out

3902839
for-loop	arrays
you only need to know the number of items in the arrays if you are using the c style for-loop

3902851
keydown	keyup
you can use setinterval to run your handler every eg 400 ms then maintain a stack of pressed keys by handling keydown and keyup

3902893
post	get
but if you want to get the admin page for post to also let you add urls you need to do some tricks with inlinemodeladmin

3902899
width	height
the website page i m working on at the moment is 100 percent height and 100 width so the content should be viewed all the time

3902912
put	get
and i get the following error i put the line number 14 in the code

3902921
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
position it 50 from the window parent container and use a negative margin size that s half of the elements width height

3902935
hide	show
this will hide it if it s show and show it if it s hidden

3902961
cpu	processors
despite the fact that the cpu utilization on my quad core and on only one processors never exceeded 25 it turned out that the lack of updating was due to a processing not processors overload somewhere in the graphics handling chain

3903012
for-loop	loops
erlang is looking for-loop 0 but can t find it because your function is loops 1

3903019
vim	emacs
you write python code line by line as you would on python interactive mode in a text editor such as vim emacs etc..

3903048
division	subtraction
no class can ever have size less than one because pointer arithmetic specifically the subtraction operator can divide by the size and division by zero is undefined

3903052
x86	mips
in the context of porting native applications it usually refers to the combination of cpu isa x86 amd64 ia-64 power mips armv9 sparc hardware architecture pc chrp prep mac kernel linux nt and base libraries posix win32 core foundation

3903054
filtering	grouping
my logic here is that i have all the contacts in the contacts table from there i have a column called grouping that i use to filtering the contacts into grouping

3903077
int	double
for most modern architectures you need to align int to word boundies and long int to double word boundries

3903114
integer	unsigned
if the original value was an unsigned integer of lesser width than int it will be changed to a signed value as well

3903228
disk	ram
the loading of the images from disk to ram would ideally need to be done on a background thread try performselectoronbackgroundthread so that the i o doesn t bog down the main thread which will impact on your scrolling performance

3903265
getter	setter
the only way to do it is to create getter and setter

3903303
put	get
now the clean and methods don t sound like a nice place to put code that has side effects and i fear that checking at this moment whether the value is unique does not guarantee i won t get integrityerror s

3903305
submit	submission
when the user selects the permissions and clicks submit in the rails controller should i be submission to create or update

3903319
getter	setter
core data s synthesis of attribute getter setter is a similar example of objective-c s dynamic messaging and dynamic runtime making things much easier

3903339
post	get
the app sends out a get or post request to a url

3903395
stdout	fflush
so you should include a newline in the message and still do fflush stdout

firefox	safari
i found a vertical menu but i m having some problems with it because i have some incompatibility with ie 7 8 9 and also with safari just it working for firefox

3903474
getter	setter
what i found in google to be the solution to this is to change the use of mscrollx for the public getter of view but the code also sets that variable and there are no setter available

3903506
libpcap	wireshark
libpcap libpcap is packet capture library used in tcpdump wireshark

3903507
struts	stripes	struts	wicket	wicket	stripes

3.also on your model surface just select the association line between the two entities and remove it your navigation properties will be gone by having inherited you don t need that

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
document.getelementbyid editor .focus works well in firefox and ie but in google-chrome safari it just selects the entire content

3904158
hex	binary
in the computer s memory that number value is usually represented in binary no matter how it s specified in your source code decimal hex whatever

3904188
gif	png
from that point i would only grab the first few bytes of data from the content and check if the image meta data existed and whether or not it was jpg png or gif

3904212
hide	show
i am using devexpress xtrascheduler.in this i have created one custom form which opens while double clicking .but the problem is now while double clicking two forms are opening ie one custom form that i have created and the other default one.so i need to hide the default form and need to show the custom form that i have created.how it can be done

3904294
getter	setter
firstly i would create a small class holding the information about your items to make it a bit easier to work with i ve only implemented the necessary setter you ll probably want some getter and other functions as well

3904361
xlib	cairo
iâ ve a program developed using xlib and cairo

3904361
xlib	cairo
just for the reference i do mix calls between cairo and xlib although iâ m not sure if that might be the cause of the error

3904361
xlib	cairo
one is the main ui thread which makes calls to both xlib and cairo another uses it just to send a xclientmessage and third makes some xlib calls like xcopyarea and at the end send an xclientmessage those are for some animations

3904361
xlib	cairo
iâ ve also guarded all xlib calls with xlockdisplay cairo calls are also guarded with xlockdisplay

3904361
xlib	xcb
can this be a bug in xcb and is it worth trying to compile xlib without xcb

3904372
public	protected
changing the visibility to public or protected will resolve the error

3904413
folder	directory
i want to copy only the parent folder names from source and then create the folder with those names in a destination directory

3904451
keydown	keyup
i use keydown because keyup didn t work for me

3904462
namedtuple	dictionary
it then passes that to namedtuple and returns a class that s inherited from the resulting namedtuple with all appropriate methods in its dictionary

3904495
puts	gets
so from the top what this does is gets the data from every txtbox on the form puts it all into one string then stores all that information into the data variable

3904499
min	max
i tried min dob - it gives me the oldest person and when i tried max it gives me nothing

3904503
google-chrome	safari
once i had this problem using safari never tested with google-chrome maybe there was the same problem google-chrome safari both use the same rendering-engine as far as i know - don t know about the js-parts

3904503
firefox	safari
i never found a solution to work around that but because of it was a small app in a company-wide intranet it wasn t a big problem to not support safari firefox was the default-browser anyway and firefox works

3904564
int	double
first array will be pointer-to-pointer-to-pointer int - since it points to double pointers

3904567
keydown	keyup
i use keydown because keyup didn t work for me

3904573
rss	feed
how can i get this datetime format for an rss feed

3904618
pull	push
you can then send patches or a pull request or push to mob branch

3904702
hide	show
in that event handler hide second dialog collect the data and show it again when ready

3904702
hide	show
make sure that you create black_box only once and show hide it as appropriate

3904780
strtod	setlocale	atof	setlocale	atof	strtod
not sure following consideration applicable across standard but msdn states that strtod as long as atof react to the settings set up in a call to setlocale see lc_numeric

3904842
submit	submission
given that i m thinking you need to capture whatever curl s submission to b and submit the same request from your browser

3904871
submit	submission
also if you re relying on knowing which submit button the user pressed the above loses that because we re not submission the form using the button anymore we re cancelling that one and then submission it later with code

3904918
ubuntu	linux
running under linux ubuntu 10.10

3904937
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to add a pop-up message function in my project.and i make it run in a subthread since i need a realtime notification.but i find if the notification dialog is created in my subthread started by afxbeginthread all the elements buttons urls.... of the dialog are not shown.the message box is just a blank dialog

3904957
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
wanted to know maximum size of session variable for different browsers firefox msie7 8 google-chrome opera safari

3904970
serializable	deserialization
i have found a tutorial on how to implement custom a serializable deserialization for java enums

3905045
getter	setter
the problem is that the interface has only getter and you try to explicitly implement it with getter and setter

3905045
getter	setter
if the interface only has getter there is no way to use the setter so it makes no sense to have a setter there

3905056
filesystems	ntfs
using ntfs with permissions for the drive s filesystems would be bypassed by anyone with applicable window s privileges

3905146
getter	setter
when one is clicked a value with a viewtate getter setter assigns this the value of the button clicked

3905208
codeigniter	pyrocms
one thing you can do is create a my_input or my_security in codeigniter 2 like the one in pyrocms and override the xss_clean method with an exact copy minus the object|embed| part of the regex

3905216
folder	directory
if you re using an ide like eclipse the working directory is by default the projects root folder

3905284
children	parent
i have widgets which have children and one parent

3905339
int	boolean
of course there are no threads and semaphores in javascript but instead of using many boolean variables you could use just one int for counting

3905366
opera	firefox
everything works just fine in firefox ie opera etc

3905375
free	malloc
you can instrument your memory allocation yourself by hooking malloc free calls and counting the number of bytes you allocate and you free each time

3905378
postgresql	mysql
i m converting a mysql table to postgresql for the first time in my life and running into the traditional newbie problem of having no auto_increment

3905397
children	parent
after wm_setredraw false is sent calls to getdc getdcex getwindowdc etc using the parent window handle and all its children will return a dc that won t draw on the screen

3905419
google-chrome	firefox
while same image is rendered correctly in google-chrome firefox

3905441
int	double
i would like to know the best solution in terms of performances for storing vectors arrays of data int or double whose dimension is not available at compile time it depends on the input from the user but once intialized they will never change their dimensions neither their values

3905443
post	put
i will use any feedback to put a more concise blog post together

3905457
children	parent
parent before children that would be quite easy

3905464
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i then tried calling it in viewdidload and later in viewwillappear methods but it never got called after the first launch

3905481
mutators	setter
the mutators setter is called

3905481
getter	setter
in my personal opinion a class that has bean properties should not have any other methods named get set or is if they are not getter or setter to make the method intents clearer

3905576
hash	salt
actually drupal 6 does not use any salt to calculate the hash of the password

3905596
gif	png
is your best best but the jpg png gif bit will only work if you append the glob_brace flag on the end

3905605
width	height
i wonder if i can change the border size to make it bigger in width and height

3905629
width	height
increasing the border-width increases the overall width and height of the element

3905652
width	height
to increase the size an element you can use the width and height attributes

3905668
integer	fractions
the phase accumulator usually contains an integer component and a fractions component

3905715
put	get
the out put will give the itemnumber name and price.how i can get the type name i mean sweaters

3905726
implements	extends
the same way a class can only extends one other class but can implements multiple interfaces

3905950
multiplying	add
you should be able to do the interpolation with a single multiply-accumulate instruction if you re using a dsp otherwise it s a multiplying + scale + add on a general purpose cpu

3906117
min	max
random.nextint max - min + 1 + min will do the trick

3906154
width	height
in it i d use graphics2d.drawimage giving width and height of container as a parameters to it

3906154
awt	swing
the awt approach seems closer to bare metal but since jdk 6 brought a lot of improvements in swing rendering pipeline i would go the swing java2d approach

3906171
put	get
this seems to work fine but i get a httprequestvalidationexception if i put a single quote into my textbox

3906173
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
whenever i present modalviewcontroller with the navigationcontroller this navigation comes below the actual navigationcontroller

3906192
submit	submission
it will depend from site to site and on many site you won t even need a submit value user pass should be sufficient and then in many other sites they may have some hidden fields in the login form so best way is to see the fields in the form you are submission either directly in html or using some tool like firebug

3906233
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu the system is called apt and there s tonnes you can read about it

3906233
ubuntu	debian
for a developer such as yourself a nice introduction could probably be had by trying to package a piece of software for your distro of choice for debian ubuntu there is a nice guide

3906234
hide	show
when i hide that div and show it again than scrolling not come but before hiding the div scrolling was there why this happen why style is changed to overflow hidden and for solving this problem what should i do

3906235
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
whenever i present modalviewcontroller with the navigationcontroller this navigation comes below the actual navigationcontroller

3906240
disk	ram
i ve also searched for alternative solutions like for example a piece of software allowing to make windows believe that some defined part of the ram is a removable disk or something like that

3906266
hide	show
or just try jquery s toggle or hide show to see if that alone works out for you

3906297
post	get
using this solution your web page can now simply call the following stored procedure to get a list of filtered post for a given user within a specified period

3906378
rss	feed
rss feed are not ideal for a number of reasons

3906385
sorting	filtering
i have the sorting down pact but i can t filtering repeat the data

3906448
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
from what i see it is used by autoresetevent manualresetevent and semaphore but not by mutex

3906460
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop however the - 1 is correct an arrays of size 10 goes from 0..9

3906558
firefox	safari
i checked this on safari for windows firefox internet explorer and it works everywhere except for the ipad

3906560
getter	setter
if you do not need a field because it is a standard getter or setter most people us auto-implemented properties

3906572
getter	setter
if your getter needs to do some validating on the value or your setter needs to fire a propertychanged event so that the ui can update then the first method is required

3906606
children	parent
i m not sure if the children elements will adapt themselfs with procentual values if their parent doesn t have a width attribute

3906702
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
oddly it works consistently in firefox google-chrome and opera

3906719
jboss	glassfish
i ve no problems using a real application server like glassfish or jboss

3906741
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the first kind are methods like initâ viewwillappear viewdidload or setup

3906776
freebsd	linux
most systems restrict the maximum backlog size on linux and freebsd this option is named somaxconn

3906779
jar	war
i just have my usersettings.java in a separate jar project and include it as a dependency to both war s

3906840
width	height
after going through approaches seems like if we load higher resolution images memory usage goes huge width height 4

3906897
disk	ram
but it technically would allow you to create an unlimited number of objects since you re trading ram memory for disk space

3906960
int	double
if a is a double rather than an int then it will be represented as mantissa and exponent

3906963
post	put
i figure it put from this post and after that i made a toggle comment from line 934 to 969 and it s all

3907030
pull	push
git remote show origin shows me that both fetch and pull urls are the same as i supply as argument to push

3907032
superclass	subclassing
it mostly depends on whether your subclassing needs things to happen before the superclass method or after

3907067
versioning	upgrade
i tried to upgrade it to the latest versioning but when i ran update.php it failed

3907081
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
but the nsurlconnection request is called outside the nsoperation so i had to modify it a little to suit my purposes

3907081
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
another good example that i found is the linkedimagefetcher which shows how to fetch images from a website and includes nsurlconnection request inside an nsoperation

3907120
inherited	subclassing
if you use the activerecord class both to find the subclassing and to get the static finders at least you can still tell what methods they inherited by looking at the activerecord class itself

3907220
typedef	struct
then you wrap that struct definition in a typedef which essentially tells the compiler that there s a type error that s equivalent to struct error

3907229
sorting	filtering
let s go back to the cases you are considering viz filtering followed by sorting vs

3907229
sorting	filtering
sorting followed by filtering

3907229
sorting	filtering
finding the pointer is o log 2 n so here there s both reasons to consider that filtering first will be faster the reasons given above and that sorting first will be faster that removal can be made a much faster operation than it was before

3907237
int	double
you are reading double values using the decimal int format d

3907247
typedef	struct
you defined a typedef in other words an alias for struct error named error

3907247
typedef	struct
you then created an instance of struct error named g1 using the typedef name

3907247
typedef	struct
struct names and typedef names occupy separate namespaces mdash

3907247
typedef	struct
you can combine a struct definition with a typedef definition

3907247
typedef	struct
in this case the struct type can only be referred to via the typedef

3907256
typedef	struct
this is a pretty basic use of a typedef struct in c

3907256
typedef	struct
the typedef acts as an alias renaming the struct error to just error so you can refer to items of this type by just the short name

3907257
rss	feed
is there any way of publishing this via say an rss feed via asp-net or a web service for it to be consumed into the outlook calendar

3907316
uilabel	uibutton
depending on the input data it currently returns uibutton uitextfields uilabel and my own subclass with more subclasses likely to be added later

3907356
ubuntu	linux
using eclipse version 3.5.2 and cdt 6.0.2 on ubuntu linux 10.04 lts

3907360
width	height
how can i calculate the width and height of an image in python

3907378
stdout	stderr
the main advantages of this is that you can call it in a variety of ways removing the need for specialized utilities to handle logging exceptions to stderr stdout and files

3907449
children	parent
another option would be to break these into two separate inserts one for the parent that returns the parent identity and one for the children that use that identity

3907463
hex	binary
viewing binary data in strings can sometimes be confusing especially if they re long but you can always convert it to some easier-to-read hex

3907555
hide	show
so when we say that encapsulation leads to abstraction or information hiding then it means that it gives us an idea which data to hide and which data to show to users.

3907599
post	put
i ve put together a small blog post and sample application to show how to enable digest authentication using the current rtm of openrasta

3907618
sat	np-complete
however basically it s np-complete because an efficient algorithm for the knapsack problem would also be an efficient algorithm for sat tsp and the rest

3907635
getter	setter
another way to achieve that is by making a getter and a setter for the health variable

3907659
accessor	properties
the properties accessor operators the dot and the bracket notation temporarily convert the string value to a string object for being able to access those methods

3907659
accessor	properties
and this happens because again the properties accessor on the second line above creates a new temporal object as

3907673
qdatastream	qbytearray
i would try something along the following lines let qdatastream do the work for you which can be constructed with a qbytearray let s call it yourbytearray

3907678
cassini	iis
moved my site from cassini to iis 7 - didnt work

3907711
sorting	filtering
you also need to figure out what filtering and sorting you will do

3907737
jar	manifest.mf
i m trying to find the cleanest code for the class to find out the manifest.mf file from the jar file it has been packaged into

3907844
portrait	landscape
there is no problem with portrait mode but when i try my app on landscape mode it doesn t look how it should.what is general aproach to solve this problem.my first idea is replacing x and y places.if i am on the right track how should i do this

3907855
jar	war
well if you know the jar is on the file system not inside a war and you also know that the security manager gives you the permission to access a class protection domain you can do it like this

3907888
rspec	capybara
cucumber + capybara + rails + rspec

3907900
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want it to change to visibility.visible on mouseenter on the grid and back on mouseleave

3907902
addclass	removeclass
use addclass and removeclass

3907928
rss	feed
in my iphone application i m parsing rss feed to get html and keep it

3907971
linqdatasource	detailsview
i have a page where i use two asp detailsview controls to render data from two different but related linqdatasource objects

3907971
linqdatasource	detailsview
my primary table is represented in the first detailsview linqdatasource set and i use the linqdatasource s built-in update functionality to persist changes when the detailsview is in edit mode

3907971
linqdatasource	detailsview
this is accomplished not via the linqdatasource but by handling the itemupdating event for the tags detailsview and using a datacontext to manually process the inserts and deletes

3907971
linqdatasource	detailsview
but the first detailsview uses its bound linqdatasource to do the update which has its own datacontext

3907996
textview	imageview
i am trying to create a custom cell with an imageview button textview and a label

3908026
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it runs ok width firefox and width opera now all perfect but google-chrome i dont know why it doesnt parse it ok here the answer of the debug send for me the second line of the code

3908056
ssl	https
and in the iis manager for each page that i want https i have changed its setting by checking require secure channel ssl and require 128 bit encryption

3908063
stdout	stderr
processing the child s stdout stderr in the parent python process is not an option since i couldn t find functionality for doing it in a non-waiting way and the parent python process must do other things while the child is running

3908078
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
perhaps firefox and opera adjust the workings of parsefloat to deal with locale variation but apparently google-chrome does not

3908120
hide	show
all i had to do was to add the hide and show methods to the toolpanel div

3908135
post	get
you might be better to post that data as there s a chance that you re actually sending it as a get request which can be dangerous on a few security levels

3908157
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the following code works on ie6 8 google-chrome firefox safari

3908206
google-chrome	firefox
in that case everything works fine with firefox and google-chrome assuming that the xml var is a string headers text html sent in php to be sure

3908211
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchescancelled	touchesended
with touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended and touchescancelled i then tried to play the audio files

3908216
sorting	grouping
i can easily quicksort any individual column using a quicksort recursive algorithm but grouping them together and then sorting those subgroups to the nth time is really messing with my head

3908228
innodb	myisam
i m having a problem with a innodb table was initally myisam but converted it to inndob awhile ago table

3908243
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add	multiplying	division	division	subtract
it s a small microcontroller digital signal processor capable of 40 mips million instructions per second. it is only capable of integer math add subtract and multiplying it can do division but it takes 19 cycles. it s being used to process an osd layer at the same time and only 3-4 mips of the processing time is available for calculations so speed is critical

3908247
actionscript	mxml
the actionscript class to which data is converted must be used or referenced in the mxml file for it to be linked into the swf file and available at run time

3908249
free	malloc
a poor man s solution would be to just log every call malloc and free then comb through the logs and look for pattern

3908265
ssl	https
https is essentially http over ssl tls which secures the communication between the client and the server

3908265
starttls	smtps
similarly communications between an smtps client and an smtps server can be secured using ssl tls there are two variants smtps over ssl tls directly on a specific port or tls initiated via starttls within the smtps protocol

3908273
uiview	uitouch
you might try putting a graphic of your keyboard in a custom uiview subclass calculating the hit rectangles for all the active areas multiple rectangles for the white keys and using a uitouch handler in the view subclass to track all the touches individually including what hit rectangles they initially hit get moved across to another where they are released and etc

3908279
client-side	server-side
i think you re conflating the server-side templating paradigm with client-side javascript

3908290
mouseup	mousedown
it has some code to respond to mouseup and mousedown events

3908290
mouseup	mousedown
when i run this on a mac and i press and hold the mouse button nothing happens - but as soon as i release the mouse button i instantly see both the mousedown and mouseup events delivered

3908304
hash-collision	key
if you can get the number of hash-collision to zero your hash function generates a unique value for every key that is actually passed to it you will have a perfect hash

3908315
int	chars
make sure you choose the correct overload for print println write in order to write the int value as a byte instead of as chars or string

3908319
stdout	stderr
you can t just use the stdout and stderr parameters

3908319
stdout	stderr
processing the child s stdout stderr in the parent python process is not an option since i couldn t find functionality for doing it in a non-waiting way and the parent python process must do other things while the child is running

3908329
put	get
i then just put some padding around the picture and you get the double-stroke border

3908329
width	height
setting fill_parent for both width and height does that but it also expands the background all the way to completely fill the cell resulting in a sort of letter boxing effect

3908396
google-chrome	firefox
it is working in ie but i am getting data as null in firefox and google-chrome

3908403
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in ie7+ firefox google-chrome safari and i believe opera you can place hover on any tag and in that case i would suggest you change the tag to a tag

3908414
width	height
at the moment it s working great but for pageloads time and such i m looking to restrain the normal users to a maximum of 300px images width and let s say around 500px height that are then resized in

3908418
width	height
the width or height of its superview

3908478
phpunit	simpletest
there are three that i use depending on the situation simpletest phpunit and zend_test which is really just a wrapper for phpunit to be used with the zend framework

3908492
width	height
just create a new image object with that url and check its width and height attributes after the onload event

3908495
phpunit	simpletest
but if phpunit isn t to your liking then you may want to check out simpletest a slightly different php testing framework

3908496
fgets	fread
just use fread or fgets

3908585
csv	tsv
if you need to pre-process your data do it with the above script then export back to csv tsv and use load data queries to finally import into your database

3908590
rss	feed
i am trying to read a simple twitpic rss feed but not having much luck

3908622
formview	linqdatasource
i m using a linqdatasource connected with a formview

3908639
fseek	ftell
the fseek and ftell is where my troubles begin

3908644
mvp	presenter
we re using asp.net with the mvp pattern and unity for ioc although this question is the same regardless of container. each presenter gets injected with an idatarepository that gets injected with an idataaccess which news up a linq to sql datacontext under the hood

3908669
prepare	execute
since you are basically doing the same inserts thousands of times you can prepare each insert before you start looping and then execute during the loop passing values as parameters

3908702
inherited	properties
you still need to declare the and elements in your master web.config file but any config section that inherited from configurationsection supports a configsource properties

3908717
button	checkbox
the application in question does not really rely on common controls radio button checkbox labels etc however there is the need for the user to be able to enter edit some text

3908730
int	double	int	chars
i have several variables of type chars array int and double

3908730
int	double
so when i m creating the table i need to tell it if it s varchar int double etc

3908754
int	double
so when i m creating the table i need to tell it if it s varchar int double etc

3908809
freebsd	linux
how does linux compare to freebsd and other operating systems in this regard

3908816
min	max
3 for each sample choose j such that min 0 p_j-1 x max 1 p_j

3908860
post	get
in order to get a better feel of why caliburn would be useful i recommend reading the series of post by rob eisenberg beginning here

3908878
wordpress	joomla
if you are just hosting files on the web and just need a cms have you considered one o the many open source projects such as wordpress joomla drupal or any of hte many others

3908914
inherited	properties
inherited properties are also enumerated

3908918
expression-blend	silverlight
so i created a layout in expression-blend 4 for my silverlight application

punctuation	words
this leaves the punctuation but gets the final words

3909110
width	height
don t know what your viewmodel code looks like but try creating a set for the width and height properties and set the binding mode to twoway

3909121
instances	transient
this will work since the framework does by default guarantee that controller instances are transient

3909127
put	get
and try to put gridview into edit mode by clicking btnedit then i get the exception

3909145
vsto	add-in
i ve got a vsto 3.0 word add-in that i d like to profile using vsts profiler

3909145
vsto	add-in
when i try to run an instrumenting run with the profiler though i get a warning that it can t be instrumented because the add-in dll is signed which from what i know about vsto they have to be signed

3909145
vsto	add-in
is there any way to turn off the signature verification on word vsto add-in

system.configuration	system.web
i did this by creating my own class vb class library adding the reference system.web system.configuration subsonic.dll and associated dlls i then added an app config with my connection string and service provider and then generated my classes i then built the class as a dll

3909194
google-chrome	firefox
however it works fine on the server that has ie 7 installed on it and when i try to view it using google-chrome firefox or ie 8 and above it kinda distorts the look of the website

3909208
listview	gridview	gridview	formview
in the page i d have formview control that will contain the edit fields for customerid and comments also i d have a nested gridview or listview that i could add line items to

3909208
gridview	formview
the formview and gridview controls would most likely be linked to independent datasource controls

3909208
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
is this even possible using the linqdatasource or objectdatasource objects

3909211
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you can code for standards compliant browsers google-chrome safari firefox etc. and then add conditional comments for internet explorer

hide	show
when you click on the window the application show hide the title bar

3909349
loginview	detailsview
our proposed view hierarchy is loginview - uinavigationview landingview + collectionview - uisplitviewcontroller detailsview

3909351
hide	show
one way to do it is to expose the dropdown list public and in your parent control check the child controls dropdown to see if it should show or hide the panel on page load

3909394
filtering	grouping
the samples that i have found only show simple filtering grouping etc

3909398
vsto	add-in
i ve got a vsto 3.0 word add-in

3909398
vsto	add-in
if i compile the project then run word outside of the ide the add-in registry entry is of course still pointing to the network copy of the vsto dll not a local machine c drive copy and the add-in always fails to load

3909398
vsto	add-in
but i was wondering if there s any way to config vsto to be able to load an add-in from a network share directly

3909416
queue	fifo
there isn t an fifo ordered a queue of things to be done that you can fill up in this way

3909553
google-chrome	firefox
i m not really sure whats the problem here it works with google-chrome and firefox but not ie

3909553
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome and firefox el is div element while ie is null

3909553
google-chrome	firefox
by right newdiv.firstchild should be the div element but i dont know why firefox and google-chrome register it as a text element and clearly my responsetext is something like this

3909560
put	get
simply put you can reach it via the method get int of vector

3909584
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller that contains a uitabbarcontroller with three tabs each tab being a uinavigationcontroller

3909588
int	double
if you try to call it with other types such as int or double its ambiguous -- the compiler doesn t know which you want as both are just a good or as bad if you prefer

3909592
put	get
so would i just get into vs 2008 do an open website from source control or whatever the string is and put it into a new website under wwwroot

3909596
union	distinct
according to at least for performance it is better to use union all since it does not actively distinct duplicates and as such is faster

we re starting new project and we need 100 width 100 height is a bonus 3 column pure css layout for business ria

3909713
width	height
i d like to have width and height of the currently focussed window

3909713
width	height
the selection of the window works like a charm whereas the height and width are always returning 1

3909772
opera	firefox
please see this example page in opera 10 and another browser like firefox 3.6

3909772
opera	firefox
interestingly using the generic serif font displays exactly the same in opera and firefox

3909772
opera	firefox
and now opera and firefox match almost exactly

3909790
division	modulo
bitwise and will beat modulo division every day of the week

3909794
matplotlib	mplot3d
i m currently using matplotlib 0.99.1 but should shortly be updating to 1.0.0 - i know i ll have to update my code for the mplot3d implementation

3909833
switching	screens
however when i switching to landscape mode the listview is taller than the screens

3909833
oncreate	setcontentview
according to the docs listactivity has a default layout that consists of a single full-screen list in the center of the screen. but if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate . so i don t think the listactivity is interfering

3909865
google-chrome	safari
my guess is that button being an inline element by default unless you overrode its display property somewhere else in code that s not here probably doesn t like the inner span being set to block thus unexpected behavior on safari windows and i d assume other webkit browsers unless there s something particularly special abt the windows version of safari over the mac version or over google-chrome

3909899
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works for firefox and google-chrome

3909917
getter	setter
the main problem is the use of getter and setter -- i m guessing you re java-born and bred

3909917
getter	setter
in python you don t need to write getter and setter for everything because you can always add them in later if you need them

3909921
background-image	background-color
for using gradients on simple element background you should declare gradient as background-image instead of just background-color

3909921
opera	google-chrome
but remember that border image has poor support from most browsers as of now even opera and google-chrome

3909930
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i am getting it exactly the same size in all browsers at least firefox opera and google-chrome

3909945
put	get
i didn t need to get results for each individual query either so i just put them all in a single call and fired it off to a single mysql_query which you can do from your controller in codeigniter like so since it ll throw a fit if you pass that to db query

3909956
filtering	grouping
use the array of catalogitems to filtering items while counting and grouping them

3909970
ubuntu	debian
for some reason it limit the size of the input while on debian ubuntu it s unlimited size

3910011
nsstring	nsdata
you can only store nsnumber nsstring nsarray nsdictionary nsdata on all versions of the plist format some allow nsdate too

3910080
folder	directory
i think that this may have to do with the working directory folder being different when running within visual studio

3910097
google-chrome	firefox
it works how i want in google-chrome and even in internet explorer but in firefox when i hover the links the divs won t change their visibility

3910120
glfw	sdl
am i able to achieve this by using glfw sdl or similar library or need i for example use different libraray for each task

running svn2git with the appropriate options will handle the trunk and branches directory correctly but how can i also include the history for the other folder

3910248
set	bag
note that you have to set the dimensions iirc it is minimum and not preferred although i could be wrong along with the grid bag constraints weight cell which part of the cell it binds to etc

3910275
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
sqlcachedependency uses sqldependency to integrate it with the asp caching infrastructure

3910279
min	max
2- if it isn t possible to do that i will have a parent opening the file instead of each child doing that that sends a struct with min and max limit and then the map procs will read whatever the lines they are responsible for process them and give the reduce process a result this doesn t matter for the problem now

3910311
voip	sip
sip is the most widely supported voip protocol

3910326
int	chars
my struct is 1 chars and 2 int

3910331
min	max
if all you are going to have is required min max then they should just be columns for the field last option

3910343
ready	each
each process starts by sending a byte up to the master to signal it s ready and blocking on read

3910365
put	get
montrã al.however if i put the i like this e in the code below i just get a space instead of the ã

3910368
implements	extends
in essence rather than extends either class directly create a wrapper class that extends control or something similarly low-level and implements idropdown add an idropdown field for the underlying control implementation you want to use and forward every method call of interest to the selected implementation

3910457
rss	feed
i m trying to read an rss field and add some metadata to each item in ruby outputting another valid rss feed

3910457
rss	feed
i d like to do this in one pass without reading the entire rss feed into memory for performance reasons but i ve been playing with libxml-ruby and the reader object doesn t seem to be able to print out the current element it has just read which makes it difficult to loop through an xml file and print out each element

3910458
post	get
get all the post for a particular month

3910484
int	boolean
get the value 3 with - each returns true but when you add boolean you get an int representation

powerpc	i386
my only other options are i386 various forms of powerpc and x86_64

3910568
google-chrome	firefox
how can i add outlines on input tags in other browser firefox explorer like google-chrome

you can add an hmac hash of the querystring using a secure random key stored only on the server then verify the hash on every request

3910646
put	get
i m starting to miss google app engine storage s simple get and put interface

3910678
opera	firefox
if you look at the page in firefox and opera it lays out perfect but ie does not seem to be obeying the height specifics and just making the table big enough to display the data does anybody know of a hack fix for ie or a way i can correct this.

3910698
google-chrome	firefox
i have an ogg video which works just fine using the video tag when i run it on localhost in either google-chrome or firefox

3910720
margin	height
obviously set the bottom margin to the height of the image

3910720
margin	height
otherwise you could try setting the bottom margin of the body tag to the height of the image then set the bottom setting for the image to - height of the image

3910749
selecteditem	selectedindex
the bug was caused because setting the selected property of a list item in a drop down does not unselect other items but setting the dropdownlist s selecteditem or selectedindex property does unselect previously selected items

3910762
profiler	aqtime
aqtime is a decent profiler and leak checker

3910773
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
fine in google-chrome safari ie9 not checked 7 8 yet but firefox is setting right -6px botom -3px.

3910800
mouse	keyboard
but pre-configured devices such as mouse keyboard and cd player are available in the guest

3910813

type book why do we need anything more than http get put post

3910859
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
but anyway the font doesn t look good in firefox google-chrome or opera on a pc

3910861
inherited	properties
i ll still keep my answer posted as another way to emit 2 different xml tags for a commonly inherited properties but i recommend you to look into xmlattributeoverrides as well

3910861
getter	setter
this base class set should contain all the necessary getter setter logic

3910922
webkit	gecko
it works as expected in webkit engine and for some reason that i am unable to figure out and i could use some fresh eyes on this gecko and opera add 5 extra pixels to #header width and not to #footer-container making a horizontal scrollbar appear on the body

3910928
jobs	cron
cron is a system process that runs the jobs you put it these jobs give you the job by writing to it in a text file

3910931
postgresql	mysql
for entering and storing the data i would use a relational database like sqlite mysql or postgresql

3910931
postgresql	mysql
for mysql i like phpmyadmin and for postgresql phppgadmin

3910934
microchip	dspic
you can also add an ethernet controller and use microchip s free tcp ip stack with their pic18 pic24 dspic and pic32 families

3910936
superclass	subclassing
i want to receive a queryset where each object belongs to a proxy class of a common superclass so that i can run custom subclassing methods with the same name and my controller logic doesn t need to know or care about which kind of proxy model it is working with

3910974
vim	emacs
if you are familiar with emacs vim you could use that via the ssh shell for small edits or use xemacs with x-session-forwarding over ssh

3910995
oncreate	ondestroy
to get the entire time the app is up you would want to diff between oncreate and ondestroy of your foremost activity class

3910995
onresume	onpause
for just the time the app is in the foreground use onresume and onpause in each of your activity classes and sum the time from each class

3911025
wordpress	joomla
a cms drupal django joomla wordpress etc

3911031
int	chars
moreover i want to create a method match that for string will return true if the starting portion of the string matches aaa would match aaa zzz because the first three chars of both strings are aaa but int shorts etc

3911031
int	chars
when key2 is an int short or chars match behaves like wherease if key2 is a std string i want it to do a prefix match

3911103
cdr	cons
t cons car l delete a cdr l

3911122
junit	jmockit
for example here is an almost complete junit test using the jmockit expectations api a tool i created to enable such tests

3911196
post	get
while reading a post on stackoverflow which is now marked as closed i came across an answer comment in fact that said the following the two inner loops could possibly get a speed boost by using uint64 and bit shifting

3911202
post	get
ok i have been writing a proxy to take http get requests and translate them into http post requests because a lot of media players for python only support get

3911221
for-loop	loops
since the condition of the for-loop is just v and v is now 0 which is a false value loops halts

3911240
bufferedreader	printwriter
in my original program messages were sent and recieved using a printwriter and a bufferedreader

3911240
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i am now trying to do the same thing but sending across objects rather than text with an objectoutputstream and an objectinputstream

3911288
typedef	struct
note that the typedef are needed to allow c code to refer to bg fg and colour without a prefix struct or enum

3911370
uiview	calayer
does that mean the the view controller has multiple uiview or that the uiview has more than one calayer

3911370
uiview	subviews
or does the uiview have another uiview subviews

3911433
vb.net	vb6
i need to call a vb.net dll in vb6 application does anybody has any ideas

3911440
qthread	qobject
you should wrap your code up in a qobject subclass instantiate it and use a qobject movetothread to move your object into the qthread context so that processing will occur in the context of that qthread

3911476
put	get
i can checkout the contribution by itself but if i try to checkout the contribution and put in the same directory on my computer as the main project i get an error message from tortoise svn stating this directory is in use for another url

3911527
submit	submission
they want you to submit to them an expression that will return the values assigned to the name1 name2 and name3 variables whatever they may be - there are two examples of such expressions above - which concatenate the three name variables and add a comma between them - have you tried submission either of the examples above

3911565
min	max
these should both take a min value m and a max value m and return the list of integers from min to max exluding the max value m-1

3911606
width	height
connect fixed to size_allocate signal and in the signal handler get the fixed allocation width and height then get the drawingarea to make a size_request of the current allocation

3911606
width	height
to avoid doing a lot of extra unnecessary work in the second signal i just return if the previous height width match the new allocation

3911612
typedef	struct
inside of this first step towards a bootstrapped scheme interpreter i find the following set of typedef struct union and enum definitions

3911613
width	height
either define the height to be taller since the content is taller or don t define the width height and let it auto size

3911651
int	boolean
now an object can hold two different values a boolean or an int so the union now serves a purpose

3911678
x86	64bit
a x86 build can access 4 gb on 64bit windows so that s the theoretical upper limit for the process

3911683
toolbar	tabs
if so using toolbar which don t require changing tabs and palette windows which may require changing tabs but there can be several open at a time might be a more efficient choice

3911707
opera	safari
because the function.prototype.tostring method returns an implementation-dependent representation of a function and in some implementation such older safari versions mobile opera and some blackberry browsers they don t actually return anything useful

3911719
int	boolean
also you are converting a boolean int in c into an address

3911727
g++	gcc
i think in gcc g++ there is a warning for this

3911783
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome always works but ie and firefox only some times

3911794
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
nsxmlparser can parse url data if we parse url directly it will freeze the ui main thread instead of that you can use data parsing by using nsxmlparser.please go through nsurlconnection api for asynchronous fetching the data

3911811
mouse	keyboard
working quickly in visual studio is all about good navigational keyboard shortcuts not mouse clicking

3911824
integer	fractions
we d like to make a parser that doesn t care whether the numbers in the fractions are integer or real

3911844
put	get
if i just put in a constructor function without the for-loop i get the building s to draw so the problem lies somewhere in my for-loop and the way i m trying to make and or store the objects

3911845
jar	war
basically you neet to create a war archive where the stripes jar lies in the directory web-inf lib

3911871
prepare	execute
note the use statement does not support being a prepare statement so you have to execute it using the driver api

3911879
cdr	cons
then cons the result to the cdr which also needs to be cleaned hint but only if there is something to cons

3911880
super	implements
2 is it super easy to way to implements meaning 3rd party grails apis or plug-ins and or spring apis

3911882
maven	pom.xml
if you also need the values in the pom.xml you will have to do some more processing probably using the maven properties plugin or something similar

3911884
children	parent
each parent has a number of children each child a single parent creating a multi-level hierarchy

3911906
post	get
following is the post string that would get fired from the clients

3911906
post	put
also i noticed that even if i put something irrelevant to the right of the post string like post s httpgarbage 1.0 r n the transfer still happens it would be grand if i am informed about this behavior as well

3911916
width	margin
i am trying to get my site to auto center a div that has a bunch of divs inside of it on the page by using a set width and defining a margin of 0 auto

3911932
matplotlib	mplot3d
the place i m looking at in the matplotlib code is your_python_lib_site-packages mpl_toolkits mplot3d axis3d.py in the draw function

3911932
matplotlib	mplot3d
i wonder if the matplotlib people even know that the minor tick marks don t work in mplot3d

3911976
children	parent
try relative on the parent and absolute for the children

3911983
ienumerable	ilist
web data-binding isn t against ilist and hence ilistview itypedlist etc but rather ienumerable

3912000
extjs	qooxdoo
this technique is often used by ria frameworks like qooxdoo extjs etc

3912016
tunnel	vpn
you need ip tunnel a basic vpn service would work but you might need multicast routing above that depending upon your configuration

3912018
equals	gethashcode
most places you ll see use the same semantic logic for overriding equals as gethashcode for memberwise equality...however they usually use different implementations

3912018
equals	gethashcode
if you re implementing memberwise equality for your type lets say for storing in a dictionary why not just override gethashcode then do something like this for equals

3912045
equals	gethashcode
so you cannot really implement equals in terms of gethashcode

3912045
equals	gethashcode
this is why you have collisions in a hash table and why a hash table lookup must involve call s to both gethashcode and equals

3912046
typedef	struct
ok guys we all know there are all lot of typedef struct questions out there but i feel this one is a bit of a mind bender

3912046
typedef	struct
i have a struct called ball_struct which i typedef as just ball

3912046
typedef	struct
the struct contains a pointer to a list of ball_structs since i couldn t use the typedef name before its own declaration that the ball considers its neighbors

3912046
typedef	struct
is there a way to cast the typedef back down to its respective struct

3912046
typedef	struct
if not is there anyway i can add a ball to a ball_struct list so i don t have to remove the typedef and paste struct keywords all over my code

3912046
typedef	struct
the struct typedef

3912094
typedef	struct
ps you may want to consider using the same name for your struct and the typedef of the struct

3912102
x86	64bit
on an lp64 x86 system the long primitive type is 64bit wide least significant byte first

3912102

there s also emacs vim e and others out there

3912152
vim	textmate
text editors over ides such as vim with plugins textmate etc

3912199
moq	moles	moq	typemock	moq	justmock	justmock	moles	justmock	typemock	typemock	moles
isolation frameworks like typemock justmock and moles have a completely different technical background compared to free mocking frameworks like rhino moq etc

3912204
postgresql	mysql
note i looked for the function in postgresql mysql and mssql and found none so i assumed all sql does not support it

3912249
cube	skybox
the only problem with skybox is that the edges of the cube may be visible under certain conditions

3912275
getter	setter
also do i need to use the getter and setter methods if i am using the baseadapter class in my application

3912285
rss	feed
and you can access atom version of any rss feed without any problem - that is the service no login required that google reader api gives you for free

inherited	properties
inherited my control from repeater it self so that i don t have to provide code for template properties

3912507
getter	setter
if you donâ t want to do it the right way by using a nscell youâ ll have to add instance variables to your nscontrol subclass to store the target and action and override the getter and setter to use them

3912507
inherited	subclassing
if youâ re using a custom cell that is not a subclassing of nsactioncell just change it so that it does inherited from nsactioncell instead of nscell

3912507
getter	setter
if you cannot do this for example because youâ re subclassing a nscell subclass you cannot change youâ ll have to add the instance variables for target and selector to your cell class and override itâ s setter and getter

3913204
folder	directory
to create a jar right-click the project on eclipse - export - java - jar file then select the folder you want to include in the jar in your case i guess this includes the folder gen and libs libs being the folder with the httpmime apache-mime4j jars but probably neither res nor the root directory of your project with files such as androidmanifest.xml that will cause problems with the same file in the dependent projects

3913220

i think you need to put the config.properties file into a source folder when you build the project you can create a resources folder as a src folder and put the config file in it than you can get the file in the app

3913357
innodb	myisam
should i use innodb or myisam

3913427
put	get
so you really have to put the or with the null to get the desired result

3913485
jar	manifest.mf
i should have listed the content of the wordpad output when i double clicked on the manifest.mf file in the jar i got

3913490
outputstream	inputstream
one way i could find is to use assetmanager and then with help of inputstream and outputstream i can write this file onto the device the first time it is run and then use it

3913491
google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome and firefox

3913515
jar	manifest.mf
you can extract the manifest.mf from the meta-inf directory of your jar file by using

3913516
xslt	schematron
so if you do need verify more complex relationship in a xml document you can use xpath and xslt to do this see schematron xml schema language comparison beyond w3c xml schema improving xml document validation with schematron advanced xml validation and using xslt as a validation language

3913526
google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way to find out what the problem is is to inspect the element in firefox or google-chrome using right-click - inspect element firebug needs to be installed in firefox for this

3913531
jar	manifest.mf
it s basically inside your jar s manifest file under meta-inf manifest.mf

i like to keep it simple an address is a single attribute being the plaintext you must put on an item of mail for it to be delivered by the post office to the addressable entity in question

3913625
disk	ram
but i have access to large clusters with oodles of disk and lashings of ram and your platform might dictate another possibly more sophisticated approach

3913745
width	height
but the curframe bitmap image even though not null has a width and height of -1 in the debugger

3913820
subobject	instances
it s an optimization because instances of the derived class take up less space than they would have if the base class subobject were required to have non-zero size

3913820
allocator	stl
i think the proliferation of allocator objects in stl templates was part of the reason - a std vector typically would be the size of 3 pointers with the empty base optimization and 4 pointers without it due to alignment

3913854
multiplying	add
it s also possible for a vector to be something else entirely for example a bounded function on the interval 0 1 is a vector because you can multiplying it by a real number and add it to another function on the interval and it will satisfy certain requirements namely the axioms of a vectorspace

3913861
children	parent
the only thing to keep in mind is that the popular parent takes care of deleting children system which qt uses is only available for qobject sub- classes

3913870
getter	setter
also do i need to use the getter and setter methods if i am using the baseadapter class in my application

3913881
firefox	safari
similarly web browsers tend to favor these conventions ie uses r n newlining whereas safari and firefox use n

3913884
google-chrome	firefox
another problem boy this is way more interesting than i thought is that in google-chrome and firefox at least any year before 100 is treated as an abbreviation for a year in the 20th century

3913901
postgresql	mysql
this template argument is a class type derived from this base class such as sqlite postgresql and mysql

3913966
perl	tcl
i assume you re talking about a perl array which is known as a list in tcl

3913987
postgresql	mysql
it does support sqlite postgresql and mysql as well as oracle firebird and odbc

width to height

3914013
int	double	int	chars
i want to pass several array data types such as double chars long int etc

3914033
keydown	keyup
some browsers blur this line somewhat but the general principle is that the keyup and keydown events are there to detect any key being pressed and telling you about which key it is while keypress is for detecting an actual character being typed

3914107
put	get
the only way i know to do this is to get the .app file in mac put it into a folder called payload

3914130
outputstream	inputstream
one way i could find is to use assetmanager and then with help of inputstream and outputstream i can write this file onto the device the first time it is run and then use it

3914143

3914535
folder	directory
i identified in my view storage directory it is creating multiple folder related to the view

3914556
client-side	server-side
anyway as everyone said php is server-side and even as cli you need to have a server on your localhost and that will just execute a php script php that don t have access to mouse mouse movement etc without a client-side language like javascript

3914579
for-loop	arrays
i have stored the images in arrays .i want to know how to display those images in uiimageview where the uiimageview should be created dynamically according to filelist count increases in for-loop

3914583
allocator	stl
a counterexample here is something like the allocator policy class in stl containers - you don t necessarily want your containers to derive from it but you want to keep it around without it taking up overhead

3914610
yslow	pagespeed
in addition to firebug and yslow mentioned by tim s van haren there s also pagespeed by google also a firebug add-on

can anyone tell me how to reduce the width and height of checkbox in order to display very small checkbox in android

3914732
integer	fractions
i assume you ve already defined a single number which can be integer or real - doesn t matter you are converting everything to float anyway - and a fractions of two numbers probably something like this

3914735
google-chrome	safari
it appears a reduction in right padding for google-chrome and safari solves the issue

3914738
post	put
that will run the same post build event you defined in your project but you could put any msbuild tasks inside those target elements

3914740
for-loop	arrays
by incrementing count your for-loop tries to access an object which is not in the arrays anymore

3914760
ostringstream	std
let s specialise that though when our type is already a std string as it is pointless going through ostringstream

3914778
button	checkbox

i want press some keys in the children windows and propagate the event in the parent

3914809
children	parent
but when i press key on the children the event is not propagate to the parent

3914829
hide	show
you could hide the footer using javascript and show it when a button is clicked

google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome appear to behave better but since this is a corporate intranet application they are not really an option

3914832
google-chrome	firefox

3914959
getter	setter
which eclipse extention and in it which shourtcut will create getter and setter for me to get something like

3914975
getter	setter
or go to the source menu and select the generate getter and setter option

3914995
getter	setter
in eclipse right click on the source code and choose source - generate getter and setter

3914995

3915219
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the strange thing is that when i use an image of 1400px wide ie8 in compatibility view firefox google-chrome safari and opera all scales this image down to 765px in the width - but not ie8

3915241
accessor	properties
using object.defineproperty you can create properties with accessor functions - so you could implement a properties like length in arrays that varies depending on the object state

3915249
nunit	mstest
i am using nunit asserts within a mstest project like as follows note this shouldn t matter see comments to dave falkner s answer

3915249

i m overriding mstest s asserts with nunit s because i like the fluent style better

3915249
nunit	mstest
lastly i m using mstest because i m having issues with nunit

3915259
crypt	hash
as i understand it dpapi uses a hash calculated from the user s actual password so you would need both an open-source implementation of the crypt functions and an explicit password from the user

3915293
jboss	glassfish
i have a web service built by java and deployed on two application servers named glassfish and jboss

3915315
metaclass	subclassing
i m trying to writing a generic metaclass for tracking subclassing

3915315
metaclass	subclassing
i tried adding the metaclass attribute later so that at least it can be applied in subclassing

3915315
metaclass	subclassing
i m looking for suggestions in order to do this either change a class metaclass at runtime in a way that it is applied to its subclassing or any other alternative

pypdf	pdfminer
not exactly an answer to your exact question but you might want to have look at existing pdf parsing libraries in python for example pdfminer or pypdf

3915452
cpu	processors
when doing context switching on a single-core processors the code responsible is executed on the only cpu which takes care of switching the threads

3915460
winpcap	wireshark
however i see that on windows winpcap wireshark doesn t support ethernet capture over usb

3915498
hide	show
i would define three different listviews and either show hide them as appropriate or add remove them

3915502
crypt	hash
one thing you could do is use crypt and attempt to hash a pass with the various id types essentially probing pam or more properly probing libc s crypt which pam uses for shadowed passwords

3915525
gridview	repeater
if you are using other page for editing maybe you should use repeater instead of gridview and instead of the linkbutton just an hyperlink with url

3915588
maven	pom.xml
of course it is kind of against maven best practice one pom.xml one artifact but it is adobe flex project that produces many swf modules and it is really makes no sence to create a separate project for each module

3915640
put	get
and for bonus it would be cool if they could browse for an image that would get posted to flicker and be put in editor with the correct url as well

3915643
uitextview	uimenuitem
i have successfully been able to add a custom uimenuitem to the copy paste menu in my iphone app and even subclassed uitextview to get rid of the standard menu items

3915643
uitextview	uimenuitem
for example if the text in the uitextview is this is a test. and the person touched the word is it would add that word as a uimenuitem to the uimenucontroller

3915658
profiling	benchmarking
it s going to be hard to profiling that code with -o2 because for trivial functions the compiler will unroll the loop and you won t be able to benchmarking actual differences in compares

3915666
rss	feed
i would like to configure our mercurial server installation so the rss atom feed will publish the branch name of the changeset in addition to the standard fields title guid description author pubdate

the textlabel of the cell displays the text and i add a uiview with some uiimageviews as its subviews to the cells contentview

3915746
jar	war
you can write your own maven plugin and invoke war and jar plugins with mojo executor

3915746
maven	pom.xml
this is a more general problem with maven 2 it doesn t allow any pom.xml code reuse expect properties and custom plugins

3915797
folder	directory
you ll need to run the terminal app to do the rest its in the utilities folder of the application directory

3915808
versioning	upgrade
i have recently upgrade from cruisecontrol .net 1.4.3.x on our build machine to the latest versioning available from sourceforge which is 1.5.7256.1 and since then the xml output that is used by cradiator and cctray contain lots more information than is required as both output them straight to the screen

3915902
int	double
check out the parse tryparse methods of the int float and double types

3915905

3915905
awt	swing
don t use awt components in a swing application

3915909
mouseup	mousedown
i ve never done it but it should be possible to use the mousedown and mouseup events to select any rows that are under the cursor when you move the mouse while holding one of the buttons down

3915916
width	height
in other words if your aspect ratio is 0.5 and the sizeincreasethreshold is 10 you are going to increase the height by 10 but the width by 5 each time the command is executed

3915917
post	get
but i was wondering if anyone knows how to make a hyperlink pass some variables and use post like a form as opposed to get

3915942
mouse	keyboard
you can of course do such a thing in javascript by implementing a document-wide keyboard and or mouse listener and a periodical method with a timeout

3915963
int	chars
x y works differently for value types chars int float etc and reference types object int yourclass int ... for value types returns true if x and y are just the same value whereas for reference types returns true if x and y denote the same object - for two objects with different values the result can be false

3915963
abc	subclassing
x.equals y is by default in object.equals implemented just as x y but many subclassing override it for example for strings x.equals y checks if those strings have the same value despite if they are same objects or not so new string abc .equals new string abc is true and abc .equals abc is true

3915982
for-loop	arrays
you probably want to initialize every point in the arrays using a for-loop

3915986
bash	zsh
if you don t have readlink or realpath utilities than you can use following function which works in bash and zsh not sure about the rest

3915990
post	get
try using get_posts to get your post sorted by your custom taxonomy set up a variable that is initially an empty string called current_cat or something and with each loop of the results check the taxonomy and compare it with current_cat - if different print out a header for the new category and then the entry if the same print out an entry as usual

3916020
put	get
but if i put the z loop inside the q loop i get strange results

3916050
udp	tcp
use udp instead of tcp

3916077
width	height
for example you could print the width and height of the first screen by doing something like the following

3916089
draggable	droppable
i did a few experiments with draggable and droppable but i can t get to to work keeping them sortable

3916093
post	get
is there an easy way to get all post s that contain a tag starting with foo using linq

3916096

in the buildhql method i don t know how to access min and max properties of my range class to build a hqltreenode

3916129
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve added an extjs quicktip qtip to an extjs combobox and it works well in firefox google-chrome safari but not in ie7 and ie8

3916144
draggable	droppable
i recommend using jquery a javascript framework which easily allows you to make objects like divs draggable and droppable in a cross-browser compliant manner

3916150
hide	show
script runs when this specific value is chosen and dynamically changes the class of input object from hide to show hidden and visible with css display

3916191
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox but not in google-chrome

3916204
getter	setter
you now have a variable myarray which can be accessed through setter and getter synthesized by apple

3916211
google-chrome	safari
since for most sites it is actually the size of the screen that matters and not so much the capabilities at least when talking about modern phones with things like safari and google-chrome on them wouldn t checking the resolution make the most sense

3916218
ant	maven
i don t know if you use maven but if you do i d use resource filtering to inject the properties into the sql files at deploy time there are similar solutions for ant also and let spring s propertyplaceholderconfigurer use the same property files at run time

3916227
addition	multiplication
even though multiplication has precedence over addition the compiler is free to perform the calls to the functions in any order it likes and might call a or b before or after it performs the multiplication

3916281
code-signing	authenticode
authenticode -- the code-signing that signtool does -- is different which is why the exe doesn t run after the signing

3916302
post	get
i m intending to do a bunch of testing on this stuff and take another view trying to compromise the security of the page from the client end after the page has been served but unless i start throwing about the names of server objects in the page s get or post i can t see that there would be much of a problem or surely there would be issues with the standard data grids and whatnot

3916308
nant	psake
i would guess that working through things there - and especially looking at what was already done - would be much more fruitful than a single question here as the vast majority of mainstream c# users use msbuild nant psake or another .net specific tool-chain

3916311
jar	war
so i need to copy to war file in specific folder module1 jar

3916314
division	multiplication
i m vaguely familiar with rounding problems and floating point math but i thought that applied to division and multiplication only and would be visible in the output

3916326
udp	tcp
lott points out you could instead use udp which is packet-based instead of tcp which is stream-based but then you give up the other features that tcp provides retransmission of dropped packets sequential packets and congestion control

3916379
fixed-point	fractions
this kind of problem occurs because there is no perfect fixed-point representation for your fractions 0.1 0.2 etc

3916384
put	get
put aside swing for a moment and get the web service call working on its own

3916399
width	height
i think the solution for you here is to listen to size changed callbacks and reset your idea of width and height accordingly

3916409
hide	show
when preload is complete hide preloader show image reset opacity

3916440
rss	feed
it happened when i tried to use the on a list of a few thousand rss feed urls which i tried to parse with multiple concurrent threads

last day of the month select dateadd ms -3 dateadd mm datediff m 0 getdate + 1 0

3916489

apple s reference for that is here but ensuring you have a setter and getter is sufficient

3916568
boost	stl
my question is that this seems such a natural and obvious extension to vector so why isn t it part of the stl or even boost

3916584
junit	jmock
you need to move the junit library down your classpath after jmock in the eclipse project properties

3916584
junit	jmock
junit v3 is part of android.jar so you can t use junit 4 style jmock tests

3916592
windows	wow64
strangely the 32-bit environment is called wow64 when 32-bit windows did this for 16-bit apps it was called wow16

3916592
windows	wow64
in wow64 everything looks like a 32-bit windows

pop-up	dialog
the start and end date selectors are widgets which are made up of a jspinner and a calendar dialog which pop-up if button is clicked

3916613
floating-point	fixed-point
basically perl is dealing with floating-point numbers while you are probably expecting it to use fixed-point

3916613
subtract	add
that way there is no floating point ambiguity during add and subtract operations

3916687
width	height
when i try your code i get an exception from jcarousel stating that since no width and height is set for the elements an infinite loop will occur which if unhandled in your version would explain your too much recursion and out of memory errors

3916728
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and google-chrome i can switch back and forth between the parent and child but in firefox if i click on the parent window focus goes to the child which just flashes tauntingly

3916880
ironruby	ironpython
i was at a talk by one of the guys working on ironpython and ironruby

3916880
ironruby	ironpython
the general sentiment he seemed to express is that ironpython is not as up to the task of building modern asp.net mvc sites as ironruby or c# are

3916901
width	height
that is the widget s size request will be width by height

3916901
width	height
pygtk def set_size_request width height

3916932
for-loop	loops
this means that instead of pattern in one of the for loops given the linked question your first for-loop should contain your directory name then take this variable concatenated with the character to obtain only the files you re looking for

3916983
serializable	deserialization
there s going to be some overhead for xml serializable and deserialization in the data-service but that much

3917083

3917132
portrait	landscape
my ipad application supports landscape and portrait orientations -so far so good

3917132
portrait	landscape
it is as if the uiview i m loading tries to load first in portrait mode but then it realizes it is in landscape mode and autorotates

3917152
decoder	encoder
your application can use predefined .net framework encoder and decoder fallbacks or it can create a custom encoder fallback derived from the encoderfallback and encoderfallbackbuffer classes or a custom decoder fallback derived from the decoderfallback and decoderfallbackbuffer classes

nltk	opennlp
however i think there s not a toolkit such as nltk or opennlp in perl

if there s no content in the button make sure you set the height width otherwise it won t stretch to fit the button

3917270
rational-numbers	fractions
number fractions lets you work with rational-numbers fractions instead of decimals something like this constants is imported to automatically convert strings like 11 10 into number fractions objects

3917277
post	get
i ve done similar for ping in the past perhaps you can modify it to use telnet to post a http get on 443

3917299
actionscript	haxe
this works with haxe but should be possible with actionscript 3 too

3917336

this worked since jbossas has it s jta transaction manager defined at jndi location java transactionmanager

3917511
uiview	subviews
don t be afraid of uiview as subviews as opposed to constantly using uiviewcontrollers

3917518
range	median
also i only want to perform the median on values that fall within a chosen time range and the solution can t alter the database which isn t mine

3917525
firefox	safari
i know that particular behavior works under firefox and safari

3917525
firefox	safari
check out cp 3146842.3146844.3146854 -- the like button with comments works in firefox and safari but not ie

3917528
post	get
in practice many firewalls and other network intermediaries block http verbs other than get and post

3917528
post	put
to work around this issue wcf data services and the odata standard support a technique known as verb tunneling. in this technique put delete and merge requests are submitted as a post request and an x-http-method header specifies the actual verb that the recipient should apply to the request

3917528
post	get
silverlight supports only the get and post http methods

3917528
post	get
it is important to point out that true restful service can be created conforming to all the rest principles listed above only using the get and post http methods in other words the rest architecture does not require a specific mapping to http

3917528
post	put
the following http methods overrides may be set in the header to accomplish the put and delete actions if the web services interpret the x-http-method-override header on a post

3917534
zsh	eshell
the one thing i have yet to try and seems to be the biggest obstacle thus far is the built-in emacs shell shell and or eshell here on referred to as eshell due to having zsh setup perfectly for me

3917534
zsh	eshell
can eshell be treated as a superset of zsh eshell can do everything that zsh can plus more

3917534
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh	zsh	eshell
i assume eshell lacks quite a bit compared to standard shells bash zsh ksh tcsh etc. otherwise it would be one of the standard shells correct me if i m wrong to think about it that way

3917534
zsh	eshell
what are the main limitations in using eshell over zsh

3917534
zsh	eshell
any folks switch from zsh to eshell and feel there are aspects of zsh you critically miss

3917534
zsh	eshell
anyone know of any links resources doing a zsh eshell feature comparison

3917534
zsh	eshell
if eshell isn t as powerful as zsh then what advantage does eshell have over zsh

3917534
zsh	eshell
should one just give up on eshell and continue using zsh if it does everything i think i need

3917700
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
when you click on the button all the boxes should go down then the value in the textare comeup in the first box and same should happen as many times you click on the button this is working fine in mozilla and opera but not is google-chrome and safari also in ie6 in these browsers no new boxes come down only existing

3917702
inherited	properties
it aims at being more adaptable so you can use whatever js inherited events properties style you d like

3917710
post	get
why i am not sure why following the two examples mentioned in my post did not work i figured out how to get it to work

3917710
oncreate	onstart
i had to move the attachment of my listener to the button in the dialog s onstart method from the dialog s oncreate method

3917711
disk	ram
if i have an event that starts a timer with an interval of say 30 minutes and 15 minutes later the computer the app is running on sleeps suspend to ram or hibernates suspend to disk and is brought back online after ten minutes will the timer raise its tick event in 5 minutes 30 minutes real time from the start or 15 minutes 30 minutes runtime from the start

3917728

the problem that i m running into is that when i m transitioning through pictures using the fadein and fadeout jquery functions it is fading out the links as well

3917755
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the newer versioning of the sdk

3917786
apache	nginx
you might be able do this by using apache or nginx as the front-end proxy and writing rewrite rules to forward or reject requests depending on the username i m not sure

3917826
put	get
you should be able to get the effect you want if you put the text in a separate div from the image

3917829
inherited	properties
so you could create class nullablebeta that inherited beta while properties name and isnullable are virtual on beta entity

3917866
int	boolean
wasn t sure if this should only be used for int and boolean

3917891
integer	unsigned
if it s signed and you re passing in an unsigned integer then you may be getting an unexpected minus sign in btmpsms

3917898
uiview	subviews
it looks like ccuiviewwrapper adds their contained uiview to the root window as a subviews so essentially the order of things is everything cocos2d then any ccuiviewwrappers on top of it

3917923
sudo	passwd
i can access my mysql server on my remote ubuntu 10.04 machine downstairs local network just fine through ssh and when i sudo in to mysql monitor using the mysql passwd i can modify any of the tables

3917928
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome behaves as i want but for some reason each coretablerow isn t getting pushed down to accommodate the height of the inner coretablecell divs in ie

3918001
width	height
then depending on the height and width parameters you can decide to use different files with varying sizes for the watermark

3918021
move	drag
if i have a list of labels i would like to drag and move them around much like the icons on your desktop

3918028
sorting	grouping
currently i am grouping the data on the x-axis into tuples and sorting them before plotting.

3918086
disk	ram
on any modern system this will not be mapped to existing memory in the executable file on disk or in ram of your execution machine unless you will really access it

3918112
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works correctly in firefox google-chrome and safari

3918122
folder	directory
the fullname represents file directory so i would like to display results for certain parent folder instead of the individual files

3918165
afp	smb
my plan was to use links with the smb or afp url which includes the mount address and location of the file

3918199
put	get
so when i put a random line between this lines of code i get that error

3918236
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to get this to work in firefox and google-chrome but ie pushed the image way out to the right

3918299
client-side	server-side
how can i make it so that clicking on node_a is handled by javascript client-side instead of c# server-side

3918305
folder	directory
either to copy the xml files in the temp folder or to actually serve the files from the bin directory directly not sure if this is possible

3918345
apache-poi	jxls
alternatives to apache-poi are jxls open source or aspose.cells for java proprietary

3918381
google-chrome	firefox
if i do a quick alert lastrowid i get coursesection 1 in google-chrome firefox and ie8

3918398

update the set accessor on the name properties to call an objectmodified method that changes the modified and revision properties

3918399
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfect in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome or opera

3918423
public	protected
11.2p1 if a class is declared to be a base class for another class using the private access specifier the public and protected members of the base class are accessible as private members of the derived class

3918444
inherited	properties	doublebuffered	double-buffering
rather than setting the doublebuffered properties on the form the best solution i have found is to create a new class that inherited from tablelayoutpanel and in that class constructor enable double-buffering

3918451
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
firefox opera google-chrome already support google-chrome video etc..

3918502
pop-up	dialog
i have no idea why and it makes no sense to me but removing the selected attribute made it pop-up the dialog without a reload

3918526
integer	unsigned
if i undestood correctly your problem is how to convert the input which is really a signed-byte sbyte but that input is stored in a unsigned integer and then also avoid negative values by converting them to zero

3918539
move	drag
this solution mostly works but it will occasionally act glitchy when i drag the view around particularly when i move it around quickly with mouse or drag it around past the view bounds

3918549
rss	feed
then you can access the rss feed with

3918552
qtreeview	qfilesystemmodel
how do i set a custom background color for certain rows in a qfilesystemmodel applied on a qtreeview

3918585
cgsize	cgrect
it will work out a cgsize you can use to make your cgrect etc

3918605
put	get
you only get a top bar if you put a uinavigationcontroller inside the uisplitviewcontroller in the first place

3918605
put	get
so all you need to do is to put another uinavigationcontroller inside the uinavigationcontroller and you will get another bar

3918611
udp	tcp
udp is actually expected to work better than tcp in lossy networks or congested networks

3918611
udp	tcp
tcp is far better at transferring large quantities of data but when the network fails it s more likely that udp will get through

3918611
udp	tcp
in fact i recently did a study testing this and it found that snmp over udp succeeded far better than snmp over tcp in lossy networks when the udp timeout was set properly

3918611
udp	tcp
generally tcp starts behaving poorly at about 5 packet loss and becomes completely useless at 33 ish and udp will still succeed eventually

3918611
udp	tcp
most stacks these days can actually use both tcp and udp

3918626
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
i think maybe you are implementing the onclicklistener in the wrong place - usually you should definitely implement an onitemclicklistener in your activity and set it on the listview instead or you will get problems with your events.

3918663
bash	zsh
it doesn t have its own scripting language like bash zsh etc

3918663
bash	zsh	zsh	eshell
i can t speak to zsh vs eshell but i ve mostly switched from bash to eshell

3918663
zsh	eshell
it s going to be really hard because zsh has a full scripting language whereas eshell is basically an interface to the elisp interpreter

3918663
put	get
for a silly example try message hello world | cut -f 1 -d some commands notably grep get put in emacs buffers so you can quickly jump to the results

3918679
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

3918734
subtract	add
simply add the amount to the borrower s total and subtract amounts from the lenders who receive the payment

3918769

3918779
udp	tcp
also shouldn t your try and listen to udp and tcp

3918795
width	height
this method also seems to fall apart if the user resizes the page as the height and width of .ie_shadow is set explicitly and not recalculated automatically

3918830
put	get
i had to put it in a t4 template to get access to the current visual studio dte otherwise it would randomly work if i tried it outside of a t4

3918834
superclass	subclassing
for a subclassing is there way i can remove stop methods from superclass implementation

3918957
hide	show
show hide

3918957
hide	show
functions are there to show hide divs

3918968
integer	unsigned
up for consideration is the following function which can be used to relatively quickly factor a 64-bit unsigned integer into its prime factors

i m using rails 3 devise and cancan

3919075
rss	feed
my program is scraping rss feed and tucking the results into redis

use the onresume to load data so you can clean up and save memory effectively with the onpause

3919187
processors	hyperthreading
a dual-core hyperthreading processors may be able to execute 4 threads simultaneously - depending on what the thread is doing no contention on io or memory access etc

3919194
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

3919208
width	height
i m using the post thumbnail feature to show portfolio work so for example the problem is i want to show a particular width of image only which is 640 but because my pieces are website they have varying height

3919208
width	height
but it s specifying the height how can i only specify the width

3919219
bufferedreader	gzipinputstream
tell the server that you support gzip and wrap a bufferedreader around gzipinputstream if the response header says the content is compressed

3919234
integer	unsigned
since you are using unsigned int and it won t fit in a single unsigned int then the compiler must use a second integer and store the last 24 bits in that last integer

3919239
width	height
you can calculate the ratio height from width

3919239
width	height
newheight height newwidth width

3919242
int	chars
the problem is that charat gives you a chars which you then convert into an int

3919325
unsigned	short
use smaller types for your bit-fields unsigned short and unsigned char and regroup the bit-fields so that they fill the allocated unit entirely - that way you should be able to pack things as tightly as possible

3919327
irc	xmpp
you can use orbited along with js.io for the browser and either xmpp or irc as the underlying system

3919330
src	attr
so i need to use an iframe i ve figured out and have tried to .wrap a link around it and specify the link as an iframe with the dimensions specified grabbing attr src for the link

3919392
width	height
i am having trouble splitting a screen into 4 divs with width and height of 50

3919392

innodb	myisam
in a table with 5 millions rows a would be instant in myisam but would take several seconds in innodb

3919427
innodb	myisam
why haven t they optimise count in innodb like myisam

3919433
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in firefox and google-chrome and if the proxy server is down it still seems to work

3919433
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that ie is not contacting sites directly if the proxy is down something which is not an issue with firefox or google-chrome

3919450
libjpeg	libpng
the reason why opencv crashes is that it cannot find libpng libjpeg dlls

3919450
libjpeg	libpng
your problems should be fixed if you include the libpng libjpeg libraries

3919478
innodb	myisam
myisam has the number of rows stored somewhere and so the query is almost instant innodb has to scan the table to get the full count

3919503

google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome and firefox

3919674
hex	binary
a linear feedback shift register is pretty simple as long as you re comfortable with thinking in binary or maybe hex since it s easy to map between the two

3919719
google-chrome	firefox
btw this doesn t happen in google-chrome since google-chrome always scrolls down a part-page but it always happens in firefox which always scrolls as little as possible to the input

3919755
for-loop	arrays
maybe i ll just use a for-loop of some sort but it d be even better if the script was smart enough to automatically detect each parameter and maybe build an arrays that looks something like this

3919766
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
the code works for png jpg and tif but not for bmp or gif

3919880
perforce	svn
my company was recently purchased and one of the services offered by the corporate mothership is centralized svn or perforce hosting

3919880
perforce	svn
given that neither perforce or svn offer the complete feature set i require i m most likely going to continue to use git as the front end to whichever we choose

3919888
google-chrome	firefox
i have see the code below laid it out so that it works in ie but it looks like crap in google-chrome and firefox where am i going wrong

3919905
mouseup	mousedown
i was hoping to implement the functionality to return the slider to the middle and stop sending notifications in the mouseup event of the slider but it seems that for some reason apple disables the mouseup event after a mousedown event on the slider and handles all the slider functionality at a lower level

3919937

hide	show
to show or not to show shakespearean style the extension is purely up to the windows explorer setting to show or hide known file extensions

post	put
requestbody is for use with post and put requests where the body of the request is what you want to parse

3921872

is there something i am missing where i can set the max width and height of the images in the jquery files or css

3922698
wordpress	joomla
with that goal in mind the team delivered the fastest plone yet it trounces drupal joomla and wordpress for speed improved a lot of very important infrastructure files are now stored outside of the database it uses much less memory than it used to and scales a lot better to large number of parallel requests

3922725
inline	inlining
if the cost of a function call is bigger than its payload the compiler should be able to figure out by itself if it s convenient to inline the call and in some cases even inlining too much can slow down the code

3922741
width	height
you would better use barplot in order to represent the total mass by the area of the bins height gives the count width gives the mass

3922760
folder	directory
then create a folder in your root directory name it templates

3922872
google-chrome	firefox

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in ie and opera but in google-chrome and firefox it doesn t

3923207
int	chars
now that there is enough memory allocated to the chars pointer we can safely use sprintf to write the int to the chars pointer

3923207
free	malloc
unless this is a quick and dirty program you always want to make sure to free the memory you called with malloc

3923230
int	double
there is no possible x that could be an abstraction over int float double etc

3923269
post	get
you also could do some curl requests passing the data via get or post

3923347
width	height
both their height and width are variable

3923390
avr	microcontroller
it is for a library for avr microcontroller and this would save me a few precious instructions in an interrupt handler.the array that should have this property is 54 byte long out of about 80 bytes of total static memory used by the library

3923400
int	chars
or figure out a way to have all the chars represented as strings rather than have some as list of int

3923406
opera	safari
safari webkit and opera currently support a unitless number for tx and ty

3923411
allocator	stl
should i use the stl allocator if available

3923426
free	malloc
for that reason the integrity checks are only performed when the heap gets manipulated which is in the malloc and free functions and friends

3923430
fseek	ftell
this is all untested and i haven t been careful about off-by-one errors but it gives you an idea of the usage of fseek and ftell which sounds like what you are looking for

3923453
folder	directory
you can find these libraries in the bin folder or the qt directory

3923460
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
so my solution to this is to override touchesbegan withevent and touchesmoved withevent and call them from there as follows

3923505
allocator	stl
since the author of the specialized memory allocator has more knowledge on the size of the objects allocated from the pool and how those allocator occur the allocator can use the memory more efficiently than a general purpose allocator such as the one provided by the stl

3923539
client-side	server-side
it really is not sensible to have pagination server-side and sorting client-side

3923552
wmi	managementeventwatcher
the final option is to use wmi to do the detection.you can use the managementeventwatcher

3923576

in that respect a vector works more like a regular int or double

3923610
width	height
i have tried using wrap_content for webview s width and height but that does not work

3923611
int	boolean
the class has some properties like int strings or boolean but could also have more complex ones

3923617

if you use https which is essentially http over ssl tls all the http traffic will be encrypted from the moment the ssl tls connection is established provided you re using the appropriate cipher suites that it before any http communication

3923752
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you can then reference your view in your code after you called setcontentview with findviewbyid r.id.myview

3923769
int	chars
using chars rather than int and writing a value -128 to 127 to b should fix it

3923775
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it all appears to be working seamlessly on firefox opera google-chrome etc

3923822
goto	break
it s perfectly valid to use break - as others have pointed out it s nowhere in the same league as goto

3923832
allocator	stl
if the stl allocator meets your needs use it it s designed by some very smart people who know what they are doing - however it is for the generic case and if you know how your objects are allocated you could make the above perform faster

3923832
free	malloc
the simple allocator i describe above isn t re-entrant of course you could wrap it with a mutex to provide a bit of cover and even then i would hazard that the simple allocator would perform orders of magnitude faster than normal malloc free

3923913
temp	tmp
that s why the process freeze it is trying to run a tmp file c temp nse305.tmp ns306.tmp

3923923

rss	feed
when you request the rss feed it s dispatched to retrieve it and stores the feed into its global all-user cache identified by url

3923941
rss	feed
i m not sure what the cache invalidation mechanisms are but the crawler definitely doesn t revisit the feed strictly as often as the response s cache-control mechanisms would indicate that s probably a good thing as many generated rss feed send no-cache although they don t change too often

3923941
rss	feed
these are the hypotheses i formulated some time ago from my rss feed access logs

3923956
graphics2d	bufferedimage
anyway your graphics2d is backed by a bufferedimage so that s probably what s slowing you down

3924042
put	get
note that you will have to put the correct namespace for the local declaration but you should get that from intellisense if you aren t sure what it should be

3924056
hide	show
wrap the checkbox and its text in an element and show hide that instead

3924059
public	protected
provide a public virtual destructor or a protected non-virtual destructor

3924066

3924066
hide	show
if your checkbox is nested within the label then you could just show hide the label instead

3924080
draggable	droppable
so if the user drags another draggable and drops it the previous dropped element must get removed from the droppable and the currently dragged element must replace it in the droppable

3924120
post	get
note that if your method allows for a get and not a post submission method then that would both solve the problem and better fit with convention

3924172
keydown	keyup
on keydown the value hasn t gotten the last letter yet on keyup hoever the value has been updated

mouseover	mouseout
i ve been trying to do it with mouseover and mouseout with no luck

3924497
jobs	cron
i had worked on php and java-based projects for the past few years and speaking from experience java and given the open source libraries to achieve scheduling orm aop etc. is usually a good choice - and of course you don t always need a container as different tiers and services can be written with different languages integrated together with other processes such as cron jobs

3924513
google-chrome	firefox
if i try on google-chrome or firefox they don t get the background

3924525

createelement	domdocument
i think that the main problem is that the tags which i m creating with domdocument createelement ss data should be closed with whereas domdocument is outputting

3924915
uiview	subviews
i would probably use the uiviewcontroller for the main view to load the subviews and add them to the main view not load the subviews directly in the main uiview itself

3924921
ant	maven
page maven 1.x originated in 2003 inside the jakarta turbine as an attempt to simplify the ant builds of apache projects and their maintenance

here s how i deal with it instead of putting in viewdidload i put it in viewwillappear

3924953
profiling	instrumentation
if for some reason the table is taking a long time to load and it shows a blank table before showing your data i would look into profiling your data loading functions using instrumentation perhaps the real issue is that you need to optimize the function so that it takes less time

folder	directory
i do have a directory in the path that contains 16000 folder - for every commit

3925021

is it possible to add a glow effect in a uisegmentedcontrol like how its done in uibutton using setshowstouchwhenhighlighted yes

3925194
for-loop	loops
it s just a syntactic sugar since the standard says that it s equivalent to a loops with iterators edit this means it doesn t provide any additional information to the compiler compared to the equivalent for-loop mdash

3925329
ubuntu	linux
i have a subversion repository running svn 1.6.6 on an ubuntu linux server and i m trying to create a branch using the tortoisesvn gui

how to get this fadein or fadeout effect without blackscreen

3925381
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is a problem across all major browsers firefox safari google-chrome ie but strangely it doesn t always do it

3925404
apache	nginx
i ve never used nginx but in apache it s just a directive

3925427
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
here is my complete list of fixes that makes the button element look the same in firefox safari google-chrome opera internet explorer ie9 ie8 ie7 haven t tested ie6

3925485
post	get
assuming i want to get the post and the title

3925489
hash	md5
most payment mechanisms are verified in this manner usually with an md5 or sha1 hash you can find more info on the following links

3925491
centos	linux
on linux centos 5.4 java says

3925497
implements	sealed
inheriting from such a class definition would force the inheritor to implements the abstract member but scope it privately to consumers of the class though it would have to be defined as protected so unless the class was marked as sealed further inheritors would have access

3925510
hide	show
it looks like what you re trying to do is show one div and hide a bunch of others when other elements are clicked mdash

3925510
hide	show
but you can also easily relate the divs to show hide the panels and the divs that you click on the tabs by giving them some information in common

3925521
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectinputstream only works on data written by objectoutputstream

3925528
integer	unsigned
in x86 assembly the overflow flag is set when an add or sub operation on a signed integer overflows and the carry flag is set when an operation on an unsigned integer overflows

3925613
put	get
once you get things fixed put your perl libraries into source control so you can always roll back an installation

3925621
int	chars
the list and set interfaces are a part of the collections framework which only allow for adding removing iterating objects like chars or int not primitives like chars or int

3925658
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but they can also be solved by simply sending an automated keypress at the os level that simulates the enter key works for firefox a little harder on some versions of google-chrome and safari

3925662
post	get
however i don t quite understand why you re trying to get the post content inside the section of the page

3925664
freemarker	velocity
if you need to do a lot of this templating you may be interested in apache velocity or freemarker

3925756
folder	directory
the assemblies that perform these translations live in a folder in my application directory

3925794
layoutparams	viewgroup
i ve got a schedule class which is simply a custom viewgroup with custom onmeasure and onlayout which enables me to place childs events with layoutparams for column row start and column row end

3925799
int	boolean
obj.amethod byval arg1 as int byval arg2 as int byval arg3 as boolean

3925809
put	get
does my put operation get an exception

3925849
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
ie including #9 opera 10 safari 5 and google-chrome 6 all do maintain a global

3925852
libusb	pyusb
personally what i ve done so far is use a python wrapper called pyusb to do some quick experimentation with libusb as i don t have to do ide setup or library include file setup with python

3925879
width	height
i want to limit the height and width of the image to a maximum of 80 of the window s so that there won t be a need for a scroll bar at any normal size

3925879
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works exactly how i want it to work in google-chrome and safari and firefox acknowledges the max-width as well

3925990
min	max
grouping or aggregates use the builtin min max or itertools.groupby

3926012
folder	directory
iis configuration mappings right-click the virtual folder - properties - virtual directory tab - configuration - mappings tab

3926042
children	parent
the generated resource entity will have navigation properties like resources and resources1 which i renamed parent and children

3926073
post	get
this works for a get request but when the a post is made i does a 302 redirect and therefore the script doesn t get the post variables

3926082
freemarker	velocity
you d better use some templating technology like freemarker or velocity for your email templates

3926129
freemarker	velocity
there are other technologies out there better suited for what you want like velocity and freemarker

3926130
ati	nvidia
most implementations are trade secret so you will never know how ati nvidia implemented anything except what you can infer by the results produced by interacting with their implementations

3926168
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i ve found the following code to work in ie7 ff3 opera 10 safari 4 and google-chrome and quite likely other versions of those browsers which i simply haven t tested

3926173
google-chrome	firefox
so i do not see any issues with cross domain this code works perfectly in firefox google-chrome any other normal browser

3926197
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
and the problem is it works for some browsers opera google-chrome but it doesn t work for internet explorer and firefox

3926207
disk	ram
this provides a way to manage objects on disk and ram

3926229
for-loop	loops
most of the dangers associated with using break or continue in a for-loop are negated if you write tidy easily-readable loops

3926282
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
see the documentation for nscalendar and nsdatecomponents

3926293
setlocale	strftime
if you want to change this setting project wide i would do so in config projectconfiguration.class.php using setlocale and then use strftime rather than date

3926328
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it is almost a half-way between an interpreted-language and a compiled-language gaining the benefits of both

3926377
mouseup	mousedown
luckily while playing around with a little test program we made it was discovered that if you override the the mousedown method of the nsslider and call the super of that method it does not return until the mouse button is released so you can just put whatever code should be in mouseup inside the mousedown method after the call to super

3926398
scheme	rebol
i currently use programmer s notepad with the rebol syntax scheme

3926429
strlen	strcpy
strlen and strcpy need to know where the strings start so that they can access all of their elements not just the first

3926462
strlen	strcpy
thus what strcpy is exactly doing is to copy strlen line bytes of memory starting from the address line into corresponding locations starting from the address of pointer

3926462
strlen	strcpy
if you pass and strcpy will have access to only the first char and not the rest of strlen line -1

3926517
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
linux is one of the more popular ones today whose programs can be run by linux itself netbsd or freebsd

3926536
post	get
there are multiple parts to the request the dns lookup and the get or post to the site

3926563
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
if there is no data in a stream but you are trying to read...eg read methods of chain streams like datainputstream objectinputstream randomaccessfile throw eofexception if they are trying to read from fileinputstream but the fileinputstream is empty

3926572
width	height
i have fixed height and width and have 4 divs for row

3926585
pop-up	dialog
the way i did it was that i had a stack of dialog pop-up objects that i drew to the screen every time my redraw function was called so before i loaded the textures i added a dialog with the loading message redrew the screen then started loading and then replaced modified the dialog with the done

3926614
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in ie8 firefox 3.6.10 and the latest google-chrome

3926623
versioning	upgrade
define these versioning explicitly in your references so that if you upgrade the .net versioning it will continue to use the old versioning and not the new

3926635
filtering	grouping
i have a report in access that we want split and exported to .rtf based on a grouping id filtering

3926648
ubuntu	linux
i have been developing a project app to learn about android i can upload my app to my htc desire on my desktop using linux ubuntu and eclipse i have the same setup on my laptop but i cannot upload apps to my phone

3926667
width	height
of course you have to subtract the border-width from your fixed height and width

3926681
put	get
what i would like to be able to do is count the number of cycles i know the right way to do this is with the state monad but what is the most elegant way to fit the put get into a function like this

3926702
inherited	subclassing
however zend framework provides better alternatives to subclassing inherited controllers

3926702
inherited	properties
it becomes hard to manage inherited properties as it is harder to visualize what inherited functionality is being utilized by each controller action

3926710
content-disposition	content-type
these are needed to add the content-disposition and content-type headers if the media is streamed over http responses

3926726
allegro	sdl
i have experience with sdl and allegro

3926726
allegro	sdl
i think that sdl is a bit slow allegro isn t good idea for this kind of thing

3926748
for-loop	arrays
the clean way of iterating through an arrays is using length and an incrementing for-loop

3926750
hide	show
the css inside the noscript tag will then hide all of your page content and instead display whatever no js message you want to show

3926778
floating-point	integer
a data type simply tells you how to interpret a sequence of bytes as an integer a floating-point number a data structure etc

3926819
fgets	strlen
also by not checking result you are doing an strlen on line which could have uninitialized data because fgets failed

3926819
calloc	malloc
so perhaps using calloc instead of malloc or at least initializing all structure pointer members to null would have been a better idea

3926843
int	chars
actually back in the 80 s the formatting string standard was printf with format strings such as d for int or s for strings and obscure format modifiers such as 06d which draws an int and pads it to the left with zeros until it reaches six chars

3926863
maven	pom.xml
i m using maven and it would seem that there could be some way to have a hook that looks at the meta-inf maven directory and pulls the dependency list from the pom.xml and goes and fetches the required libs probably from a local repo

3926898
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and opera work with my code just fine yet my new update to linux firefox gave the same error -- nsresult â 0x80570009 ns_error_xpc_bad_convert_js

3926952
stdout	stderr
however when it fails subprocess shows that nothing was printed to stderr or stdout

3926952
stdout	stderr
so why can t subprocess actually capture the stdout or stderr of this

3926952
stdout	stderr
their toolkit redirects all stdout stderr into their logging subsystem

3926966
post	get
right now i m writing forms that store the post data in a session and then populate the database row at the end but as soon as i introduce conditional logic from page to page the sessions break and don t get sent

3926974
folder	directory
ability to loop through many many separate text files contained in a folder directory but output to just one single csv text file

3927024
put	get
despite what it looks like in a debug build you can still generally put a breakpoint on an empty c# control block or semicolon and it will get hit correctly

3927032
stdout	stderr
since the error message really isn t coming in on either stdout nor stderr my best guess is that the program is using windows equivalent of opening dev tty whatever that is

3927040
post	get
you would basically need to proxy all get s and post s between your server and the destination site

3927053
hide	show
your most difficult logic goes into building the page with the proper number of questions and making sure the divs are effectively titled to work with your show hide script

3927053
hide	show
in my case i use jquery s show hide functionality

3927076
collabnet	svn
you could install the collabnet subversion command-line client then run its svn command as a subprocess pipe its input into your program and search for lines that have

3927111
dictionary	map
a safer approach would be to create a private map between a label and myobject using a dictionary instance

3927112
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup could also be used but please note that these will only fire once even if the user holds down the key so that multiple characters are added

3927126
profiling	debugging
when i m working in vs.net 2010 then start debugging seems like a new window profiling or something like that kicks in and rearranges hides windows that i had open previously

3927142
int	chars
the above dynamically allocates and deallocates one memory slot that is initialized with the int value 10 equivalent to the chars value n

3927241
datatrigger	eventtrigger
h2 good solution- h2 eventtrigger on your three buttons seem to work better and doesn t have the problems that the datatrigger encounters plus you don t even need the dependency property x anymore

3927249
width	height
for example if you want your object to be 1 4 of the screen then it s width is screenwidth 4 and height is screenheight 4

3927249
width	height
ie width height aspectratio

3927250
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried this in google-chrome 6.0 and also firefox 3.6.3 and get the same result in both

3927260
hide	show
since i have multi-selection there is no need to display the selected value like you would do in a combo box so the drop-down appears to be a button to show hide the list

3927260
button	checkbox	hide	show
the columnclick event handles when they click on what looks like the show hide list button and the itemchecked event lets me handle anything that needs to respond to a change in the checkbox

3927301
inherited	properties
instead every contract inherited a nullable properties from the generic

3927322
bindingsource	dataview
i was using a typed dataset and put its typed table into a dataview and use that dataview as the datasource for a bindingsource which was then the datasource for the grid

3927352
multiplying	subtract
subtract the integer from the original number now multiplying by 10 stepwise and find the digits after the decimal point

3927359
integer	fractions
if m is greater than or equal to 10 -3 but less than 10 7 then it is represented as the integer part of m in decimal form with no leading zeroes followed by . . followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractions part of m

3927359
integer	fractions
the magnitude is then represented as the integer part of a as a single decimal digit followed by . . followed by decimal digits representing the fractions part of a followed by the letter e e followed by a representation of n as a decimal integer as produced by the method integer.tostring int

3927376
profiling	benchmarking
for benchmarking and profiling you can use xdebug and memory_get_usage and memory_get_peak_usage

3927390
cpython	ironpython
both the cpython and the ironpython pickle modules have the same functionality except one is implemented in c and the other in c#

3927397
hide	show
if you re inclined to go with the insert at the end approach i d recommend bpeterson76 s idea of using js to show hide sections on a singler phisical form - just make sure you ve got control of the user s back button otherwise the user could loose all of their answers

3927403
integer	radix
for integer types number of non-sign bits radix base digits in the representation

3927403
min	max
there are other methods such as min max and the like

3927404
min	max
edit actually it s not giving you any information about the standard however you can get the min and max value on compile time for certain types

3927415
width	height
try setting the width height of the stackpanel instead.

3927465
stdout	stderr
can you try this subprocess.check_output with stderr redirecting to stdout

3927465
stdout	stderr
if out_err gets both the output and error you ll probably need to redirect stdout and stderr to file objects and later read from those file objects because windows do not have unix-like pipes

3927595
stdout	stderr
i m using the jython 2.51 implementation of python to write a script that repeatedly invokes another process via subprocess.popen and uses pipe to pipe stdout and stderr to the parent process and stdin to the child process

3927596
google-chrome	firefox
but all works fine on his end with google-chrome and firefox

3927596
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i also have tried it in ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome and they all work fine

3927612
width	height
i know with silverlight you can control the width and height of the silverlight section within the web page

3927615
ant	maven
it s a massive tool with a myriad of accompanying tools such as maven ant junit etc

3927622
post	get
if still no luck please post the errors you get

3927629
subtract	add
update thinking a little further i don t think the add subtract method would be good because it would kill sorting

3927650
gif	png
read image formats jpg gif png with transparency

3927650
mouse	keyboard
monitor mouse and keyboard input to this form

3927658
google-chrome	firefox
now i am trying to build a little ui-library here is a demo to a simple list note use your arrow keys google-chrome firefox only

3927667
post	get
as it stands i just get all the content of the last 200 post into a string and split them into words then sort by which words are used the most

3927702
children	parent
if you only need a reference to the parent and not to its children then rather than creating the child elements dynamically create the parent dynamically and then set its innerhtml for the content

3927711
children	parent
the problem is i can t figure out how to prevent some of the children categories being treated as parent

3927711
children	parent
how do i configure the tables or relations so children categories aren t treated like parent

3927713
int	chars
no c++ only allows int types ex int long unsigned int size_t chars as indexes

3927720
disk	ram
if it can be stored in ram it s 203 mb so subsequent runs will probably hit the disk cache then the problem goes away entirely as the fsb speed typically differs from the processor speed by a factor less than the fsb width in bytes â the fsb can transfer more than one prime per cycle

3927727
tunnel	vpn
if so you ll need to use a web service and ensure that there is a network path from wherever customers will create orders public internet extranet to your nav web service - likely using a vpn tunnel etc

3927729
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the script works fine in all other browsers firefox google-chrome and safari

3927768
vim	emacs
i usually work fullscreen with vim and emacs on a 30 monitor which means i tend to have a lot of splits

3927768
vim	emacs
the active pane s modeline changes background in vim and emacs but sometimes that s not an easy to see indicator of the active pane

3927768
vim	emacs
either vim or emacs solution would be fine

3927781
implements	extends
for example some of the type gymnastics present in the collections library make the collections a joy to use but perplexing to implements or extends

3927901
post	get
i get why it s doing this as the request is a post however this is not the desired or expected result as the control was not in anyway involved in the user action

3927918
pull	push
or just push pull from a local truecrypt archive and rsync it to a remote location

3927942
post	get
renderaction uses a post renderpartial uses a get

3927969
printf	fgets
the printf doesn t have a n because the newline character is retained from the fgets see the manpage

3927998
fgets	fread
implement fread as string collecting loop with fgets with eventual seeking if only a specific size was requested and fgets read too far until the next n line break

3928025
jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
jruby is just yet another ruby execution engine just like mri yarv ironruby rubinius macruby maglev smallruby ruby.net xruby rubygolightly tinyrb hotruby blueruby red sun and all the others

3928025
jruby	mri
in fact on windows jruby passes more rubyspec tests than ruby meaning mri or yarv itself

3928025
jruby	mri
and with the new c extension support in jruby 1.6 they can even use a large subset of mri and yarv c extensions like mongrel for example

3928025
jruby	mri
tooling whenever someone writes a new tool for yarv or mri like memprof it turns out that jruby already had a tool 5 years ago which does the same thing only better

3928025
jar	war
deployment assuming that your target system already has a jvm installed deploying a jruby app and i m not just talking about rails i also mean desktop mobile other kinds of servers is literally just copying one jar or war and a double-click

3928025
jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices

3928025
jruby	mri
note that many rails developers simply develop and unit test on mri and integration test and deploy on jruby

3928025
mri	rubinius
unfortunately neither mri nor yarv nor rubinius run threads concurrently so there s still some broken multithreaded ruby code out there that doesn t know it s broken because obviously concurrency bugs can only show up if there s actual concurrency.

3928057
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
it s like class inherited in oop where subclassing inherited variables methods etc from their superclass automatically

3928071
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
i m sure i want to call onclicklistener and not onitemclicklistener

3928083
hide	show
the only thing that worked is a show hide but that s not an option for me

3928118
profiling	debugging
profiling the application with a tool set some stopwatches or debugging the app and see what the bottleneck is

3928157
int	chars
a key should also be small - an int of 4 bytes is perfect a two-letter chars 2 column just the same

3928163
post	get
my server is expecting to get post parameters that look something like this

3928164
firefox	safari
the following behaves exactly as i expect it to in firefox and safari but the solution for internet explorer eludes me

3928276
division	modulo
i m not sure if gcc or msvc or whatever compiler you are using is clever enough to change the workingnum 2 expression but odds are it s doing the division and looking at the modulo in edx.

3928280
flask	pylons	flask	django
as the lead developer of nagare i really encourage you to try it in real on your product which is the best way to see how nagare is truely different than the others frameworks like django pylons or flask

3928283
hide	show
the users would need the ability to show hide columns because honestly who could assimilate that much data all at once

3928283
sorting	filtering
we would use a domain service for this so filtering sorting paging could be handled on the server and only a certain number of objects would be returned

3928283
sorting	filtering
serialize and pass the report object back to the client letting silverlight handle paging sorting filtering

3928283
hide	show
however this would give us the flexibility to choose which columns need to be sent to the browser in the hide show columns scenario which would lower the overall payload going across the line

3928288
post	get
what you d want to to go here is get a handle to the text value of the editor in javascript and post that server side to save either as a file or in a db

3928325
put	get
get mysql_insert_id foreach or exist word_id if word_value already there and then put in the new table like

3928335
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in google-chrome 6 and firefox 3.6 both on the mac

3928348
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
nscalendar and nsdatecomponents can probably do everything you need

3928370
debian	linux
currently i am targeting an amd opteron 6168 compiling with gcc on debian linux i ve tried to find documentation for this but i am in unfamiliar waters

3928382
folder	directory
one option is to svn export http path to repo to a local directory and copy the files and folder manually

3928393
mouseover	mouseleave
if you need to catch only mouseover and mouseleave events maybe you should simply try to use only css and hover selector on image or div if target browsers let it

3928403
hide	show	mouseleave	mouseenter
the single function will get fired for both mouseenter and mouseleave and toggle will show when otherwise will hide

3928419
hide	show
i wouldn t use the show and hide methods because they re a bit slow particularly if you re using a lot of animation on the page

3928432
folder	dir
btw - my home dir in this case for me is my user folder for my login so i was able to find it there

3928433
getter	setter
i use this option in eclipse java to import getter setter methods to access class variables

3928443
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
declare variables for the fileinputstream and fileoutputstream and invoke close on each in a finally block

3928444
switching	screens
when i did that the preference screens started to act wierdly â the two custom preferences switching locations constantly as i drag the seek bar

3928448
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller with two uiviewcontroller on it a and b

3928451
folder	directory	copying	overwrite
we frequently have multiple people working on each project and sometimes they copy files overwrite changes made by others who were working on the same file at the same time copied the file from a network share to their local hd made the changes then copied back to the network keep old versions in the same directory as the working file lose track of who has what file where like people copying the file out of the shared project directory and into their personal shared folder making changes and moving it back and forth

3928453
rss	feed
i wanna write a simple rss feed reader in c++

3928453
rss	feed
and the protocol or commands to interact with a rss feed socket

3928465
getter	setter
it s a plain private property with getter and setter

3928504
min	max
mode both min and max jruby runtimes are set to 1 in your trinidad.yml configuration file

3928545
rss	feed
to get started just go to which is an rss feed for stackoverflow c++ question

3928547
google-chrome	safari
i am running fx 3.6.10 and it has no problem changing the background of el1 to green but i see nothing of the drop-shadow and border-radius on el2 in fx although it works fine on webkit at least in google-chrome and safari here

3928579
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
in safari firefox opera etc

3928596
udp	tcp
the source filter must do the job of connecting authenticating with a stream server then turn the tcp udp stream into discrete media samples that can be passed downstream via your filters output pin s

3928618
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome etc

3928627
google-chrome	safari
however in safari and google-chrome it remains at 1px

3928634
implements	extends
easy control to work with and easy to extends and modify all areas by implements custom itemplate classes

as well as for the accessors paradigm you may declare them private and use protected getter and setter methods

3933043
getter	setter
if your base class implementation changes you only have those getter and setter to modify

3933050
inherited	base-class
if it is your base-class and your inherited classes there s probably not going to be any harm but you do lose control of how members should be accessed locking logging read write persistency ...

even though it s in the javax.swing package it doesn t depend on any awt or swing classes

3933118
public	protected
whether you make them private protected or public that isn t something thats chiseled in the stone so feel free to create your class tree without much thinking about that

3933120
getter	setter
so do getter and setter btw.

3933133
public	protected
protected data has all the drawbacks of public data so you might as well make them public

3933158
rss	feed
starter kit uses rss feed which are

3933189
rss	feed
i would like to store data retrieved hourly from rss feed in a database or in lucene so that the text can be easily indexed for wordcounts

sproutcore	cappuccino
i am evaluating sproutcore and cappuccino for use in my current project

3933231
sproutcore	cappuccino
on the other hand all the cappuccino samples seem very responsive despite that fact that they are more full blown applications than the sproutcore samples

sharepoint	splist	spweb	splist
is possible to inherit from sharepoint classes such like spweb splist etc

3933301
sharepoint	splist	spweb	splist
spweb and splist are sealed in sharepoint 2007 see

3933329
filesystems	ntfs
the size of the directory is less interesting than the fact that you re going through the entire filesystems stack 250 000 times everything from ntfs the kernel and your grandmother s favorite anti-virus filter all have to get a chance to play

3933467
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
i have a kinda awkward problem i m working with c# and wpf in .net 4.0 and what i need is a timer that will create only one thread but it will need to work in the background so not in the main thread the problem is using system.windows.forms.timer or dispatchertimer will automatically force it to work on the main thread and be influenced by the ui on the other side using system.timers.timer or system.threading.timer will create a new thread for every cycle that overpasses the time interval this will happen since the code in the elapsed timer event is a bit big although part of it is sent further to a backgroundworker

3933563
post	get
the problem i am having is that if the user clicks the save button when one of the text boxes has focus the blur event gets triggered at the same time as the button click event and two ajax post get called simultaneously

3933573
put	get
since we don t have access to the satellite system we can t prove this is the issue but it appears they get the packets just don t put them back together in the correct sequence

3933590
for-loop	loops
and this loops can be optmized by putting large increment on this for-loop

3933590
width	height
for example if you know that you have no such object whose width or height is smaller than 50 pixel then you will put 50 as the increment in the nested loop either on width or height or both.

because the server-side is performing your paging and the client-side runs jquery you can t directly access the information you need

3933687
jboss	weblogic
i am new to weblogic and am porting over a series of web applications from jboss

3933698
getter	setter
you provide dummy public setter and getter

3933698
getter	setter
instead you should provide protected setter and getter

you have a typedef d anonymous struct but refer to a non-existent tagged struct inside

3933792
udp	tcp
the daemonization code in twistd doesn t care if you re serving up udp or tcp

3933792
udp	tcp
the way you daemonize a udp server is identical to the way you daemonize a tcp server

3933792
udp	tcp
you should be able to use the tcp echo server as an example to write a .tac file for your udp server

mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
obviously you ll need to provide your own wav ogg or mp3 to try this yourself

3933943
int	chars
a chars literal such as a will be treated as an int literal such as 97 or 0x61

3933991
n-gram	words
i was thinking about simply making a list of 2-5 long words n-gram and finding the probability but that doesn t take order into account which could be helpful

3933998
apache	nginx
stop start runserver apache or nginx

multiplying	add
well depending on the size of your integers you may want to multiplying the first coordinate by the max possible coordinate and add the second

3934139
google-chrome	safari
anyways tested and it works in google-chrome and safari

3934220
multiplying	subtract
the point of choosing 31 as your prime is being able to multiplying using a bit shift and a subtract

3934220
multiplying	subtract
the point of choosing 31 as your prime is being able to multiplying using a bit shift and a single subtract operation

3934220
multiplying	subtraction
note that bitshifting by 5 is equivalent to multiplying by 32 and the subtraction makes this equivalent to multiplying by 31

3934284
getter	setter
when i copy the method declarations for a boolean type using the technique suggested by jim correia the getter and setter are typed as

3934284
getter	setter
the setter and getter methods store and retrieve your property using - id primitivevalueforkey nsstring key

3934295
width	height
create a message that has input storage key output storage key width height - and add to queue

3934307
children	parent
as the hit rect is in the parent coordinate space the parent first needs to layout its children which it hasn t done yet during oncreate

3934312
gridview	rowdatabound
then in the rowdatabound event handler for your gridview add

3934326
getter	setter
a backing variable complete with getter and setter methods are created for you by the compiler but you would not see them in your standard code

3934352
int	chars
read it into a chars buffer and use atoi to convert the string into a int

3934355
int	chars
you can use the read function but you have to be careful to consume sizeof int chars from the socket and then you have to worry about endianess

3934379
width	height
the image rectangle s width and height

3934379
width	height
from the width and height members of

i went to the extreme though and decided to use vim as my editor rather than relying on an ide radrails aptana etc

3934441
nerdtree	fuzzyfinder	nerdtree	rails.vim	rails.vim	fuzzyfinder
if you go the same route i did you ll need to learn about vim and it s many plugins like rails.vim fuzzyfinder snippets nerdtree

3934484
put	get
dataadapter.fill datatable gets only the first result set and put it on a datatable as that result is empty you get an empty datatable

nsnull	nsstring
is there anything else that could cause an nsnull to get created specifically to get created in a place where the system is expecting an nsstring instead

3934502
mediarecorder	audiorecord
i ve got an application which records audio from the microphone and then performs some post-processing on the audio in realtime so i must use the audiorecord class instead of the standard mediarecorder

i thought i would try some of the other refactorings like adding a parameter to a method but i get the following error when i put the cursor over a private method

3934540
postgresql	mysql
my conclusion was basically to stick with what i know php and mysql postgresql

3934540
postgresql	mysql
yeah mongo or another nosql might be a better fit for the data but it d take me time to learn how to install and use them and frankly unless you have a massive amount of traffic mysql postgresql will not cause performance issues

3934573
classname	inherited
in this case tr.classname mean that every tr elment with class classname will inherited the css

3934591
inherited	properties
i am facing problem while serializing values of enabled visible properties that are inherited from system.windows.forms.control class

switching	screens
if i put the table in edit mode switching to another screens of my app and then go back to the table i can set the table to don t be anymore in edit mode but the button persist in the edit state while i would like it to show me agin the edit label so to be consistent with the table state let s say

3934646
folder	directory
it turns out though that startupprojectb and startupprojectc all live in the same directory as startupprojecta on the local machine so on the pc i m using i have a generalsolution folder which contains a startupprojecta folder a startupprojectb folder a startupprojectc folder and a folder a b folder and a c folder

3934745
hid	keyboard
the question is that i have some hid devices that act as a keyboard msr barcode scaner rfid reader and i want to be able to read their input in my wpf application without the necessity for this to happen in say a text field in the application

3934757
getter	setter	public	protected
if one expects that the source code for a base class will be available to anyone who is inheriting from it and expects that the base class will never change typically this means that the reason for using the base class is to allow public members and properties of the base-class to be used interchangeably with derived classes rather than to reduce the amount of code needed for the derived classes and if all public methods are virtual or tie directly into virtual methods there s not much disadvantage to using protected fields rather than protected virtual getter setter

3934757
getter	setter
if one expects that derived classes may be created in situations where the classes above them in the hierarchy are not completely known or are not immutable then it may be more appropriate to have protected getter setter but that responsibility could be left with whoever creates the opaque layers in the hierarchy

3934757
getter	setter
addendum the only thing gained by adding protected virtual getter and setter will be the ability for derived classes to change how the base class code accesses the fields properties

3934769
int	double
should be int instead of double

3934769
int	chars
question is compiler doing implicit cast from default return value of zero int to chars

3934771
post	get
i m trying to get a post response from a url and i can not get the response to print to my html page instead it just redirects me to the url in the action with the response

3934789
sikuli	selenium
you can extend the selenium server so it will be able to execute sikuli scripts see this on how to call them from java

3934794
public	protected
i consider any other use of protected as conceptually equivalent to public

3934794
public	protected
in the sense that if you write a non virtual protected method write it as if it was public

3934794
public	protected
if the field would break something if it was public it will also break something if it s protected

3934811
portrait	landscape
i want these to be one above the other when the device is in portrait orientation and i want these to be next to each other when the device orientation changes to landscape

3934821
put	get
for a named scope you d need to put it into a lambda so it does get evaluated every time this sounds like the question you re actually asking

3934841
button	checkbox
one workaround i have found is to replace radio button with checkbox and use rules to simulate the exclusive behavior of radio button

3934871
post	get
jmeter will not execute javascript at run time - it can only post get http requests

3934927
post	get
there isn t an xml-rpc method to get all post mostly because that could lead to significant performance issues imaging a blog with 5 000 post and high traffic .

3934927
post	get
pull all the code together into a custom plug-in place it in your site activate it and you can now get a count of published post or a list of published post ids via xml-rpc

3934969
int	chars
your chars return probably works because chars can be easily converted to an int

3934997
hide	show
then it hide form2 and then show it as a modal box

3935098
int	double	int	chars
it is probably because chars will implicitly cast to an int however double won t as there would be data loss

3935102
accelerometer	gyroscope
drift from the accelerometer and gyroscope are understood

3935102
accelerometer	gyroscope
i m interested if anyone has been able to develop a 6dof with only the accelerometer and gyroscope that works reliably for 5-10 seconds with little drift in both translation and orientation

3935158
ostream	istream
you could make that a function taking istream instr and ostream outstr

3935158
spaces	delimiter
suppose now we want to change that to read multiple lines each with numbers delimiter by spaces or tab

3935158
variance	kurtosis
we could calculate the variance skewness and kurtosis at the same time if we want whilst iterating

3935161
post	get
also - it may have been accidental but post parameters dont go up in the url like get they are behind the scenes invisible to the user and also capable of being far larger

3935182
onresume	onpause
when i click home button and then come back to to my application it doesn t show the last values on the listview or any other view it just look same with when i started the application.i believe it is can be done with onresume and onpause but i couldn t find how

3935185
implements	extends
class gameview extends surfaceview implements surfaceholder.callback

3935196
jobs	cron
make the cron jobs look for a flag file under var run then write an initscript that sets or resets that flag

3935207
onresume	onpause
you can store all values in sharedpreferences in onpause and then load them again in onresume and populate your views using that data

3935216
cvs	svn
is installing a cvs or svn or something along those lines still my best bet just to get use of the one function

3935221
hash	salt
the password will be salt and hash in sha-256 then stored in either the registry or a file

3935262
equinox	knopflerfish
there are existing open-source offerings that you can build-upon equinox and virgo apache felix and karaf knopflerfish concierge glassfish 3 etc comparison

3935304
integer	unsigned
i can easily convert the bytes to an unsigned integer 1876166208

3935304
integer	unsigned
another way to put the question is how do i convert an unsigned integer into a 31-bit signed integer in java

3935309
prototypejs	mootools
you could use better ajax techniques like the available javascript libraries out there jquery dojo prototypejs mootools

3935346
integer	unsigned
if the lower 31 bits represent a one s complement integer that is a sign bit followed by 30 bits representing an unsigned magnitude then you need to convert it into two s complement so that java extracts the value properly

3935365
range	min	range	max	min	max
because i am bounding the sample size to the range of values from max to min i am selecting a different prime number that stays static as long as the same initial seed is given

3935365
min	max
i do this because i want the same sequence given the same seed and the same min max bounds for repeatability of testing

3935367
coalesce	isnull
some articles i found on the internet compared isnull with coalesce so i think my question is a little different

3935407
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
opera google-chrome flock firefox and maxthon

3935408
post	get
set the session variable before you redirect - the post is lost as the redirect is essentially a regular get request

3935430
hide	show
and let the css do the dirty work to hide most of the body and show alternate content

3935433
ant	maven
if i use ant directly the file is uploaded but if i call the ant task via maven using the maven-antrun-plugin i get the following error

3935460
mouseup	mousedown
i have not checked to see if the jquery library has fixed this since i asked the question what i did instead was use the mousedown and mouseup events to disable and enable

3935462
post	get
jmeter and most other load testing tools are designed to operate at the protocol-level http get http post etc

3935513
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in google-chrome 6.0.472.63 firefox 3.6 3 and 2 ie 8 7 and opera 10.62

3935525
apache	nginx
can i tell apache on server a to whenever see url www.mydomain.com en point to server b and nginx on server b with run new rails site

3935538
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
edit typically there would be a daemon running all the time that listens to the queue at my work i have a worker daemon that uses beanstalk client and beanstalkd for its job queue but if you have jobs being added only infrequently then a cron job is a good first implementation

3935543
profiling	benchmarking
if you are wanting to optimize then profiling and benchmarking don t guess

3935597
win64	windows
as a side note since you did not specify otherwise and masm is a windows program i assume you are assembling this for use on win64

3935605
google-chrome	firefox
these results are consistent across firefox and google-chrome strangely it works correctly in ie so i have to assume i m doing something wrong but i don t know what

3935648
g++	gcc
notice that even though i set cc gcc the output is always g++

3935655
hide	show
the better way do show hide where you don t have to worry about what the default display value might be is to define a class

3935658
settings.bundle	plist
i went through the process of creating a settings.bundle in the project root settings the root.plist to display as an iphone settings plist etc

3935674
google-chrome	firefox
there seems to be some bug while using google-chrome because in firefox this works

3935719
postgresql	mysql
i am using postgresql and due to a bit laziness and fear of breaking something i don t want to use mysql so i just add a gem postgresql in our gemfile

3935729
webrat	cucumber
i ve also tried using webrat for the secondary sessions but can t convince cucumber to switch drivers for a single step in a scenario although it does switch between scenarios

3935865
rss	feed
within a site i am working on the previous developer put together a very rudementary function to re-create the rss feed at the click of a button

3935865
rss	feed
i need to be able to have the rss feed continuously up-to-date without clicking on the button and running the function

3935893
int	boolean	int	double
must allow values to be many different types int strings double boolean lists of those

3935894
rss	feed
write your own .net rss feed in c#

3935907
apache	nginx
you could run nginx on a different port 8080 and then use apache s mod_proxy to send requests to nginx

3935914
comparator	comparable
alternatively you can use a treeset to sort on insertion using this comparator or make the employee a comparable object to sort using collections or a sortedset

3935963
hide	show
it seems to me if you need such message you have to continue to use div placed over the grid body and hide show it inside of loadcomplete event handle

3935974
graphics2d	bufferedimage
i think you are better off keeping one bufferedimage and graphics2d per thread in threadlocal variables and drawing over the previous captcha whenever you create a new one

3935982
clang	llvm
â the llvm clang static analyzer can typically find memory management problems even before you run your program

3935985
translation	localization
most localization solutions i ve run across involve using the same controller and action method names but specifying a culture parameter in the route which dictates which translation version of the view is presented

3935995
coalesce	isnull
my goal was to simulate the functionality of isnull or coalesce but linq doesn t like it

3936026
calloc	malloc
it is really more like calloc than malloc because the call

3936027
execl	fork	vfork	execl
if so how would the wrapper invoke the java program - fork clone vfork execl

3936040
min	max
it can really always be avoided you can even use foreach but ignore the values and use the key almost forgetting that its a foreach instead of for but avoiding any gaps in your keys and automatically have your bounds taken care of without length min max functions or anything

3936069
textarea	textbox
add select for dropdowns and textarea for multiline textbox

3936071
ssl	https
i have a small confusion on ssl handshake between browser and server in a typical https web scenario

3936079
filewriter	bufferedwriter
you can use java s scanner class to parse words of a file and process them in your application and then use a bufferedwriter or filewriter to write back to the file applying the changes

3936080
google-chrome	firefox
again firefox google-chrome ie8 ie9 all work properly

3936111
strcpy	strncpy
note that you should consider using the strncpy method instead of strcpy and check the return value to ensure that the buffers do not overrun

3936114
spaces	delimiter
so you hold tags keywords categories as a spaces delimiter string in your posts table

3936117
hash	md5
is there an md5 sha1 hash function already in the gnu library or do i have to use an external library for this

3936121
free	strdup
note you ll also need to free all of the strings you create with strdup .

3936155
comparator	comparable
implement comparable by creating a comparator employee method

3936161
versioning	upgrade
you may need to upgrade the versioning of php

3936181
hash	hmac	hash	md5	hmac	md5
authentication code hmac versions of both md5 and sha-1 hash

3936183
spaces	delimiter
i tried the search function but only found questions regarding reading in comma spaces delimiter files

3936207
button	checkbox
i also have a group component that deals with a group of checkbox or radio button

3936214
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	salt	md5
glibc s crypt uses a md5 based algorhytm if salt starts with 1

3936242
post	get
the ofxhttputils addon does not have any method for remembering the cookie from a post so the response i get back is just the login page

3936265
hide	show
your controller will stay within your existing navigation-controller hierarchy unlike fluchtpunkt s solution and the tab bar will automatically hide and show itself when your player controller appears and disappears

3936288
filtering	grouping
because it filtering users from the second grouping

3936321
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox and ie but google-chrome freaks out

3936326
userid	usergroups
what doesn t make sense to me is why there is no join between users and usergroups on userid

3936340
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to only happen in firefox mac i can t replicate the issue in google-chrome

3936364
post	put
both put and post are used for creates and updates it s not about if you re creating or updating it s about whether you already know the uri or you need the server to assign it for you

3936421
filtering	grouping
you are always returning every row from users ignore email filtering for now once for every row in usergroups because you have no join no matter what grouping they belong to

3936423
folder	directory
it s also possible but not likely that the media folder is only writable by the camera app in which case you d want to specify a different desired destination in the extra_output extra of the intent which invokes the camera so that the file will be written into your app s directory

3936469
glsurfaceview	viewanimator
i have a viewanimator setup to go through a few normal views buttons text etc and then to a glsurfaceview

3936469
glsurfaceview	viewanimator
beyond that i just use shownext and showprevious off the viewanimator and it works great until i try and switch to that glsurfaceview

3936496
post	get
i want to get the post only from the band not others from a facebook page wall its a band so no private profile and publish it on my own site

3936496
post	get
i hoped to get the post as xml or json and then parse them

3936497
super	self
if self super init

3936499
gridview	rowdatabound
alternatively you could bind the data to the child gridview programmatically via the parent gridview s rowdatabound event handler

3936500
post	put

3936922
ant	maven
as pascal has mentioned the maven-antrun-plugin is not using the ant specified by your ant_home environment variable and the configuration that he s mentioned is probably the best way to do it consistently from a pure maven perspective

3936922
ant	maven
the only potential benefit that you may derive from this approach is that the ant script may be runnable from maven and ant

3937019
children	parent
the parent should should have an abstract method like dosomething to be implemented by the children whatever was in _dosomethingwithchild1 should be in child1.dosomething etc

client-side	server-side
the main advantage of ria services is that they handles validation by using data annotations on server-side classes and do it in a smart way they automatically generate client side-classes with the same data-annotations and validate them by implementing automatically inotifydataerror on the client-side class

3937719
post	put	client-side	server-side
if one uses custom attributes and put the.shared.cs or .vb extension those attribute definitions are copied in the silverlight client and used in the client-side validation otherwise they are used only to perform server-side validation......for more information pls see my blog post

should be as fast as 3des aes turned out to be much faster than 3des in software typically 5 to 10 times faster

3938726
des	aes
the design of the aes benefited from 25 years of insights and research on des

3938726
des	aes
the original des designers were genius but one could say that the aggregate effort of cryptographers for the aes has been far greater

3938769
getter	setter
it will generate the getter setter you only need to declare the fields

3938770
getter	setter
most ides eg eclipse or netbeans include tools for automatically creating getter and setter methods for a class s fields

3938771
getter	setter
perhaps you mean to expose getter setter and make the fields private

3938772
opera	firefox
opera and firefox render things differently

3938828
cvs	svn
now you basically have the same centralized model you would have had under svn or cvs but with better ui and merging and the ability to do distributed work in future

so i m using a hidden field to hold the foreign key value and it works properly during post backs to get that value into the child task record

3939423
portrait	landscape
in ib add a uitableview and uiview to the existing root view for the controller and lay them out as desired probably worth altering the auto-resize parameters too if your app can be used in both landscape and portrait

3939425
children	parent
in a straight tree where the structure is only established by children nodes knowing their parent you d need a separate query to get each parent s immediate children

lua	scheme	lisp	scheme
a compiler can compile from a high-level language to another high-level language gwt which compiles java to ecmascript from a high-level language to a low-level language gambit which compiles scheme to c from a high-level language to machine code gcj which compiles java to native code from a low-level language to a high-level language clue which compiles c to java lua perl ecmascript and common lisp from a low-level language to another low-level language the android sdk which compiles jvml bytecode to dalvik bytecode from a low-level language to machine code the c1x compiler which is part of hotspot which compiles jvml bytecode to machine code machine code to a high-level language any so-called decompiler machine code to low-level language the jit compiler in jpc which compiles x86 native code to jvml bytecode and native code to native code the jit compiler in pearpc which compiles powerpc native code to x86 native code

3939834
actionscript	mxml
also there s clearly a lack of distinction between the languages mxml actionscript and the tools flash ide flashbuilder a problem that adobe should clearly address in that respect the name flashbuilder is a better choice than flex

3939898
width	height
its in your control to set the height and width of uislider using cgrectmake.

3939904
post	get
what could cause post back requests to get lost between server client when returning to an asp.net page due to inactivity

typedef	struct
so most of the interesting bits are actually in wait_queue_head_t which is a typedef of struct __wait_queue_head

3939965
int	double
your function zeroit reaches an int through double indirection

3939983
addition	multiplication
the best way is to simply use normal 1-dimensional arrays and compute the index yourself with multiplication and addition but in c99 you can also use vla semantics to have the compiler treat it like a real 2d array

3939984
int	double
cell 10 contains a pointer to cell 20 and cell 11 contains a pointer to 30 this is called double indirection - array is a sequential word width sequence of pointers to arrays of int there is no need to calculate just dereference two pointers

3940010
int	chars
what s happening is that scanf stops reading an int when it sees the . chars and leaves it in the input buffer

3940010
int	chars
then subsequent calls to scanf fail because the next chars is . and not something parseable as an int

3940042

3940368
bellman-ford	dijkstra
a shortest-path algorithm like bellman-ford or dijkstra has the side effect of telling you which nodes you can reach from a given node a -- which is exactly the list of nodes from which edges to a would form a loop

3940401
width	height
with your current setup you ll will need the pixel coordinate of the center of the sprite sheet the height of each row of sprites and the width of the sprites in each row since your sprites appear to have varying widths

3940422

children	parent
this does stop the wrapping within each child span correctly but also stop the parent div from wrapping the children so all spans are on a single line that stretches off the page

3944122
opera	google-chrome
however it does not work in opera and google-chrome because it so happens that window.event exists there too

int	chars
given a data structure having first n int and next n chars

3944221
ienumerable	iqueryable
when propagating linq query results from methods in this manner the best choice for the return type is ienumerable of t for linq to objects or iqueryable of t for other linq providers

3944221
ienumerable	iqueryable
in this case it looks like account is the type so ienumerable of account or iqueryable of t depending on the query type in question

3944224
int	chars
since the question calls for an array of int and chars which are of different sizes and is not strictly possible in c c++ more information is needed

3944224
int	chars
how big are the int and how big are the chars

3944287

one of my design objectives is to provide bindable business objects inotifypropertychanged ieditableobject etc. to make it easy to consume these on the client-side

3944505
integer	unsigned
i ve found that while detecting an unsigned integer overflow is pretty trivial detecting a signed overflow in c c++ is actually more difficult than most people think

3944505
subtract	addition
however this solution is unfortunately a lot less efficient than the initial solution since you have to perform a subtract operation just to test if your addition operation will work

3944510
prng	random
now any functions which need a prng can run within the random monad to request them as needed

3944577
lisp	scheme
the work you d have left is to implement delimited continuations but you knew that already when you ruled out lisp scheme

3944594
.htaccess	httpd.conf
create a section in etc apache2 httpd.conf using and move all the directives from the offending .htaccess to that section

3944610
goto	break
this is actually an idiom in c - instead of using a goto you can have a do while 0 loop with a break statement if you want to bail out of the construct early

3944648
move	drag
i d like the user to be able to move and resize the items using the mouse to drag handles around on-screen

3944979
post	get
while it s too late to get any points out of this i thought i d post the best way for posterity

3944989
post	get
to get rid of those you ll have to either start using post or immediately redirect to the desired url upon receiving a get request

3945008
post	get
try doing a equivalent get request for the possibly post login request that is probably happening right now for login

3945041
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
you should wait in the loop with a manualresetevent or autoresetevent

multi-tier timer where each object has a master timer that checks all of the functions the object could need to perform runs any that are ready and then sets the next timer interval to the next required action time

3945086
min	max
second you have to pass a min and a max to your randomnumber method

3945096
min	max
randomnumber has two parameters min and max

3945097
min	max
in btnplay_click but the randomnumber method requires min and max

3945186
kde	gnome
gnome kde or similar desktop interface get notified of this via d-bus that a new device has been installed and mounted i m not 100 about the exact steps here

3945186
kde	gnome	daemons	systemd
you could try altering your udev rules or the script that mounts new drives to do this for you or write a new daemons that gets notified the way that desktop management systemd like gnome or kde get notified to run it but there is no facility that i know if that already does this

3945199

this works for a test case if i resize the browser window so the coordinates are on the edge - i get the width as it would be if i put the div at those coordinates

3945255
getter	setter
say you have a property p what you will have to do is write a getter and a setter for it

3945332
ceil	floor
e.g. cast minutes to a float divide by 15 use either the floor ceil function for decrement increment then multiply by 15 again

3945340
min	max
however two successive calls to randomnumber int min int max will give the same five results if they are called within the same time slice

3945537
uiview	subviews
generally speaking uiviewcontrollers are intended to host full-screen views and if you re adding the view as a subviews you should ask yourself if the view should just be a uiview subclass and move the logic into the parent view controller

3945587
getter	setter
i had set the value of connfd to 7 using the setter and then when i was using the getter i was getting the value 65534

3945610
getter	setter
are you sure the unexpected results are because of the getter setter

3945626
hash	md5
usually md5 hash hash in general are represented as hexadecimal strings instead of base64 which then only contain a-f0-9

3945640
hash	md5
you might want to consider using the hexadecimal representation of your md5 hash instead since this is a fairly standard way of representing those as a string

3945659
folder	directory
generally it s not good practise to write to the program files directory i usually write log file to the appdata folder which you can get at by using

3945671
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome i can do and everything works

3945671
opera	safari
that code in ie safari and opera gives be a nan

3945679
mouseleave	mouseenter
i used two timers named tmrenlarge and tmrshrink which activate on mouseenter and mouseleave events respectively

3945693
getter	setter
hereâ s a revised version of your class that properly initializes id marks the getter as const and removes the unnecessary return value from the setter

3945722
ienumerable	iqueryable
are you also aware that you can convert an iqueryable which gets sent to sql server to an ienumerable in order to have the query processed by the .net framework instead of sql server

3945722
ienumerable	iqueryable
the first part i ll query as an ienumerable and the other part as an iqueryable and then join the two together

3945723
post	put
you can do this using the http put method but not with post

3945739

actualheight	actualwidth
from mdm20 s comment i noticed that the actualwidth and actualheight of the grid increases continuously if i wrap the grid around a scrollviewer

3945785
width	height
do i need to have hard values for the width and height of the grid

3945827
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the other option instead of using .htaccess although wordpress is built around modifying that file you can take the contents of the .htaccess and add them to a directive in your httpd.conf or virtual host config file

3945841
getter	setter
a small debate flared up in a question about protected member variables regarding the use of getter setter

3945841
getter	setter
there are lots of questions already over whether getter setter are evil however one particular argument against them which was posed by two separate individuals with much higher reputation than myself struck me

3945841
getter	setter
one said that getter setter made the code only 0.01 less brittle and the other stated that adding 10 lines of code where one would do makes the code more brittle

3945854
children	parent
what is wrong is that after you want the children to be responsible of selecting what implementation should the parent factory method return

3945854
children	parent
it s wrong in terms of design because you are delegating to all children what can be simply pushed up and centralized into the abstract superclass and also it shows you are mixing together patterns that are used in different contexts abstract factory parent decide what family of classes clients are going to get and factory method children factories select what the clients will get

3945854
children	parent
more test friendly and extension friendly solution is simply to have children that are not singleton but packaged into some internal package that you will document as private and abstract parent that can expose the singleton mimiking static getinstance and will cache the children instances enforcing that clients always get the same service instance

3945957
labwindows	cvi
last time i used it labwindows cvi suite by national instruments was a c only compiler

sometimes after a class the next line comes on the same line and i need to put say 10 to get it to the next line

3946009
for-loop	loops
i don t care how it s done whether it s a for-loop or a while loops just at the end of the day i have a list of strings instead of person

3946034
gridview	sqldatasource	gridview	entitydatasource	sqldatasource	entitydatasource
if i go through the configure gridview and configure datasource wizard for any datasource sqldatasource object entitydatasource when i use multiple tables i cannot use the where parameters in the wizard and therefore need to have the selecting code in the code-behind but i m unsure where exactly to put this

3946036
post	get
what i d love to do is get question #1 and update it based on the post data

3946070
post	get
if you ve ever seen when you hit a back button and you get that dialog do you want to resubmit this query that s because the results of the previous page are from a post not a get

3946085
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i have dealt with this problem before and it was the result of a hidden .htaccess i know you said you have checked for one but possibly try checking your htdocs folder because if you documentroot is set to htdocs in your httpd.conf then any folders inside that will inherit your .htaccess setup

3946108
prepare	execute
therefore the following code should prepare the statement once and execute it 10 times

3946109
for-loop	arrays
so i ve placed each curve as an arrays in a cell index y this allows me to index through arrays of different sizes inside a for-loop

3946109
for-loop	arrays
i use hold all below to enable each iteration of the for-loop to plot each new arrays in the cell arrays y inside the same plot

3946124
google-chrome	safari
it seems to be fine in google-chrome 6.0.472.63 and ie 8 not had a chance to test it in safari

3946172
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the visited links lack the bottom border though although all other styles are applied

3946190
versioning	upgrade
i think it boils to just installing a newer versioning of pydev this is the solution for many bugs - add as an update site and then upgrade to the latest versioning

3946240
treeviewitem	listboxitem
my workaround is to use an attached behavior that utilizes the preview events to intercept the focus before it happens and set the underlying item accordingly which works great when i ve hard-coded treeviewitem or listboxitem etc. but i don t want to hard-code the type since the control shouldn t really care

3946270
ati	nvidia
wikipedia has tables of headline figures for ati cards here and for nvidia cards here

3946282
postgresql	mysql
for development often sqlite is sufficient and ideal because it just uses an easily transportable file rather than having to create dump load and manage user access to something like mysql or postgresql

3946289
mouseover	mouseout
handle the mouseover mouseout events for the parent element instead

3946317
mouseleave	mouseenter
use mouseenter and mouseleave instead

3946317
mouseleave	mouseenter
that won t happen with mouseenter mouseleave

3946363
dbf	dbase
that being said the dbase formatted files dbf are still used

3946396
post	get
in this case whenever you access the post property of an already loaded user the data will get loaded from the db

3946415
pull	push
note since you are using a dvcs which introduces publication push pull which is orthogonal to branching you might want to fetch the same branch2 from the remote and merge it in your local branch2

3946435
google-chrome	firefox
setting the span to display inline seems to work in google-chrome and firefox

3946490
int	double
seems like all your issues stem from reading in matrix values as int rather than double

3946490
int	double
everything works fine if you change temp in read_mat to an int then cast it to a double when you re putting it in the matrix

3946514
sorting	filtering
i have full control over columns sorting filtering style etc via the jquery configuration script which is rather straightforward

3946515
int	double
more to the point why use nsdecimalnumber at all as opposed to a c int or double or whatever

3946541
pull	push
i want to push and pull things off of a stack in an atomic way using ruby and mongodb

3946549
stdout	stderr
if you don t want wget s stderr output emailed either you can also add a after the dev null which further redirects stderr to stdout which is now going to dev null

3946550
public	protected
i think there s a fair reason for a standard collection not to support a public cloning method but only a protected one it s possible that a class which derives from a collection might break severely if cloned and if base class cloning method is public there s no way to prevent an object of a derived class from being given to code that expects to clone it

3946610
nsstring	nsobject
isequalto is an nsobject method which should be extended overriden by subclasses like nsstring isequaltostring basically it compares an object with another object in a way you would expect it to with the contents

3946641
int	chars
basically what i m asking is does anyone disagree that static simple c types non-objects like chars short int and long and structs without constructors composed of those types are initialized when an executable is loaded into memory before main or any other constructor is invoked

3946642
width	height
the problem is that the defined in the skin draws some line that go outside the bounds of the skin s width height

3946642
width	height
unless i explicitly set the width and height from outside

3946642
width	height
i can only draw the path after i know the width and height of the component..

3946665
uiview	subviews
when i add a subviews to a uiview or when i resize an existing subviews i would expect and to reflect that change

3946672
mouseout	mouseenter
however when moving from the image to the button which is over the image the mouseout mouseenter is triggered so the buttons fade out then fade back in the buttons have the same class as the image otherwise they just stay faded out

3946694
int	chars
basically what i m asking is does anyone disagree that static simple c types non-objects like chars short int and long and structs without constructors composed of those types are initialized when an executable is loaded into memory before main or any other constructor is invoked

3946711
webkit	gecko
one can get consistent behaviour at least between webkit and gecko by giving the outer element some width

3946740
for-loop	while-loop
i m not really sure of what you are trying to do here but generally continue will break out of an if-block or go to the next iteration of a for-loop while-loop etc

3946771
sorting	filtering	hide	show
our data is tabular so we send it via ajax to datatables this allows for good ui formatting sorting filtering and show hide of columns

3946773
mouseover	mouseout
put the image and the button in the same div then put the mouseover mouseout events on the div

3946781
comparator	comparable
i would use a comparator instead of comparable if you are going to change the way you sort

3946800
jar	war
building a war or a jar is similar for different projects and you can predict where to find information this is as opposed to the free-form style provided by ant where targets can be written and organized in a lot of different ways

3946819
int	double
arithmetic operations in java whose operands are all int s will result in int s so you re actually assigning an int result to a double variable

3946820
int	double
by casting score to a double you are dividing a floating-point value with an int and you get a floating-point value back

3946839
routedevent	frameworkelement
i want to invoke all registered routedevent handlers of a frameworkelement a mouseleftbuttonup or a mousemove of a contentcontrol canvas ...

3946855
getter	setter
i m assuming you actually have getter and setter for the properties you want to use

3946868
apache	lighttpd
since you ve switched to lighttpd the webserver itself is going to use fewer resources than apache would but apache is rarely the bottleneck unless you ve run out of ram or seriously misconfigured it

3946875
onmouseover	mouseout
hover on a span doesn t work in ie6 so if you need to make that browser hover-highlight you would have to have onmouseover mouseout code to add or remove a .hover classname.

3946892
cos	sin
i understand what sin and cos and some other trigonometric functions means but i don t really get what kind of problems they solve

3946908
getter	setter
i ll agree that changes in c# are nice closures delegates etc. but anyone who s writing java without an ide that easily generates all the getter setter you need automatically is crazy

3946922
getter	setter
it s all about getter setter

3946946
uiview	subviews
if you want any other functionality such as resizing a view to fit its subviews you should subclass uiview and override -sizethatfits

3946956
getter	setter
it s just shorthand syntax for the type of getter setter methods you write in java

3946970
gridview	rowdatabound
i ve done this often by creating divs underneath in a rowdatabound event for gridview

3947022
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome opera and previous firefox had no problem with the the essentially null function while the new version did

3947034
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
when second button is pressed the press event may be entered on touchesbegan touchesmoved or touchesended you have to check touches count at these places

3947042
getter	setter
the getter setter say there is a method to set something called foo and a method to get something called foo but what s implied is there is a property called foo of type int. i think having language support to intuitively define exactly what you mean is a good thing

3947045
cos	sin
if you have a basic understanding of sin and cos you should be able to use them to make the clock drawing pretty easy

3947045
cos	sin
if that doesn t give you your answer try to draw it without sin and cos

3947049
post	get
not sure how i would get the post count with this

3947077
getter	setter
particularly i prefer to use properties in c# instead on c++ or java setter and getter which are merely functions with special usage

3947086
getter	setter
i also want to have getter and setter methods for each field

3947103
put	get
some programmers might argue it s better to put the conditions throughough the logic not just inside the loop header and to employ break statements to get out at appropriate places

3947114
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
viewdidappear bool animated only gets called when the view is shown by uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

3947126
tolower	toupper
i also don t want to use toupper tolower for performance reasons

3947139
strdup	malloc
as i am using the heap through strdup which calls malloc i do not understand why minurltime is not null until the thread is exited but then it is null

3947139
strdup	malloc
once pthread_exit is called although minurltime is a global variable that was allocated through strdup which calls malloc it appears to be null

3947145
put	get
i can t seem to find what event i need to put my code in to read the screen and get the left top

3947160
folder	directory
if i visit folder such as css and com which are folder in the web root it displays a 404 error page and adds the to the end of the url because it s treating it as a directory

3947160
folder	directory
if someone types in a folder name that happens to exist it will redirect the user to the path with the at the end of the url signifying that it s a directory

3947160
folder	directory
for the pictures directory explained above the user does not have permission to access that folder so it is redirecting them to a 403 access denied page rather than simply showing the page that is supposed to be displayed there via the rewriterule above

3947172
udp	tcp
basically i would like to use boost asio s sockets like linux socket descriptors whether the underlying socket is udp or tcp it doesn t matter you can call read write sendto etc.

3947172
udp	tcp
is there a more proper solution than just writing a wrapper class around asio s udp tcp socket classes

3947203
kde	gnome
i mean the basic building block or principle they used to draw visual components on the screen like kde gnome etc

3947211
udp	tcp
you need to use a particular type of socket like boost asio ip tcp socket which is a stream-based tcp socket or boost asio ip udp socket which is for datagrams

3947229
fadein	hide	hide	show
show the image on mousedown using show or fadein or whatever tickles your fancy then hide it inside your success callback

3947264
war	manifest.mf
can you provide us with the exact composition of your ear file your war file and the manifest.mf file of both

3947268
rss	feed
you might want to take a look at the .net wcf syndication framework makes creating serving rss atom feed relatively simple

3947273
postgresql	mysql
is there a way to do this in rails safely that will work across dbs like sqlite mysql or postgresql heroku uses

3947291
post	get
finally this blog post by google at long last real-time stock quotes are here claims to offer free data on certain stocks but in google finance s pages i can t find anything about it nor at their api pages and again who knows what delay i get from the realtime data

3947296
int	double
in the case of the position class one would assume that the attributes are all primitive types int or double and therefore a deep versus shallow copying is moot

3947296
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if the objects in the array are serializable then you can copy them by using objectoutputstream and objectinputstream serialize and then deserialize the array

3947301
folder	directory
all i want to do is change directory to this folder

3947374
hide	show
rest assured when you use it right it s quite easy to create multiple windows and to hide and show them at will

3947388

integer	unsigned
in my experience using unsigned types breaks a lot of common approaches to error checking and makes it so that you run into integer storage wrapping errors and bugs almost immediately yet at the same time makes it more difficult to reason about the solution

3951513
integer	unsigned
if var1 were a signed 16-bit integer loading it from memory would be slower than if it were unsigned because of the necessary sign extension but if it were kept in a register the compiler would not be required to worry about the upper bits

3952125

problem is some reports are very large and require every mm of page to print reports so i setup page size a4extra 32cm height and 22 cm width but problem is printer not recognizing page setup it always give a4 print size which leaves reports half printed and after some pages printed new soft page start on middle of physical page so soft pages not printed separately on physical pages so result is ugly report print

3952314
children	parent
if you mean that given a node n that belongs to a tree t it has the same parent and same children you will clarify us if the transformation you apply to the t to get the simplified one t1 outcomes a different tree or an homomorphic tree

3952337
width	height
the only other thing i needed to do was ensure that the height and width parameters passed to the function which are measured in inches got converted to pixels correctly

3952337
width	height
i couldn t use vb6 s existing inches-to-pixels conversion function since it takes the current dpi into account which would create inconsistent results since the text height and width is normalized to 96dpi so instead i just multiplied the height and width by 96 which converts them to what their pixel measurements would be at 96 dpi

3952357
min	max	width	height
in any case you should be able to override this behavior by setting min max height width as needed

3952604
keydown	keyup
now i could work around that and fake it by sending that event first then looking at the e.handled before sending the actual keydown message which makes sense but then i hit another wall with the previewkeyup and keyup events since thanks to setting e.handled above i never get the real key up events to know when to send the fake ones

3952610

int	chars
yes using an int instead of a chars will often result in a noticeable performance freebie

3953953
x86	mips
also try at a minimum x86 and arm perhaps mips gcc 3.x 4.x and llvm

3953953
int	chars
in particular notice how a single chars mixed in with a list of int in a line of declarations may cause the int that follow to not be aligned which is fine for x86 from an address standpoint but will cost in performance on an x86 even with a cache

3953953
int	chars
use simple habits like use unsigned int for everything unless you have a specific reason put your larger aligned variables and structures first in a list of declarations and the unaligned stuff last shorts then chars

3953953
int	chars
it is much better to multiply two chars instead of two int for example if the numbers support it so if you do happen to know the int are really 7 bit or 5 bit or whatever quantities typecast them down for the multiply and allow a hardware multiply to happen instead of a soft multiply

versioning	upgrade	jruby	mri

pop-up	dialog
if you want it to open inline inside the browser without any pop-up dialog you could try setting the content-disposition http header on the server

postgresql	mysql
use at least sqlite aside of mysql postgresql other_big_rdbm

3955103
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works fine in safari 5 on the mac but doesn t seem to do anything in google-chrome or firefox

3955109
for-loop	arrays
this is a question about incrementing one value of a matlab arrays multiple times in the same statement without having to use a for-loop

3955126
int	double
primitive variables bytes double int etc. are not references in java

3955144
jmx	sigar
it will be fairly straight forward to create a jmx mbean that uses sigar to expose this data

3955205
google-chrome	safari
the code itself works fine and the drop down works in safari but for some reason it won t open in google-chrome

3955212
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
second your viewwillappear viewdidappear will get called when you write the code to call them from your mainviewcontroller

3955212
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
without knowing anything else about your design it s not really possible to advise on when you should call them but if the sub-controllers views are to be always visible when the main view is visible then it probably makes sense to call them from the viewwillappear viewdidappear methods of your mainviewcontroller

3955243
wordpress	joomla
it s a place where you can find many pre-built force.com apps think about them like plugins to wordpress joomla oscommerce...

3955245
hash	md5
one option is to make your stored hash include an algorithm version number - so you start with algorithm 0 md5 and store

3955245
versioning	upgrade
then when you upgrade to sha-1 you bump the versioning number to 1

3955260
decoder	encoder
you can use closure library google to make a cross browser json encoder decoder

3955271
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so the problem is that viewwillappear viewdidappear get called when the view is added to the window not to one of it s subview

3955291
nunit	mstest
many of them run different unit tests some mstest some nunit

3955293
children	parent
suppose container is your parent movieclip and it has many children then now your target and currenttarget property depends on which object the listener is attached and how much you have nested your movieclips

3955293
children	parent
in my case the container is your parent movieclip having two or more children

3955302
postgresql	mysql
i know i could just store them in mysql or postgresql oracle and ms sql server are out for this but some other open source data store may be fine and just put the haversine formula in there where clause but i don t think that is going to yield efficient results

3955309
pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	pbkdf2
so if your existing hash are straight md5s and you plan on moving to some form of pbkdf2 or bcrypt or scrypt then change your password hash to

3955309
pbkdf2	md5
you already have the md5 in your database so all you do is apply pbkdf2 to it

3955309
hash	md5
the reason this works well is that the weaknesses of md5 vs other hash sha- don t affect password use

3955309
hash	md5
compared to longer hash md5 reduces the hash search-space somewhat with its 128-bit output but this is insignificant compared to the password search space itself which is much much smaller

3955309
pbkdf2	md5	pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
what makes a password hash strong is slowing down achieved in pbkdf2 by iterations and a random long-enough salt - the initial md5 doesn t adversely affect either of them

3955330
postgresql	mysql
to clarify the data will be stored in mysql postgresql but indexed by and searched via sphinx

3955333
width	height
then you can just get the width of your view the screen size you can just use an if else statement to get the height of status bar

3955359
pull	push
getting a handle of how to structure repositories with common functionality but customizations in each can be a little tricky but if you structure things right you can do all of your intra-repo migrations using using push pull and merge and never have to fix a bug twice have the same code in different changesets or re-do a repository s customization

3955363
comparator	comparable
your comparator implementation will cast class to comparable and use its compare method

3955376
width	height
i tried width 100 and height 100 that also didn t workout

3955390
temp	tmp
setup copy support into temp direcotry tmp

3955419
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.6.10 google-chrome 6.0.4.

3955445
lisp	smalltalk
oo and byte code compilation goes back to the 70s with smalltalk and i m sure someone will say lisp as early as the 50s 60s

3955506
uilabel	uibutton
create a xib file with a set of uibutton s for #s 1-9 a uilabel to show the currently entered number and a call button

3955507
min	max
max min load time for each php page page1.php page2.php page3.php etc

3955541
rodbc	rjdbc
yes this is possible using eg mysql linked to r with the rmysql and dbi package or via the rodbc or rjdbc package

3955614
eiffel	ada
note that as well as c++ and objective c eiffel ada 9x vala and go are oo languages of varying vintage that are compiled straight to native code

3955616
capitalization	uppercase
well there are a number of ways to look at this if you want client-side capitalization then something like the jquery capitalizer would automatically convert text into uppercase during typing if hooked into say the keyup event

3955678
listbox	icollectionview
in the case of selection changed events it s better to use wpf built-in support for that create an icollectionview that wraps your collection bind it to an itemscontrol listbox etc. and the icollectionview will have its currentitem automatically synchronized to the current selection

3955692
int	chars
i know how to convert hexadecimals to int when i only have one hexadecimal chars

3955706
width	height
and the code after i switch to it totalwidth being the width of the parent viewheight half the height of the parent

3955727
equals	icomparable
note that if you implement icomparable you must override equals along with the

3955727
comparator	icomparer
but the correct answer is to implement icomparer instead of comparator if your objects are mutable and pass an instance of the icomparer to sorting functions when necessary

3955727
equals	gethashcode
furthermore it doesn t require or even suggest using equals gethashcode or - you re free to define it in any way you please

3955727
comparator	icomparer
in short use comparator for value types and icomparer for reference types

3955732
fgets	fgetc	fgets	strtok	fgetc	strtok
you re probably better off using fgets and strtok or writing a little loop around fgetc to do what you want

3955760
put	get
i can t figure out how to format the insert into sql string so it will get the data from mysite2.com and put it in mysite1.com

3955808
spaces	delimiter
because the wildcard gets replaced with spaces delimiter filenames you ll have to post-process argv after optionparser has run against it or programmatically glob the directory and build the list that way

3955839
debian	linux
i am familiar with debian linux mostly and originally found this post when i got started

3955884
width	height
using the function above you can test the height width of the uploaded image and resize if necessary

3955888
put	get
to get this rolling for the first time you ll want to put 0 in last_position.temp so there s no errors or hard feelings

3955890
stdout	fflush
when running gdb through a terminal stdout is line buffered which means that it will be fflush every time a newline is read resulting in the behavior i was expecting

3955890
stdout	fflush
eclipse cdt runs gdb with stdout in block buffered mode which means it will only fflush stdout when it reaches a certain size or if it is manually fflush

3955890
stdout	fflush
is so short the buffer for stdout will never be fflush unless a call to fflush is made

3955890
stdout	fflush
i managed to fix this problem by adding fflush stdout

3955937
width	height
i am not sure what you want exactly but by using the following settings you can make sure either the width or the height of the image is 228px

3955937
width	height
if width height width will be 228px

3955967
phpdoc	codesniffer
we currently use phpdoc to generate all of our documentation and have a strict php codesniffer standard that ensures documentation is complete and consistent

3956068
yslow	pagespeed
i ve been experimenting with yslow and pagespeed both provide very helpful advice and neither seems to have an advantage over the other but when it comes to entity tags they seem to disagree or conflict in some way

3956107
inherited	properties
so what s really the recommended way to do object inherited in javascript that doesn t have problem and that visually encapsulates better all the object s methods and properties

3956184
integer	fractions
this may also be the easiest way to see that the sum of the fractions parts is an integer

3956203
google-chrome	firefox
maybe you ll also hear soon about indexeddb now supported on ie 10 firefox and google-chrome which is a kind of local sessionstorage but which you can use to store javascripts objects instead of only strings

submit	submission
i m having issues submission the result of a form submission i can submit a form but i can t submit the form on the page that follows the first

3956287
google-chrome	firefox
however since google-chrome and firefox in the vmware windows xp machine function properly seems to point directly to ie8 as the culprit

3956327
put	get
but once i put in a user control and called it from another page i get this error -

3956352
allocator	stl
quicksort of which stl probably uses an optimized version can sort an array in-place meaning it requires absolutely no heap allocator

3956356
min	max
the scoring function is called recursively at each depth and depending on whether or not the depth is odd or even it select max or min respectively for all possible moves

3956359
amr	aac
i ve been transcoding a 22kb audio amr file to m4a aac and my encoding bandwidth goes up in increments of 0.03 gb

3956374
google-chrome	firefox
still works in google-chrome and firefox

3956374
google-chrome	firefox
an interesting aspect of this is that the session seems to be working on google-chrome and firefox browsers

3956387
width	height
setting a max width and height on an uploaded image isn t necessarily going to fix your problem as you could upload an image with a much higher dpi and it still be a large image with small dimensions

3956415
maya	blender
you need to find a way to convert them from your 3d software maya max blender to whatever data format you want to store them in your application in and you need to store them in your application somehow using control structures

3956433
mouse	keyboard
if you are trying to automate mouse clicks and keyboard strokes you can try autoit

3956601
debian	linux
you could try to figure out if that can be changed but since you have vmware try to compile it under a virtualized linux minimal debian is quite light-weight

3956622
client-side	server-side
separate out your validation logic so you can call it from both client-side and server-side code enables next point

3956630

3956833
free	malloc
my question now is there any other malloc implementation or alternative function for malloc and free functions

3956835
inherited	properties
you d still have a base class of user but instead of using sti which would limit you to a single inherited structure you could mix in modules based on the roles each user has which might simply pivot on what properties belong_to a given user during initialization

3956843
rtp	rtcp
for purposes of sending video over the network you might want to take a look at rtp rtcp rfcs

3956848

3956859
width	height
you must know the height and width of your raw image

3956915
int	chars
if you wanted to use unsigned int instead of unsigned chars you would simply calculate the number of bits for that

3956934
post	get
just set up a page which handles the data correctly and then make a get or post call from the page that currently has the flash thing

3956968
post	get
if you use html helpers to generate those input tags then when rendering they will first look at the request parameters post and get and then the model and viewdata

3956974
post	get
you can send this over the client using ajax or even a normal post get and then wait for the response to do something with it

3956977
macports	homebrew
i strongly prefer homebrew over macports for installing software from source

3957019
getter	setter
you can read the clang compiler source to see the c++ code that generates the getter and setter methods

3957019
getter	setter
while not literally the same as the code that is generated this code is much easier to read and gives a clear indication of what a proper getter and setter should do

3957073

you can get the rss version of the tag feed using the following url

3957082
getter	setter
iâ ve tried writing getter and setter for the params

3957082

you would create an instance of that set the audio params through accessor and then finally it would build an audioprocessor instance for you setting all the properties through a non-public setters so that you could not change them later and break the invariant

3957117
maven	pom.xml
as a temporal solution i added this libs to my maven repository and everything seems to work fine but i would like to know names of the proper libs to add to my pom.xml

3957119
range	minimum
given that the internet is limited by the speed of light in copper you can always expect one-way latencies to typically be in the range of at least 100ms minimum for your far clients often 500ms or longer

3957154
profiling	debugging
of course you can only debugging the code to see the generated sql but it s easier with a profiling tool and you ll see how long time the query takes

3957165
rss	feed
that is there should be many sections of rss feed based on date

3957180
int	chars
note a chars value converts implicitly into int so there is no conversion needed in that direction

3957180
int	chars
you only have to convert the int back to chars

3957207
int	boolean
there is an issue filed with redhat about this but in the meantime your option is either to rewrite the snmp adapter it s open-source after all or to write mbeans which re-expose the required information as string long int expose boolean as 1 or 0

3957212
queue	fifo
for an embedded application i am trying to implement a fifo fifo queue of structs using ansi c

3957233
firefox	safari
it was all working fine last night but when i fired it up this morning i got the error disallowed key characters but then realized this error was only occuring in firefox not safari where the site loads fine

3957252
int	chars
the size of an int type or any type in units of chars bytes is easily computed as sizeof type

3957280
dynamic-languages	typechecking
because groovy is a dynamic-languages it s not possible for the compiler to perform the same rigorous typechecking that you get with java but at the very least the netbeans groovy editor should provide some hints warnings if you re referencing classes that don t exist for example

3957288
superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
there s a superclass with an ivar and a subclassing which accesses the protected superclass ivar

3957288
superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
it seems like adding a synthesized property in a subclassing without a corresponding ivar is actually hiding an unrelated superclass ivar

3957297
pkcs#12	pfx
the client certificate is pfx pkcs#12 and has private key

3957320
post	get
in the ajax get request send request to url or your tag s url which would list out post in the tag

3957323
width	height
you can set the stagescalemode to no scale but you can also define a set swf width height these dimensions can be both define in your code but also in your html embedding code

3957329
versioning	upgrade

3957510
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the following snippet is reproducing the issue in google-chrome 6.0 and firefox 3.6.10 but not opera 10.63 which surprisingly doesn t have the problem and this was working before upgrading jquery from 1.3.x and jquery-ui 1.7.x as far as i can remember.

in my xaml page i am using listbox for which no width and height is specified and this custom panel is called from itemspanel template

3957770
width	height
when the class is derived from panel class the width and height received in the parameter is infinity

3957901
mamp	wamp
have you looked at using wamp xamp mamp lamp for development locally

3957902
boost	stl
we also may want to call the member function of our own class on each member of the collection - the latter requires boost bind to achieve the former can be done with the stl mem_fun family of classes if we don t have a collection of shared_ptr in which case we need to boost bind in this case too

3957964
range	max
and int has a range from -2 31 to 2 31 - 1 which is just below what you are calculating int max 2147483647 you 2160000000 so you overflow the int to the negative range

it seems to me that under some circumstances using property without an ivar can hide other ivars resulting in compilation errors see why does a subclassing property with no corresponding ivar hide superclass ivars

3958128
jar	war
lets say i have a jar file named abc.jar and run the following command it will create abc-1.0.jar and if i bundle this artifact in a war file the resulting file name will be abc-1.0.jar

anyway i would be very thankful to hear any suggestion about how to perform sorting that divides the pairs into grouping by the number of interactions interaction durations and the intervals between the interactions - is it possible to calculate timespans between two consecutive records sorted by date and then select the grouping of pairs which interacted commonly and or for a long time by using solely sql queries or is it neccesary to write custom algorithm

3959702
int	chars
first of all anything you pass to printf except the first parameter undergoes default promotions which means among other things that chars and short are both promoted to int before being passed

3959702
int	chars
so even if what you were passing really did have type chars by the time it got to printf it would have type int

3959702
int	chars
in your case you re using a chars literal which already has type int anyway

3959702
int	chars
second even without default promotions chars literals in c already have type int anyway â 6.4.4.4 10

3959702
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

3959702
int	chars
so in this case the values start with type int and aren t promoted--but even if you started with chars s something like

3959702
int	chars
...what printf receives would be of type int not type chars anyway

3959704
int	chars
in c a chars literal is a value of type int

3960234
pull	push
don t shame them for having a branchy history -- good dvcs use involves a lot of pull merge push cycles

3960234
pull	push
if you make them use rebase or collapse to turn 30 changesets with 15 merges into one changeset per feature bug then they re incentivized to keep thing local until they re ready to pull merge push the whole thing at once

3960234
rss	feed
nothing draconian and silly like ranking developers by lines of code but something that can be noticed whether it s an aggregate rss feed from all the repo rss feed or a commits email alias that gets a quick x pushed changeset y into repo z message whenever someone pushes

bazaar	svn
i actually prefer bzr-svn because instead it stores the bazaar revid in the remote svn revision using the svn revision properties feature instead which means no local revision rewrite

3960734
bazaar	svn
it also has the property desired that two independent pulls of the same svn branch will result in identical and interoperable bazaar branches

i wanted that upon clicking on a button a certain field would hide and on clicking on another yes another one would hide too but of course it had to make the other show otherwise we would end up with nothing and the purpose was to present different fields depending on what the user clicked on a radio button so in a childish way i made my code and it worked

i have a solution that needs to build silverlight projects on a computer that doesn t have standard editing tools like vs or expression-blend

3961525

innodb	myisam
as for mixing innodb myisam - mysql fully supports mixing matching table types in queries

3961887
innodb	myisam
you can select join update insert delete alter in any order you want just remember that doing anything to a myisam table within an innodb transaction will not make myisam magically transaction aware

3961887

your eclipse project has a valid pom.xml and all dependencies are available you should see errors on maven console in the problems or markers view or when opening pom.xml in m2e s pom.xml editor

3962714
maven	pom.xml
project configuration is in sync with pom.xml you can use maven update project configuration from the project popup menu

3962722
button	checkbox
i m looking to create a listview screen similar to the sound setting screen in the built in settings app see image below i.e i want some rows to have text + checkbox other rows to have text + pop up button some rows should have text only etc

3962761
division	modulo
the division and modulo should run in shorter and more consistent time than the loop on any machine that has hardware division which many do

3962761
next	except
another way to do this which is functionally similar to what you have would be to have the last step of processing each timer event be to queue up the next timer event note that no one else should send timer events except for the first one if this is the way you choose to implement the game

3962785
stdout	stderr
3 only stdout is normally caught by a basic redirect so the original stdout must be discarded and stderr must be send to stdout

3962788
floating-point	integer
first off you say that youâ re using an integer but the number is actually a floating-point number not an integer

3962788
floating-point	integer
because as i said youâ re trying to assign a floating-point number to an integer

3962800
stdout	stderr
reopen stdout to point to where stderr currently points

3962800
stdout	stderr
reopen stderr to point to where fd 3 currently points which is where stdout pointed before the previous step was completed

3962800
stdout	stderr
now stdout and stderr have been succesfully swapped

3962843
width	height
although if the height was different to the width of each tile which could happen you would need to calculate them individually

3962869
jlist	jtable
usually when i try to do something the jlist can t do i just switch to jtable without a second thought

3962871
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried different plugins and different browsers firefox opera and google-chrome

3962871
google-chrome	firefox
when i renamed it makes firefox and google-chrome ask to install flash but still

3962882
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it works in all the major browsers - mozilla firefox 1.5+ opera 9+ safari and ie6+

3962936
strncmp	memcmp
if you were to write your own version of a string prefix comparing function essentially memcmp or strncmp then you would have separated the job of matching the length of the string from looking deeper into the string and probably would not have made such a mistake

3962956
arpack	lapack
it wraps several libraries such as lapack arpack and superlu and it gives you a nice python interface to work with

3962984
children	parent
a station entity the parent contains a collection of observations objects the children

3962984
children	parent
in this case i m not interested in the collection of children observations related to the parent stations being fully fetched before the collection of parent is returned

3963026
ada	algol
wikipedia also mentions ada and algol

3963033
folder	directory
then look for it in your current directory probably your bin folder

3963041
serializable	deserialization
in a couple of cases where an improperly serializable object wasn t really exceptional and to prevent exception overhead in c# for very common failures i would use boolean return values to signify whether a deserialization operation was successfull

3963047
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
hint look into nsurlconnection and nsoperation

3963087
int	double
in my application i have numerical double or int viewmodel properties that are bound to textboxes

3963112
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in proper browsers like google-chrome and firefox

3963114
spaces	delimiter
when we write code in c# and other languages we don t write code putting all custom properties in one property as a spaces delimiter string and end up having to parse that string every time we need to access or write to it

3963164
actionscript	mxml
remember that mxml is parsed to actionscript by mxmlc

3963176
width	height
this way you can have the inside div wrapping the elements it contains while not specifying any height value while the outer div invisible just with width keeps it centered

3963178
switching	screens
what i m trying to do is when tapped on certain place popviewcontrolleranimated no the actual view controller leaving the leaves view behind on top and trying to do the page turn without having to tap again on the screens and keeping things as if no switching ever happened

3963193
udp	mtu
to your example - the large messages are larger then normal ethernet mtu of 1500 minus eight bytes of udp header unless you are using jumbo frames and thus will be fragmented by the sender

3963212
ant	maven
it is simple to achieve with ant or maven build

3963215
children	parent
and even better even if you injected the parent root-flagged process the children wouldn t inherit that new environment until they naturally are shut down and the root parent forks a fresh child

3963218
inherited	properties
and if you have specific properties that you want to set before the usercontrol gets rendered then make them inherited a custom usercontrol class

3963226
implements	extends
these implements the list and set interfaces respectively but do not extends arraylist or hashset or any typical concrete collection

3963227
hide	show
you would just modify the column1 name to be whatever column you want to show hide and link the event to the proper checkbox es

3963230
int	double
if the condition is true input.equals q then it just does not nothing because instead of the int double it will use a string q to calculate the distance

3963236
width	height
- basically this returns height and width in one

3963236
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the javascript engine in ie 8 is not as fast a firefox 3.6+ safari or google-chrome

3963236
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
opera has made improvements to their scripting engine but still not as fast as firefox safari or google-chrome

3963260
inherited	properties
what this means is that if someone inherited from your class and overrides a method or properties that is accessed in your constructor - then the overriding implementation will be hit before the constructor for the inherited class has run

3963276
vsto	add-in
i m trying to create a word 2010 2007 vsto add-in and have run into a couple of questions

3963343
innodb	myisam	readonly	temporary
some engines can work with a readonly data directory myisam archive others may require a read write data directory innodb but that could be a temporary area or ramdisc

3963350
chown	chmod
i ve also chmod d and chown d the entire directory but no luck

3963376

3963439
maven	m2e
i recently installed eclipse 3.6.1 and the m2e plugin to use with my existing maven build but im running into a lot of problems trying to get it working

3963439
maven	m2e
but for some reason eclipse or m2e is unable to tell maven the right settings

3963467
int	double

3963491
folder	directory
when i run the service i get a directory listing in ie of the folder that the service is in

3963498
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i have an nhibernate object that is a superclass let s call it super and a subclassing that inherited from it let s say it s called sub

3963498
profiling	debugging
after using the nhibernate profiling and debugging my code it looks like nhibernate is trying to instantiate an object whose type is the subclass

3963556
sequence	permutation
i am interested in some clojure code which will allow me to specify the transformations of x permutation rotations under which the value of a function f x is invariant so that i can efficiently generate a sequence of x s that satisfy r f x

3963578
pop-up	dialog
i ve created an htmlhelper that helps me show a jquery modal dialog i set a message in controller s tempdata and if the message is not null the helper writes an jquery + html code to make pop-up apears after postback

3963619
children	parent
however i think you can fake it if you have an object that is parent to all of the laser beams and java3d will let anchor a texture to the parent and let the children inherit it

3963638
sorting	filtering
jide software provides jide grids set of extensions for jtable like a tree-table cell-spanning sorting and filtering

3963653
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work fine in ie 7 ie 8 firefox and google-chrome

3963667
queue	fifo
i m using the following approach to handle a fifo queue based on google app engine db.model see this question

3963667
queue	fifo
right now my code has a method that access this fifo queue invoked by a deferred queue

3963735
margin	height
i can handle this using outside position property modifying the margin or padding of an li element if the text height is smaller than the image height

3963742
mp3	ogg
hey i was looking for a good mp3 or ogg decoder that use the bsd license or public domain and that is also light-weight something that comes with sources without the need of platform specific configuration

3963754
getter	setter
i would say add the generate getter and setter plugin except i just did and it doesn t work for me

3963764
versioning	upgrade
apparently i should upgrade my clients to a newer versioning of access

3963774
post	get
if you can t get the above working can you post an example of what you re trying

3963783
opera	firefox
also is it currently supported on any of the alternative browsers for android like firefox or opera mini

3963788
pop-up	dialog
if the component that s opening a dialog isn t a user facing component and you re trying to strangle the pop-up in the ui then you need a bit of rework to ensure that the component notifies the ui of it s need for a file name and the ui can choose how to get it

3963803
mouseover	mouseenter
if you have an element that has an animation to move it around the mouseover and mouseenter events aren t fired unless the mouse is moved by the user

3963824
post	get
ios wp7 wm6x android etc all support soap json etc because they allow you to execute standard http post and get requests which are required by most web services

3963832
width	height
now on another note you should not use px if you must use a numeric value for height or width use dip or dp it will adapt to diferent screens px will not

3963865
opera	firefox
also is it currently supported on any of the alternative browsers for android like firefox or opera mini

3963874
getter	setter
when dealing with buisness classes like the typical customer and employee classes is it better to use getter and setter only or to use properties

3963874
getter	setter
is the code more readable with getter and setter that emphasize the fact we are reading writing a property or with properties that at first sight can be confused with parameterless methods

3963877
hash	md5
speaking of hash what about md5 vs hmac-sha1

3963877
hash	salt
i had been previously considering adding a per user row salt to my users password hash

3963877
hash	salt
if i were to do that how could the application be able to create a matching hash without knowing the salt used

3963901
inherited	subclassing

try using adptevents as protected or public on a global scope

3963931
versioning	upgrade
development maintenance cost of hiring developers maintaining the system ability to upgrade to new versioning of the system while keeping my customized code separate

3963960
wordpress	joomla
wordpress or joomla

3963967
getter	setter
practically both approaches will eventually do the same thing with the only difference that properties look much neater than getter setter

3963973
getter	setter
getter and setter are only there in java because it doesn t have properties

3963973
getter	setter
and then if you need a getter or a setter you can build it into the property but you don t have to litter the accessing code with a bunch of function calls

3963986
box-sizing	border-box
i reset the box-sizing style of div s to border-box

3963987
ssl	https
i am simply trying to ignore an unsigned ssl certificate and am i am directly following examples i found online of how to override two delegate methods of nsurlconnection as follows to allow my app to use an https connection to a server which has a self-signed certificate

3963990
wordpress	joomla
wordpress is also good but i have seen some people have a harder learning curve with it than with joomla

3964007
getter	setter
for pascal like programmers it s very clear if you re reading or writing a value so i think the code is more readable if you do not use getter and setter in the java-like way where you write getxxx or setxxx in every sentence of your program

3964007
getter	setter
for me and i assume for the majority of pascal programmers the code is more readable if you just put the name of the property you re reading writing and we all know a getter or setter method will be called if necessary

3964030
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
as i answered in your previous question encode your output with htmlspecialchars and then use nl2br to convert new lines to tags

3964085
jquery	scriptaculous
jquery is my favorite but i write a lot with dojo and have used prototype scriptaculous and yui happily.

3964113
kde	gnome
i am not on my linux box right now but i recall this being in a relatively obvious place under the preferences menu option for gnome s terminal and i would imagine kde is similar

3964147
serializable	deserialization
i m interested in finding a code generation tool that given a set of xsd files will generate a set of clos classes from xsd generate deserialization routines from xml to clos and generate the corresponding serializable routines

3964150
subtraction	addition
no addition or subtraction is involved so you needn t worry about leaving the representable range

3964156
scrollable	panels
i think the scrollable panels will help you out

3964174
min	max
this will return true if num is between min and max but is not equal to either of them

3964174
range	min	range	max	min	max
if you need it to include min and max in the range check use

3964225
winpcap	pcap.net
it s pcap.net - .net wrapper for winpcap

3964255
folder	directory
a user clicking into folder foo has to wait for all the items in that directory to be loaded before the page will finish rendering

3964343

this considers every 4 bytes big-endian as an unsigned integer which is represented as a 5-digit number in base 85 with each base-85 digit encoded as ascii code 33+n

3964368
pull	push
in clearcase i can rebase or deliver a specific baseline of code is there a way where i can use git tags similarly to pull push code upto a specified tag

3964434
inherited	properties
becuase i can inherited the properties by using parent object id without marked parent object as abstract true

3964443
for-loop	loops
a for-loop can be done with two recursive rules one is the base case and it doesn t depends upon itself to keepon while the other does what you intend to do inside loops and follows itself

3964451
cldc	midp
another one the one this question is mostly about tries to use fileinputstream and datainputstream so that the very same data could be at least theoretically be read on midp 2.0 cldc 1.1 java configuration which doesn t have randomaccessfile

3964459
translation	localization
we recently got a localization file the contains portuguese translation of all the string in our java app

the man page on ubuntu 10.04 had a great example of how to use getifaddrs and using it as a reference helped me figure out code that worked on both mac and linux

3964545
int	boolean
it appears to me that spring mvc cannot bind properties of primitive wrapper types int boolean etc

3964545
getter	setter
as soon as i changed the type of the assigned property getter setter and instance variable from boolean to boolean it worked fine

3964561
folder	dir
if you type dir you should see a list of files located within the folder one of which is hierarchyviewer.exe

3964603
getter	setter
you may need to fiddle around with your apis to subvert spring s helpful insistence that the getter and setter types parameter result types match

3964631
inherited	properties
can inherited the properties by using

3964737
decimal	ieee
according to ieee 754 the precision of double is 15.95 decimal digits

3964758
mouse	keyboard
if i plan to implement 100 objects on stage to be listen to mouse and keyboard input is using function call responsive enough

3964783
java.util.date	simpledateformat
in the above codes the logparser used to parse the tomcat log of combined pattern when get the date format data i use the simpledateformat to parse it to a java.util.date object then it may throw a parseexception.the logs array here is just used for throwing the exception

3964783
try-catch	exception-handling
but the java.text.parseexception extends the exception-handling why it can not be subject to my try-catch block

3964810
post	get
my problem however is that i can t think of the best way to map each action to its appropriate http method get post etc...

3964835
post	get
though the headers seem to me to be fine there is no response body to either a get post or anything else i can throw at this via jquery

3964888
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
is there a way in any of the three major windows browsers firefox 3.6 google-chrome internet explorer 8 and soon 9 and ideally for safari on mac to record my interactions with the website

3964888
keydown	mousedown
i m guessing i could have a global mousedown keydown handler but i want it to work on any website

3964900
hide	show
is there any way maybe using jquery to only show the first line of the paragraph and hide the others

3964933
equals	tostring	equals	gethashcode	tostring	referenceequals	tostring	gethashcode	referenceequals	gethashcode
in the datatypes object which all other objects in the class library have been inherited from i have suppressed the equals referenceequals gethashcode tostring and gettype functions so these functions are not browsable in the visual studio editor

3964935
width	height
setting height and width is wrong.

3964951
serializable	deserialization
i watched a spring 3 presentation recently that said that beans such as userdao shown below are loaded by a proxy which doesn t serializable the bean but stores only the name and re-obtains the reference on deserialization

3965028
nunit	moq
i use nunit moq for the unit tests themselves

3965064
ati	nvidia
use the arb extension version of vbos instead of the gl 1.5 standard because the intel drivers only implement the extension despite claiming to support 1.5 and the nvidia and ati drivers don t care

3965112
hide	show
im not sure what the toggle key word does but i assume its shortand for alternating hide show keyword

3965118
rss	feed

google-chrome	firefox
this problem only comes up with ie and works fine with google-chrome and firefox

3965138
facebook	fbconnect
i m using fbconnect in my app to connect to facebook

3965179
google-chrome	firefox
i have a quick implementation of the feature you are talking about working in firefox and google-chrome

cvsnt	svn
is there any reliable way to convert cvsnt to svn

3965308
typedef	struct
if you really can t stand typing the struct keyword typedef struct foo foo

3965326
equals	gethashcode
these operators compare source elements by calling the gethashcode and equals methods on each collection of elements

3965356
typedef	struct
i m more surprised that no one s suggested combined typedef struct constructions

3965452
firefox	safari
since firefox and safari support it should work

3965489
vmware	virtualbox
i ve used virtualbox with some success but i have no experience with vmware

nsstring	nsdata
to attach the file to mail i simply create a nsdata instance from a nsstring instance as followed

3965605
debian	linux
maintenance costs for the underlying technology platform there are many options on java such as oracle solaris on oracle hardware vs redhat linux on dell hardware vs debian linux on amazon s cloud service

3965607
mouseover	mouseenter
change mouseover to mouseenter

3965616
submit	submission
you can get the value of the submission when you submit a form on a website by writing a script to be called when the form is submitted

i am referencing and using the upnp.dll file as found in yoru system32 directory - when i reference and use this in vs2010 say vb.net it all works and no issues are found but in vb6 i get the error above any ideas anyone

3965718
free	malloc
as an aside you should first call free on that memory before losing the pointer otherwise you l have a memory leak and this is assuming you have a good reason to use c-style malloc free instead of the more kosher c++ new delete

3965720
allocator	stl
you can even use the stl to handle your memory allocator for you

3965796
button	checkbox
checkbox being children of button you can just give your checkbox a background image with several states as described here under button style

3965824
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

3965843
udp	tcp
if you know the real length of your audio samples and you re sure you don t lose any of them for example you use tcp not udp then just assigning sequential 120 ms time intervals is a good solution

3965879
min	max
xlim ylim or zlim to retrieve min and max value or

3965886
padding	overlapping
you can adjust the button s padding to add space around the text and you may want to place your buttons in a tablelayoutpanel or something to stop them from overlapping when they resize

3965895
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
i want to draw a triangular object in qgraphicsview by using qgraphicsitem

3965896

so if you quickly need to put something together and get it done and working then you should stick to 2.3.8 whatever you are comfortable with

3965931
hide	show
what i understood is that you want to be able to show and may be also hide the sidebar with the tab button

3965932
getter	setter
getter setter etc should all be synchronized

maven	pom.xml
what i am currently doing is to create folders write a .classpath file hardcoded injecting maven nature to .project file and now trying to generate the pom.xml

3965944
maven	pom.xml
seeing a pom.xml i thought writing one plugin for th ecurrent version of maven won t do a good job

3965984
post	get
if you post your code or at least the name of the function that you re having problems with it s possible that you could get a better answer

3966007
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
subclass the qgraphicsitem and in the paint method of subclass class draw triangle later set the item to qgraphicsscene then add the scene to qgraphicsview

3966012
move	drag
i was looking at jquery s website and the ones i found are drag related meaning you have to click on the div and move it yourself

3966018
superclass	subclassing
if you are only ever likely to catch or discriminate in some other way the more general superclass exceptions then having lots of more specific subclassing exceptions doesn t achieve much

3966052
google-chrome	firefox
i can confirm this doesn t work in firefox 4 and google-chrome

3966052
width	height
so my suggestion is to use a defined height for the links you can omit the width

3966065
mdpi	hdpi
but when i created the project adt created 3 different drawable folders for mdpi hdpi and ldpi

3966115

i have looked around and there is no reference to such a mechanism but i thought i d ask just in case someone knew a handy trick by the way i m working in vhdl but i should be able to translate any verilog

3966577
inherited	properties
since you don t know exactly which properties will exist for a given derived class until the pertinent inherited takes effect but since you may also wish to have consistent methods that consume the above enums in your base or interface it s a perfectly-valid design to expect to be able to define that the enum will exist in the base interface but define exactly what members it has in a specific context in any derived classes

unsigned	short
testmethod cannot convert parameter 1 from char 5 to unsigned short

3967422

3967755
int	chars
no reason to include a decimal and parse it to an int if you are only taking one chars of the string anyway

3967776
int	chars
your code takes the last chars of a string that i presume is always a number and cast it to an int

3967787

if all you want to do is draw shapes then you d be better off using either canvas svg or vml depending on exactly what you want to do and the browser support you need

3968177
svg	vml
svg and vml are vector graphic languages

3968177
svg	vml
they perform roughly the same task but vml is specific to internet explorer while most other browsers support svg

3968177
svg	vml
again you can work with these using javascript and the best way to do it in a cross-browser way is to use the raphael libraray which gives you an api to create your graphics and then translates it to vml or svg behind the scenes according to the browser

superclass	subclassing
for what it s worth you don t actually need to cast a subclassing to a superclass reference second solution listed only the other way around

3968936
superclass	subclassing
when casting a superclass to a subclassing it s generally preferred verify its type with instanceof prior to the cast rather than making assumptions

3968943
superclass	subclassing
there is absolutely no need to upcast the returned value to superclass - a superclass reference can always point to a subclassing object

3968944
superclass	subclassing
anything you could do with the superclass reference you can do with the subclassing reference in almost all cases a parameter to an overloaded method is the only exception i know of

rss	feed
here is a link with a sample for creating an rss feed with argotic

3970346
rss	feed
here s a good example of how to create a basic rss feed

3970367
portrait	landscape
use two diferent layouts one for portrait and one for landscape

3970371
uiview	subviews
sure use a custom uiview or uiviewcontroller class and subviews all your views or view controllers from that

3970434
google-chrome	firefox
when i run the copied block from the console in google-chrome or firefox after the page loads it works fine

3970457
squash	branch
release is the branch into which i squash commits ready for publishing

3970457
squash	branch
i rebase these commits into the release branch squash them into logical feature-oriented commits -- often a single commit

3970457
pull	push
i never ever merge or rebase this branch into any other never push it or pull into it never merge anything in here

3970457
fast-forward	merge
note that when i merge the remote master into my master the merge should be a fast-forward

3970495
post	get
in a certain very simple request i get different behaviour for get and post which should not be the case

3970495
post	get
in essence nginx somewhere loses the response if i use post not so if i use get

3970555
post	get
as far as i know what get can do the same can be achieved by post

3970574
post	get
a post request isn t really bookmarkable like that which is why get is useful

3970574
post	get
get is for geting post is for posting

3970576
post	get
furthermore semantically post and get serve different purposes

3970576
post	get
these semantics have practical implications but they also have theoretical design implications that speak to the quality of your application s design an application that doesn t handle get differently from post probably has a great deal of security problems and workflow bugs

3970583
inherited	properties
a textblock does not actually inherited from control so it does not have properties that you would generally associate with a control

3970596
puts	gets
likewise we use http correctly gets posts puts deletes etc rather than dumbly posts only because these verbs offer an additional layer of abstraction and therefore convenience and conforming implementations

3970602
inherited	properties
i was able to correct this by adding an autocompletemode and autocompletesource properties to the inherited combobox but also had to add in a line to set the base dropdownstyle because of the order in which the designer sets the properties

3970610
put	get
the methods get head put and delete share this property

3970624
post	get	post	put	put	get
however if you wish to leverage http for the features and benefits that it provides beyond simple message transport then you should read the rfc and learn the rest of the http protocol including get put post delete and all of the headers cache management and result codes

3970657
pop-up	dialog
on running our application on xp machines with just 4.0 and msvc++ 2010 and 2008 an error dialog will pop-up with the message

3970670
versioning	upgrade
i have just upgrade my asp mvc 3 application from the preview to the beta versioning

3970689
for-loop	arrays
for this to happen i needed to create an arrays which i would fill in the for-loop above

3970745
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
if you ve written a slow linq query that filtering a large list into a small list or that does sorting and grouping it may be wise to call tolist on the result of the query in order to avoid enumerating multiple times which actually executes the query multiple times

3970754
public	protected
once you ve made sufficient progress you ll start to see that some utility methods you ve extracted belong in their own class in which case they d have to be public anyway while others can be made private protected and tested indirectly by testing methods that depend on them

3970787
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the website displays properly when viewed on every desktop browser i ve tried safari google-chrome firefox ie however on the iphone ipad there is a tiny gap space between the content div and header and footer

3970789
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
so in my jpa model object i changed all java.util.date into java.util.calendar

3970827
post	get
after the post to the server successfunc get s called and then afterrestore gets called

3970838
getter	setter
a property is a pair of methods - a getter and setter - that are used behind the scenes when the property is used or written to by other code

3970838
getter	setter
the advantage of a property over explicitly defining getter and setter methods is that you can use the property as if it were a field a simple publicly-visible member variable

3970838
accessor	properties
you can choose to define only one accessor making a read-only or write-only properties or you can define more limited visibility for one function or the other

3970838
getter	setter	public	protected
for instance you can make the getter public but the setter protected so everyone can examine the property s value but only the class s other members and derived types can set its value

3970838
getter	setter
if you didn t define the code bodies of the getter and setter the compiler would generate a basic implementation using a backing field

3970848
width	height
specifically if a canvas has an explicit height and width and is a child of a panel that has a scrollbar the scrollbar can hide a part of the canvas

3970867
short	base
the short answer is yes you can do exactly what you want -- create a base class with fields common to subclasses

3970892
post	get
if you want only specific share buttons or with default style justy type social_name share button and you will get the js to include on your site here are the 3 you mentioned in post

3970952
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the backviewtabbarviewcontroller nib has a uitabbarcontroller with a uinavigationcontroller for each tab

3970954
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
also you do want to think about the table implementation if you do decide to use inherited single table with null cols for the subtype attribs separate table or single table for superclass and separate tables for subclassing

3970965
mouse	keyboard
if full keyboard access can t navigate your app correctly then neither can anybody who can t use the mouse

3970971
multiplying	add
the basic laws of mathematics state that add multiplying ops are interchangeable etc

3971012
google-chrome	safari
while using safari and google-chrome on windows on my local machine on my django runserver some views were randomly not returning a response to ajax post requests

3971029
int	chars
the field is a chars 1 that contains either a y or n i d rather use a bool int 1 but i can t change that unfortunately

3971029
put	get
the query works if i manually put a y or n into the statement but when using bindparam i get the following error

3971029
bindparam	pdostatement
when using pdostatement bindparam an

3971046
allocator	stl
implement a custom stl allocator that does the reservations for memory upfront

3971085
int	chars
i have seen this format with int but how does the above chars bit field work and what does it represent

3971173
vbscript	vba
since vba is pretty similar to vbscript and the code below uses file system and excel object model stuff that should be available to vbscript perhaps it will be useful to you

3971184
int	chars
re your query it s an attempt by the implementer to use less memory for their bitfields chars as opposed to unsigned int

3971212
getter	setter
i am working with several spring mvc web applications and i use the getter setter dependency injection and configure all my beans in my app-servlet.xml file

3971212
getter	setter
and in my class i would have the getter setter for this injected value

3971217
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
so in my jpa model object i changed all java.util.date into java.util.calendar

3971222
caliburn	prism	mef	prism	mef	caliburn
spend some time and understand either prism mef caliburn and use that create your application

3971222
caliburn	prism	mef	prism	mef	caliburn
with prism mef caliburn not only testing is easy and also your development will be truly modular

3971249
bmp	pcx
has anyone dealt with converting a bmp to pcx in the .net compact framework

3971249
bmp	pcx
i need to convert a signature from a bmp to a pcx to be printed on a zebra rw420 bluetooth printer

3971263
int	chars
chars bit fields work in the same way as int just the base type is 8-bit wide not 32-bit

3971311
filtering	grouping
i need to implement a feature that would allow users to filtering table data in excel like style dropdown menu in column headers with list of checkboxes or checkboxes grouping hierarchicaly

3971334
integer	unsigned
a bit-field is interpreted as a signed or unsigned integer type consisting of the specified number of bits

3971370
getter	setter
some getter and setter

3971451
wordpress	joomla
joomla wordpress

3971457
post	get
how can i get mvc to post to an action of a different name of the current view while still having it reload the same page

3971463
folder	directory
i m trying to write a simple backup script in ruby that copies a folder to a specific directory with a timestamp in its name

3971473
passenger	webrick	passenger	thin	thin	webrick
a wide variety of web servers support webrick mongrel thin passenger etc

3971530
squash	merge	squash	branch
i work in a branch develop and when ready to merge with master use interactive rebase to squash all my little commits into one feature-encompassing commit which i gets applied on top of master

3971547
int	double
that loop is prone to problems use just a int value and compute the double value inside the loop

3971557
mouse	keyboard
your big problem arises from the fact that getkeystate is not supposed to return a value for mouse buttons only keyboard buttons

3971580
ienumerable	iqueryable
now consider what implementing ienumerable iqueryable or idisposable tells you about an object and that s without knowing anything about the implementation itself

3971603
range	min	range	max	min	max
i m trying to create a validation rule for a year range min 1970 and max current calendar year

3971609
migrate	upgrade
yesterday i migrate our ssis project from 2005 to 2008 and though the upgrade said it worked i cannot get it to read an excel file

3971623
tabcontrol	tabitem
in those tabs for which the datagrid only displays a few rows the tabcontrol tabitem only stretch to contain the usergrid leaving the statusbar visible at the bottom of the page

3971632
centos	linux
errno 13 might be due to selinux in case you are using a linux server distro for example redhat enterprise linux or centos

3971639
hide	show
then you can hide all the divs in your starting with a specified id and show only the one with clicked element s id + _div ending

3971665
filtering	grouping
or in a grouping sort filtering expression

3971678
viewmodel	caliburn
as i see it the only complication with more pages would be memory consumption since caliburn in its out-of-the-box behavior initializes all pages screens viewmodel and keeps them in memory

3971695
getter	setter
getter and setter methods are used in object-oriented programming to keep variables encapsulated and provide an interface to make those variable accessable by other classes

3971697
getter	setter
using getter setter methods will prevent the direct access to an instance variable

3971707
mouseover	mouseout
however due to what i would consider a bug in how .delegate works off mouseover mouseout which fires when entering a child i d steer clear it it for now and bind directly like this

3971714
getter	setter
the getter setter if done correctly allow you to access this data and change values creating data classes like this is useful when creating multiples so in your case if you just declared these variable within the main class it would be very hard and akward to created multiple dies this way though you can create multiple instances of die

3971753
getter	setter
q why use getter and setter

3971753
getter	setter
it might become tedious because most of the time getter and setter will just get set the value without any checks or side effects

3971892
prepare	execute
unfortunately when i execute a mvn release prepare on my laptop to perform a release say 1.5 the two commits that occur changing 1.5-snapshot to 1.5 then 1.5 to 1.6-snapshot are pushed together into my git repo - and hudson obviously builds the most recent one ie 1.6-snapshot - and completely ignores the 1.5 release

3972001
portrait	landscape
without the first line which sets the status bar orientation the alert view appears in portrait even though the rest of the interface is in landscape left

3972023
stdout	stderr
when this program is run the stderr line is displayed before the stdout line

3972023
stdout	stderr
i thought dup2 would make stderr and stdout use the same file descriptor so there should be no problem with buffering

3972027
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller loading in the first tab of a uitabbarcontroller

3972084
next	document.write
document.write happens as soon as the code is encountered so on the next line after document.write the text has already been added into the document

3972120
stdout	stderr
the two streams stdout and stderr may be using the same file descriptor but before a file stream writes any data to its underlying file descriptor the data is stored in the stream s buffer

3972120
stdout	stderr
the buffers in stdout and stderr don t become the same just because the two streams are connected to the same file descriptor

3972132
min	max
if the lowest start number is relatively large compared to the maximum end number you could change the connect by subquery to generate the numbers from min startnumber to max endnumber rather than from 1 to max endnumber which should be more efficient

3972138
stdout	stderr
there is a difference between the s stdout and stderr and the file descriptors 1 and 2

3972138
stdout	fflush
you could call fflush stdout

3972138
stdout	stderr
in your example the stdout buffer was holding the string stdout while the stderr was being written to the screen

3972138
stdout	fflush
then upon exiting the program all of the open are fflush so stdout then got printed

3972171
do-while	break
like for while and do-while have a break statement jquerys .each supports the return false to break the loop

3972186
ssl	https
the biggest problem with modern cryptography is when people want to roll their own use ssl tls or https

3972277
post	get
i m trying to get all images from a wp post to create a slideshow from them

3972277
post	get
to get 1st 2nd images from the post etc

3972291
getter	setter
i d add a double map from field-name to column-number and some clever getter setter that never throw indexoutofboundsexception

3972303
tabcontrol	tabitem
i want the tabcontrol to display the tabitem s from the collection

3972303
tabcontrol	tabitem
i ve tried setting the tabcontrol s displaymemberpath to tabitem but that didn t work

3972365
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
its the mozilla docs but code works in google-chrome safari opera and ie9 too

3972378
width	height
in my case my image was grayed greyed out in firebug due to the image having its height and width to 0 px so effectively it was hidden on the screen

3972423
prepare	execute
i use pdo prepare execute close cursor etc

3972500
post	get
as far as i was concerned i was filtering my requests based on post or get attributes

3972542
post	get
from request you should be able to get post parameters

3972590
post	get
make a url connection to that url and create a get or post request that conforms to their api

3972597
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it definitely works in ie6 google-chrome 8 firefox 4 and opera 11

3972599
int	double
you can have one column which is int and another which is double its much more common for an entire column to have the same data type rather than having the same data type for a whole row

3972615
prepare	pdostatement
as alan says the problem is probably that prepare is returning false rather than a pdostatement

3972672
printwriter	bufferedwriter
i ve tried using a bufferedwriter in front of the printwriter as well as changing the buffer size both for reading the file and for the bufferedwriter in various ways with no improvement

3972683
maven	pom.xml
as of maven 2.2.0 see mng-3401 goals invoked directly from the command line can be configured in the pom.xml separately from other plugin invocations using a special executionid called default-cli

3972693
spyware	antivirus
questions is do software like antivirus firewall anti spyware etc see my program as virus because lsp function

3972741
tweepy	python-twitter
i just switched from python-twitter to tweepy

3972754
accessor	ivar
it has a location ivar + accessor

3972805
maven	m2e
use the eclipse wtp support and either the maven eclipse plugin or m2e to import your project as a dynamic project

3972999
width	margin
increase the width of the container by the width of the sidebar and add a right margin to the content block by the same amount

3973101
flask	web2py
web2py is not as freeform as flask there is a one right way to do things

3973104
put	get
if you put table columns in the select clause and the columns are not part of an index oracle will do the index lookup then get the row from the table which may be totally useless depending on the query

3973187
for-loop	arrays
now if you are concerened with performance i d recomend just using a normal for-loop as there is significant overhead incurred when calling functionas that will add up very quickly with larger arrays

3973204
getter	setter
i know i can generate setter and getter for fields in the eclipse source menu but i m very surprised it doesn t offer to replace the direct field accessors with calls to the newly created methods

3973233
uninstall	upgrade
i don t care about future upgrade uninstall

3973261
rss	feed
in addition to both providing a plethora of ui components - buttons treeviews grids even charts and rss feed viewers out-of-the-box - they also provide module systems to encapsulate and organize code

3973269
put	get
note this will put dtbcsv in the scope of the entire get block instead of just in your if statement

3973325
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
is there a way to remove escape html tags using lxml.html and not beautifulsoup which has some xss issues

3973326
boost	stl
boost uses header-only libraries a lot because like the stl it s mostly built using class and function templates which are almost always header-only

3973329
getter	setter
the encapsulate field dialog-box will create getter setter for you if they don t exist and will change field-access to go through the getter setter

3973329
getter	setter
the dialog automatically detects existing getter setter so for the requirements that you had mentioned that would do the trick

3973331
explode	implode
between the explode and implode lines you should be mysql_real_escape_string -ing each of the values in

3973361
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
but i am running into issues that i think are related to the clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml files

3973373
implements	extends
you would need a more generalized interface without method2 and perhaps an extends interface which contains method to but which is not implements by b

3973392
width	height
say you have a max width x height of 250x200 facebook is optimizing the use of this

3973412
webrat	cucumber
a quick google search also brought up the following article on php testing with cucumber webrat and selenium which looks pretty useful

3973435
inherited	properties
the fix was to ensure the case of the inherited properties was the same as the class it was referencing -- i didn t realize it was case sensitive

3973456
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested in firefox 3.6.10 google-chrome 6.0.472.63 safari 5.0.2

3973466
dictionary	map
map s are dictionary

3973498
dlsym	dlopen
dlopen dlsym dlclose are also close but will not work for -lmylib referenced libraries reference count never gets to 0

3973579
quicksort	mergesort
it would work better with a stable sort like a mergesort instead of .net s built-in quicksort but it provides you with readable multi-field ordering ability similar to sql as close as a method chain can get anyway

3973579
predicate	icomparable
you can extend this to accomodate members that aren t icomparable by defining overloads that take a comparison lambda instead of creating it based on a predicate

3973605
children	parent
you ll want to bg background and disown the process because nix uses a process tree such that if the parent of a process terminates all of its children terminate too unless the parent disown s the child

3973640
hide	show
this basically show if it s hidden and hide if it s not displayed

3973655
onreadystatechange	onload
looks like ie doesn t support onload but does support onreadystatechange

3973670
super	extends
there s plenty of discussion of why this is true on so but see what is pecs producer extends consumer super

3973670
super	extends
3 use wildcards as you are trying but you ll run into the pecs restrictions i linked earlier you can add or remove elements but not both super vs extends

3973685
multiplying	add
this is where i m hitting a brick wall i need to multiplying the leftmost digit in the initial number by its initial base and then add the next digit to the right and then repeat until i hit the rightmost digit

3973685
multiplying	add
i m not sure how i would multiplying the first number and then add the next nor do i understand how to let the program know when to stop performing this operation

3973765
profiling	debugging
i assume to provide a better user experience and better response time in order to debugging your approval you need to log into your market profiling and change the test response option

3973790
multiplying	add
i need to multiplying the leftmost digit in the initial number by its innitial base and then add the next digit to the right and then repeat until i hit the rightmost digit

3973796
komodo	aptana
however i m going to check out aptana and komodo on the pc---they both look like they could be very good

3973801
width	height
all you need to know is the x y position of the object as well as its width and height

3973813
int	boolean
i think it s because there was no actual boolean type in those days or a separate logical not operator so to make the int not operator work with both true and false they used values 0 and -1

3973837
maven	pom.xml
so now im hacking away till something works with no hope of going back to yesterday when everthing worked without issues i created the project with maven used pom.xml files to do everything and eclipse went along

3973863
client-side	server-side
it allows for a more optimized server-side and client-side caching of the resources

3973876
textwrangler	bbedit
assuming bbedit is similar to textwrangler you could use the built in find dialogue

3973876
textwrangler	bbedit
this isn t a regex but since you said you re using bbedit which is made by bare bones and supposedly shares a lot with textwrangler it should work

3973956
degrafa	flex
degrafa supported flex 3 and fxg supported flex 4

3973983
xml-rpc	json-rpc
encode the binary data in base64 then use json-rpc or xml-rpc for transport

3974008
int	chars
your best bet is to represent it as an array of int representing each chars

3974016
put	get
i believe i should just have to put an xml file in the one war that needs to not read the jboss spring jars but i can t quite get it right

3974047
cos	sine
mike s note that there are two possible solutions for cos x made me realise that i would need to resolve the phase ambiguity of the sine wave

3974054
let	curry
there is a pair of functions in the prelude named curry and uncurry that let you convert between functions written in this style and functions that take two arguments directly as a pair

3974062
16-bit	64bit
if i use this version i get every second character of the string into my char aits d for macintosh hd . i am assuming that this is something to do with being on a 64bit platform and jna mapping the value to a 32-bit wchar_t but then chopping off the high 16-bit on each wchar_t on copying them back

3974103
required	placeholder
in practice this is going to save a lot of typing and cognitive load as we often only care about a few values in practice and the rest can be mere placeholder to get the database to shut up about missing required fields and so on

3974113
apache	nginx
a good approach here is to use streaming by a front-end web server through x send file addons see nginx xsendfile or apache mod_xsendfile and in rails you ll have an action such as

3974113
apache	nginx
and that sets an http header x-accel-redirect which gets sent to apache nginx from your app server which once you ve got the module s linkd to above installed whill tell the webserver to stream the file directly to the client but the url for them stays the same as a normal request to your app users id avatar or whatever because there s no redirect

3974136
button	checkbox
for select boxes checkbox and radio button the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus

3974154
goto	break
it s not a huge deal but statements like continue break and return are all essentially goto statements that have been dressed up a little

3974168
int	chars
i m sure he is referring to operator overloading for types such as chars int float etc in iostream and the types themselves

3974168
int	double
i think what actually occurs is int gets cast as a double then the double + operator is used and a double is returned

3974244
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover is the more efficient way of doing mouseenter mouseleave

3974262
stdout	stderr
with its own stdout and stderr

3974268
octal	decimal
the value in decimal is 1 583 054 206 in octal it s 013626676576

3974289
post	get
you didn t post the actual error message you get so i have to resort to reading your mind but you are also missing an import for multivaluedmap

3974313
client-side	server-side
you will have to do it twice once using javascript at the client-side and then using php at the server-side

3974340
mouseover	mousedown
also if you are looking for different images on mouseover and mousedown then using custombutton is a better option

3974347
nsurl	nsstring
where somedictionary contained a variety of objects like a nsstring photo and nsurl

3974392
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql you d use pg_dump but i don t know how in mysql

3974416
next	except
that solved it except now if there is blank tab next to each other a newline gets printed for both

3974424
printf	strlen
it probably made this mention explicitly because php is written in c and provides a lot of identically named wrappers for c functions strlen printf etc

3974469
vb.net	vb6
my company recently approved project to be written in c# so we have a lot of vb.net programmers however we have some legacy app developers as well that are in vb6

3974475
tunnel	vpn
i d guess that either your isp or vpn provider is limiting you because of high-volume suspicious traffic or your router or vpn tunnel is getting clogged up with half-open connections

3974488

3979546
getter	setter
this is the equivalent of what in java would be a private member field variable with a public getter and setter method

3979546
getter	setter
remember that declaring a property in flex is like declaring a private class-level variable and public getter and setter

3979546
getter	setter
so you are giving customadvancedpanel a private array called states and public getter and setter to get set that array

3979546

3979961
udp	tcp
why don t you use tcp instead of udp

3979974
put	get
when you put the main thread to sleep no events will get processed so you are truly throttling the multi-threading to one thread

3980014
public	protected
public default constructors in abstract classes are frowned upon by stylecop which is why i made the viewmodelbase one protected

3980046
dictionary	map
i ve been using object as a way to have a generic associative array map dictionary since as3 flex seems to be very limited in this regard

3980049

creates the getter and setter methods for you presumably in an optimized way

3980237

if you want to get really crazy put use autodie

3980242
getter	setter
it simply tells the compiler to write the setter and getter for you using the attributes you ve specified in property

3980252
google-chrome	firefox
crap the previous developer had placed the beginform tags in invalid places start of form tag in the middle of a div end of form tag in an entirely seperate div and whilst vs didn t throw any errors it resulted in an invalid markup which caused firefox and google-chrome to ignore and not return the submit value

3980276
mouse	keyboard
the focus is used in a limited way by the ios and handicapped users who don t use a mouse but use a keyboard to navigate

3980286

i can t repro the behavior you ve described but i get close if i put a breakpoint on the writeline in release mode i doesn t even exist in that case

3980298
put	get
i get what is going on in the larger picture but i m lost on how to put it all together

3980302

3980508

firefox was still being a brat though maybe it doesn t like the chunked encoding all shoutcast servers respond with a http 1.0 version response which hadn t defined transfer-encoding chunked yet

3980508
chunked	transfer-encoding
try sending a transfer-encoding identity response header with the ogg stream to disable chunked and firefox might work

3980554
ready	each
while these are not production ready they do include more fixes and html5 standard implementations with each release

3980580
boost	allocator
you might be able to get a boost by converting to c c++ and rewriting it to suit those platforms less oo stack allocator instead of heap etc but otherwise none of the other languages in general usage are close to java in speed

3980612
inherited	subclassing
in languages that allow subclassing without subtyping like the cz language the rule favor object composition over inherited is not as important as in languages like java or c#

3980616

3980631
switching	screens
two switching between the screens or activities i am using the following code

3980634

you could play around with onkeydown events or onfocus and reset the scrol in javascript but that would be nonsense

3980940
zoo	xts
assuming your data.frame contains only numeric data this is one way to do it using zoo xts

3980947
inherited	subclassing	public	protected
since the current existing version of the code has child subclassing base via protected inherited the public functions in base become protected in child so worker can not access them via child object

3980992
public	protected
obviously flipping the method to public will make mocking available but protected feels like the more appropriate accessibility level

3980995
invokelater	invokeandwait
one way to do this is to alter your code to call via invokelater or invokeandwait

3981006

thinking that the best thing to do in order to update the time in a ui textbox would be to create what i thought would be a simple thread to get the time and post it back to the ui control

3981369
mongodb	bson
mongodb uses bson i believe and i can t remember what the others use

3981402

what i want to do is create a switch statement that accepts either google-chrome safari firefox msie etc that is pulled from a regular expression

3981598
actionscript	haxe
it is reasonable to begin with something familiar like haxe or actionscript since you already know javascript in order to learn about game development techniques and design patterns

3981630
serializable	deserialization
if you use the phoneapplicationservice.state serializable happens when you tombstone and deserialization when the application is re-activated though i m not sure if this is tied to the phoneapplicationservice.activated event or not

3981659
hash	md5
most basic hash it with md5 or sha1

3981659
hash	salt
you can salt the hash with extra data so if they are compromised it s value cannot be found try googling some simple hash words

3981666
g++	gcc
gprof is pretty standard for gnu built gcc g++ programs

3981694
crypt	salt
use crypt with some salt

3981701
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it seems to work fine in google-chrome safari firefox etc

3981714
hash	salt
one thing to make it a little more secure is to add a salt to the hash and run the hash function again

3981714
hash	salt
this makes it more difficult to generate a password hash maliciously since the salt value is handled server-side only

3981748
mouseleave	mouseenter
i would look at hoverintent instead of mouseenter and mouseleave

3981786
apache	nginx
and modified the nginx configuration to direct two sites to the same apache server

3981786
apache	nginx
as i had nginx in front of apache i did not need to change the http.conf configuration

3981804
lisp	scheme
when learning common lisp i used exercises from the structure and interpretation of computer programs which is in scheme

3981804
lisp	scheme
this meant i was exposed to the differences between scheme and common lisp early on

3981827
int	double
why are int s and double s immutable

3981843
inherited	properties
the row properties is inherited from tcustomgrid via tdrawgrid and tcustomdrawgrid where it is defined as

3981905
cpu	processors
it seems apparent that each core of the gpu could allow for handling of a request rather than one main processors the system s cpu handling all requests

3981920
lisp	scheme
this may be useful a comparison of common lisp scheme clojure and emacs lisp

3981965
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as jaroslav moravec said if you set the content-type in the header of the stream to application x-javascript it works in safari google-chrome and firefox

3981972
gentoo	linux
i used to run my gentoo linux with a per-process file limit of 250 with exceptions for programs that needed a lot more

3981985
awt	swing
if you are doing a desktop project with awt swing - you can java.awt.dimension although it is not an interface

3981990
setinterval	settimeout
i ve read that to get around this you can use either the settimeout or setinterval commands to essentially reset the counter that ie uses to determine if a script is long-running

3982131
post	get
this works for get post ajax any type of request

3982134
datamapper	activerecord
after all the hussle about rails 3 can i after all painlessly use datamapper without almost changing my activerecord code so that i could run my rails at gae without any bother

3982136
versioning	upgrade
or make sure the versioning of tomcat you are using with eclipse matches the server you are going to deploy on although it s probably easier to upgrade the tomcat versioning on the server than trying to setup eclipse with an older versioning

3982153
vim	textmate
i m coming from textmate and vim so its a big change any advice

3982193
hex	binary
keep in mind that sha1 will return hex encoding of the binary value

3982214
hide	show
then you can use this to show and hide it

3982325
oursql	mysql-python
mysql-python or oursql and pyodbc both have the same interface db-api 2 only you don t have to deal with odbc s issues if you use the former

3982325
oursql	mysql-python
i strongly recommend you consider using mysql-python or oursql instead

3982356
width	margin
i ve left floated the label and given it a width added the text box a line break a margin on the select box but how do i create the next column with the buttons and the final column with the final select

3982363
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as far as i know this is not expected behavior all other browsers google-chrome firefox safari tested work ok

3982471
postgresql	mysql
however given how drupal 6 handles its database abstraction this will require that the secondary database be the same type as the main drupal database eg either both are mysql or both are postgresql

3982493
pull	push
to resolve this i used locationmatch for both the pull and push

3982493
pull	push
this means you have to authenticate to pull and push

3982501
mouse	keyboard
the reason i ask is because i want to have system supplied events mouse keyboard etc. which apparantly are delivered on the main thread to be handled in a very specific part in the run loop of my secondary thread

3982530
wav	ogg
how can i transcode a wav file to ogg vorbis format using python

3982530

i can convert to mp3 using pymedia 1.3.7.3 but when i set the output stream type to ogg i get the error oggvorbis_encode_init init_encoder failed and the script dies

3982537
versioning	upgrade
if you are not ready to upgrade to vs2010 then you ll need the 0.6.0 versioning as documented on the landing page

3982545
spaces	delimiter
paths are delimiter by whitespace so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted

3982580
put	get
at any rate you should put only the access inside your try..except and call it outside since otherwise a keyerror caused within one of the field methods could get misunderstood

3982619
google-chrome	safari
you should see it in google-chrome and safari very soon it s already in the google-chrome dev channel but it s a bit buggy

3982619
opera	firefox
if your script is standalone and your customers use ie or new versions of firefox use this allows rendering to continue in parallel to script downloading for ie and the newest html5 browsers but causes pre-html5 browsers including all versions of opera to block

3982619
webkit	gecko
again this allows rendering to continue in parallel to script downloading in ie and html5-aware gecko webkit but older browsers and opera will suffer

3982619
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
if your audience includes many opera or old firefox safari users the following snippet will execute the script after parsing the document on most pre-html5 browsers ie webkit need to test old firefox while the newest html5-aware browsers start downloading immediately but won t block to execute the script because of the async attribute

3982679
folder	directory
i have created models folder in application directory

3982688
width	height
my widget can change his height or maybe width but it must have adjusted size by both ordinates.

3982787
integer	unsigned
near the start of chapter 5 listing 5.2 a point is made about unsigned integer overflow

3982789
autoresize	scrollbar
i ve set our settings to autoresize and implemented the correct fb js call to do the resizing of the height to avoid unwanted scrollbar but it doesn t seem to be working

3982807
width	height
more text should increase the size of a textview if the width height is set to wrap_content

3982821
hex	binary
i would have expected the hex numbers to match up to offsets in the binary

3982851
hide	show
sort function hide div#2 and show div#3

3982851
hide	show
initially as i was not able to see any divs being show hide i assumed that it was happening too fast for me to notice

3982851
hide	show
once this was done it was quite apparent that show and hide actions were being done at the very end

3982851
hide	show
then and only then was the browser able to hide show divs as i wanted

3982858
post	get
the closest you can get in c is using an inline function for each data type imaginable or a decently complex macro see previous macro issues and previous post

3982894
mouse	keyboard
it recommends using ctr cmd + 1 to use the keyboard this is much better than having to use the mouse but i m still looking for a just do the right thing most of the time automatic solution

3982908
folder	directory
the maximum number of directory entries in a fat32 folder is is 65.534

3982910
mouse	keyboard
you can poll the mouse and keyboard for their state without accessing the event queue

3982910
mouse	keyboard
you could use pygame.time to wait on a timer instead of waiting on the event queue and then pass control to the game objects which poll the mouse and keyboard as per above but you are still looping but bound by a timer instead of the event queue

3982916
folder	dir
now recursively remove the .svn folder from the problem dir and copy it back into the target location

3982957
jobs	cron
how do modern cron daemons internally schedule their jobs

3982981
fadein	fadeout
operation with #logobig fadein and fadeout is executed twice

3983019
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	aiff
most wav files are but not aiff m4a mp3 etc. i d use the extaudiofile api instead of the audiofile api as this will convert any format you re reading into whatever format you want to work with in code

3983048
put	get
am i right to say that the only way i can get to that file is by removing it from my android test project and put it in my actual android project or am i missing something that will let me load the file from my android test project

3983087
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
if you aren t using any of the other features of apache consider using something lighter and faster like lighttpd or nginx

3983088
google-chrome	firefox
i have some javascript code that works in firefox but not in google-chrome or ie

3983100
min	max
to understand whether each selected column is fixed as part of the group by or aggregated sum count min max etc.

3983138
ocp	principles
i have recently been trying to learn about basic design principles and the ocp has me a bit confused

3983138
ocp	principles
perhaps an example of some code that doesn t follow the ocp and how exactly it has violated the principles would be the most helpful for me to understand this

3983181
wordpress	vbulletin
im making my little site where users can create blogs and have studied publishing tools like wordpress and vbulletin

3983192
hide	show
for example if i have 50 child div s inside divwiz i want to show 25 and hide the rest

3983196
getter	setter
i suppose that using getter and setter is a good idea for the sake of consistency you always know that you can call setfoo to alter the foo attribute without having to look up whether or not you can do it directly

3983196
getter	setter
personally i think having to use getter and setter is clumsy-looking

3983209
children	parent
parlanse offers explicit teams set of computational grains as an abstraction with exceptions propagating out of functions to the top of a computational grain java defines this to be undefined which is stupid to the team parent back to all the other team children as an asynchronous abort-exception catchable in a try clause allowing the other children to clean up

3983232
hide	show
all you need to do is have onclick handlers that show hide either firsthalf secondhalf or both

3983238
hide	show
if you need better performance wrap those packs of 25 div s into common parents and show hide those parents should be 25 times faster

3983250
nullreferenceexception	invalidoperationexception
when i run the program and step through the code with the debugger the added code is not there anymore and an invalidoperationexception is not thrown and the code will run until the nullreferenceexception occurs

3983273
post	get
1. when processing forms with php get vs post _request vs _get _post

3983316
getter	setter
so new languages only modify internal variables fields through properties getter and setter methods in c++ or java

3983328
vb.net	vb6
if by vb you mean vb.net and not something like vb6 then the code to work with datatables as opposed to legacy vb recordsets will be the same in c#

3983353
webclient	httpwebrequest
some framework elements have this built in for you such as webclient vs httpwebrequest to save you the trouble of writing dispatcher code but using this can lead to ui performance degradation if you re doing a heavy amount of work because you have more code than you need executing on the ui thread

i just tried adding some print statements to my shouldautorotate method and noticed that it checks it 4 times which does make sense but even though i am not switching mode from portrait to landscape

3988119

it returns portrait 3 times and on the fourth time it returns landscape even though my simulator is not in landscape

3988152
tar	md5sum
something like tar -c dir | md5sum -b although you may need to play with the options to tar so it doesn t include access times which would mess up the checksum if somebody accesses the files in that directory even without modifying any of them

comparator	comparable
think best of both worlds like comparable it s implicit for the type in question but like comparator it s extensible and can be added retrospectively to types that did not have it

3988467
comparator	comparable
since java lacks type-classes it has to duplicate every such method once for comparable then for comparator

3988489
width	margin
one solution would be to capture the label s right margin in the form constructor and in the label sizechanged event reset the location based on the initial right margin the label s current width and the label parent s current width

3989184
hide	show
you could try having a single-frame image of the first frame of animation and show hide each one on click

3989184
hide	show
if you want it to reset back to the single-frame image when the animation is done you could use settimeout with how long the animation is as the length of time and have it hide the animation and show the static image

3989217
chown	chgrp
i suspected a permissions issue since i noticed some of the things in hudson_home were owned by root so i recursively chown and chgrp d that directory to make hudson own it all

3989268
textview	imageview
i ve realised that this is beacuse i ve tried to add the background in a textview so it adds the image in each cell in the listview so i have tried to add a linearlayout listview and a imageview and put the background there but it force closes

use jquery s addclass and removeclass if you re not happy with the effect of show and hide and attach a class to change the visibility for example

3989434

jquery uses display none to hide .i use this and show quite frequently but i haven t had any problem yet probably because display block hasn t hurt my formatting

it gets the width right but the height is all messed up and it doesn t know to add padding to account for a outerglow effect

3989488
min	max	width	height
i have my min max width and height set up for the application and i figured if there was some function i could call to bring me back a x y max bound then i could just set the window height and width to those values after i subtract the padding

3989711
width	height
it you re using the standard wrap_content and fill_parent for your width and height your layout will automatically adjust when you change orientations

3989711
portrait	landscape
with that said you will often want to change to a different layout when switching from portrait to landscape as a layout that looks good vertically may be unusable when horizontal

3989739
client-side	server-side
asp.net s textbox controls are created server-side and then rendered client-side

3990448
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with firefox and google-chrome but ie doesn t do the thing

3990459
width	height
according to the box model in the section on replaced elements this should work as you expect since the video has a height of auto and a set width and it has an intrinstic ratio as videos do then the used value of height should be computed based on those

3990512
inherited	properties
the enabled properties is found in uibaritem the class from which uibarbuttonitem inherited which is why you won t find it in the uibarbuttonitem docs

3990545

int	chars
all i am trying to do is acces the values in the array arr i have seen how to do it with chars but not with int

3990584
getter	setter
this doesn t seem to be the case in your method nor in the getter and setter of the imageasbytes property

3990641
children	parent
what i want to do is use tablesorter to sort only the parent rows based on their last edit date column right now the children last edit date column is getting sorted too and messing up the ordering

3990665
notepad	scite
from scite you click in the output frame ctrl-a to select all ctrl-c to copy then paste into what every application you like such as notepad

3990674
background-image	background-color
i found that using a background-image for the hovering row is actually faster in ie than using background-color

3990676
getter	setter
thus any reference within that object s method after final release to self an ivar a getter a setter or any other method that requires such recursively could crash or worse randomly corrupt memory being used elsewhere

the validate method 3 children down needing to know if there are other transactions isn t the only case in the system of a child needing to have information about its parent

3990783
children	parent
if the parent objects passed down all this information down to all children whether they needed it to not is a waste - and prone to missing an update somewhere

3990783

how can i avoid children talking to their parent as required while not having parent giving child objects they don t want

versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade our solution and dependent projects to 4.0 i get the sys is not defined error which tells me it is not loading the correct versioning of the above files

3990916
move	drag
when you drag any window around does it render as a dotted outline or is the whole window re-drawn as you move it

3990939
put	get
i know that a good general rule of thumb is to remove the target dom element make the necessary changes and then put it back into the dom so you only get hit twice with the re-render but i wasn t sure if you only replace the inner text of an element if you incur the same hit

3990957
hash	md5
the passwords were hash using md5 into the database so the user table records looks more or less like this

3990957
salt	md5
i have access to the php source code and i can see that there is no salt or anything else it is juts a straight md5 application

3990964
min	max
also if you call it will auto-scale the image to min max

3991032
mp3	flv
we re using this for mp3 files on our site and it s working great but we also have a flv video file on there that we don t want it to handle as we re using the shadowbox.js to play it

versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a higher versioning excel you are using excel 2003 or earlier

3991297
cpu	processors
this is especially true if dealing with multiple processors or even multiple cores as the cpu cache lines need to be invalidated after a thread writes in order for a separate thread to read a value

3991311
put	get
it makes sense because threada put a x lock on that row so that thread b can not get the x lock until thread a release the lock

3991323
mvp	presenter
ps some people claim of having success implementing a mvp model-view- presenter architecture above asp.net webforms

width	height
try setting the width height

3991360
post	get
if so do i still use nsurlprotocol and how do i get the post data

3991366
r-tree	quadtree
a far better way to deal with indexing this space is to use a data structure like a quadtree or an r-tree

3991401
width	height
then the function will loop for every image and checks its width and height

3991401
width	height
if its width or height is larger than your max values then it will be resized by keeping the aspect ratio

3991420
ostream	istream
i have thought of writing some sort of termination sequence to the istream object which in this case is cin by creating an ostream object from istream rdbuf

3991424
gridview	linqdatasource
what i am trying to do unsuccessfully is to implement a gridview search using a linqdatasource wherein the search returns order results where any of the orderproduct.manufacturer columns contain a search query

3991434
width	height
i generally don t use linearlayouts without having either height or width set to 0 and using the weight attribute to make everything the same size

3991468
put	get
so i defined a persistent pojo on the server-side to get it put in the datastore via the persistencemanager as shown in the gwt rpc tuts

post	get	post	put	put	get
browsers support two http verbs get and post but asp.net mvc 2 allows you to simulate put get and delete using html.httpmethodoverride helper method

3991539

you can still use cfparam or structkeyexists to handle any fields that may not exist ie checkbox or radio button

3991572
versioning	upgrade
just increment the versioning 1.1 or 1.01 doesn t matter and release it as an upgrade

3991587
google-chrome	firefox
this actually seems to work in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

3991607
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup can be used similarly if keychar presents implementation issues

3991629
keydown	keyup
keypress is supposedly not very reliable you should try switching to keydown or keyup

3991631
firefox	safari
on mac firefox and safari everytyhing works fine on windows both ie and firefox put flash on top of my div

3992336
for-loop	arrays
i have an extjs grid and one of the column renderer function has a for-loop which goes through an arrays of numbers and compares them with the value for every cell for the column in consideration

3992336
for-loop	loops
so i was thinking since the renderer already loops for each row and now i have for-loop runner for each row

3992336
for-loop	arrays
the question is should just let it run or should i change the arrays and user string.match instead of for-loop

3992347
implements	extends
i have a custom swing component called navigationlink which extends jlabel and implements a key event listener like so

3992350

xslt	xquery
both xslt 1.0 or 2.0 and xquery have these features

3992640

i am using indy v10 components to do the get post operations so i am wondering if there is a way to do this using them and being able to do a callback and not use the pin authentication method

3992707
accessor	properties
i know that automatic properties must define a get and set accessor method i also know that it is possible for either of these accessor to be made invisible by means of an access modifier

3992707
accessor	properties
if the compiler can generate that is there a reason that it can t omit the set accessor function based on the presence or lack thereof of a setter in the properties declaration

3992714
post	get
also i ve been rtfm ing all day and looking at various blogs post stackoverflow questions etc and i still don t get it i obviously need it spelled out step by step for my situation

3992749
accessor	properties
leaving one of the accessor out would mean that the properties would either be read-only or write-only even within the constructor of the class struct

3992797
getter	setter
i have a boolean field called showlabels in a bean class and i want to provide getter and setter methods for it

3993134
put	get
put it all together and we get

3993150
versioning	upgrade
but it should be easy for you to talk most of your potential customers into wanting to buy the plugin from you instead of using a forked versioning - you can offer benefits such as support upgrade etc etc which probably won t be available for a cracked versioning

3993157
int	double
another thing to note your functions are declared to return double but they declare scanf and return int

3993157
int	double
its not a huge problem as the int will get automatically changed into double

the arrays is used in a for-loop as

3993164
width	height
for each sale we need to capture the customer s choice of width height colours and a bunch of other technical stuff

3993444
gridview	repeater
update this has been solved here itemcommand not firing on first click in repeater or gridview

3993502
post	get
i could i suppose parse the raw get string from getquerystring or parse the raw post string from getinputstream but instead i think i will add another hidden parameter and then use getparametervalues string to get its order

3993545
getter	setter
this has been fine but i find myself writing numerous setter and getter that only get used on init

3993685
gif	png
images in jpg gif and png provider image

hide	show
this way i could potentially conditionally show hide elements based on login session etc

3993839
fast-forward	merge
my guess with #2 is that the pull request there actually was a fast-forward and thus no merge commit was necessary whereas #1 and #3 were not fast-forward even if they did merge without conflicts they weren t direct descendants of the your head

3993839
fast-forward	merge
if you want a slightly more length explanation of the differences between fast-forward and merge here s someone else s words

3993938
width	height
set the textfield width height

3993958
hash	md5
the common approach for passwords is to hash them with something like md5 and then store the hash

3993967
hash	md5
md5 is a one-way cryptographic hash though its use is not recommended because it is cryptographically weak

3993967
hash	salt
for your needs you probably want to store the hash of the password better with salt probably using sha-256 or better

3993972
hash	md5
md5 is a hash function which means it is one-way and cannot be decrypted

3993977
filtering	grouping
not directly you can create a second list that maps users to grouping use me filtering on that list and use connection to filtering the sr list using this list you will still need to click on each grouping name to change the filtering to that list

3993991
ubuntu	linux
if you are on linux say ubuntu then it is probably because you did not run

3993992
int	double
you may work with int instead of int double instead of double etc

3993995
int	double
the examples you gave int array double these are all primitives and there are no sub-types of them

3994007
setinterval	settimeout
first of all you should use the settimeout instead of setinterval in my opinion

3994019
hash	md5
best practice is to store the password hash using md5 as you are now or even better sha256

3994058
punctuation	words

3994126
min	max
backgrounddetect filename sil min max analysistime

3994126
min	max
during the playback of the file audio is monitored in the receive direction and if a period of non-silence which is greater than min ms yet less than max ms is followed by silence for at least sil ms which occurs during the first analysistime ms then the audio playback is aborted and processing jumps to the talk extension if available

uitableview	uipickerview
but i would just use nssets nsarrays to populate uitableview and uipickerview

3994197
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
meanwhile i would subclass uiviewcontroller for your view that shows worked objects and job objects - and have that class implement uitableviewdelegate uitableviewdatasource uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource

3994207
gdi	direct2d
microsoft has a page comparing gdi vs direct2d hardware acceleration

3994207
bitblt	gdi
gdi always has been an accelerated api of course it was always left up to the actual gdi driver implementation to decide which bits of the gdi ddi to actually accelerate so its usually been the bitblt stretch blit operations that have been accelerated and all the line drawing and other effects are done by cpu

3994217
rss	feed
i used threads to collect update some rss feed into my database for a website i was hosting with godaddy

while searching i could only find stateful and stateless webservices

3994280
pull	push
this isn t cvs conflict resolution isn t terrible - git will auto-resolve 95 of conflicts for you without you having to do a thing so whether you git pull before or after you make your changes doesn t really matter - you just need to pull before you push and you ll be fine

3994280
pull	push
just tell your developers if your push is rejected as being non-fast-forward do a git pull then try pushing again and everything will work

3994287
stateless	stateful
in general stateless describes any process that does not have a memory of past events and stateful describes any process that does have such a memory and uses it to make decisions.

3994321

3994697
vbscript	vba
that done both dll and exe rtd servers work with excel and vba and vbscript and c# clients

3994702
post	get
another possibility is to use the get verb instead of post which will automatically append it to the query string but in this case you should use a different action name because you cannot have two actions with the same name and same verb

3994719
int	double
casting from double float int to long should preserve the sign if not the actual value.

3994736

wouldn t it be simpler to just multiplying the value by 10 in your code and add the starting value

3995268
sorting	grouping
do i have to use a native query in this case or do the sorting and grouping in my client code probably not such a good idea depending on the amount of data in the db... or is it possible to get this query working

3995323
lapack	gsl
i searched on hackage but i didn t find anything at regard hmatrix which uses gsl blas and lapack is great but doesn t seem to include special algorithms to solve linear systems and eigen-values vectors problems with sparse matrices

3995374
mp4	webm
i want to determine if an uploaded file is in fact a mp4 or flv for flash videos or webm for html5

3995374
mp4	webm	mp4	h.264	h.264	webm
now i also need to check for file types which are completely not videos and filetypes which are videos but could be converted to a mp4 with h.264 or webm

3995374
h.264	webm
the conversion thing can be managed but hints on that would be very cool too converting h.264 and webm

3995375

if i make viewmodel transient then i can easily end up in a situation of having several different instances when i actually expect same instances injected

3995651
hide	show
i want to make a div clickable to show hide children divs

3995674
getter	setter
getter and setter on an object have the advantage of type safety

3995674
getter	setter
so although it might make your code long getter and setter are good

3995674
getter	setter
this is more general - you can insert whatever key you like - and is less code however it doesn t give you the static analysis benefits of getter and setter

3995674
getter	setter
there would also be performance differences between using getter setter and a map however i imagine in 99 of applications they would be irrelevant so it s not worth pointing out here

3995681
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox opera google-chrome but ie reports object doesn t support this property or method when i try launch fadein

width	height
you can set minimumsize to current size and maximumsize to well maximum size with height equal as in minimumsize and width 800 or some other really big number

3996038
post	get
would i have to start looking at ajax or jquery or can it be done using the built in get and post techniques

3996100
getter	setter
for example activerecord uses method_missing to define getter and setter methods that correspond to data base columns

3996104
width	height
to get it work you also have to set the height or width depending on your orientation to 0px

3996155
uialertview	uiapplication
uialertview uses uiapplication s statusbarorientation property to choose alert s orientation

3996155

jquery	anythingslider
it gives me an error jquery #portfolioslide .data anythingslider is null

3996397
serializable	deserialization
having never used the json serializable but having a slight clue about how wcf does its deserialization i would say you can t have stringbuilder as a parameter

3996397
serializable	deserialization
wcf wants to do the serializable and deserialization itself so let it

if you do not want to add multitasking running in backgrounding just add it

3996687
move	drag
is it possible to restrict the drag source to only move within the boundaries of a circular path when dragging it

3996740
hide	show
you can check the .length and use .toggle to show hide based on how many are checked like this should work

3996779

but a property indicates that you are getting or setting properties member variables of an object and that these getter setter are not time consuming function that f.e

3996850
width	height
so now i want to measure the surfaceview canva s width and height so that i can launch the images in proper proportion rather than hard coded values

3996850
width	height
but i am unable to retrieve the height and width so please help me

3997020
udp	tcp
i wrote a program that creates a tcp and udp socket in c and starts both servers up

3997020
udp	tcp
the goal of the application is to monitor requests over the tcp socket as to what udp packets to send it monitor for something like 0x01 0x02 and if i see it then have the udp server parse the payload and forward it over to the tcp server for processing

3997020
udp	tcp
so what is the best way to continuously monitor requests from the tcp server but send it certain payloads from the udp server when requested since the udp server will be busy

3997020
pthreads	fork
i looked into pthreads with semaphores and or mutex not sure all the socket operations are thread safe though and if this is the right way to approach it as well as fork pipe

3997020
udp	tcp
forking the udp server off as a child process seems easy enough but i don t see exactly how i would be passing the kind of data i need among both servers need request data from tcp and payload data from the udp

however today i noticed that facebook no longer have this # if you use a modern browser - like google-chrome or firefox

3997181
google-chrome	firefox
judging from the coverage in google-chrome 8 dev and firefox 4 beta i wonder that could be related to html5-era apis but the code in facebook is not of my capacity to debug to find out what they did

3997197
std	ostream
std ostream is a typedef

3997234
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
â viewwillappear â viewdidappear â viewwilldisappear â viewdiddisappear

you could put the necessary locks on your side but there is pretty much nothing you could do to get the internal plumbing of the control to do the same

3997264
inherited	properties
that view inherited from my buisness object with properties login password email etc

3997280
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
then it loops through arrays parsing its content and pushing values to another arrays and finally printing them to file in another for-loop

mp3	ogg
from mp3 to ogg there are several

3997452
flac	speex
as flac and speex

3997452
mp3	ogg
i imagine it s theoretically possible to embed mp3 in ogg though i m not sure why anyone would want to

3997452
mp3	ogg
all that said if you still want to convert from mp3 to ogg vorbis you could a try the freshmeat link above b look at the other answers or c look at ffmpeg

3997456

i was thinking i could add as many fields with link_to and ajax but i guess it s a lot easier for the user to have the six fields printed out and ready instead of clicking a link each time in order to add a field

3997501
addclass	removeclass
use .add css or addclass and removeclass

3997509

is it possible to get the keyboard to pop-up for the edittext as soon as the dialog loads

3997531
put	get
put each full pathname into a set and use the difference method to get the files and folders that are different

3997585
for-loop	loops
they are usually swallowed by the for-loop but in this case we made the generator raise an exception so loops doesn t notice them

3997620
getter	setter
the field part of a property allows you to access a value just like a field would do though allowing you to trick this getter function and setter procedure if i may say

3997626
button	checkbox
the problem is when someone submits the form and goes to the following page then clicks the back button the checkbox remain checked but the div color reverts

3997671

3997759
minimum	max
button options to pay off max minimum or your own input

3997759
min	max
in general we agree that your max and min amount should be shown on the screen somewhere it s annoying to go look for your bill when the site can show amount owed

3997770
mouseup	mousedown
and if i want to drag in another direction i must do mouseup and mousedown again

3997795
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
my question is whether there is a generic way to get notified when user browses to urls i want to support at least ie and firefox google-chrome and safari is nice to have

3997823
post	get
after you get the token for each service you will just save it in a database or something and reuse it each time you need to make a new post

3997838

i added an empty rule to the field and set not to my senior developer group which does not hide the tab but disables and show no information in the text box

3997841
erlang	ocaml
other languages that implement these paradigms are caml ocaml erlang

3997856
try-catch	exception-handling
since this is supposed to happen in the main ui thread i expect the exception-handling to be propagated up to application.run ... which i surrounded with a try-catch block

3997860
implements	extends
why i can t extends more than one class but can implements more than one interface

3997875
alloca	malloc
if you want stack allocation you can use alloca to allocate on the stack instead of malloc all usual warnings apply

3997875
allocator	stl
if you want to a friendlier interface you can implement a custom stl allocator based on alloca and use a std vector with this you should read up before implementing

3997892

i d give them all options though including max min and custom

3997928
post	get
but i can get round this by editing the post twice once to create the new category which automagically associates it with the post and then a second time to select some additional existing categories from the menu - like i said this is not a big deal because it all works really well otherwise and my users can adapt to these limits

3997953
kerberos	ldap
as for security we use spring security with a few default authentication mechanisms including a straight forms auth provider ldap and kerberos

3998006
children	parent
if they do you need to compare the parent and the z-index of the children is irrelevant

3998006
children	parent
so the z-index decides how the element is placed compared to other children of its stacking parent the closest ancestor with a z-index set and a position of relative absolute or fixed but it doesn t matter when comparing to other elements

3998019
width	height
borrows from the answer to this question get the real width and height of an image with javascript

i am running a dynamic soql query in my apex test code and the limit clause is not working

3998119
post	get
first thing is you have to do a get not a post

3998126
folder	directory
i think it makes sense to have a src folder for your source and a tests folder for your tests and the the directory structure under test should match the directory structure under source

3998129
bitarray	bitset
apart from this bitset wraps your bitarray in a nice object representation with many useful operations

3998148
onclick	onchange
if i click yes i can retrieve an onchange or onclick event state and make something happen

3998148
hide	show
what i need to be able to do is show hide an element on the page depending on what choice they ve made in this radio set

3998161
getter	setter
i d like to add as a con for using properties that serialization understands the concept of properties and uses them while it does not know anything about getter setter methods

3998207
vb.net	vb6
this can be done in c++ c# or vb.net or vb6 and lots of 3rd party options

3998214
packets	multicast
i have a service on android that listens and responds to packets it receives via multicast

3998223
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason it renders fine in firefox however in google-chrome it adds an extra pixel of padding on the bottom which covers up bottom border see image below

3998274
pull	push
i haven t tested this but i think i d do force your commits to be published to github thus re-writing the history again have your friend pull your changes rebase his changes then push his changes up

3998278
put	get
extract open the file get the rows of data and put them in a queue to be handled by the transform layer

3998285

3998287
vsto	add-in
i just had the same problem when trying to add a vsto add-in project reference to a wix setup project

not sure what is different about the vsto add-in projects that prevents them from being shown in the add references dialog

3998292
try-catch	exception-handling
generally crashes in .net applications are caused by an unhandled exception-handling - an exception-handling in a thread in that application that was not caught in a try-catch block of some sort

3998311
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie google-chrome firefox and even safari you can try that

3998339
profiling	instrumentation
the best way for a developer is instrumentation s time profiling instrumentation

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
that is because the file i configure flat file connection with at design time has linefeed as a row delimiter

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
had i point to a file that have cr linefeed row delimiter then columndelimiter of the last column would be x000d _x000a_ and these are not overriten with values from config file

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
in my case if i desinged package with file that have cr linefeed as a row delimiter than at run time file that have linefeed delimiter is not being loaded into a table at all obviosly because it is unable to find cr linefeed which indicates the end of the row

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
however if i design package poining to the file fith linefeed delimiter then at run time file with cr linefeed delimiter gets processed but cr is appended to the last field of the file

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
solution i end up poining at design time to the file with linefeed delimiter and adding derived column transfomation task after flat file source with expression to remove cr in case when file at run time has cr linefeed delimiter

3998439
children	parent
right now it is possible in our add children form just using vanilla nested attributes to add the same user as a child multiple times for parent

3998439
children	parent
i am sure i could also enforce uniqueness constraints in the userscontroller update method but would prefer to avoid changing that code right now it doesn t reference parent children at all thanks to nested attributes in the form model if possible

3998443
pthreads	epoll
note you can use pthreads aio with epoll there s signalfd 2 it creates a file descriptor that you can then use to be notified of signals in an epoll based loop

3998450
filtering	grouping
filtering data to grouping from the xml by x node where x node is equals a y z

3998487
stdout	stderr
soon after your program starts use the dup 2 call to make duplicate file descriptors for fd 1 stdout and 2 stderr

3998487
stdout	stderr
now whenever your program printf 2 to stdout or nslogs to stderr the data will be written to your slave fds

3998487
stdout	stderr
do the dup 2 in the correct order so stdout uses fd 1 and stderr uses fd 2

3998487
stdout	stderr
now anything written to stdout and stderr will go to the original fds

3998490
junit	testng
it serves the same purpose as junit or testng does in the java world and is one of many in the xunit family

client-side	server-side
there is no need to use the server-side geocoding services as this can be done entirely on the client-side in javascript

3998732
addition	multiplication
this is best illustrated with an example which is probably somewhat silly in mathematics we can say that a semiring is a set that is a commutative monoid under one operation which we ll call addition identity 0 and a monoid under another which we ll call multiplication along with the requirements that multiplication distributes over addition and that 0 annihilates all elements under multiplication

3998733
width	height
does anyone know an existing way to find out the png s true height width is an extra

3998746
windows	wow64
please note that if you run 64 bit windows there s a shadow entry as well in the wow64 section

3998755
getter	setter
if you properly encapsulate your data using getter and setter methods you could put such code in these methods or override these methods in a subclass

3998755
getter	setter
to solve this problem i would write my own class loader perhaps using the asm framework and replace each get-field set-field instructions with proper calls to getter setter methods

3998755
getter	setter
how do i generate setter and getter for my class

3998770
foldable	traversable

cvs	svn
if you re working on a decade old project recently migrated to git with jar files checked into the scm previously checked into cvs svn where log4j-1.0.jar is in branch-2-0 and the mainline has log4j-9.0.jar proceed with caution if you want to checkout version 2.0 of your project

4000115
cvs	svn
you cannot have the same working tree in both git and cvs svn though the ui may seem to imply so

4000122

hash	salt
when salting a password hash should the salt also be hash or left as plaintext

4000471
hash	salt
the salt should not be hash as you need the original value to combine with the password before hashing it

4000474
hash	salt
if you hash the salt all you are effectively doing is changing the salt

4000816
filesystems	ntfs
if your server is using ntfs for its volume filesystems you aren t limited to any number of files per directory per se but more in that you are limited to some number of files directories per volume

4000816
filesystems	ntfs
technically speaking the ntfs filesystems uses a global mft that keeps track of all the files directories are files and are mostly used for logical representation to the end user so every time you modify the volume that change is reflected in the mft

for a standard way of specifying bit patterns like that use octal number begins with a zero or hex number begins with a zero and x formats

4000825
integer	unsigned
second almost all computers have the same binary representation for a positive integer and its unsigned equivalent so there will be no difference

4000891
voip	sip
sip vs h.323 voip story comes into my mind

4000891
voip	sip
sip is very simplified easy to build while h.323 like a typical telecom standard tried to envisage every issue on the planet about voip and provide a solution for it

4000946
width	height
... in the same way as the img element â if you only set one of width and height the other dimension is automatically adjusted appropriately so that the video retains its aspect ratio

4000946
width	height
however â unlike the img element â if you set width and height to something that doesn t match the aspect ratio of the video the video is not stretched to fill the box

4000975
awt	swing
it s an object you can use to draw graphics primitives on a swing awt program

4000976
width	height
however since a view s bounds property is defined in terms of its own coordinates that height and width should reflect the current orientation of the view

4001001
awt	swing
in most awt and swing components you can override the paint graphics g method to implement your own drawing method

4001010
hash	salt
you must not hash the salt since hash are one way

4001010
hash	salt
if all salt are the same it s obvious to the cracker who can see your hash values which accounts have the same password

4001010
hash	salt
you should assume that the cracker will gain both the salt and the hash value so the hash algorithm must be secure

4001010
hash	salt
having any salt at all prevents using existing precomputed rainbow tables to crack your hash value and having a unique salt for each account removes the desire for your cracker to precompute their own rainbow tables using your salt

4001011
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried setting the border bottom of the tr but this seems to do nothing in google-chrome and firefox at least

4001014
int	chars
int is an alias for int32 byte is an alias for byte chars is an alias for chars and so on and so forth

4001066
hash	salt
no you must not hash the salt

4001066
hash	salt
the salt is in clear text and it is needed to you to recompute the password and check it with the one stored in the hash password file

4001066
hash	salt
in this manne a dictionary attack is not possible because for every word into the dictionary and for every salt into the password file the attacker needs to compute the hash

4001068
put	get
the way to do it would be to put together any sort of app with the namespace com.thecompany.theapp and get it uploaded

4001139
try-catch	exception-handling
you should handle this exception-handling using try-catch and attempt to connect n number of times again in the catch block

4001140
hash	salt
as the salt needs to be saved along with the hash or at least must be retrievable along with the hash an attacker could possibly get both the salt and the hash password

4001140
hash	salt
my reasoning was that storing the salt unencrypted along with the hash password would make it easier to crack the passwords as a hacker that would be able to retrieve the password table and would know or make an assumption about the hash algorithm would be able to find matches between hash of well known words dictionary attack by hashing each word in the dictionary and then salting with the salt he also has access to

4001212

cefsharp	awesomium
we tried hit a hurdle couldn t change the code to work the way we wanted so we went the open source route with cef and cefsharp being able to see the code made the work so much easier and less voodoo ffs awesomium even obfuscate their code so i couldn t understand what i m doing wrong

4001547
cefsharp	cefglue
we gave cefglue a 5 minute try it didn t work immediately so we moved to cefsharp which immediately worked this is the great and terrible thing about two competing open source frameworks

then because of a many gems are not available for jruby and b most of the rails webshosts don t support jruby i decided to use ruby mri

4001690
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
in general i d rather not have paging and sorting parameters or options on my repository instead i d rather return an iqueryable and let callers compose those types of operations into the query as long as you are iqueryable a technology like ef or nhibernate can translate those operators into sql - if you fall back to ilist or ienumerable it s all in memory operations

locate header save width and height

4002002
width	height
return width and height of the image

4002002
width	height
their code also returns the width and height of the image but they do it in a different way that is several magnitudes times faster than the code that team a wrote only the beginning of the file is loaded into memory and the dimensions is taken from the header without decoding the image

4002043
multibyte	substr
mrclay also pointed out something very important it may be a better idea to use mb_substr multibyte substr literally instead of substr

4002090
post	get
you need to check the get variable qqfile and if it is set it contains your file name while the file is in the post data

4002141
int	chars
what i think if the base type of the pointer were of int type then it would have retrieved 4 bytes from the location it s pointing.then the o p would have been 1000.but as i changed the base type to chars then it would retrieve 1 byte from location it s pointing when i dereference it.but how the answer is -24

when you ignore setting the height and width it simply doesn t add width and height to your control

4002375
google-chrome	firefox
these things seem relatively standard and in fact ssl works completely fine in both firefox and in google-chrome while it does not in ie

4002381
hex	binary
the key is in hex - if you look at the java page you pasted you can see that easily by decoding the binary values for the key in the detailed output

4002419
int	chars
dereferencing a chars pointer got you the first character-sized chunk of the internal representation of 1000 as an int

4002419
int	chars
that chars was then promoted to a int as per the rules for varidac arguments and interpreted as int

4002419
int	double	int	chars
in any case when you dereferenced the it interpreted that memory as float which has a rather more complex internal structure than a chars or even a 2s-complement int and promoted it to a double those rules for varidac arguments again then an attempt was made interpret that representation as an int and if the float did fit in an int the double probably doesn t so you re interpreting part of the double as an int

4002434

it generates an entity class for each table that wraps the base entity and has property setter getter corresponding to each column name

4002870
folder	directory
copy the folder of data files myd etc to your local data directory but skip the mysql folder too version specific and might not be right for the local setup

4002871
centos	linux
it works ok but uses 20m per httpd-child at my centos 5 linux machine

4002872
preorder	inorder
but if inorder and preorder traversals are same then the trees are equal

4002884
for-loop	arrays
a for-loop can be used to iterate over the elements of an arrays but it cannot be used to iterate over the properties of an object unless you can use ecmascript 5 s object.keys which could be used to implement the above example as follows

4002919
superclass	subclassing
i have heard that when you have a subclassing you are supposed to initialize the superclass with the same init function from within the subclassing s init

4002919
superclass	subclassing
if this is required then does this mean i can t create a new init function within a subclassing such as initwithpoint and have that call super s init or initwithframe simply because the superclass doesn t have initwithpoint

4002938
superclass	subclassing
you can choose to init your subclassing with whatever you want provided that you call an init method of the superclass

4002942
super	implements
if the -init in super is implements as

4002942
superclass	subclassing
if this is required then does this mean i can t create a new init function within a subclassing such as initwithpoint and have that call super s init or initwithframe simply because the superclass doesn t have initwithpoint

4002976
jinternalframe	jeditorpane
my program will then pop up a jinternalframe with a jeditorpane in it as the console capturing any console output from the user s program

4002980
stdout	stderr
it has a method for starting the logging on file as well which uses freopen 3 to redirect some stream stderr and stdout atm to a file in append mode

4003048
hash	salt
i was thinking of sharing a small class between the applications so that the password can be passed already hash but i would also have to pass the salt so it still seems like a small security risk

4003055
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can use webclient or httpwebrequest to download asynchronously and parse the response

4003096
width	height
if you want to have a triangle that has exactly the value of the first texel of your 2 d texture then you need to pass the coordinates 0.5 width 0.5 height to each of the vertices

4003101
textarea	textbox
a multiline textbox is actually a html textarea tag

4003105
superclass	subclassing
when you create a subclassing if you implement an initializer then you must be sure to call the superclass s designated initializer s and you must provide at least one designated initializer of your own though this can just be your override of the superclass s

4003105
superclass	subclassing
as part of initializing your subclassing you must call one of the superclass s designated initializers

4003107
uiview	subviews
you can even have uiview if not coreanimation as grimless suggested animations that move the current tableview to the left setframe and the next tableview from the right setframe offscreen before animation and then in place in the beginanimation-commitanimation clause but make sure you add the tableviews in a container view the bubble interior that clips its subviews

4003164
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
to test whether this is the case you could either do an nslog call inside the didreceivememorywarning message or you could subclass uiimage and extend its dealloc and put an nslog message inside it saying something like image being dealloced and then check what gets written to the console

4003179
superclass	subclassing
i have heard that when you have a subclassing you are supposed to initialize the superclass with the same init function from within the subclassing s init

4003179
superclass	subclassing
if this is required then does this mean i can t create a new init function within a subclassing such as initwithpoint and have that call super s init or initwithframe simply because the superclass doesn t have initwithpoint

4003179
superclass	subclassing
once it s in a superclass interface it s there and you re able to make bad choices where the compiler can t help you - you re expected to determine the visibility graph for initializers and write your subclassing accordingly

4003188
hash	salt
passing the salt in clear is no problem the salt is usually stored in clear the purpose of the salt is avoiding the same password hashing to the same hash always so users with the same password would have the same hash and rainbow tables would only need a single hash for each possible password

4003201
int	chars
if as seemingly in your case chars is a signed type you are assigning the int constant 128 to a type that is only guaranteed to hold values up to 127

4003202
hide	show
i want these layers to be retrievable so i can delete hide show layers on command

4003210

get resources new -- post resources -- redirect get resources new_id

4003521
put	get
get resources id edit -- put resources id -- redirect get resources id

4003521
post	get
they could press reload over and over and as long as our controller checked the new action for a post vs a get it would just continue to error or reload the blank form

4003521
post	get
on success we d move on with get post get pattern

4003521
post	put
so what s the general consensus i know i could hack the post put data into the flash but i d prefer something clean on what to do about the resource location switch and on fail now displaying the new form on what should be a show or index based on the uri and incorporating rails ... new || ... edit paradigm

4003521
post	put
secondary question how should could we handle getting information about a resource before a post or put if practicing true rest which touts itself as great because there is no broadcast contract of schema as per say soap

4003526
mouse	keyboard
mouse is very slow and keyboard stops responding shortly

4003539

i m having 5 view controllers in my navigation based application i need to support both landscape portrait mode in only a one view following items displaying in the view

4003802
move	drag
i want to give user a option to move up and down file name using up down button and using drag and drop

4003829
portrait	landscape
you should use shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation in your view controller and return yes for view controllers that should support both landscape portrait

4003842
union	distinct
union is a set operation - it returns distinct values

4003842
union	distinct
you can think of union as concat followed by distinct

4003844
portrait	landscape
if you have your portrait layout main.xml in res layout and your landscape layout main.xml in res layout-land and your onconfigurationchanged looks like this

4003852

the method .removechild only applies to parent nodes and its direct children

4003867
google-chrome	firefox
the existing code worked in ie8 and google-chrome but failed in firefox

4003873
consistency	acid
if your connections are the problem certainly then just deal with the connection problem and implement connection pooling java and sybase have libraries for that rather than reducing the quality and performance of your app as well as the consistency that s the c in acid of the database

4003894
multiplying	addition
is it a multiplying or addition or is something else

4003898
onresume	onpause
you probably want to register you listener onresume and unregister it onpause though rather than oncreate

4003905
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	caf	wav	aiff	aiff	caf
i tried different formats like wav mp3 aac aiff caf but it seems that attaching the soundmanager eats the same size of memory

4003928
int	double	multiplying	add
it can add registers multiplying registers with the constants 2 4 and 8 for address calculations of words int and double

4003934
int	chars
a chars works just like an int

4003946
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems determine performance and 200 000 images without indexing will slow down performance in ext2 or ntfs

4003995
innodb	myisam
should i use innodb or myisam for the tables

4003995
innodb	myisam
or innodb for one and myisam for the other

4004081
put	get
i also guess that you may get desired output from the list if you put node to the list by value not by const reference but it still is undefined behaviour

4004114
post	get
but this is post the moment that we switch times which happens on 01 00 utc so when you convert time to local timezone you get march 30 04 00

4004166
nsscanner	nsstring
you can solve the problem using methods on nsstring or a class named nsscanner both have been available since iphone os 2.0 and long before that since before mac os x 10.0 actually

4004168
int	double
from a usability standpoint while reading the second is akin to a table layout and it helps you scan it vertically to quickly see that there re two int and one double but it s also slightly harder to connect the horizontal extremes to see that bar is 1

4004168
int	double
the first one makes the individual rows take focus and is easier to scan horizontally to see that bar is 1 but it s harder to quickly see that there re two int and one double

4004170
folder	directory
i was wondering if it was possible to maintain a directory structure within the application folder in side webapps folder i have created a folder called itc357 which acts as my application folder which carries all my files so the directory path is as follows

4004240
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
however for regular filesystems fat ntfs extx etc. there s no need to be shrinkable as they were designed to occupy space dedicated for them on hard disk

4004245
draggable	droppable
is there any way of dropping a draggable into the droppable by hardcoding and not by actually going into the browser and doing drag-drop

4004255
width	height
note how i switched the width and the height

4004397
width	height
how can i set the textview properties like width height using java code

4004475
folder	dir
you may see it as log.txt in your graphical folder viewer as opposed to the cli dir command simply because it hides the known file extensions

4004523
ocl	uml
now uml includes an imperative action language not to be confused with ocl that allows a precise definition of the behaviour of class methods

4004545
for-loop	loops
and that reference does take a bit of memory but the real danger is usually the overhead when calling function in a loops just having a single function call inside a large for-loop could add a lot of processing time

4004590
move	drag
try this code to move items up and down with drag and drop within the listbox

4004624
ada	pascal	modula-2	oberon
the entire wirthian line of languages including pascal object pascal modula-2 modula-3 oberon oberon-2 and ada plus a few others i ve probably overlooked allow arrays to be indexed from whatever point you like including obviously 1

4004627
postgresql	mysql
the database can be sql server mysql postgresql xml etc

4004637
ocaml	sml
to transpose the matrix you can either translate this ocaml code to sml or simply use your poslist function for all indices from 0 to 8

4004766
width	height
yes or argumentexception when gdi+ randomly decides that the width or height you pass is too large instead of throwing oom

4004805
getter	setter
and this property has only a getter but no setter

4004831
hide	show
what i want to do is basically create calayerref s or cglayerref s or whatever push them into my layers variable and then when i need them fetch use their context and finally draw hide show delete them

4004849
explode	implode
or a combination of explode and implode

4004920
ant	maven
to be frank i think that your current mindset maps much better to ant than to maven and i would suggest starting with that

4004936
jobs	cron
instead of using cron jobs i was thinking of using asynchronous calls

4004964
post	get
some of these cpts require a custom write panel which basically means that it has a set of custom meta boxes rather than the bog-standard edit box you get with your post or pages

4004991
int	double
essentially i have a methods that manipulates data taken from a table to create a new object zexpert. zexpert has parameters int id int domain and double zexpert

4005035
octal	hex
i was expacting only 92 because this would be the converted value from 222 octal to hex 92

4005055
multiplication	exponent
if the exponent is 0.5 you should use sqrt and if the exponent is a small integer 2 3 4 expressing the formula with multiplication is faster but less readable

4005073
width	height
i have a control for which i need to enforce a certain width or height depending on a property called orientation which obviously can be vertical or horizontal

4005075
int	boolean
| and are available for boolean and int types and don t short-circuit

4005084
post	get
bedroom width bedroom num_windows bedroom bed_type etc you would store an array within the post_meta table so when you get the post meta for the bedroom of a house it would return an array of arrays the first level represnting the rooms the second representing the attributes of a room

4005092
melt	reshape
here i manually loop over the data and build a narrow result dataframe that i could turn into my desired result using melt reshape

4005092
plot	heatmap
now i can take the highest scores and plot a heatmap style graph

4005103
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
when i download the images from gowalla i m already scaling them down based on the screens size 48x48 for hdpi so 32x32 for mdpi etc. so these aren t huge images but i m still forced to choose between potentially crashing my app or having the icons flicker in and out

4005139
directx	directdraw
i have been going through the code and reading through directx documentation trying to find a place to optimize the code so that rendering is as smooth of directx as it is on directdraw

4005139
direct3d	directx
since i don t know directx very well my question is is direct3d just not an optimal option for displaying video capture or is the problem simply that the code probably isn t the best it could be for it

4005155
width	height
if it is a custom control then you could write the orientation property such that the set method checks value which would be either vertical or horizontal and then quietly sets width height accordingly

4005159
folder	directory
the problem is if i copy a big file into this directory such that it takes about 30 seconds to copy this method is called as soon as the first byte is written to the folder and tries to move a file which is being used by another process so fails

4005162
installation	upgrade
i m building an installation upgrade package with wix

4005162

google-chrome	firefox
- it works fine on google-chrome and firefox

4005166
width	height
when i keep prototype with jquery altogether with my noconflicted gallery viewer there seems to be errors with the width and height returned by jquery accessors

4005180
post	get
version of the question cross-posted on parallel python forums i ll post an answer here if i get something there about this from a non so user

4005184
getter	setter
and even better if you use synthesize to generate your getter and setter than you need not even worry about the memory model of cocoa at all with the exception of releasing your ivars in dealloc

4005205
implements	extends
class panel extends surfaceview implements surfaceholder.callback

4005227
nsscanner	nsstring
you could use nsstring and nsscanner but i generally find it easier just to use c apis directly for pure ascii files

4005236
width	height
i once posted a question and answered myself regarding width and height and animation without jquery

4005262
hide	show
for example if i know that i will always have to hide div elements this hide and show method is pretty ok

4005291
int	double
xdate int year int month int day int hour int minute double second

4005329
toolchain	binutils
there s no way to specify what toolchain to use i have to spot the variable names for all binutils hoping not to forget any

4005336
for-loop	arrays
but later when i try to make a for-loop with a if statement that ignores null values and prints the arrays address as the ascii value for the character the number of times the character occured and the percentage that character appears of the total characters

4005337
post	get	post	put	put	get
you should read this article on the differences between get and post get is when you put your parameters in the url and post is when you put your parameters in the form

4005355
implements	extends
i ve got class a wrapped with method foo implements using extends

4005359

properties is inherited from another

4005366
post	get
i m trying to get will paginate to link to my nested route instead of the regular post variable

4005385
yacc	bison
you can use yacc bison for this

4005471
button	checkbox
note that this is particularly useful for checkbox if you use radio button it might be a better idea to remove the part then php will automaticly retrieve the value that was chosen if any

4005496
post	get
you can use http post parameters instead of get parameters in the request

4005520
for-loop	arrays
will this result in an arrays that i can put a for-loop through

4005523
pop-up	dialog
a small dialog window pop-up - select ok

4005524
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop but it s not an arrays that s returned it s a nodelist for example

4005532
for-loop	arrays
but the behave like arrays so you can use a normal for-loop to traverse it

4005559
nfa	dfa
let s suppose i have a class which implements a nfa dfa whose transitions are stored in a .net dictionary structure and which takes an input word and recognizes a set of words derivable in some way from the input

4005560
int	chars
isdigit accepts number1 of type chars and not int

4005568
post	get
i am trying get all commments relateed to my current post i am doing it as following

4005577
integer	unsigned
note that it have unsigned type and result will be integer

4005585
nfa	dfa
please see the following implementation which takes an nfa and converts it to a dfa and then to a graph using a dictionary just like yourself

4005585
nfa	dfa
nfa to dfa

4005606
folder	directory
with media being the folder in the base directory that contains the static files

4005610
ubuntu	linux
i have seen plenty of people mention some of the cool new features in perl 5.12 but my preferred flavor of linux ubuntu only comes with 5.10.1

4005610
versioning	upgrade
can someone give me some guidance on the easiest while still safest way to upgrade parallel-install the newest perl versioning

4005641
ubuntu	debian
on the other hand itools at first glance appears to be maintained but there does not appear to be an ubuntu debian package available and so would be difficult to deploy and maintain

4005694
width	height
see height and width on iphone ipad

4005710
content-length	content-type
the problem is i keep getting an error saying http 1.1 400 bad request content-type text html date sat 23 oct 2010 18 42 20 gmt connection close content-length 42

4005710
post	get
basically the first line is different the host name is different and it says i m sending my info with a get variable instead of a post variable even though i set curlopt_post to true

4005826
hash	salt
so the way around it is to combine the hash with a unique salt

4005826
hash	salt
so my question is how does this change the fact that if the attacker got access to the database in the first place and has the hash created for the real password and also has the hash for the salt how is this not just as subject to a rainbow attack

4005826
hash	salt
because the theory would be that he tries every permutation + the salt hash and compare the outcome with the password hash

4005843
hash	salt
the primary advantage of a salt chosen at random is that even if two people use the same password the hash will be different because the salt will be different

4005843
hash	salt
this means that the attacker can t precompute the hash of common passwords because there are too many different salt values

4005855
int	double
for example it lets you add two numbers regardless of whether those happen to be of type short int long float double long double etc

4005919
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i assume this can be easily achieved with activex technology but want to make sure firefox safari google-chrome browsers let alone linux mac os don t get left behind

4005934
hash	salt
for example if you add a 32-bit salt to each pass-phrase the attacker has to hash and re-hash each input in the dictionary 4 billion times and store the results from all of those to have a successful attack

4005954
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu linux version 10.04.1 i am using as version 2.20.1 and the problem is that it creates the file but the file is always empty

4005974

is there anyway to send a text through an ip tcp ip lan using vb6 or vb.net

4005974
pop-up	dialog
i was looking at the net send to send something but it doesn t seem to work for me as well as it seems to pop-up a dialog box for every text you send

4006006
goto	break
one problem is that a goto break a for-loop

4006006
goto	break
the goto break always and all nested loops even if the label of the goto is in the same block and the for-variables are lost immediately after the jump

4006013
pull	push
as components as finishinged i will push my changes to the centrally hosted git repo private git hub account usually or pull them to dev i setup dev as a repo and pull from ssh

4006023
objectcontext	transactionscope
if you use transactionscope with multiple objectcontext instances the transaction will be promoted to distributed and whole operation somemethod will be handled still as atomic

4006094
integer	unsigned
one possible explanation is that you have undefined behaviour because you are using a format specification for a signed integer d but passing an unsigned int parameter

4006107
maven	pom.xml
the problem is that dependency versions specified in pom.xml definition are the libraries i need to use they have sources javadoc available etc. but maven puts all the available library versions on classpath so that if i ctrl+shift+t or step into some class which belongs to that dependency it might be the one without sources javadoc the one not declared in pom.xml definition but in local maven repo

4006109
outputstream	inputstream	content-disposition	content-type
if the resource is dynamic create a servlet which obtains an inputstream of the content somehow new fileinputstream resultset.getbinarystream etc..etc.. and writes it to the outputstream of the response along at least the content-type and content-disposition response headers

4006116
put	get
what i understand is that you can put the long macbeth story into the hash function and get a x long hash out of it

4006116
put	get
then you can put in the beowulf story to get another hash out of it again x long

4006116
put	get
so since this function maps loads of things into a shorter length there is bound to be overlaps like i might put in the story of the hobit into the hash function and get the same output as beowulf ok but this is inevitable right

4006121
x86	64bit

cons if access archiving versioning is not an issue then sql makes a good config store if combined with apc or memcached for efficient access

4006163
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
add subview to navgiationbar with the following code inside inside viewwillappear or viewdidappear

4006185
width	height
the frame property has an x y width and height attribute

4006212
lxml	elementtree
another option if you really don t want to build a tree is to use the target parser interface which is like sax for lxml elementtree but easier

ceil	floor
this link provides functions that truncate floor or ceil or round a float

4006234
nfa	dfa
does anyone know of any good nfa and dfa implementation in c# possibly implementing as well conversions between both

4006234
nfa	dfa
what i would like would be to be able to construct a nfa and then convert it automatically to a dfa but without having to write my own code which would take a very long time

4006238
hash	md5
a couple of years back dutch researchers demonstrated weaknesses in md5 by publishing a hash of their prediction for the us presidential election

4006271
komodo	notepad++	kate	komodo
i write everything in kate linux komodo editor mac or notepad++ windows

4006282
put	get
if not how do i get around this problem of put creation with nhibernate

4006314
int	chars
p n where p is a pointer and n is an int is equivalent to p+n therefore it s like accessing 100 chars away from what your p points to

4006319
int	double
by convention java objects have capitalized first-letter names string while primitives have lower case names int float double etc.

4006333
ssl	https
in order to prevent that you should enable tls ssl on your server and serve the page over https

4006337
subtract	add
since by definition your site is just doing simple calculations i would recommend creating a single controller with a variety of actions add subtract divide etc

4006346
persistent	transient
any message whether published persistent or transient on a durable or non-durable queue may get persistent to disk

4006348
freebsd	linux
i am porting from linux to freebsd and have run into mknod failing with errno

4006348
freebsd	linux
so what would be a good replacement call to use that will work on both linux and freebsd

4006352
spaces	delimiter
if you have data that looks properly formatted with delimiter that you can identify eg in your case tabs spaces there is no need to use regex

4006353
mousemove	mouseenter	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseenter
the problem is that ie handles mouseover differently because it behaves like mouseenter and mousemove combined on an element

4006366
post	get
this way you will get the comments for the specific post and all associated to the comments data

4006366
post	get
this way you will get the post and all data associated to it

4006374
getter	setter
the other option is to use automatic getter and setter in the controller and then in the block use

4006374
getter	setter
using the getter and setter can occasionally get confusing as it may look like you are accessing the data through the orm rather than a temporary session variable so you might make a coding-style consistency decision to use mage registry for those types of variables

4006376
pdfbox	itext
if you want to parse pdfs you ll probably want to investigate something like itext or pdfbox although be warned the pdf file format wasn t designed for easy extraction of text - many a phd student has burnt out whilst trying.

4006381
maven	pom.xml
the problem is that dependency versions specified in pom.xml definition are the libraries i need to use they have sources javadoc available etc. but maven puts all the available library versions on classpath ...

4006381
maven	pom.xml
... so that if i ctrl+shift+t or step into some class which belongs to that dependency it might be the one without sources javadoc the one not declared in pom.xml definition but in local maven repo

4006381
maven	m2e
and this is not really a maven or m2e specific issue

4006386
mvp	presenter
also i am working on a project using mvp and i find it very tedious to make the view connect to the data base.i mean i have to update my presenter service serviceasync servicimpl facades in order to make connection to database

4006418
width	height
layouting of elements computing their preferred height and width thus no need to deal with coordinates and dimensions

4006418
hide	show
alternatively could i use a webview and render my stuff as local html using javascript to show or hide nodes

4006430
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i have windows 7 here and the navigator.appversion returns a string containing nt 6.1 in these browsers google-chrome opera safari ie9 beta

uiview	uiwindow
i ve looked into adding a uiwindow on top of the current status bar as in this question add uiview above all other views including statusbar

4006463
mockito	easymock
whereas unit tests create a dummy implementation or use mockito easymock etc. and thus don t require any ui components

4006469
google-chrome	firefox
i have attempted to use firefox google-chrome and ie and nothing will let me connect in debug mode

4006491
flex	robotlegs
i need to upload a group of images using flex with robotlegs

4006505

i am trying to learn to use expression-blend to build silverlight ui

4006527
aggregate-functions	sum
sum is an aggregate-functions

4006564
put	get
idea is to get user s group from database but i don t want to write the code evey time when i need it so i decided to put it in function

4006568
thin	webrick
i get the following error when i run with thin webrick works fine

4006603
std	ostream
and some where else i have overloaded ostream of std vector

4006607
ivar	subclassing
how about subclassing uiview and adding a uiimage ivar called image

4006615
post	get
another possibility is to use post instead of get for your login form

4006651
serializable	deserialization
i don t think i would have to write explicit serializable deserialization code

4006674
width	height
i don t want to increase the width and height of image itself

4006694
getter	setter
in groovy properties with package access well i should call that attributes or instance variables perhaps get automatically setter and getter methods compiled into the class file

4006694
getter	setter
the groovy compiler will generate a setter and a getter

4006771
folder	directory
how can i point imagemagick to a directory of images and use the adaptive sharpen tool to increase the sharpness of all the files in the folder

4006807
put	get
you actually do get a guaranty that is the same thing as so depending on what you put at the address of x - 1 then you do have a sort of guaranty

4006822
post	get
when i get to the last requiredtext field i want to submit the form using post or whatever

4006903
int	chars
if your int are nonzero and small enough to fit in unsigned chars or wchar_t a convenient way to do this is something like

4006903
octal	decimal
keep in mind those are octal values not decimal

4006908
getter	setter
set values on the model using the magic getter setter you get these in objects that inherit from varien_object or setdata etc

4006914
children	parent
the previous answer also only gets you one direction - categories know about their parent but not about their children

4006914
children	parent
if you want to go a step further and call them parent and children you can

4006936
width	height
for some reason the width always 640 and height always 480

4006936
portrait	landscape
no matter whether it is portrait or landscape

4006936
width	height
i really confused on that i thought in portraint it should be width 320 and height is 480 while in landscape mode width should be 480 and height should be 320

4006936
width	height
how do i get correct width and height of the image

4006956
ncover	dotcover
as of now i think dotcover and resharper combined are less expensive than ncover

4006958
snmp	mib
i have our own mib files and i know in many cases i have to write snmp agent to support my own mib

4006958
snmp	mib
but this time i think if i can make jboss snmp adapter jbosssnmpadapter to support my mib it will be much easier

4006958
snmp	mib
i wonder if jboss snmp adapter can suppport user defined mib so that user can query by oid

4006988
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie tested 8 and 9 - but after the slide up it reappears for a very short time then disappears annoying - and it doesn t work in both google-chrome and firefox

4007050
post	get
i m trying to post a create but i get this error message

4007071
google-chrome	firefox
wil do one thing try to do the same sample in a separate brand new page and try the code in the firefox and google-chrome and check if it is working.the same code you have in jsfiddle

4007136
rubygems	rvm
i suspect you might not be in the correct rvm name that has the gems you re trying to install so thats why i d suggest reinstalling rubygems and building you re core gems from the beginning in your global rvm gemset name

4007155
uiview	subviews
on iphone uiview have a subviews nsarray

4007155
uiview	calayer
in addition there is a second hierarchy each uiview has a calayer array

4007167
uiapplication	uiwindow
oh you could muck around in the uiapplication s uiwindow list to find the keyboard window and move it but then apple wouldn t accept your app.

4007169
fadein	fadeout
from the api i found extjs provide some basic animation for exmaple the fadein fadeout and etc

4007263
hash	md5
one way would be to generate an md5 hash of the user info provided to use as the password

4007263
hash	md5
because the md5 function will always create the same output from a given input it s theoretically possible that someone who knew you were registering what fields were required and what you d most likely put in them they could guess the md5 hash that would be sent to you

4007291
post	get
in my webapp i m using http location headers for redirect post redirect get

4007323
awt	swing
this only affects swing awt but nonetheless

4007339
icmp	tcp
this enumeration lets the program source refer to names like icmp and tcp rather than numbers

4007341
folder	directory
however it actually searches directory like library application support plugins missing the myapp folder

4007378
put	get
so to get ourselves out of this access solution we need to put some time in going over every single report

4007397
int	chars
the int probably has a four-byte alignment requirement so in the first case both of the chars elements need to have three padding bytes appended to them but in the second case you only need two padding bytes after the second chars element because a chars element has an alignment of one byte

4007420
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
if you are trying to measure how long time something takes you should know that the resolution of the time is only about 15ms in ie where it is 1ms in firefox google-chrome and opera

4007432
setinterval	settimeout
in fact most of the time settimeout it s preferred for a reason settimeout will wait the execution of your script setinterval will execute in every interval without waiting

4007451
getter	setter
ever since i read about the anemic domain model something i was doing all the time i have really been trying to get away from creating domain objects that were just buckets of getter and setter and return to my oo roots

4007452
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
this class has touchesmoved and touchesbegan defined

4007452
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
but i need to add more code to each of these classes to the same touchesmoved and touchesbegan methods without overriding the code that is already on its class

4007471
serializable	deserialization
is comparatively easy and requires writing a small wrapper around websockets so that serializable and deserialization happens opaquely to the application

4007559
mouseup	mousedown
i don t recall the details but if you change click to mousedown or mouseup you should have better results

4007605
post	put
http put isn t entirely cross browser so rails i m using rails 3 supports using post and passing the _method query param

4007610
hash	md5
i m trying to generate a signature using md5 or sha1 hash on a linux system

4007666
qpushbutton	qlistwidgetitem
that s because qpushbutton is taking focus away and doesn t pass click event down to qlistwidgetitem

4007694
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu try this

4007696
cpu	processors
the intel amd processors are much cheaper and faster than what you can get with these until they go in every cpu everywhere

4007703
folder	directory
creates a folder systemtempdir index-dir or tmp index-dir if no propertyentry for a temporary directory has been found

4007728
setinterval	clearinterval
to reset automatic calls you could use the clearinterval function on the id returned by the setinterval

4007776
tunnel	vpn
of course the easy way to do this would just be an ssh or vpn tunnel

4007838
portrait	landscape
i display a video using mpmovieplayerviewcontroller in a tabbar application the video plays fine in portrait mode but doesn t rotate in landscape mode

4007841
post	get
i ve just installed xampp and wordpress and all looks ok when i bring up the default blog but if i click on any of the post or category links i get an error 404 oject not found and sure enough if i look at the source the link destination doesn t exist

4007843
yacc	bison
you can write a small c++ parser by combining flex or lex and bison or yacc

4007859
clang	llvm
another option is finding a parser using clang llvm

4007908
ant	maven
without using ant maven etc

4007922
width	height
i did this with a custom class where i override the onmeasure call to get width and height

4007922
width	height
in onmeasure you get the width and height for your image so that it fits your view

4007951
submit	submission
you can however add the submit name value pair like a normal form submission from that button would if you re submission from a button for example

4007961
post	get	post	put	put	get
for post requests this was happening just fine but when i wanted to do a put request or a delete request this wouldn t get called somehow or it was being ignored

4007988
postgresql	mysql
usage of existing mysql postgresql instance

4007996
gif	png
the thing is that you put the .+ at the beginning in the wrong order and should not have encapsulated jpg gif png and the point in

4008051
versioning	upgrade
yes the winforms wrapper did get the upgrade and shows the vista versioning

4008115
folder	directory
so the trunk is in the root folder of the svn directory

4008133
for-loop	loops
your for-loop confusion stems from having more loops than you need

4008133
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
it works very similarly except you d be using division and modulo arithmetic instead of multiplication in the offset above

4008150
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox opera safari and chromium

4008162
width	height
i was wondering how to resize a div containing some text by setting a width and height so it would stretch to fill that area like an tag

4008162
width	height
when you set the width and height attribute of an image it resizes the image to fill that area

4008162
width	height
i need to take an arbitrary width and height value and stretch a div containing text to those dimensions

4008162
google-chrome	firefox
oh and i would preferably not like to use html5 because it is a requisite that i need compatibility with ie7+ and firefox google-chrome

4008167
off-by-one	equivalent
they re almost equivalent except the latter version is both more easily readable and more resistant to off-by-one

4008216
subtract	add
if you add a second row_number sorting desc rather than asc you can calculate the total number of records by adding the two rowcounts together and subtract one

4008273
width	height
commenting out width and height assignments i see the tiles but with distorted proportions

4008341
post	get
if it is then a link is the right choice but you should change the js so it makes a get request instead of a post request otherwise you should be looking at using a form instead

4008344
post	get
see this post get an object attributes list in objective-c

4008354
width	height
if i have a given rectangle with the width w height h and angle r

4008390
google-chrome	firefox
i have one but it works only with ie - not with firefox or google-chrome

4008422
int	double
a simple solution is to store the cents in an int as opposed to the dollars in a double

4008425
sorting	grouping
at least i got rid of the sorting grouping in my client code

4008435
persistent	transient
if you annotate a field with transient it will not be persistent

4008449
pop-up	dialog
i expect this line to pop-up the save as dialog box but nothing happens

4008455
dictionary	map
you could use a plain dictionary or create a similar map suited for your needs it will be an array in which you place elements according to an hashvalue you calculate on your 4 values but you ll need to care about collisions

4008546
int	chars
string s an int n and a chars c and returns

4008557
xml-rpc	json-rpc
would you choose an existing one soap xml-rpc json-rpc java rmi amf rpyc corba or an entirely new one

4008581
setinterval	settimeout
i did this with settimeout instead of setinterval because it s a little safer

4008634
rspec	capybara
i use capybara rspec cucumber and pickle in concert to minimize the actual amount of step definitions i have to write and generally it gets the job done

4008669
width	height
so it accepts raw image data xml containing parameters and image width height and then return processed image and some xml report

4008713
post	get
btw this works if you use a get but fails as a post

4008713
post	get
changing post to get o s value is 9 14 2010 12 00 00 am

4008713
post	get
how do i get the post to work with .ajax

4008744
getter	setter
org.springframework.beans.notreadablepropertyexception invalid property name of bean class java.lang.string bean property name is not readable or has an invalid getter method does the return type of the getter match the parameter type of the setter

4008780
turing	decidable
basically decidable is the language for which one can construct an algorithm turing machine that will halt for any finite input with accepting or rejecting the input

4008813
groovy	gsp
in a gsp groovy server page i m using to update a after the server-side call

4008863
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven s jetty plugin you will need to specify ssl keystore details in your pom.xml file

4008864
getter	setter
this is most likely telling you that some el expression is failing because spring cannot figure out what the type of the name property is based on the getter setter signatures

4008864
getter	setter
if you showed us the declaration of all of the getter and setter for name maybe we can be more specific

4008908
getter	setter
in fact the getter and setter in the bean need to match the contents of the xml

4008933
int	chars
i need to allocate memory for a pointer which needs to be used as a 2d array.i know how to allocate memory for chars pointers and int pointers i am confused how memory is allocated of a array of pointers.a pictorial representation of the reason would be very helpful also is the code below fine

4008947
post	get
it is supposed to intercept a post request and convert it to a get request with the parameters appended to the query string

4008977
width	margin
blocks take up the whole of their parent s width by default minus margin border and padding widths so the 100 doesn t really do anything

4008987
post	get
.ajax gives you a bit flexibility you can choose post or get and you can leave .post in current case

4009020
mp4	webm
according to flash supports flv and mp4 as well as webm eventually

4009020
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome opera firefox support webm

4009020
google-chrome	firefox
for codecs h.264 is supported by flash and google-chrome i think firefox supports theora etc

4009034
mockups	balsamiq
i use balsamiq mockups to draw up the screens then i write a up a page for each screen explaining behaviors

4009038
post	get
in any case you don t have to stop using post to get the benefits of your returned script s variables being global

4009059
post	put
if this is within android which is the tag that is on the post you can put a hook in the oncreate method in which you save what activity you are in to the database table

4009082
post	get	post	put	put	get
because rails validates http verbs get post put .. and webdav uses http extensions like propfind that do not validate throwing the following exception

4009114
rss	feed
i m kind of new to rss feed but i m able to create a feed dynamically using php and it works great

4009183
getter	setter
my personal guess is that the getter is defined in the super class of myobject and only the setter is re-defined or overriden in the myobject class

4009202
min	max
looks like you have defined a macro or maybe a function called min and max in your own code

4009202
min	max
the #include for vector apparently also defines a macro for min and max and the compiler is getting confused

4009202
min	max
change the name of your min and max macros

4009203
int	chars
strcat takes 2 pointers to chars you re supplying a pointer to chars and an int wrongly cast to pointer to chars

4009209
rss	feed
the easiest way to do this a way that does not require client side programming might be setting up an rss feed in php

4009209
rss	feed
there are dozens if not hundreds rss feed readers out there for every conceivable platform

4009209
rss	feed
if i remember correctly windows vista and or 7 have a built-in sidebar widget to display rss feed

4009218
sum	coalesce
the coalesce is to catch the first row which has a sum of null

4009235
post	put
data-size xml very verbose but usually not an issue when using compression and thinking that the write access case through post or put is much more rare as read-access in many cases it is 3 of all traffic

4009273
postgresql	mysql
but i have only tested this on sqlite which don t actually have the alter_table at all so i don t know if it will actually work on mysql postgresql

4009292
udp	tcp
these could communicate over tcpip tcp or udp microsoft networking named pipes mailslots or whatever you have

4009292
udp	tcp
you d probably get to a result more quickly picking one development tool set and using whatever it offers for tcp or udp sockets

4009297
width	height
i imagine i need to set the string to the longest string and then create the button allowing the ui to size it properly then get its height width and set the height width such that it doesn t resize when the button text is changed to the shorter string

4009320
width	height
i am trying to set the width and height of a mask behind a modal window

4009320
google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox and google-chrome but ie adds about 25px to each and i end up with scroll bars

4009326
tcplistener	tcpclient
if you need bi-directional communication with a custom protocol i would use wcf or the tcplistener and tcpclient classes to create your own socket server and client

4009360
portrait	landscape
i have been able to create portrait pages and landscape pages in separate documents but now require to do this in one document

4009369
ctime	posix
apparently the ctime creation or change time metadata attribute of a file is system dependent as some systems windows store the time that a file was created its birth date and others posix systems linux track the time that it was last updated

4009375
hide	show
i need to hide it in the first load then when hovering it will show

4009381
getter	setter
using synthesize will actually only create a setter and a getter method

4009407
capitalize	uppercase
i would be normalising the surnames before storing them - either all lowercase all uppercase or all capitalize

4009414
fseek	ftell
alternatively before using ftell to get l use fseek to move to the start of the file

4009446
sequence	permutation
generate a random permutation over log_2 n bits at the beginning of sequence using the above method and then swap the bits in the result above

4009513
textview	imageview
so is there any methods to edit textview from a imageview

4009514
uiview	subviews
what i implemented already works when the uiscrollview is normal zoom scale but when you zoom in you cannot drag the image to the trashcan because well the trashcan is a subviews of the controller s view itself this was so that it wouldn t zoom with the uiview and of course is not in the right coordinates of the screen for the uiscrollview

4009520
public	protected
when you use private inheritance all public and protected members of the base class become private in the derived class

4009525
public	protected
if you want to access private attributes of a superclas you should do so via public or a protected accessors

4009566
pygtk	pycairo
it seems installing activepython the installing gtk runtime pycairo pyobject pygtk as administrator with compatibility mode for windows xp service pack 2 solved the problem

4009584
actionscript	mxml
either as an attribute on the mxml or in actionscript

4009635
minimum	max
if the minimum length is 17 and the max length is 18 then you guys are looking at this at the wrong way

4009637
ampl	mathprog
another important advantage of ampl is that despite the fact that it is commercial you can avoid the vendor lock-in because there is an open source alternative - gnu mathprog

4009647
mouse	keyboard
classic signs of having a problem like this is the ui thread freezing not getting around to painting and responding to mouse and keyboard events because it is completely overwhelmed by invoke requests

4009677
ienumerable	iqueryable
i wouldn t think you should create a poco for every single ddl list you need so how does one specify to a repository what fields to populate using entity framework 4 asp.net poco generator and a repository that doesn t return iqueryable or ienumerable doesn t defer the sql call when leaving the repository

4009679
onenote	ms-office
there is a comprehensive summary of onenote programmability options with code samples for various ms-office versions here

4009687
getter	setter
in java you would need to have a virtual lookup table for fields to support this or alternatively automatically generated getter setter

4009709
qlistwidget	qabstractitemview
after your qlistwidget is created call setselectionmode with one of the multiple selection types passed in probably qabstractitemview extendedselection is the one you want

4009733
client-side	server-side
html5 has built-in support for generic types and client-side regex verification but few browsers support it and you have to assert it server-side anyway

4009789
min	max
i have been able to use this same code to find out the min max and average for the other performance counters but this one keeps giving me the wrong average

4009789
min	max

onclicklistener	ontouchevent
the reason for setonclicklistener not working is that ratingbar overrides ontouchevent actually its super class absseekbar does and never let view take care of it so view#performclick is never called which would have called the onclicklistener

is add or subtract 400 until we have a

4010579
wan	lan
by far the most common cause of problems when you go from lan to wan is firewall setup

inherited	subclassing
instead of subclassing array your class instances could delegate to one for the desired methods so that you don t inherited the overridden inspect method

4010620
switching	screens
in my case i liked the look-and-feel of the mapquest app - and they way it dealt with toolbars that your could open and close from the top and bottom of the screens - which had buttons - which could switching to other views etc

i m trying to cons the cdr of the input list to a null list and then just compare the car of the list to the car of the new list and traverse down the list but my code just isn t working

4010640

get a wmp9 plugin here that will put your current song name on the

4010807
titlebar	window
titlebar of the wmp window and use

on the other hand if you will shift right unsigned integer shifted in bits will be zeroed

4010828

the problem occurs in firefox and google-chrome

4010876

if you only use an int to do math where you are expecting a double to be returned like 0.55 everything after the decimal place will be lost because the cpu expects an int to be returned

4011191
hide	show
i guess what i m asking is it possible to make it hide anything that currently is in the #content div and show the appropriate div

4011218
children	parent
to understand which is which right-click productcategory1 in the property window the multiplicity for productcategory1 is many so productcategory1 represents the navigation property for the children or subcategories also it s of type and the other one - productcategory2 - represents parent category for this category and it s of type productcategory

octal	decimal
nnn is supposed to be an octal escape but the number is in its decimal form

all you need to do is write a forwarding comparator method implementing comparable for node that checks if the generic argument implements comparable and then forwards the method call to comparator of the stored object

margin	text-align
the closest is text-align but you probably want to use the css declaration margin 0 auto which will move the whole to the center of the page

4011630
post	get
of course it really depends on how much traffic you re going to get how many comments you expect to have etcâ but it s likely that â œdo the simplest thing that worksâ is your friend here it s simpler to store only the user_id so do that until it doesn t work any more eg because you ve got a post with 100 000 comments that takes 30 seconds to render then denormalize and store the username along with the comments

4011676
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	hide	show
do i just hide the tab bar at first place then after the login succeed i will show the tab bar or i should have a uitabbarcontroller inside the uiviewcontroller for the first time

postgresql	mysql
it currently supports oracle mysql and postgresql and is in java so the product runs on windows linux and mac

4012051

int	double
single objects like you do declare a local int or double or myclass temp1

4014730

and if you want to control a computer from a web browser be prepare to require installing some kind of custom plugin - since browsers can t touch arbitrary files on the local filesystem execute local applications or do other things that are flagrant security risks

4014738
lisp	smalltalk
languages like smalltalk lisp cobol etc

4014738
vb.net	vb6

int	chars
to add to phimueme s answer above if your string is always two chars then you can build a 16-bit int out of the two 8-bit chars - and switch on that to avoid nested switch case statements

4014990
post	get
in general you ll want to open an httpurlconnection set it up for a post or get to the appropriate url and then send the request and read the response

my guess is that there is no easy approach for this except add tons of code to touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesend in the custom view and map location of the string to the offset in the view

4015193
g++	gcc
edit then you have to link using g++ or with gcc -lstdc++

4015194

really depend on your definition of smooth however most algorithm of smooth motion use splines to interpolation between 2 or more data points

4015557
hide	show
it is working properly on my iphone but when i am testing it in the ipad i am getting some very strange behavior when you get to the end of a line the keyboard hide for a millisecond and then show itself again immediately

4015557
hide	show
also i have found that removing the lines in the function makes the uitextview grow properly and also doesn t show and hide the keyboard but unfortunately then the uitableviewcell doesn t grow to the proper height

4015557
hide	show
does anyone have any ideas as to how to get the keyboard to continually show rather than hide and show when you get to the end of the line on the ipad

4015570
put	get
then get the custom-pager module also requires token it should let you put together something

4015582
post	get
this may seem too simple but you should always validate your get or post variable before doing anything with them

4015608
google-chrome	firefox
maybe there is something related with this issue firefox and google-chrome slow on localhost

4015610

in colection of objects can contain differnt items string int double etc

4015675
post	put
otherwise will put together a list of the templates myself and post them on the public domain somewhere

4015688
profiling	debugging
i suggest take a look at objectquery.totracestring method by writing the below code before going to profiling and then debugging through your code and examine the value of sql variable

4015792
post	get
session_start creates a session or resumes the current one based on a session identifier passed via a get or post request or passed via a cookie

4015800
width	height
the issue i believe is that webkit for iphone does not provide a native way to scroll content inside a fixed size width height div

4015816
google-chrome	firefox
except firefox and google-chrome will throw a 404 error on the .woff file

4015830
serializable	deserialization
since this is a whole concern in and by itself well you need to design a generic serializable deserialization mechanism on top of your json xml whatever parser you choose that is flexible enough to sustain the potential differences between your 2 data models

4015831
expression-blend	silverlight
in addition since you mention silverlight tim heuer has a blog which covers silverlight and at times touches on expression-blend

4015844
button	checkbox
and the other 2 replace checkbox and radio button respectivly

4015856

thus they are as secure as the https connection which depends on a lot of ssl tls parameters like cipher strength or length of the public key

4015876
mp3	flv
i m currently writing a program that converts a flv video into mp3

4015892
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
the pushviewcontroller should just push a new viewcontroller into the navigationcontroller that is calling it

4015900
int	double
i d like to get an int or double from that event

4015941
mdpi	hdpi
for example if you put them in the drawable-ldpi folder with the size you want and then test on a emulator runing mdpi setting or hdpi settings the image will be bigger you have to decide properly where to store them acording to your desing

4016059

if one hosts his own video files h.264 webm or ogg and flash for each video you can put it on your html5 pages by this and many other method

4016142
h.264	webm
if you don t host and want h.264 or webm codec with flash fallback from your youtube hosted videos you can use this method

4016142

however i am using modernizer and would like to embed my youtube videos without using the iframe but just with direct links to the h.264 webkit and webm gecko file

4016152
post	get
you should look into externals - there s also a post here on how to get started

every entity inherited from the abstract class entitybase which holds the properties company

4016238
pop-up	dialog
ie introduced restrictions on them dialog unadorned is not available to web pages and createpopup pop-up can no longer obscure other windows which are not going to go away and other browsers never implemented them at all

4016301
accessor	properties
simply you can write the logic of adding the child to the parent collection in the set accessor of the parent properties

4016323
post	get
i tend to route all ajax calls that need to do any crud operations to send a get or post request to a function in the controller and let it handle communicating w the model

4016323
post	get
this is how html css views process data getting it from the model via the controller and sending get post requests to the controller and since js is client-side it shouldn t be treated any differently

4016336
client-side	server-side
are you merely changing properties in javascript representations of the objects client-side or are you somehow invoking server-side methods from the javascript calling into servlets to change the data

4016343
actualheight	actualwidth
please check your code use used value instead you should bind it to actualheight and actualwidth of the stacky

4016369
width	height
i set the autoreszingmask to flexible width and height however on rotate the width changes am assuming because self.view s width changes and its set with a width relative to self.view but the height of it doesn t change to fit the content again

4016369
uiview	subviews
the uilabels are subviews of uiview heirarchies used as headers for sections in my uitableview

4016378
width	height
each of these images will have the same width but potentially differing height they are resized on upload to maintain aspect ratio to meet standard width requirements

4016378
width	height
this however appears to assume any image is of standard height and width

4016378
width	height
we have a predefined width that things will fit into however each image may have a different height

4016379
accessor	properties
i am using binding isasync properties to keep ui responsive and loading data from the get accessor of the properties and proved to be a good option while using mvvm

4016412
int	double
and like this also double int etc .

4016441
hash	salt
one approach which will provide good security if the only people who will need to use the key for any purpose can be trusted absolutely with it is to store the key encrypted with another key a copy of which is stored for each user encrypted with a hash of that user s password salt differently from the one stored for password validation

4016449
folder	directory
the way it is now will look for a localhost folder in the current directory

4016477
put	get
i want to get a single order record with all the comments put together in one field

4016506
guava	lambdaj
i don t think such a library exists but if you want to reimplement it with very few code you can use lambda oriented libraries such as guava or lambdaj

4016508
width	height
the best approach is usually to first set the maximum width and current height then send sizetofit then adjust the width again if necessary

4016518
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
if you are planning on writing a larger web app maybe you should look into turbogears pylons or django

4016521
width	height
you ll still need to know the size of the thumbnail image as you ll still need to supply height and width for the div - since you re displaying the thumbnail as a background image you won t be able to have the box scale to the right size automatically

4016521
width	height
but at least now your code can set the values for height and width without worrying about the shape of the play button getting distorted

4016524
prepare	execute
where else do you expect to execute the batch prepare under sybase other than under sybase

4016524
prepare	execute
do vs prepare execute are quite different

4016524
prepare	execute
prepare execute for sybase works just fine in millions of programs

4016524
prepare	execute
execute execute the prepare batch supplies the go and sends the batch to the server and captures whatever is returned according to whatever array variables you have set

4016524
prepare	execute
if you get rid of them and think in terms of execute whatever you have prepare in the batch it might help you to understand the problem better

4016597
getter	setter
i looked up in john resig s article javascript getter and setter but his prototype example didn t work for me

4016597
google-chrome	firefox
worked for me in google-chrome and firefox

4016631
codeigniter	cakephp
codeigniter for example has database migrations and cakephp has scaffolding as well as migrations

4016650
devil	libpng
instead of using libpng directly you might want to consider using devil

4016650
tiff	png
it s intended specifically for the kind of job you seem to be trying to do so it ll generally make it quite a bit easier to do and next month when somebody decides you should display a jpeg or maybe a tiff instead of a png it ll handle that without any major rewrite either

4016678
erlang	lisp
a strong foundation in theory allows you to pick up a very different language like lisp or erlang and know what s going on

4016680
comparator	comparable
difference between comparator and comparable interfaces

4016724
folder	directory
if documentclass.as in in a folder called classes that is in the same directory of your .fla the class filed in your properties panel will be classes.documentclass and your .as package header will be package classes instead of just package

4016767
children	parent
when using nhibernate to retrieve a given parent with children from sql it works fine if there are no children or if there are children with dates that match the where condition

4016767
children	parent
if there are children that do not match the where clause the parent is null

4016767
children	parent
i want to have the parent initialized with an empty list of children

4016875
hash	md5
joux 3 noted that 2-collisions lead to n-collisions if it is feasible to find two messages with the same md5 hash it is effectively no more difficult to find as many messages as the attacker desires with identical md5 hash

4016933
mouse	keyboard
how can i block keyboard and mouse input in c#

4016937
put	get
if i have a tab bar app and plan on using core location in different tabs is there a good common place to put the code used to alloc init the cllocationmanager and get the updates once startupdatinglocation is called

4016945
disk	ram
if you use ram to store part of the range of integer value counters you could technically lower the amt of disk access even more

4016961
width	height
more precisely the width of an alert view s frame is 284 points and the height is 141 points

4016971
maven	m2e
you can try updating to the latest version of m2e and maven 3

4016971
maven	m2e
there is a new maven plugin api that tells m2e what files been affected by the maven plugin

4016993
post	get
you can use get instead of post but it sounds like the url will get pretty messy

4017023
inherited	properties
but the problem is they are not giving right results in case of inherted types inherited properties are coming last and the sequence of the data supplied in the form of a | -separated string is not working

4017027
post	get
to view the page you need to login first with post form get session id and proceed to the page

4017078
cos	sin
using sin and cos

4017089
viewdidload	dealloc
here is viewdidload below followed by the dealloc and the header

4017094
tinyint	boolean
it wasn t my idea to use tinyint column as boolean

4017112
google-chrome	firefox
you d need a prerelease build of firefox minefield or google-chrome canary to run it in

4017120
hide	show
you could reduce your code a bit by simplifying your if else structure since anything besides 1 is the same show hide result and also just call the handler you re binding when the page first loads like this

4017127
hide	show
then the handler just grabs the entry based on that field value and hide show as directed

4017142
hide	show
a quick fix is to hide the div by default and then show it if married is the selected item

4017163
hash	md5
this is not a property of all hash functions but a weakness of the merkleâ damgã rd construction which md5 and sha-1 are based on known as length extension

4017176
serializable	deserialization
you will need to do something like get the list of property names sort them and use the same sorting for serializable and deserialization

4017179
put	get
you must put files directly on the c drive as long pathnames will make the external program not receiving all command line parameters if they get to long

4017182
width	height
you are setting the img src and then immediately trying to get its width and height attributes

4017186
put	get
when i put that import and remove jar files from my app lib it still get me the error

4017187
rss	feed
in the 1st view i load items from a rss feed

4017192
implements	extends
i don t also get why everyone uses things like implements extends interface or others which i find more confusing than putting everything into a single class with public and private visibility or just using functions

4017226
integer	radix
it s used to parse strings and you should use it to convert huepixel i to an integer note that i specify the radix explicitly to avoid numbers being parsed as octal

4017237
multiplying	division
if i were dividing by a constant i would let the compiler strength reduce that specific division likely turning it into a multiplying and some shifts

4017246
width	height
i am not a asp.net guy but jquery has width and height methods not properties like you are using in your code

4017268
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome firefox safari the total height of the table is kept at 500px

4017280
multiplying	add	multiplying	division
so now each division is by a constant which compilers will typically reduce to a series of multiplying shift add instructions as the question mentioned

4017322
rss	feed
firefox doesn t handle the rss feed correctly if its compressed

4017328
versioning	upgrade
for applications that have been developed using recent versioning of java there s no solution other than having users upgrade their java runtime to the minimum versioning required to run the applications

4017369
width	height
if your happy with the use of absolute positioning of div s you could make use of css s support for top left right bottom width and height being specified in centimetres within a print style sheet

4017376
terminate	timeout
the default action for sigalrm is for the kernel to terminate the process so if usleep is implemented in a manner that does not use sigalrm using nanosleep or one of the polling functions with a timeout for instance then usleep would not have registered a handler or otherwise changed the default disposition of the signal

4017382
allocator	stl
my answer though is predicated on your code base using the standard stl allocator which throws on a failed memory allocator

4017392
inline	inlining
some say that inlining should be left to the compiler completely and we shouldn t even bother marking functions as inline

4017412
verilog	hdl
error 10170 verilog hdl syntax error at counter.v 7 near text

4017421
rss	feed
i want to read rss feed with 3 different field title description-1 and description-2

4017479
folder	directory
however the default working directory is my users folder so i need to navigate to my code folder every time i load a new project

4017479
folder	directory
i am wondering if there is a one-line command to set the working directory to the solution folder

4017489
submit	submission
to your submit or click handler to prevent the browser from submission the form and reloading the page

4017512
children	parent
however they want a drill down menu which only shows the parent and the children of the parent so they don t overwhelm the user

4017512
children	parent
i think that what i basically need to do is get the parent id of the child so i can call up just those children

4017540
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
you can replace integer division by a constant by multiplication modulo wordsize with a magic number and a shift

4017540
division	multiplication
a good compiler can compute the magic numbers and replace integer division by multiplication and shift if the divisor is constant at compile time

4017557
inline	inlining
will result in significantly more instruction cycles as a function call than as an inline and such functions are best suited to inlining

4017580
google-chrome	firefox
it would be extremely helpful for developing firefox extensions if i could see the source of google-chrome browser content browser.xul with overlays applied

4017616
tcpdf	fpdf
there are extensions and php classes that allow you to directly create a pdf cpdf fpdf tcpdf

4017635

maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
i already used this recursive property definition in one of my pom.xml in a maven-antrun-plugin and it works well

popupwindow	pop-up
as a work-around i tried to draw an invisible popupwindow before drawing the first pop-up i.e trying to use it twice the first time

4021611
strlen	strcmp
i read efficient to mean that the algorithm is not iterating and invoking an out-of-line strcmp mindful not to repeatedly call strlen preferably returns false immediately if the equality comparison exhausts haystack before needle

4021627
urdu	arabic
so i was looking that i am going to create whole new unicode with my custom made glyph but the problem is that how to manage the joining of letters i mean in arabic there are lots of alphabet joined together and make a word unlike english in which each alphabet is separated from other so now my problem is that there is a unicode define for a urdu alphabet but very same alphabet join with lots of other alphabets how to handle it

getter	setter
these members should be encapsulated with appropriate getter and setter this is just for illustration

4021662
post	get
if you need more help you could post some code in your question and get more direct feedback

4021681
vb.net	vb6
but visual studio 2008 supports vb.net a very different language from vb6

4021779
bmp	png
but be aware that you can t convert from png jpeg bmp to svg that s a one-way street

opera	safari
some time back i actually did do some work on tracing a raster image for some prototype-building of a small web-app find it here mnsfw requires ffx safari opera

4021818
folder	directory
under layout folder i have 2 directory

4021848
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
now this works fine in firefox and google-chrome and none of the apple people have complained to me but opera does a really strange thing it scrolls down to the correct element then pauses very briefly before scrolling all the way up again

4021862
getter	setter
i have been trying to use properties instead of specific setter and getter in my app

4021862
getter	setter
so i am wondering should i just switch to using good old setter and getter

4021862
getter	setter
just wondering whether i would be better off using explicit setter and getter

profiling	debugging
written for the c and c++ developer this tutorial walks you through the steps of designing writing debugging and profiling a parallel application for windows hpc server 2008

4021916

this function works in firefox google-chrome ie9

4021916
opera	firefox
the result of strpatter.test returns false in opera and true in firefox

4021948
width	height
you compare the aspect ratio of the image and the browserwindow look at the difference and then resize the width or height based on how the aspect ratio s are comparing

4021948
width	height
i also gave it percentual width height although that might not be neccesary wanted

4021952
vim	emacs
however if you re just looking for an editor that will show you changes you just made in the last few minutes vim and emacs both have the concept of undo trees that let you visualize the undos and rewrites you ve made in the course of a session

4021956
width	height
i tried setting width and height of relativelayout to be bigger than screen size - it works but only partially if the image is positioned completely off-screen it does not work and if the image is partially visible it is not cropped but that works only for right and bottom sides

4021967
vim	emacs
yes both emacs and vim can do this

4021967
vim	emacs
however i agree with the other answers a version control system would be more appropriate and easier to learn assuming you don t already know emacs or vim

4021971
put	get
i ve been trying to get thrift to work with wp7 but has put it on hold preliminary

4021983
getter	setter
by accident rather than careful choice i use getter and setter and am happy

4022023
pop-up	dialog
instead i would use a pop-up dialog repeating the file name

4022031
temporary	tablespace
the problem was complicated by not being to see any explain plans - but for the query to use up so much temporary tablespace it had to be doing a very ugly join at least partially cartesian before filtering the resultset

4022038
postgresql	mysql
is there a reason why all sqlite3 mysql postgresql driver compiles on mac os x leopard when it is rails 2.3.8 but can t compile when it is rails 3.x

4022040
google-chrome	firefox
bty my code works in firefox and google-chrome

4022042
int	chars
int my_func const chars key

4022089
ubuntu	linux
for linux ubuntu

4022092
hash	md5
you are currently using an md5 hash as a sort of fingerprint but this is unsuitable in this case because slight differences in the input of a good cryptographic hashing function produce very large differences in the hash

4022092
hash	md5
this will mean that two very similar frames will have a totally different md5 hash so from the hash you d never know they were similar

4022184
width	height
i have set in css the height of an image to a certain value and the width modifies automatically so that the aspect ratio is preserved

4022184
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox and internet explorer this works great but in google-chrome and safari the width returned is always 0 for each image

4022206
public	protected
although you can use structures in place of classes but structures lacks the ability to implement access identifiers such as private public protected

4022206
public	protected
if you are using classes just for holding variables you can use structures as well but if your class contains some private protected or public methods or variables properties you can not use structures

4022223
post	get	post	put	put	get
there s nothing wrong with using the same url for different request methods get post put delete head etc

4022257
children	parent
once you have track of parent and children you can force their unloading

4022258
getter	setter
the fact that you currently have only getter and setter doesn t mean anything

4022260
apache	nginx
so my best option is to detect check if server supports x-accel-redirect in case of nginx x-sendfile in case of apache

4022299
config	ini
the format of the config file is free it can be ini xml and so on but the more human-friendly the better

4022300
put	get
it supports sftp and allows synchronize keepuptodate get put and delete on folders and files

4022303
inherited	properties
if you did not explicitly set the control s itemsource properties this exception may be caused by a change in the value of the inherited regionmanager attached properties

4022313
public	protected
if the child s property is protected or public all works fine but if the child s property is private it fails without error just nothing happens

4022313
inherited	properties
usually a private properties should never be accessible from outside so i implemented throwing __set- and __get-methods in my ultimate base class from which all classes inherited

4022326
apache	nginx	passenger	thin	passenger	unicorn	thin	unicorn
but it s more advice to use a web-server apache nginx lighthttp and rack compiliant server passenger thin unicorn

4022352
inherited	properties
private methods and properties cannot be inherited or reached

4022354
maven	pom.xml
the hudson jobs are configured from the maven pom.xml files and the dependency appears on hudson as downstream upstream project

4022359
public	protected
1 do not define public or protected internal protected friend in visual basic constructors in abstract types

4022359
public	protected
in 1 it tells us that not defining internal protected constructors is because that constructors with public or protected internal visibility are for types that can be instantiated

4022369
mef	prism
i have mef prism 4 project for which i can resolve imports via the importingconstructor but not via field imports in the same class

4022373
post	get
i rather interpret this sentence that it should not be possible that a get request on the same url does not cause the same as a post request

4022387
ubuntu	linux
we have a linux module developed by a 3rd party now the module runs correctly on a fedora system but on ubuntu the same fails

4022394
public	protected
in 1 it tells us that not defining internal protected constructors is because that constructors with public or protected internal visibility are for types that can be instantiated

4022394
public	protected
i believe rule 1 is about public and protected internal rule 2 is about protected and internal

4022409
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested it on windows and osx with ie firefox safari and google-chrome

4022434
integer	unsigned
not a valid unsigned integer

4022495
scheme	racket
but the executable i m trying to sign is produced using racket a scheme implementation which assembles a standalone executable from racket scheme code by cloning the real racket executable and editing the mach-o file directly

4022501
int	chars
match the number and convert to int then to chars

4022542
cvs	svn
the first option would be a simple api on top of svn or cvs and use a db backend to track tags uploader comments etc

4022575
width	height
what i want to do is change the size of the popup so it shows my whole calendar but i can t manage to change it... i ve tried using height width minheight minwidth.

4022577
config	ini
perl has modules for many different formats of config file including json and ini

4022589
gridview	sqldatasource
i ve bound a number of gridview to sqldatasource which execute a stored procedure

4022600
stdout	stderr
every process has 3 fd stdin stdout stderr

4022611
width	height
at the moment i have a label being sized correctly using astring sizewithfont constrainedtosize linebreakmode but i ve introduced rotation into my device and with a flexible width and height this results in my uilabel stretching width ways because its set relative to the main view but not then contracting height-wise to compensate for the extra space

4022658
jquery	jqmodal
i m trying to get the jquery jqmodal extension to work as a confirm box as per the example given on the jqmodal website and incoprate this function into a dotnet usercontrol so i can re-use it over the website

4022666
folder	directory
for asp.net application the working directory is the system folder c windows system32

4022775
post	get
i am having a nightmare trying to get this working and have looked at other post but am still having an issue

4022807
post	get
i m not sure with post requests but in get requests you usually use square bracket notation for multi-dimension arrays

4022860
width	height
1 create a view that is 2 screen width 1 screen height

4022871
gif	png
after they select the folder i would like to scan that folder and list all the images jpg png and gif in my windows form application

4022939
vb.net	vb6
basically when i use vb.net or c#.net to do this it works perfectly but when i use vb6 it doesn t work in my for-loop where the relevant service in the relevant device is captured here is the code that returns no result.

4022977
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
i would definitely try to resolve this with composition instead of inherited by associating the needed properties traits to employee instead of subclassing it

4022992
qobject	qwidget
since qsystemtrayicon is a qobject not a qwidget my guess is this is not possible

4022992
kde	gnome
the system tray icon isn t really owned by qt - it s passed on to the desktop i.e whatever part of the gnome kde windows mac is drawing the relevant area

4022992
kde	gnome
for gnome and kde it s a freedesktop.org standard but again i don t think its your process which actually does the drawing and hence there s no way for qt to get events such as drag and drop to you

4023007
range	minimum
range minimum query and lowest common ancestor 1

4023084
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome ie8 safari firefox etc it looks fine

4023134
sorting	filtering
the following article deals with the filtering and sorting

4023159
for-loop	arrays
it does not have a predetermined limit to the number of iterations in the for-loop which means that the stringa and stringb arrays could continue to grow in size while this code is running

4023184
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i want to fade in some images after the background image has load so thanks for the explanation all is working well on firefox safari and google-chrome

4023215
int	chars
note that if the length of the string is odd second will have one more chars than first due to the rounding in the int division.

4023219
ubuntu	linux
it doesn t seem to be entirely reliable though yi jiang can t get it to work on a tft using ubuntu linux

4023264
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
2 cos -1 w 2 sin -1 sqrt x 2 +y 2 +z 2

4023264
cos	sqrt
and if we plug in w sqrt 1 - 0 + 1 + 0 your unit quaternion is 0 0 1 0 and it will rotate by angle 2 cos -1 0 2 90 degrees 180 degrees or pi radians.

4023270
versioning	upgrade
or did you initially use the express versioning but upgrade to full vs because of a feature lacking

4023270
getter	setter
edit not having encapsulate field in express used to be annoying though though the introduction of automatic getter and setter has pretty much canceled that out i think

4023294
uicontrol	uibutton
i realise i could use uicontrol but that s considerably more work since i need to handle the label subview myself and get the artist to produce highlighted versions of the artwork - uibutton is doing all that nicely if i could only disable the well effect

4023316
int	chars
there s exist function calloc in standard c library for your case it inits allocated area with 0 s which corresponds to chars short int long 0 0.0 and null

4023335
implements	extends
this means that i need to extends the test for error modes with my own methods for propagating these errors and then i start questioning whether i should just implements something completely different and not go for the idataerrorinfo interface at all

4023346
wmv	flv
my client ask videos must be no longer than 2 minutes and in either quicktime wmv mp4 or flv format.

4023358
super	extends
extends the notion if you write super it refers to constructor of the base class and if you write this it refers to the constructor of the very class where you are writing this code

4023367
public	protected
super allows you to access public protected method attributes of parent base class

4023409
memcpy	memmove
also the reason memmove and memcpy are provided by the compiler is that they are sometimes written in tuned assembly for the target cpu using a specialized instruction

4023496
post	get
now i don t want the user to be able to enter their login details through a get request so how can i check that a certain param is either a get or post parameter

4023500
codeigniter	cakephp
some frameworks you can have a look cakephp codeigniter zend framework symfony

4023502
sorting	filtering
and helpers for most specific tasks closer to the action like sorting filtering pagination json encoding pdf download avoiding duplication of code in many actions

4023503
unsigned	short
for example is there a size_t alternative to unsigned short

4023538
post	get
in rails you don t have specific post or get parameters

4023538
post	get
you do have a post or get request

4023538
put	get
or you can check for other http verbs get put and delete

4023550
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
there are other libraries that do archiving the proper way and are faster easier to use and with ore features dotnetzip and sharpziplib

4023558
google-chrome	firefox
while this code works perfectly on firefox and google-chrome it doesn t seem to work on ie8

4023563
memcpy	memmove
you can t implement either memcpy or memmove all that efficiently in portable code because the platform-specific implementation is likely to kick your butt whatever you do

4023647
post	get
maybe use http post instead http get to hide these parameters

4023654
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
i then set my form to inherited from that subclassing and the properties now display in the properties box

4023672
hash	hmac	hash	salt
if you re concerned about replay attacks you could use an hmac to validate cookie session requests by having the session id datetime username if that s part of your data maybe ip address in a string followed by a one-way salt hash of this data

4023694
implements	extends
the point is i don t want to force client s classes like person to implements my own interface or to extends my own class

4023701
google-chrome	firefox
after some debugging i think it s the xmlhttprequest status property when i try to alert this status in the corresponding javascript function ie shows an exclamationsign at the leftbottom corner with some vague not further defined error message while in ie8 firefox and google-chrome this is no problem at all

4023707
apache	nginx
i wound up with nginx serving static resources and proxying framework requests to apache and mod_python -- if i recall correctly my app had a mod_python dependency

4023707
apache	nginx
proxying nginx to apache assumes you already have apache serving django successfully so maybe not so useful for you

4023726
google-chrome	firefox
not elegant as what google-chrome or firefox offer but it will still work

4023731
x509certificate	bouncycastle
i have looked at x509certificate2 and also the bouncycastle x509certificate classes but can t see how to get the key size

4023744
public	protected
since that dependency is invoked through it s public facing interface by foo you stub the method that triggers the protected method within the dependency

4023744
implements	extends
if however there is no dependency but the call to the api is made from the testclass then you have to write a custom class that extends your testclass and implements it s own api calling function

4023752
implements	extends
putting it in a webview is what will make this tricky if it were just a regular view i would say extends textview and implements onlongclicklistener for it as well

4023774
hide	show
i am spending a lot for my time for a simple things i think.i want to hide and show a sprite

4023795
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can do this either with the httpwebrequest or webclient classes depending on your specific needs

4023834
width	height
here is an example of using a div 100 width + height containing an img tag to use as the background might be worth a look

4023843
post	get
i will post a tutorial as soon as i get a spare weekend

4023860
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
in the didreceivememorywarning you should also free as much data as you can - if you store some part of data model in viewcontroller release it and reconstruct in viewdidload that would be called when your view is loaded again when user navigates back to this controller

4023876
width	height
the box s height and width will vary as the browser is resized

4023886
getter	setter
other than that i see no other way but to assign the atomic pk properties to member variables in one or several different entityhome components of course requiring entityhome subclasses with resprective getter and setter

4023888
versioning	upgrade
initially the mysql code was written for 5.0.51a and the running mysql versioning it was somehow attempted to be upgrade was 5.0.21

4023910
jobs	cron
edit the production servers can now set a 10 minute timeout on urlfetches initiated from taskqueue or cron jobs so these objections might not apply anymore

4023922
equals	gethashcode
you can overcome this by overriding equals and gethashcode

4023932
post	get
but then above that i m trying to get an if asking whether there are any post within a custom post type that i ve defined

4023972
textview	imageview
this isn t working as my screen is not refreshing after each textview or imageview change thus as soon as i hit start game the game appears to freeze being due to the method never ending and i am therefore unable to click said buttons

4023980
portrait	landscape
i need to increase my orientation speed while i do the orientation landscape portrait portrait upsidedown landscape left landscape right

4023980
portrait	landscape
i have two controller landscape and portrait while orientation i just call the method for orientation and load the method

4024005
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectinputstream and objectoutputstream used for serialization

4024046
maven	pom.xml
i got an error in hudson console out saying the build fail because maven release plugin cannot update pom.xml version while there are still unresolved files

4024102
google-chrome	firefox
i ve run into a problem where on firefox and google-chrome the slider bar it s horizontal seems to move up into the div when sliding it and thus hiding the slider

4024102
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to do this only in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8 something actually works in ie

4024111
getter	setter
provided you don t wanna use the getter setter methods

4024153
h.264	webm
although the html5 video specs don t define what codecs should be used currently browsers only support h.264 and webm

4024201
int	boolean
which also brings the question can you multiply a boolean value times a int although i am not sure the type that is returned from 2 n is it an int or unsigned..etc

4024211
getter	setter
and provide a getter and setter function so it can be accessed from outside

4024223
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox and google-chrome but in ie

4024239
google-chrome	safari
the google-chrome developer tools are a direct descendant of the safari webkit developer tools

4024287
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
if you re doing this for a public website get firefox 3 google-chrome opera ie6 ie7 and ie8 and test it with each of them

4024301
perforce	svn
what concepts etc in perforce are different from svn in ways that are likely to give me problems

4024319
google-chrome	firefox
the button print and the zoom option only is showed in ie browser but i need it showing in google-chrome and firefox too

4024342
versioning	upgrade
you ll only find yourself in a world of hurt browsers get upgrade to implement features and your user agent sniff might still exclude them user agent strings can be spoofed and good old opera likes to report itself as internet explorer in older versioning

4024389
mp3	wav
i have a song in mp3 or wav and i want to accelerate the speed of it while playing it

4024444
button	checkbox
first i pretty sure the checkbox won t ever fire the repeater_itemcommand event as it is not a button or something that inheriets from button as only button create the itemcommand event inside a repeater

4024506
setinterval	settimeout
found some explanation on how settimeout and setinterval works to see which is best for your purpose

4024528
mp4	webm
however yes for viewer convenience most video-sharing sites do convert uploaded files into flv orâ these days more likelyâ mp4 which plays on recent flash players as well as some html5 implementations possibly with ogv or webm as well for html5 browsers that don t implement mp4 for licensing reasons

4024570
width	height
using the map.panto method i can pan to them but the animation only works if the second point is less than the width height of the map

4024618
int	boolean
for n and number of user-defined int or floating point types suitable definitions and type conversions may be required the key point here is the boolean pos construct which ada guarantees will give you a 0 or 1 for the predefined boolean type.

4024646
ssl	https
is it true to say any time a user logs into a site and isn t redirected to ssl tls https connection that the session cookies are vulnerable

4024655
put	get
here is some example approach if you get data fragments and you have to put these fragments together to a whole message

4024719
client-side	server-side
there s no direct way to access variables in client-side code from your server-side code

4024727
rss	feed
i m looking to retrieve json from a third-party website and convert it into a valid rss xml feed

4024771
rss	feed
i m using the argotic syndacation framework to write an rss feed and i ve found a strange behaviour that may be a bug

4024803
mouseover	mouseout
upon hovering over any of the items and the all li selection items there should be a mouseover mouseout background change

4024803
mouseover	mouseout
if an item is selected then there should be no hover state of mouseover mouseout

4024806
int	chars
i am new in c++ programming and i have been trying to convert from const chars to unsigned int with no luck

4024815
onkeyup	onkeydown
set an onkeyup or onkeydown event on your textarea the latter is better because it fires before the new line is added to the textarea

4024827
folder	directory
i have also considered using a batch file to create the mappings and do the copy but i wasn t sure how easily it would be to accomplish because the folder to copy from will not always be the same - it will always be within one directory but the subdirectory name changes

4024829
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

4024830
inherited	properties
out of the box you may be able to inherited from webcontrol and change the tagname properties to return a script tag but out of the box i don t think what you are asking to do is possible with intellisense support

4024850
strtol	atoi
or good old c functions atoi and strtol

4024855
pull	push
my workflow is to work in a branch and pull from the remote into local master then rebase my working branch merge the branch with local master then push to the remote repo

4024859
mouseup	mousedown
it stores the selection range s or textrange ie 8 in the mousedown event of the element and reselects those ranges in the mouseup event

4024868
int	chars
atoi function will convert const chars to int which can be implicitly converted to unsigned

4024873
children	parent
but it s better to just add a certain class to your parent element and then use normal css to style the children

4024908
post	get
i feel this may be the solution to my problem as later in the post it shows pixel manipulation of the image but i don t quite get what exactly it means by context.drawimage is allowed for copying areas from images hosted on other domains and it would be really helpful if someone could clarify it for me

4024910
integer	unsigned
or if charval is the pointer to the first byte of an unsigned integer then

4024957
mousemove	mouseenter
you cannot get the mouseenter|mouseover event for a part of a element that is below another element but if you know the dimensions and the position of the element you can listen for mousemove event and get when the mouseenter in some particular area

4024981
button	checkbox
i ve got 3 groups of radio button and 1 set of checkbox

4025014
qmainwindow	qwidget
qwidget does not have a clicked signal and qmainwindow does not have an exit slot

4025016
pygtk	pycairo
it seems installing activepython the installing gtk runtime pycairo pyobject pygtk as administrator with compatibility mode for windows xp service pack 2 solved the problem

4025018
subtraction	multiplication
which clearly shows the multiplication is performed before the subtraction

4025020
width	height

provided the customvalidatorproxy is before the customvalidator in the validatorcollection of the page then the servervalidate handler will override the isvalid property value that the customvalidatorproxy would have returned having validated the controltovalidate value and your errormessage from your customvalidator will be displayed in the validationsummary

on the other hand i found aforge a lot friendlier and easier to use since you can easily adjust the processing parameters from a gui not so fast easy to do in matlab simulink

hash	md5
in that case some hash functions are somewhat faster than other md5 being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle

4025516
hash	md5
first you will like to use one of the cryptographically unbroken hash function hence sha-256 or sha-512 not md4 md5 or sha-1 the weaknesses found in md4 md5 and sha-1 might not apply to a specific situation but this is a subtle matter and it is better to play safe

2 am i right to assume that since the static assert inside connector template class is instantiating has_foo with int int double signature then the single-parameter and parameterless specializations should not be instantiated

4026839
getter	setter
i m not really sure what is a good practice to cover setter and getter or not

4026839
getter	setter
if yes i m not sure how because to verify the setter method you need to call the getter for this variable and vice versa

4026839
getter	setter
where i went is just similar tests for setter and getter

4026858
getter	setter
if your getter and setter are simply getting and setting a backing variable then writing unit tests for them does not provide much value as you are essentially testing that the language and compiler are doing what they are supposed to

4026862
getter	setter
if you care about coverage metrics setter and getter can kill you

4026862
getter	setter
for example if you are testing a dao you can use the setter and getter when you write you testsave method.

4026862
getter	setter
to make life easier you might be able to write a reflection based test utility to test setter and getter

4026912
getter	setter
getter and setter are trivial to code and are often generated for you by your ide

4026921
getter	setter
if you practice tdd test-driven design the setter and getter will emerge only as you have a need for them - you don t just automatically create them up front just in case

overloaded functions in the c++ standard library often hide this fact so maybe an example from c will be more useful putchar takes a single character so only n is correct whereas puts and printf take a string and in that case only n is correct

google-chrome	firefox
with the latest version of google-chrome the hotkey is the same as firefox on mac it s shift-command-del

4028597
firefox	safari

4028616

you may want to look at things like dlopen and dlsym -- for manually accessing dynamic libraries.

4028616

i verified that this function does indeed get called before the pagerequestmanager begins its dirty work so i was able to put my calls to removenonessentialpostbackvalues in there

4028928
lisp	scheme
this is of course subjective but i think learning common lisp or standard scheme is generally more useful just for the simple fact that you then will not be limited to one compiler

4028949
ubuntu	linux

4028967
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i was loading up an array from a database in viewdidload that would populate the components but i was calling to reload the picker from viewwillappear meaning that the array that provided the datasource was not reloaded at the same time as the picker and thus not reflecting changed values

4028983
google-chrome	firefox
as mentioned by jnpcl it is possible to create a google-chrome uri within the browser but as i understand it that requires a full-fledged firefox add-on rather than just a greasemonkey script

if this is the case and you re developing pages with asp.net you could be using the standard asp.net ajax tools a scriptmanager and an updatepanel although an awful lot of people prefer to use jquery

4029247
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
aggregate-functions ie count min max sum etc only operate on the value s supplied in case you re combining the value of two or more columns before the aggregate-functions is applied -- other columns are only a guaranteed relationship if the columns not mentioned in aggregate-functions are stated in the group by clause

4029280

the functions in os.path seem to be acting as though they were case-insensitive but the open function seems to be case-sensitive

4029992
allocator	stl
if your solution to this problem is to use std vector from the stl they use dynamic memory allocator behind the scenes

4029996
int	double
you should create a method you ve called it fractionsums here and invoke it to calculate the fraction sum and return a double pass the int n to the method

4029996
int	double
that method can be either recursive or iterative but since you say i need to write a method where the parameter accepts an int n in this case and returns the sum of the first n terms of the sequence you should make the method return something either a float or a double

from my understanding the x server is what makes all the visuals possible and atop that there are the various ui environments like kde gnome and others

4035983

note though that that regex.getgroupnames also considers 0 to be a grouping the entire match so you may need to filtering that out if you don t want it

4037461
width	height
get the full width and height of the screen and create a new window set to the appropriate width and height and with everything disabled

4037461
width	height
create a canvas inside of that new window setting the width and height of the canvas to the width - 10px and the height - 20px to allow for the bar and the edges of the window

4037557
mp3	flv
the user clicks on a row - jquery takes the file name in first cell and changes the extension to flv mp3 - checks if there is a file with the new name - if there is a file it creates an image link to that file

4037557
mp3	flv
i worked hard on this code but now the client want that the event meaning that the image links that show if there is a file with the flv mp3 will occur on page load

4037575
google-chrome	safari
turns out it was the display inline property on the div in the li that interferes with the display in google-chrome and safari

4037588
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to at least versioning 106 if possible

4037588
versioning	upgrade
i think the if-test versioning testing specifically for versioning that each upgrade routine can handle reads better

4037618
salt	md5
i have always made my authentication codes by checking if the md5 + salt of the pass provided by the user in the form was the same as the one stored in the db and if it was i saved a session variable called status equal to 1

4037698
hide	show
what you really want to do in this switch statement is call another function that show or hide the options in another dropdown

4037698
hide	show
you know how to set the options of a select element and or show hide page elements right

4037714
post	get
these are kind of high-volume but people do post their to-do lists and stuff so by just listening you d get a better idea about the state of a certain boost library

4037777
postgresql	mysql
does mysql has the interval datatype as postgresql or like timespan in .net does

4037829
post	get
this would translate into a http get or post method containing something like

4037830
setinterval	settimeout
when you run setinterval or settimeout an event is generated which is then added to the browser s execution queue

4037880
jobs	cron
and if i run it at night and set the cron jobs to be like 4hrs apart i start to get even more emails sent thought i havent had a chance to see if this is due to multiple threads method calls

4037911
int	chars
i can t tell what seems to be the standard way of doing things if there is one and whether or not there are types like chars or int or whatever already built in

4037919
ilist	icollection
define a class which implements ilist and which has a constructor which takes a valuecollection or icollection

4037980
hide	show
you can show hide each row and you can show hide the details within that list row

4037991
prepare	pdostatement
if the database server successfully prepares the statement pdo prepare returns a pdostatement object

4038000
opera	firefox
this answer provides a solution that works in ie firefox opera and webkit

4038011
hide	show
it is just a simple hide and show on another div

4038014
versioning	upgrade
you should just have a collection of objects each with the upgrade code and a versioning number

4038014
versioning	upgrade
you simply iterate over that collection while the versioning number is your target versioning and call the upgrade code on that object for each one

4038044
width	height
also these rectangles must be able to follow my rectangle property settings like height width color...put them in one line at the end

4038070
width	height
event.type 22 one or more of following changed width height x y

4038070
width	height
event.type 22 restore after maximized due to change in width and height

4038076
post	get
the form method get post

4038096
cck	ubercart
this is easily accomplished via cck and ubercart either creating directly the product in ubercart or creating the content-type with cck and a product with the same machine name in ubercart

4038100
put	get
you d overwrite the afterreceiverequest to look for your relevant certain data. if no certain data then put the copy back into the message body and go away otherwise you might want to raise an event or throw an exception that your code would catch and then go get that other page.

4038104
ant	maven
i recommend both over the other solutions since ant style globbing has pretty much become the standard glob syntax in the java world hudson spring ant and i think maven

4038116
memcached	apc
normally one solves this duality between 1 performance of static files and 2 data integrity of a database by storing data in a database for integrity and using one of the many possibilities of storing prerendered results in cache be it flat files apc memcached and the like

4038116
memcached	apc
storing caches in another location so memory as the mentioned apc memcached or flat files would be the way to go if your process project doesn t depend on the latest available data forums blogs reviews etc. who cares about a couple of seconds lag

4038177
google-chrome	firefox
but when i try it in firefox or google-chrome the results are missing values

4038177
google-chrome	firefox
here is the output in firefox and google-chrome

4038183
opera	firefox
i have problem with clearing session only in ie browser i ve tested in different version ie iis 6 and 7 - it works good in firefox and opera

4038183
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera everything is all right

4038190
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in google-chrome safari firefox and opera so i know it s not just an internet explorer wonky bug

4038273
google-chrome	firefox
so for your alternatives including firefox and google-chrome are correct in setting the failed capture to undefined

4038294
client-side	server-side
session is server-side but ie is client-side that s not going to be the problem

4038319
getter	setter
i have spoken many times before in regards to storing objects and scope issues and the best way i know of to over come this is by using a static abstract class with getter and setter that can help you transport objects around your application and save you having to modify classes so that you can specifically import objects for usage

4038349
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the datepicker does not render

4038412
post	get
if you need the cookies fro a different domain to be set to a client visitor you ll have to get them there which essentially means they will have to do the post doing it with curl from you own server still leaves you with no way to set the cookies

4038412
post	get
sure you can post from your own server what you like but it won t do a lick of good as long as you cannot get the cookie information to the client which you can t due to browser security privacy issues

4038420
packets	pcap
the general idea is use regular socket in order to tell kernel to send igmp join packets and after use pcap in order to capture packets

4038443
xmonad	cabal-install
if you installed them with cabal-install by running cabal install xmonad then just re-run that command

4038443
xmonad	cabal-install
if this is the case your best option to get something working quickly might be to uninstall xmonad and xmonad-contrib then re-install them using cabal-install

4038453
public	protected
one approach is to have a protected overridable method and then have a public non-overridable method which calls the overridable one

4038466
width	height
now i d like to add dynimc layout management so when i call dolayout on the outer most panel internal widgets and panels rearrange according device s width and height

4038470
maven	m2e
behind the scenes the m2e plugin somehow generates a run configuration that contains the maven dependencies classpath container like the following

4038470
maven	m2e
my best guess is that the maven dependencies classpath container is added through some extension point being used by the m2e plugin

4038546
postgresql	mysql
asterisk makes it easy to select a destination database for your cdr s and has a myriad of different database options mysql postgresql

4038551
switching	screens
however when i put this application on my phone nexus one it doesn t switching to the new activity when i touch the screens after i take a picture

4038579
jsf	wicket
is there way i can combine a jsf component and a wicket component in the same web page

4038579
jsf	wicket
i have a menu bar component created in wicket and a form component is created in jsf

4038580
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
but of course the only availability on the surface for element access is getelementbyid getelementfrompoint and getelementsbytagname

4038587
post	get
you should post it with ajax this will stop it from changing the page and you will still get the information back

4038606
maven	pom.xml
maven parent pom.xml vs modules pom.xml

4038607
postgresql	mysql
i was hoping for an experience similar to working with mysql or postgresql but no such luck

4038607
postgresql	mysql
hibernate currently connected to postgresql and mysql

4038611
implements	modifiers
however in the recent versions of c# its kind of possible to work around this limitation for a generic class collection by implements a generic interface whose type parameter has an out modifiers on it

4038618
opera	firefox
this occurs in both firefox and opera

4038622
centos	linux
i run a dv 3.5 server on mediatemple with linux centos 5 php and mysql db and am trying to encrypt phone records with aes

4038630
stdout	stderr
with this interface you can pass messages to the child s stdin and read from the child s stdout and stderr handles

4038636
ssl	https
i am trying to access an https web service that uses ssl cert authentication using ruby eventmachine but i am not getting it to work

4038636
ssl	https
i have also tried sending the request to gmail without the ssl option plain https without cert and that works outputting status code 200 the headers and the body

4038650
post	get
it is normal for a php application to post back to the same page as it can not only process the post request but it can generate an updated page based on the original get but with the new information from the post

4038651
rss	feed
i know jfeed is rather outdated and no longer supported but firefox seems to be the only browser that is having an issue parsing an rss feed using this setup

4038654
min	max
or do i just need to redeclare the scale and min max values somehow

4038655
width	height
all you need to do is set the width and height attributes to be the size of the canvas dynamically

4038655
width	height
so you use css to make it stretch over the entire browser window then you have a little function in javascript which measures the width and height and assigns them

4038655
width	height
the width and height attributes of the element determine how many pixels it uses in it s internal rendering buffer

4038655
width	height
browser will only stretch the graphics if the width and height attributes disagree with the actual real world pixel width and height

4038658
scrollable	panels
i have implemented scrollable extjs tab panels in our product

4038676
width	height
it s worth noting that the width and height attributes of canvas are not like the old school img width and height attributes

4038688
decoder	encoder
otoh if you can develop an encoder decoder for the codec of interest it should be relatively simple to get jmf to use it - jmf supports new codecs via the spi

4038748
accessor	properties
after that you can invoke the properties accessor

4038752
int	boolean
i assume you meant to ask why it didn t return int not boolean

4038763
bash	zsh
in bash or zsh

4038792
ant	maven
use ant or maven for your builds

4038811
salt	md5
if i used md5 to generate the api key from the resource id user id and a salt it might look something like this .

4038821
ant	maven
if you are invoking junit from ant maven or some similar build tool then make sure you have the appropriate jar files in the classpath

4038853
post	get
to answer the question at the end of your post no you cannot get by without it -- at least without writing a new frontend theme that reimplements everything from scratch which nobody so far seems to have been able to do

4038858
wxpython	textctrl
i am trying to disable the context menu in a textctrl widget under wxpython prevent the context menu from coming up when right clicked

4038877
put	get
as i can only imagine one halfway good reason for what you need the innerhtml put it somewhere else into the document for copying i would suggest to use the dom-method to get the copy clonenode true and also use a dom-method which one depends on where to put to inject it into the dom

4038907
uiview	uitouch
in the new uiviewcontroller set the uiview background to transparent using interface builder you can override the uitouch hit test by throwing in this

4038936
post	get
i m trying to get a video flv or an swf video player to work on facebook walls however no matter what i do - facebook post the raw fbml and ignores the code

4038970
listview	gridview
i think the best for you would be to set the view property of your listview to a gridview

4038987
disk	ram
perhaps your computer does not have enough ram and or disk space

4039007
min	max
consider the differences of the two environments gc in jetty consider tuning you min and max memory threshold to the same size and later proceed to execute your test

4039024
implements	extends
p.s if it s needed the the class extends surfaceview and implements surfaceholder.callback

4039089
spaces	delimiter
pretty typical stuff in the log file and it is spaces delimiter date time url http code ip user agent etc

4039144
ienumerable	ilist
why such classes exist and are used instead of generic ienumerable s ilist s

4039146
punctuation	words
i went ahead and expanded the characters to split on to get the actual words devoid of punctuation

4039171
pull	push
when you use the -r x option with push pull or clone

4039196
getter	setter
so that you ll have the getter and setter created

4039219
width	height
so my strategy is to make the background color of the body red and grab only the shadow in photoshop with a width of 47px and a height of 1px

4039226
stdout	stderr
- i ve long thought that a suitable workaround should be possible using windows process structures which have a readable stdout and stderr as a well as a writable stdin

4039249
disk	ram
it is pretty much like in ram but on disk dead memory

4039305
post	get
i found the code where it displays either or however i m not exactly sure how to combine the two together and get a list of a set of post and pages together

4039323
ord	chr
for your int_to_bin function you ll probably what to make use of the function chr code which returns the character with the character code of code opposite of ord

4039328
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in safari ie google-chrome

4039349
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this javascript works in firefox 3.6 ie 8 safari 4 and google-chrome 3.1

4039355
uiview	subviews
when you pass setweather you are actually calling it on self.view main view of your view controller which is a uiview not on the mainview subviews of self.view

4039360
hide	show
i think it would be easier if some how you could make it so instead of view.gone you can choose what items to show and hide the rest

4039407
opensso	openam
i realize there are a number of sources on how to get openldap set up under ubuntu or how to configure data stores for openam formerly opensso

4039407
opensso	openam
this page link dead describes a list of ldif files to import that it suggests are distributed with opensso but alas not all of them seem to be in the available downloads from forgerock maintainers of openam

4039428
button	checkbox
i m particularly interested in radio button checkbox and select lists

4039442
put	get
so i have tried to put nstimer in the calculatesteps method and also in that while loop but couldn t get to work

4039461
opera	firefox
i understand how to create css3 round corners in firefox webkit however how would one create them in opera purely with css3

4039474
free	malloc
a well-written c program will spend so little time in malloc free that the overhead is not even measurable

4039501
put	get
you know how to iterate through the string and get the characters why put them into an array just to iterate through them again

4039542
int	chars
i haven t done much programing in many languages but i know in c ++ you have to declare a variable type int chars etc

4039543
folder	directory
and you will see a new folder in the current directory on your hard drive with everything in the project in that folder

4039594
int	boolean
private static boolean hasnoduplicates int digitslist

4039594

int	boolean
public static boolean solvepuzzle int grid int emptycells int numemptycells

4039655
maven	cargo
i am migrating from maven s jetty plugin to the cargo plugin cargo-maven2-plugin because cargo will happily run wars from dependent maven modules

4039676
processors	hyperthreading
as is pointed out on the wiki page nob provided to cite hyperthreading requires not only that the operating system support multiple processors but also that it be specifically optimised for htt and intel recommends disabling htt when using operating systems that have not been so optimized. meaning in most cases just hardwired processors basic scheduler is not enough to take advantage of multiple cores it has to be supported used by sw os support

4039708
children	parent
i have already deleted the children so there are parent that are childless

4039708
children	parent
this isn t any kind of production need i was just messing around with some test code and deleted some children now i want to delete their sad parent

4039712
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is code only compatibility ie firefox but not working google-chrome and safari

4039715
google-chrome	firefox
this is work in firefox 3.6.1 but in google-chrome 7.0.517.41 the submit button do nothing

4039755
git-rebase	amend
you could totally fake this by doing an interactive git-rebase specifying that you want to edit all those commits and amend them with merge commits

4039782
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
in short do not implement the 3 subclassing the inherited approach what will happen if you need 2 or 3 additional common properties methods down the road

4039818
uiview	calayer
unless you specify otherwise by scaling or using a transform etc. a generic uiview uses a calayer backed by such a bitmap

4039878
profiling	debugging
the default iphone developer profiling under automatic profiling selector is usually the code signing identity to select for a debugging or release device test build unless you are testing iap which requires a non-wildcard app id

4039946
post	get
that will work for either get or post requests

4039950
google-chrome	firefox
you can check that with google-chrome using a right-click inspect ressources or under firefox using firebug

4039979
std	ostream
project 4 forest.h|14|warning friend declaration std ostream operator std ostream const forest declares a non-template function|

4039981
dictionary	map
we re trying to map a parent child relationship and i suggested using the parentid as the dictionary key and the dictionary value as the custom object

4039981
children	parent
we will usually be needing to iterate over all parent children and run down the list

4039988
post	get
in addition to the other post comments even if you do get a unique object identifer if you don t create a reference to that object somewhere other than in the hash key the object might fall out of scope get garbage collected and become inaccessable

4040056
std	ostream
you cast a socket handle of type int to a reference to a std ostream in order to avoid compiler warnings errors when you tried to hand it to flush

4040056
libevent	epoll
or you use select poll kqueue epoll libevent etc

4040062
zen-cart	magento
use cms zen-cart or os-commerce and if have good command on oops use magento

4040076
int	chars
writes an int into memory with only room for a chars

4040099
textarea	textbox
editing the more simple nodes will require only a single textbox or textarea

4040133
ant	maven
if you re planning on continuing with java for more advanced projects however consider using maven or ant for building your project

4040143
int	chars
and i wonder whether some platform will complain as c is a chars and may not be at an int boundary.

4040179
mouseup	mousedown
i get around this issue by using an instead of a and using javascript to modify the image shown when the mousedown and mouseup events is triggered

4040229
webclient	webrequest
can i use like webclient or webrequest i dont know to do the following

4040234
fflush	gets
the data sometimes gets cached before it s actually written to disk in a buffer fflush causes what s in the buffer to be written to disk

4040247
client-side	server-side
these include client-side javascript and server-side validation logic

4040255
sorting	filtering
also this isn t sorting more of a filtering - you get some of the elements but in the same order

4040300
children	parent
what if the element flex you re looking for is several parent up in a sibling and then several children down

4040300
children	parent
iterate through parent and parent parent until you find a stop point find the sibling and iterate through children and their children until you find your target

4040322
scipy	scikits
thanks for the scikits and scipy

4040348
min	max
if you want any term replace min with max and if you want a specific term use the updated version of vegard

4040373
mbunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	nunit	mstest
you need a testing framework like mbunit gallio xunit.net nunit or mstest to drive watin and also to read data from an excel-sheet this xls thing is easiest with xunit.net because it has an extra attribute to utilize excel data

4040404
awt	swing
doesn t support awt or swing

4040412
int	chars
chars bytes sizof int

4040425
width	height
because the div has no content no height and no width it is rendered as being 0x0 pixels so there is no space to display the image in

4040463
retaincount	dealloc
if you want to get retaincount from objets you already released you should check out nszombieenabled which will cause objects to be released but not dealloc ed

4040547
width	height
i have an image named a.png width 40 height 20 for iphone 3 ipod and a 2x.png width 80 height 40 for iphone 4

4040617
min	max
for c you have to use min max avg count .

4040633
post	get
this would probably be the easiest solution since even if you can get post and pages in sql you might have a hard time ordering them since post don t have a menu order while you wouldn t like pages ordered by publish date

4040672
textview	imageview
for simplistic reasons let s say you have a layout for a list row with both an imageview and a textview

4040687
superclass	subclassing
if as you say you have a superclass and a subclassing where the run method is overidden you can just rely on late binding and the proper method will be invoked automatically

4040692
rubymine	radrails
in last 3 months i have tried radrails netbeans and rubymine and finally settled on rubymine not so much for features but for responsiveness and stability reasons

4040744
accessor	properties
is required in the properties accessor

4040745
mouse	keyboard
alright i am not sure if this is even possible with java specifically but i am working on a a small program very similar to synergy and i need to be able to completely disable input from the mouse and keyboard on the host computer but still record the input within the program

4040768
ienumerable	ilist
in general you should - however there are times especially when writing library code when it is not possible or certainly not convenient to know about the calling type even in terms of t so non-generic types mainly interfaces such as ilist ienumerable are very useful

4040784
pull	push
the reason why you can t connect file source async to mpeg-2 demux is that the file source operates in pull mode and the mpeg-2 demux only supports ts in push mode

4040797
int	chars
there is no reason to cast int or chars back and forth like that

4040797
int	chars
the address of a chars to an int

4040813
freeglut	glew
i am trying to use geometry shaders in my opengl application that is currently using freeglut and i am trying to use glew to do that because as i understand it the geometry shader functionality is in an extension

4040915
disk	ram
vertical pretty much means bigger computers - more ram cpu faster disk etc.

4040937
public	protected
all protected and public methods and constants and in very very seldom cases - protected fields of your abstract class become a part of your api

versioning	upgrade
i was running sql server 2008 and recently upgrade it to versioning r2

4040983
hide	show
i have a js component which has functions progresson and progressoff to show hide a progress bar

shadowing	named
it may help in rare cases where you introduce a named shadowing problem later without noticing - all of a sudden you re calling the wrong function or accessing the wrong variable

4041029
hide	show
the above code would simply hide and show the various content areas when the various links are clicked

looks like teamcity does only replace the call to nant contrib msbuild task

4041172
post	get
i have to deploy a webapp on tomcat 6.0.24 serving some webservices that should be accessed with rest-style methods not fully rest since the used flex class httpservice can just send get and post

i m modifying a tree view of some relationships we have i ve managed with help to get the checkbox ticking the children of itself but what i m attempting to do now is by clicking the plus next to each parent display the relevant child levels

4041306
hash	md5
i d agree with moving away from md5 but also maybe stretching the hash by repeating it a few times

4041340
mouseleave	mouseenter
some way its logical because every of the two elements button and list are subscribed to two events mouseenter and mouseleave

4041340
setinterval	clearinterval	mouseout	mouseenter
mouseenter provides a clearinterval mouseout provides a setinterval

4041358

gdi	direct2d
a direct2d is slower than gdi

4055456
bitblt	direct2d	bitblt	gdi	gdi	direct2d

4056345
gridview	sqldatasource
then you don t have to add the buttons and the images in the code and takecare of adding them each time the row is created you just need to fetch the data from the database and set the datasource of the gridview and i think you can also get rid of the code fetching the data and replace it with a sqldatasource

4056382
put	get
and likely then only if you don t plan to put a sim in it or already have one with a suitable data plan beware carrier habits of forcing plan upgrades because at least in the us carriers don t usually give any discount for not buying a phone so if here you might as well get something recent on sale for 99 since you are going to pay the true value of it in inflated monthly charges even if you provide your own phone

google-chrome	safari
i am attempting to make a web browser object in c# which support html5 as good as safari or google-chrome

mouse	keyboard
obviously i have to make changes to the world matrix based on the mouse and keyboard movements and hence i should somehow handle the appropriate mouseevents and keyboardevens

4056982

if it helps this is a graph database implementation and i need a prompt just like any other database client mysql postgresql etc.

4057924
implements	extends
my opinion of c++ iostreams has improved substantially over time particularly after i started to actually extends them by implements my own stream classes

4057924
serializable	deserialization
they could be used solely as serializable deserialization facilities to translate c++ objects into portable byte sequences

4057927
put	get
i m guessing its because im trying to put quotes directly inside the single quotes how can i get around this for situations like this

the idea is that a get to all-posts returns a list of the urls of every post object and the client uses those urls to interact with the resources

4057938
put	get
i simply want to get the list of competitions and put them into a list i have setup

4057941
innodb	myisam
if i understood your question properly then you could use one of the following two methods innodb vs myisam

4057941
innodb	myisam
personally i d take the innodb road as i m a fan of clustered indexes which myisam doesnt support and i prefer performance over how many lines of code i need to type but the decision is yours.

4057944
put	get
i am looking for advice on how to go about writing a small and simple application that will receive http get and http put request process the data simple text files and respond

4057955
post	get
might be a great way to get the uri s of the 3rd page of oldest post

4057955
post	put
put and especially post methods should really use simple uri s with the resource that will be affected in only the path portion

4057985
execvp	fork
i wrote a code in c c++ which fork a child process duplicates the stdin stdout into a pipe ends and calls execvp

4057985
stdout	fflush
in the parent process i don t see the line enter any key - it will be fflush only after the program calls exit which auto fflush the stdout buffer or an explicit call to fflush stdout is added

4058033
uigesturerecognizer	uiresponder
in uiresponder or uigesturerecognizer classes according to your target os

4058037

installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade your postgres installation if it is within the same versioning eg 9.1 -- 9.2 but you would require a new install for different versioning eg 8.4 -- 9.1 but then you can easily dump your tables and restore them into the new install

4058179
width	height
a solution that usually works is to wrap the whole content in an absolute positioned div with 100 height and width and customize the scrollbars of that div

4058192
width	height
i use the resize_to_fit method which will use the parameters supplied as the maximum width height but will keep the aspect ration

4058192
width	height
that will ensure that either the width or height is no greater than 640 but will not stretch the image making it look funny

4058221
width	height
use getlength 0 and getlength 1 to get the width and height of the array

4058222
superclass	subclassing
which btw means that you can override superclass in subclassing which is pretty mindblowing.

4058223
min	max
the program is supposed to return the max and min values of an array

4058223
min	max
my goal was to have two variables max and min outside of the method so that as the method ran through the array the values would get replaced accordingly

4058237
ceil	floor
just converting mentioned above is good enough though you might want to use floor or ceil functions before that

4058242
min	max
max and min method are already in stdlib or ruby

4058326
google-chrome	firefox
the following works in ie but in firefox only align the text and in google-chrome nothing.

4058332
mkmapview	mkannotationview
this object is represented on my mkmapview by an mkannotationview

4058340
strlen	strcpy
this is also the way all the c standard library functions like strcpy strlen .

4058342
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works on firefox safari google-chrome properly

4058373
hex	binary
in order to understand the bitmask u need to convert it to binary with hex it s very easy every hex number is 4 binary digits

4058373
hex	binary
hex 0 binary 0000

4058373
hex	binary
hex 1 binary 0001

4058405
post	get
it works correctly in python but in php-curl i always get a bad request error my post data is not as expected by the server

4058441
equals	tostring
i d override equals hashcode and tostring in your animal

4058467
mongoid	mongomapper
if you just want store your json in mongo you don t need mongoid or mongomapper

4058474
min	max
you need to return both the min and max values to make the recursive algorithm work so i guess you need to return a pair of values or an array in a single return statement

4058474
min	max
secondly your min and max variables initialized on lines 3 and 4 are not in scope within the minmax method body so you are actually defining new local variables there

4058486
strlen	strcpy
as sth said c standard library functions like strcpy strlen also rely on the fact that the string is valid null terminated

4058488
pascal	delphi
we are tring to use in delphi a pas file generated by free pascal

4058514
firefox	safari
in firefox it looks ok in safari it breaks to the bottom left of that line

4058564
int	double
to put it more plainly java and therefore scala does not see any common grounds between a double s + and a an int s +

4058588
filtering	grouping
i want to filtering out the column1 after grouping it into s d r separately so that i can sum it over to separately to find packet delivery fraction

4058618
width	height
each of them should have the same width and height they should be square

4058618
width	height
and i want the whole matrix to use the screen width or height depending on rotation

4058618
width	height
how can i specify for the height to be the same as the width

4058656
hex	binary
here is a hex value 0x12345678 written as binary and annotated with some bit positions

4058657
post	get
so how to get the value from the url in a post request

4058673
put	get
if your template code isn t all inline functions then you ll have to put in some control to make sure that things get instantiated only once so your linker doesn t spit out a pile of multiple instances of foo errors

4058729
int	double
for scale type like int double and float they are not class type

4058729
int	double
some languages like c# may wrap int or double as a object and they can be transfered to each other by a sub-routine

4058755
bmp	png
i have tried saving the image as bmp jpg png with no joy either when drawing image fromfile

4058822
libssh	dropbear
depending on how complex your requirements are you could use libssh lgpl used in various ssh clients investigate modifying dropbear mit or quick n dirty

4058830
post	get
if i send post request directly to log-in url i get authorization error

4058833
firefox	safari
both firefox and safari will accept display inline-box

4058856
int	chars
now if i entered a large no of t-shirts like 999999999999999999999999999999999999 the form was unresponsive.so i should limit the no of chars entered in the textbox.so please tell me how to set this limitation so as to not having int overflow

4058882
int	double
my source code below is generating error cs0563 because both of the parameters in my combinedjobs operator+ see step 5 ... in source code are listed as job as opposed to int double etc

4058886
post	get
details in this blog post but basically all the way through ie7 ie mashes together several namespaces that should be completely distinct for instance it treats all id and name values as being in the same namespace so if you have an element with and another element with ie will get confused

4058945
system.in	system.out
instead of using system.in and system.out directly use the console class - it allows you to display a prompt and read an entire line thereby fixing your problem of input in one call

4059010
width	height
so you will define the table layout height to fill parent but for each column you should set the width to 0px and the weight to the percentage you want the column to span

4059022
free	malloc
if you allocate with malloc you should free with free

4059025
free	malloc
if you allocate with malloc you must always deallocate with free

4059026
chown	sudo
as to permissions if you have the directory var www joomla then cd var www and then sudo chown -r www-data joomla

4059038
free	malloc
simply replace allocate_from_some_other_source with malloc and deallocate_from_some_other_source with free

4059040
post	get
just use android s httpclient and perform post and get operations against your asp.net application to access and modify sqlserver s data

4059051
google-chrome	safari
the problem is in google-chrome and safari the scrollheight isn t changed at all

4059051
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome safari when clicking on a link anywhere on the page and then clicking on the browser back button to return to the search results iframe content then the iframe is resized properly even in google-chrome safari.

4059051
google-chrome	safari
ps i think this person has the same problem iframe resizing with scrollheight in google-chrome safari

4059091
folder	directory
you can figure the webroot for a domain to point to any folder insider your ftp upload directory thus you can do

4059119
mediarecorder	audiorecord
this class leverages audiorecord which is a lower level approach to using mediarecorder

4059129
config	ini
for zend optimizer plus there is a number of ini config you can change as explained in

4059157
int	chars
i remember that bjarne says that encoding is the mapping between chars and int s so chars should be stored as int s in memory and different encodings don t necessarily have the same mapping

4059157
int	chars
otherwise how is it able to translate the chars to correct int and store them

4059165
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately this format wasn t accepted by firefox so i had to keep the original code for google-chrome and firefox and then use a separate script for ie with conditional comments

4059173
min	max
all of the formulas are of the same nature - they perform some high-level function average slope min max across a column of values

4059174
integer	unsigned
are you in fact going to get incorrect results from the bitwise or should the conversion from a signed type to a larger unsigned type sign-extend the integer

4059214
int	chars
mapping between chars and int s so

4059214
int	chars
chars should be stored as int s in

4059214
int	chars
different encodings interpret the underlying int as different chars or parts of chars if we re talking about a multi-byte chars set depending on the encoding

4059226
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is an independent python implementation written in c# as opposed to the original implementation often referred to as cpython due to it being written in no surprise c

4059227
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is caught up to cpython the implementation you re probably used to 2.6 so some of the features changes seen in python 2.7 or 3.x will not be present in ironpython

4059291
cpython	ironpython
if you mean compatible with cpython then yes code written to cpython will work in ironpython with a few caveats

4059291
cpython	ironpython
another difference is that ironpython lags behind cpython by a bit

4059291
cpython	ironpython
if you want to learn to program with python and also want to produce code for windows you can use ironpython for that but you can also use cpython and py2exe

4059303
int	chars
and int s so chars should be

4059341
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
will this result in a dns lookup on common browsers and platforms such as safari ie firefox google-chrome opera windows linux mac osx

4059347
integer	unsigned
it could be in dotted quad format or a single unsigned 32 bit integer

4059398
width	height
you should not be using the screen size to determine the width height of the image because the frame will contain a border

4059455
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it s seems like all major browsers ie firefox safari google-chrome support animated gifs

4059458
google-chrome	firefox
only has to be compatible with google-chrome or firefox

4059471
return-value-optimization	nrvo
if you compile without -fno-elide-constructors the move operations disappear because they are replaced by even more efficient optimizations like return-value-optimization or nrvo

4059479
toggleclass	each
the overall styling would depend on your markup if you have some sort of container each radio set is in you could check if none of those had a checked element within...if they all do then use the same toggleclass approach to set that all checked class on or off

4059483
post	get	post	put	put	get
to use the term restful action to describe anything other than get put post delete etc when using http is just nasty

4059484
umask	chmod
after you fix codeaddict s string versus number issue and note tchrist s umask issue you should call chmod on the new directory after creating it if you need specific permissions

4059484
chmod	mkdir
i usually call mkdir without the mask and then chmod the directory to the permissions i want

4059484
umask	mkdir
you can also set the umask to zero before calling mkdir you d need to do it this way if you need to create the directory with the correct permissions atomically

4059486
dictionary	map
you should use map instead of dictionary dictionary is obsolete

4059504
perforce	svn
the good news here is that all the new age scms will let you do that correctly plastic git hg while the old ones simply fail svn perforce and the even older ones

4059507
pascal	delphi
i guess the free pascal faq on this goes for delphi too

4059515
postgresql	mysql
is there much difference between mysql and postgresql for a beginner like me using basic select statements and the like or are the main differences with using more advanced queries

4059526
portrait	landscape
3 if the screen lock is portrait landscape and your game is sticked to the other orientation the screen lock forced you to orient once

4059529
put	get
it s better to put together stty 2 echo 1 cat 1 et al and just get some strings to print

4059538
postgresql	mysql
they are sufficiently similar that i d recommend starting with mysql but learning postgresql as well

4059557
int	chars
c c++ programmers are used to thinking of chars as bytes because almost everyone starts working with the ascii chars set maps the int 0-255 to symbols such as the letters of the alphabet and arabic numbers

4059569
postgresql	mysql
the reason why i usually suggest postgresql before mysql is because mysql is far from the standards sql-wise

4059589
postgresql	mysql
while you re just starting out i think you ll appreciate postgresql s pgadminiii gui tool more than you would those that i ve tried for mysql

4059589
postgresql	mysql
i d actually recommend postgresql over mysql for the window functions alone

4059609
countif	sumifs
as there is also a countif and a sumifs i think your slopes could be calculated the same way

4059609
min	max
for the rest of the functions max min etc we should analyze case by case

4059655
boost	stl
the stl and boost are nice examples of how to exploit generic programming to write code to solve many problems that is both cleaner better and more efficient than the equivalent oop code

4059669
int	chars
when you read it first read in the int then read in that many chars

4059688
uiview	subviews
then put a uiimageview containing your png as the lowest item on the uiview s stack of subviews

4059806
toolbar	tabs
you can add custom buttons to the safari toolbar create bars of your own add contextual menu items display content in bars or tabs and inject scripts and style sheets into webpages

4059810
merb	ruby-on-rails
i hoped that after the ruby-on-rails merb merge it ll be possible and easy to cherry pick the needed features but either this is not yet implemented or poorly documented

4059877
put	get
to get custom errors you ll have to set them per-element or use the meta-data plugin to put the rules on the element directly

4059890
nsimage	nsscrollview
i have an nsview in an nsscrollview that i want to create an nsimage from

4059892
gridview	sqldatasource
this will ensure that your resultset from your sqldatasource will have the columns named exactly on the gridview

4059931
domxpath	domdocument
i m using the phpcrawl class and added some domdocument and domxpath code to take specific data off web pages however the script stalls out before it gets even close to crawling the whole website

4059940
post	get
if you re trying to do server side validation once a post get is received load the form object with the submitted values

4059945
pop-up	dialog
are there any preferably free tools which would let you throw together a quick outline of a ui and build these into storyboards to create a mockup of how a use-case might play out including pop-up dialog that could be raised etc

4059998
postgresql	mysql
featurewise i think postgresql is superior to mysql better query optimizer windowing functions common table expressions check constraints deferrable constraint just to name a few that mysql is lacking and it is really free

4059998
postgresql	mysql
mysql might have a slight advantage if you need multi-master replication but there are solutions for postgresql as well

4059998
teradata	greenplum
to complete the list of databases there is also greenplum data warehouse similar to teradata

4060023
plupload	swfupload
plupload and swfupload

4060023
plupload	swfupload
looking for a swfupload url their site is down so maybe plupload is a better bet

4060028
profiling	debugging
the standard version is free and offers the debugging you require as well as device code profiling

4060118
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome the game feels fast but in other browser like ie understandable since it s using vml firefox ipad safari and others it feels slow at times

4060133
width	height
as you mention in your comment the actual problem was that your matrix width was not a multiple of the block width and height since it is square meaning the threads beyond the end would access beyond the end of the array

4060138
udp	tcp
protocols like udp and tcp are built

4060144
inherited	properties
an oo programming language must have objects method properties classes encapsulation aggregation inherited and polymorphism

msdn how to simulate mouse and keyboard events in code

4060259
debian	linux
this avoids troubles when deploying with setuptools on linux systems scripts are symlinked to usr bin -- at least on debian

4060294
hash	salt
so i m cool with using a per-user salt to hash my users passwords

4060294
hash	salt
if i m just catenating the hash and salt and putting them in the same column surely that s semantically equivalent to two separate columns

4060344
try-catch	exception-handling
your code wouldn t in the face of exception-handling without messy try-catch blocks and other nonsense. again preferable is to not have this kind of allocation in the first place

4060348
jar	war
jar war

4060359
post	get
s button performs a get and not post

4060384
sorting	filtering
a quick google search for sorting javascript table turned up table with sorting filtering from javascript toolbox sorting html tables using javascript more of example and jquery plugin tablesorter 2.0 .

4060384
sorting	filtering
css itself however can t control the sorting or filtering

4060418
firefox	safari
i have a code given bellow which in safari works fine but firefox doesn t display the results when it calls csce server then since the code is on local machine doesn t allow it and returns error

4060435
post	get
sorry for only linking to the one plugin but it won t let me post more than one link until i get a higher reputation

4060437
width	height
suppose i have an image with width 1px and height 40px

4060455
ready	each
would write an alert statement to the ready function for each distinct ndata id for that user

4060472
sudo	passwd
sudo make install this will put the files in the expected places sudo executes a command with superuser priviledges you will have to enter your passwd

4060473
freebsd	linux
on a freebsd or linux machine i m sure there are other oses that can do this

4060482
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tried the following code in google-chrome firefox and safari but my div isn t quite being centered

4060505
width	margin
so from left to right you see the padding or margin on the body element margin in this case as it is chrome then the border for the div then the 400px of width then the next border and then the window edge as there isn t any more space to render the body s right margin

4060512
nsstring	nsdata
so all what you need is receive nsdata object from nsstring

4060521
associativity	operator-precedence
in a way the situation is similar to operator-precedence and associativity rules

4060533
pull	push
you only pull in that repo to get the changes you never push

4060540
maven	m2e
in fact the move should actually consist of simply upgrading the maven installation m2e only

4060580
kerberos	ntlm
kerberos and to a lesser degree ntlm is pretty tolerant of transient network outages between the server and the dc

4060607
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is the result on mac with firefox google-chrome or safari all updated to last version

4060607
google-chrome	firefox
this is the result on windows with firefox or google-chrome

4060686
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
not all browsers but all of the big ones google-chrome ie firefox opera safari

4060692
min	max
a user can use the thumb to move left or right from min to max

4060722
width	height
in fact i also believe you width and height calls can be removed and just cached through a closure since those are pretty static after creation see next example

4060722
width	height
you set the width and height of the enemies once so they seem pretty constant you could remove the .attr lookup and pass the width and height from the createenemies call as well

4060734
jsfl	fla
i need to export fla as a sequence of png images using jsfl

4060734
width	height
width and height which i last used in the dialog file export export movie are used instead

4060743
getter	setter
you could use the pivot.selecteditem method which is a getter and setter

4060752
cassini	iis
it worked absolutely fine on cassini but after i switched to iis problems appeared

4060774
hash	md5
according to the php reference you can use either the md5 sha1 or hash functions

4060774
hash	salt
your password database should therefore contain three columns username salt and hash

4060774
hash	salt
you can verify a password by repeating the procedure with the stored salt and comparing hash

4060779
cassini	iis
the allows the url to be resolved relative to the application path and should produce correct results in both cassini and iis

4060788
put	get
when i describe admin options for a model it s possible to put any method in list_display then we can add allow_tags true and get html

4060838
disk	ram
ram is several orders of magnitude faster than disk

4060851
content-length	content-type
later i also think that you should be able to uu64-encode your jpeg and send it over the wire as text with an appropriate content-length and content-type but i ve never done http at this level

4060877
hash	salt
provide the salt also in the database could be the username and or a random value and calculate the hash again

4060877
scrypt	pbkdf2
nowadays there are much better alternatives such as pbkdf2 bcrypt see this question or even scrypt

4060904
selecteditem	selectedindex
as kp suggests selectedindex selecteditem are the properties you can access to see which item is currently selected

4060911
google-chrome	safari
it appears that in the mac safari the spin buttons do respond to click events you might want to file a google-chrome bug report i suspect it was just an oversight

4060956
width	height
where x stands for the notes position on the x-axis y for its position on the y-axis w stands for the width and h stands for the height

4060964
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
currently i have the touchesbegan and touchesmoved events implemented inside the uipuzzlepiece class.

4060968
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard mouse and painting events are caused by messages that are processed in the wndproc so call the base implementation of that method in a try...catch to handle those events

4060988
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png	bmp	pcx	tiff	bmp	tiff	png
mathematica can export images to pdf web page html bmp eps gif jpg jpg2000 pcx png pnm pxr raw bitmap svg tiff ega emf wmf

4061018
ftp	telnet
always use ports above 1024 because ports lower than 1025 are most of the time reserved for standard protocols like http 80 ftp 21 telnet ...

4061024
maven	pom.xml
a good start is to check maven repositories dependencies and its versions in pom.xml file

4061036
viewdidload	viewdidappear
it is because you are presenting it in viewdidload try presenting it in viewdidappear

4061042
google-chrome	safari
it seems that click doesn t happen at the appropriate time in google-chrome extensions though this code works fine in safari extensions

4061063
google-chrome	firefox
but in google-chrome the script puts an inline height of 21px and in firefox it renders with an inline height of 271px exactly 21px more than my defined height

4061072
post	get
then in the auth.php i get the value via the post

4061152
fast-forward	merge
the pre-commit hook is obviously not run for fast-forward merge

4061152
fast-forward	merge
but presumably if you keep the branches from being merge there won t ever be a fast-forward attempt

4061156
portrait	landscape
in portrait mode the image is centered but when i switch to the landscape mode it stills on the left

4061168
post	get
i m trying to get google web toolkit to work with django through gets and post following the examples here

4061169
tabcontrol	tabitem
when you have tabcontrol it will fire a tabitem s controls loaded event every time the selectedindex changes

4061175
mouseleave	mouseenter
a quick solution would be to use this plugin which adds mouseenter and mouseleave functionality for non-ie browsers

4061185
pop-up	dialog
for simplicity s sake i d simply like to show a pop-up dialog that states the id of the element that was dragged

4061185
pop-up	dialog
this all seems well and good but toggling the drag event of any of my elements causes a dialog to pop-up that states the id of the last element in the array

4061246
integer	unsigned
would this be the right way to do it select cast col as unsigned integer from table

4061255
versioning	upgrade
if you can t require your users to upgrade you can spend a little more time improving the .net 3.5 code so that you don t need to make a special .net 4.0 versioning

4061275
width	height
you could probably remove the width height etc to tidy it up but i thought why both waste time with that when it gets hidden anyway i just cut and paste and made it hidden

4061314
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and debian the user is called www-data on other systems it may be just www or apache or apache2

4061331
sorting	filtering
asp.net mvc paging sorting filtering using the mvccontrib grid and pager

4061335
client-side	server-side
the last time i checked the region bias for both the client-side and the server-side google geocoder was not reliable

4061393
width	height
i want to pull a dynamic content which consists of a long text input with some images into a div with a fixed width 300px and height 1000px the challenge is i cannot use overflow auto in css when the content s length is exceeding the div s height 1000px instead i am asked to split the long content into pages with a pagination

4061394
ubuntu	linux
writing a server that runs on linux ubuntu using mono

4061406
little-o	big-theta
saying that mergesort is o n 4 is marginally more useful because little-o notation is never used to imply big-theta runtime

4061453
folder	directory
set the shadow build directory to some folder on the same level of your project directory

4061460
public	protected
and if it is public or protected it is shared with any process elements to which that static variable is exposed

4061491
hash	salt
i think the second part of the first answer the part about dynamic salt in that thread gives you an answer like you expect generate a random per-user salt and store that with the hash password

4061491
hash	salt
for an example look at which avoids having the user send their password over the network at all by having them hash it with a salt specified by the server

4061509
lisp	scheme
you could use gambit scheme or clozure common lisp both are able to interface with cocoa the first because it generates c and the latter because there is a bridge from clozure to cocoa

4061515
put	get
yes when you add and 1 you get 1 which is put into

4061522
free	malloc
for memory obtained using new you must use delete and use free for those obtained from malloc

4061541
subtract	add
if you want the number to be very close to a normal distribution can just add up 12 uniform 0 1 numbers and subtract 6

update - this has been resolved in the latest versioning of the .net api so anyone still encountering this problem should upgrade to the 1.1.1 versioning of the api

4061915
namedtuple	dictionary
i would suggest using an ordered list or namedtuple instead of a dictionary so you can focus on your output instead of your data

4061916
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
for simple data extraction getelementbyid and getelementsbytagname are usually plenty powerful enough

4062376
width	height
override constructor class so that you will replace the width or height value with the smallest value of them both

4062376
width	height
then just set width and height of all elements within tablelayout to 0dip and the weight of all of them to 1

4062376
width	height
assuming that you have nxn elements in your table they all will get then the same width and the same height because of the same weigth

4062398
int	chars
this means that getting the has of a string of 10 000 chars will also result in an int

implements	extends
for example tuples implements as a pytupleobject extends a pyobject struct store their length and the pyobject pointers they contain inside the struct itself the struct contains a 1-length array in the definition but the implementation allocates a block of memory of the right size to hold the pytupleobject struct plus exactly as many items as the tuple should hold. the same way strings pystringobject store their length their cached hashvalue some string-caching interning bookkeeping and the actual char of their data

4062953
actionscript	mxml
many newcomers to flex wonder how mxml and actionscript relate to one another

4062968

4063348
google-chrome	firefox
i know it s not a problem for google-chrome to get the localstorage never tried it on firefox to be honest

4063349
serializable	deserialization
if you have control over the objects you could decorate them with the attribute and use binaryformatter for serializable deserialization

4063440
stdout	fflush
by pretending to a terminal the buffering of stdout is automatically set to line mode fflush occurs when n is encountered

4063441

4063745
nginx	lighttpd
i am currently trying to figure out ways to run lua scripts using fastcgi with either lighttpd or nginx

4063750
nstextview	nstextstorage
it s as if the layout manager does not know about the recent glyph insertion deletion at this point in execution so i assume nstextview nstextstorage invokes the delegate method then notifies the layout manager to update

4063757
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
now i hope to use uitabbarcontroller as rootcontroller to switch the view of 3 different uiviewcontroller

4063795
textview	imageview
assuming that you want to have the textview always below the imageview i d use following layout

4063795

if you want to have the textview on top of the imageview then simply leave out the android layout_alignparenttop or set it to false and on the textview leave out the attribute

4063822
pop-up	dialog
oh and of course the function would make a dialog pop-up

4063861
awt	swing
well i would use swing not awt

4063861
awt	swing
swing is an extension to awt that everybody uses these days

4063871

i have to copy several bytes from a istream to a ostream there are 2 ways that i know to perform this copy

4063963

i write greasemonkey scripts for firefox and google-chrome seems too restrictive

4063990
getter	setter
and as already noted setter getter are not implemented in ie

4063990
getter	setter
this way status is fully protected from direct access which is the point of using setter and getter

4064012
accessor	properties
make and use the accessor likely via an properties directive

4064012
accessor	ivar
going through the accessor better preserves encapsulation and acknowledges that direct ivar access is an extremely atypical pattern in objective-c largely limited only to a class accessing it s own ivars directly

4064017
int	chars
what is happening here is that the letter a is a chars which has an int value of 97

4064017
int	chars
so for each chars it is incrementing the value in the array remember all array values in an int array start at zero

4064018
min	max
that being said - you could create a method that takes your decimal along with the max and min number of places to round in reverse from and in a loop crush it down to the desired places - something like this

4064046
accessor	properties
if you declare properties as atomic the synthesized accessor will use locks to ensure that values are fully retrieved and set

4064054
innodb	myisam
move form myisam to innodb - this

4064086
uitableview	nsindexpath

you can still do low-level tcp or udp programming in c# so at that point it is really just a matter of choice whether you want to write network code in c c# etc.

4064156
width	height
you will need to know the exact number of bytes returned and the bitmap dimensions height width and encoding

4064167
post	get
note _x being get post request files

4064233
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
i don t know of any publication spelling out which exception to throw when but argumentexception and invalidoperationexception should take care of most of your cases

firefox	safari
the following code works for me without any manual refresh tested on firefox 3.6.12 and safari 5.0.2 with gwt 2.0.3

4064242
for-loop	loops
the for-loop has a number of useful properties within a loops

4064252
post	put
in my onclick function for the form i put empty messages as errormessages and put a message if the form wasn t valid and return false if it isn t so i don t post it.

4064279
width	margin
i feel like there is some other kind of padding or margin or some other invisible that is contributing the math that makes up the width which is causing the discrepancy

4064284
vb.net	vb6
if i remember right return was added as the return statement to a function between vb6 and vb.net probably to make it more like other languages

4064308
int	chars
the difference between the two is that the first has type void chars and the second has type int const

4064310
rjava	jri
it might be a bit of an overkill but rjava jri give you a java api to r

4064316
sorting	filtering
i d recommend either to use data caching on web-server side see other answers for links or to implement client-side data filtering sorting - there must be ready-to-use javascript libs for that

4064331
put	get
hi frdz i have created a stored proc and i put three queries in stored proc with inputvariable etlloadid 0 and i get three different windows for each query under result tab

the get shows a form and the post takes the forms values and saves to the db

4064349
cvs	svn
in svn and cvs you can t add a file that s in your ignore list and if you do future changes aren t tracked but in mercurial hg add completely overrides ignore so unless you ll have many new jars showing up in the future just ignore broadly and add the .jar

4064360
memcached	apc
caching your results in memcached apc etc

4064360
post	get
one last thing a search page should use a get method according to http rest specifications post must be used for inserting while get must be used for retrieving

4064416
int	chars
chars int math.abs ch1 + math.random ch2 - ch1 128

4064426
ienumerable	iqueryable
i ended up creating two sets of methods ones that return ienumerable in your case iqueryable and ones that return collection pull the content before sending it out of the repository.

4064428
128bit	64bit
so floating point and its exception handling might work slightly differently and extended might not be 80-bit but 64bit or less likely 128bit

4064499
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
player should work in all major browsers ie firefox google-chrome safari

4064538
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
add it to the map view and then use the gesturerecognizer s touchesbegan touchesmoved etc

4064571
int	chars
1000 is not many you should just make sure that the underlying int type is big enough don t use a chars for your enum

4064582
children	parent
if the parent is deleted do the children need to be deleted as well

4064598
int	chars
this is much more about how to display chars than it is about int

4064601
stringstream	fstream
is there anyway i can transfer data from an fstream a file to a stringstream a stream in the memory

4064604
cllocationmanager	mkreversegeocoder

4064610
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
if you have to go for a 3-tier architecture you probably want to look at java ee java enterprise edition and at the application servers implementing it jboss glassfish weblogic etc.

4064644
activemq	rabbitmq
this leaves me with other alternatives such as rabbitmq or activemq since they both seem to have stomp adapters as possible middleware choices

4064651
mouse	keyboard
the mouse scroll wheel works nicely in gvim but i m looking for keyboard based solutions

4064665
free	malloc
free s do not necessary cause this consumption to go down it depends on how the memory is managed and the programs mixture of malloc s and free s

4064714
capistrano	bundler
i m trying to deploy a small rails3 app to a freebsd host using capistrano and bundler

4064714

4064776
prawn	pdfkit
if you are looking to generate a pdf you will need to use something like prawn or pdfkit

4064791
128bit	64bit
in hindsight logical because while sse2 regs are 128bit they are used as two 64bit doubles

4064802
int	double
when you type literal values for integral types like int short etc. as well as floating point types like float or double you don t use quotations

4064826
division	modulo
the is the modulo in mysql syntax -- it returns the remainder of the division

4064830
getter	setter
getter and setter are not bad by themselves

4064830
getter	setter
what is bad is the practice of making any field to be private and provide getter setter for all of them no matter what

4064883
width	height
i think your question is asking how to change the width and height of the tag

4064883
width	height
if so if you want to use php you ll have to refresh the page which you probably don t want to do in this case since your user will have to reload the video obviously you would simply output new values to the width and height values

4064884
keydown	keyup
if you are using .net and windows forms you can use the keydown and keyup events of form class

4064929
move	drag
also say that this image can be move by the user via drag and drop

4065018
free	malloc
then the next iteration of the loop does another batch of allocations of size n and the free list no longer contains contiguous memory at that size and malloc has to ask the kernel for more memory

4065023
put	get
ok to put it short which way is the best to automatically get the html source of an opened page in firefox to my c# application

4065036

4065068
min	max
for example i have dates and min max amount and the gridview is populated correctly

4065134
webchromeclient	webviewclient
using webviewclient and or the webchromeclient you can get a listener for when the page has loaded however this is sometimes called before the webview has any content in it before it has displayed anything

4065134
webchromeclient	webviewclient
so i have tried two different approaches to determining when the page has finished loading onpagefinished from the webviewclient and also onprogresschanged from the webchromeclient

4065141
lisp	scheme
lisp via acl2 is one and of course scheme has a well-understood formal definition as well

4065163
ocaml	ada
technique 2 write the software in a slightly more awkward language some subset of ada or tweaked version of ocaml for instance and write the correctness proof along the way

4065200
folder	directory
the way snesdroid works is it will play emulator files on the sd card not sure if you could code the app to download files directly to the sdcard in a specific folder then have the app rescan that directory to refresh the levels

4065202
pascal	delphi
i m coding my product with delphi so i have to port the new code to object pascal

4065245

realloc	malloc
an example will clarify this a bit points of interest realloc syntax is similar to malloc s no need for extra casts etc. and after realloc you need to produce the same steps for the new objects as you did after malloc

4065304
coalesce	isnull
coalesce works like isnull for n columns

4065307
coalesce	isnull
no this wont work if there is no row being returned - isnull and coalesce will work if there is a null value in the row but there should be a row to begin with

4065307
coalesce	isnull
also isnull coalesce will have to be on some column rather than the integer 1

4065315

you could try by using setignorerepaint boolean value but it s a typical swing feature that can or cannot work mainly because it depends from awt so you never know

4065537
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
so the only way to deep copy the inputstream is to create bytearrayoutputstream and after doing read on inputstream write this data to bytearrayoutputstream

4065538
turing	decidable
with all that out of the way it s worth noting that scala s type system like haskell s is turing complete which means that you can theoretically use it to prove any decidable property about your code provided that you have written your code in such a way that it is amenable to such proofs

4065538
haskell	sml	sml	prolog
haskell is almost certainly a better language for this than java since type-level programming in haskell is similar to prolog while type-level programming in scala is more similar to sml

4066091
qscrollarea	qlistwidgetitem	qscrollarea	qwidget	qlistwidget	qscrollarea	qlistwidget	qwidget
well you could indeed use a qlistwidget with checkable items see void qlistwidgetitem setflags or use a qscrollarea containing a qwidget where you would dynamically add qcheckboxes

4066093
subtract	addition	subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add	multiplying	addition
you have to know how to do add subtract multiplying divide and power operations with complex numbers in addition to functions like sine cosine exponential etc

4066132
accessor	properties
one solution would be to create a seperate collection of item b from a public accessor properties collection of type b

4066155
getter	setter
you should be able to hide the 1d array access behind setter and getter that take 2d indexes

4066159
put	get
it fixes the errors however in the proceeding .cpp file i get the same errors above in the put function

4066178
strcpy	malloc
in that case you d need to malloc some space for a new character array and then use strcpy to copy from argv 1 into your character array

4066217
getter	setter
getter are syntaxic sugar like setter i consider that method are more flexible because of the simplicity of using them asynchronously

4066234
webclient	httpwebrequest
it is however advisable to use httpwebrequest instead of webclient since webclient returns on the ui thread

4066236
width	height
you can even get the background images width and height through attr attribute of jquery for image

4066254
debian	linux
both are linux machines - one is arch the other debian

4066278
std	ostream
ostream is declared in std namespace so you need to add using namepsace std before the declaration of container or use scope resolution std ostream

4066285
webclient	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest used by webclient itself will allow you to keep most your processing off the ui thread and just do your ui updates on the ui thread by way of the dispatcher refer above

4066285
webclient	httpwebrequest
for a deeper understanding of the differences between httpwebrequest and webclient and a working project sample to demonstrate refer my post here

webclient httpwebrequest and the ui thread on windows phone 7

4066293
nunit	mstest
here a links comparing mstest and nunit

4066305
cpu	processors
this is part of the threadpool management to keep the system from being over-tasked and reducing efficiency by all the context switches between too many threads while reducing wasted cycles while a thread is blocked there might not be enough other work to task the processors s fully even though there are tasks waiting to be run and wasted memory having threads spun up and ready but never allocated because they d over task the cpu

4066332
printf	strtol
you can pass it as an argument to any function that doesn t try to modify it printf strtol strchr etc.

4066332

another solution is to forget weblogic altogether and use a different server such as jboss or tomcat

4066956
getter	setter
i have already written a interceptor with castle dynamic proxy that will encrypt the relevant property on the setter and decrypt it on the getter

4066956
getter	setter
not knowing castle dynamic proxy that well i m sure there might be a better way of handling the interception and detecting whether it is a getter or a setter etc

4066960
width	height
note that tag is inline elements you need to make it block-level with display block to apply width and height to it and make it look like a button

if i push view controllers and or present modal view controllers on a uinavigationcontroller how can i find out what is the top most uiviewcontroller

4067717
hash-collision	key
hash-collision will happen so the code that calls hasharray_search needs to compare the search key with the one stored in the value object

4067758
mvp	presenter
the whole point of mvp is to have a very thin view and all application logic inside presenter so that presenter can be unit tested locally without a view which needs a browser

4067770

note to get error messages description on your screen rather than blank window put these two lines on top of your script

4068679
width	height
i thought of having a script take all the images and resize them offline and then link to the new picture but the aspect ratio are all different so i can resize to get the same height or width but not both

4068693
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops	inherited	properties
the other change is using a normal for-loop a for...in loops is not the proper way to iterate through the arrays you ll get other inherited properties and not necessarily the order you expect

4068752
post	put
i didn t specify this earlier but the process should be synchronous from the point of view of the browser ie webserver gets the http post request from the browser message is put into the queue message is sent from the queue webserver sends http response to the browser

4068771
getter	setter
why isn t the compiler generating the getter setter methods automagically without me having to write synthesize property

4068774
inherited	properties
so i created the own custom static class and inherited the triggers dependency properties from system.windows.interaction there via reflection and addowner just exposed the properties as shadowtriggersproperty

4068784
128bit	64bit
i do not think it would be worth the effort sse2 allow you to perform two instances in parallel you use 64bit numbers and sse2 registers are 128bit but i find it likely that a handmade division algorithm would be at least twice as slow as the cpu idiv opcode

4068786

versioning	upgrade
i d have thought that the best way to defeat code that exploits known security holes in java is to upgrade to a java versioning that fixes the bug

4069104
outputstream	inputstream
streams inputstream and outputstream transfer binary data

4069154
free	malloc
moreover when using the standard solaris malloc free libraries free memory is not returned to the os so the size metric is never decreasing

4069174
width	height
do not set the loader width and height finish the loading first and only then - in your completehandler - add it to displaylist addchild and only after that change the size

4069175
int	chars
i have to convert from strings the first 2 chars into an int

min	max
i ve re-written code that used std min and std max to use sse intrinsics for min and max in inner loops instead and the speed-up was significant

4071109

first for very large int values converting to double might loose precision

4071378
junit	testng
do they depend on junit only or does testng work as well

4071381
subtraction	addition
you re probably better off creating your own class that wraps the ticks as uint64 and provides methods for converting to human-readable presentation like datestr doing addition and subtraction parsing the strings you re getting to the uint64 values and so on

4071410
x86	64bit
on x86 for example two 32 bit int values side-by-side are exactly the same as a 64bit long long value

stdout	stderr
it appears to be because both stdout and stderr have been redirected so tput doesn t know what terminal you want the info for

4071642
getter	setter
i would suggest not writing generating any getter or setter until you actually need them to be accessed from outside of your class

4071642
getter	setter
alternatively making those getter setter private by default would have the same result but it s more code for no real benefit

4071695
jar	war
the possible solution is that you might have another jar like servlet.jar available in a war file under tomcat that conflicts with servlet-api.jar s servlet.class

this page should be able to redirect to our server as well as to someone s server and it doesn t need to know where it came from or where it goes it just simply needs to keep the same post get and header information as well as additional information received at this step

4071993
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

if you aren t allowed to use atoi you probably aren t allowed to use strtol either

4072723
octal	hex
if you need to be able to handle octal or hex formats then it gets a little more complicated

4072723
octal	hex
the c convention is for octal formats to have a leading 0 digit and for hex formats to have a leading 0x

4072723

4073265
selecteditem	selectedindex
if no item is selected in the listbox exception is not raised but even if i set the selecteditem property to null before changing the itemssource the exception still occurs if an item was selected because selectedindex property still has a value

4073287
width	height
substitute in your own flashurl width height and expressinstallurl values

4073313
g++	gcc
g++ is the c++ compiler frontend to gcc

4073315

i m answering the second question first as a design choice module is an eval and they took the questionable choice to use stderr tty instead of stdout stderr to keep their side of the design easier

4073336
free	memcpy	free	malloc	memcpy	malloc
it s well-written and well-formed but barely readable simply due to the sheer amount of malloc memcpy and free you need to do

4073525
printf	strtod
even converting back to a string with printf and doing a string comparison would not necessarily work since printf is not required to produce exact results only enough to reconstruct the value with strtod

4073563

the .toggle method can be used to show hide elements

4073730

4073740

width	height
the first time the image loads the browser will not know the width or height of it so it goes in at some arbitrary and usually wrong size

subsequent requests will load the image from cache very quickly possibly before the javascript has a chance to run which means that the width and height attributes are populated correctly

min	max
is there an alternative to hard coding these min and max values

4081169
min	max
unique constraint does allow two properties to be linked that way hoping min max constraints allow that

4081176
min	max
note these are sql type min max not the .net types like the previous 2 answers -

4081189
gif	png
if you have uncompressed images like bmps you will get better results using a compression technique specific to images than using gzip so you are better off just converting them to gif png jpg depending on your needs

4081198
post	get
if you mean without a post then yes you can use a get

4081202
getter	setter
there are some side effects that may occur when using setter or getter here -- because they are methods and hence may be overridden

4081228
integer	unsigned
however before the right shift it must convert the x to an unsigned 32-bit integer

4081228
integer	unsigned
therefore the overall effect of is convert x into a 32-bit unsigned integer

4081232
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
other than bmp s if you see someone using them over the wire prepare your shotgun images are mostly already compressed including jpeg s png s and gif s

4081272
hash	md5
get its hash with your algorithm of choice md5 sha1 etc

4081273
post	get
you would have to use either post or get to pass html data from the page to a php function

4081298
post	get
so go and study ajax so that you will be able to make an async call to a php script that will elaborate get post variable and call the php function

4081298
post	get
or just look at the post and the get functions of jquery

4081303
google-chrome	safari
in testing it in google-chrome and safari the animations are smooth and very much to my liking

4081372
post	put
read the content of that post again and put each word in a fixed buffer array 50 words until i find the keyword

4081387
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
you can create an sqlconnection and sqltransaction and supply it to the linq to sql datacontext

4081399
children	parent
since you have a min-heap there your downheap operation should swap the new parent with the smaller of its children

4081401
hlsl	glsl
gpu code shader languages such as glsl cg or hlsl or gpgpu stuff like cuda or opencl typically defines types like these though as names for the corresponding simd datatypes

4081406
jobs	cron
these environment variables will then be available to all cron jobs run through your crontab

4081455
post	get
if you can t get this to work then post back and we ll help you get it sorted out

4081458
datamapper	activerecord
2.0 s datamapper pattern is really superior to the 1.2 activerecord model

4081552
hide	show
alternatively i guess you could put this code show hide calls in the constructor and destructor of the modal dialog if you want to keep the code there

4081638
width	height
i d like to get the equivalent width height area in metres

4081646
width	height
you need to adapt it to resize the image to a specified width and height

4081668
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you can use nsdatecomponents to store only the components you need hour and minutes for example and then use nscalendar datebyaddingcomponents todate options to create an absolute date reference when you need using the serialized components and a base date

4081677
integer	unsigned
yes - will cause erlang to require a packet frame of a 4 byte unsigned big endian integer length value on receive and will emit one before each packet of data sent

4081678
post	get
i suggest starting off with the jquery documentation and if you run into issues post specific questions with code snippets back here and i m sure you ll get lots of answers and feedback

4081679
rss	feed
for the specific case of an rss feed and the specific case of individual corrupt item entries you can use xmltextreader to manually read in each item separately handling the xmlexception for invalid items

4081683
int	double
i think that a better question is how can i tell if a double is close enough to an int to be considered an int for my purposes

4081688
filtering	grouping
i m not entirely sure whether you want to filtering or grouping the results

4081698
serializable	deserialization
hope this example helps - covers both xml serializable and deserialization using linq

4081716
fink	macports
i have been unable to compile some packages like wxwidgets on mac os 10.6.4 using gcc 4.5 compiled from source not from macports fink etc

4081724
google-chrome	firefox
according to the documentation here it supports four browsers google-chrome ie firefox and htmlunit

4081724
google-chrome	firefox
i can import the firefox driver using from selenium.firefox.webdriver import webdriver and the google-chrome driver using from selenium.chrome.webdriver import webdriver

4081764
jtextpane	jeditorpane
a jeditorpane just a like a jtextpane has a document that you can use for inserting strings

4081831
getter	setter
so i can use property copy to auto generate setter getter

4081855
put	get
it would seem silly to do the first because most banks put a limit on the number of free transactions you get per month

4081904
boost	stl
considering my code only depends on boost and the stl that the issue is to check code compatibility and not lib compatibility

4081922
sorting	grouping
sorting analytics grouping counting aggregation etc

4081939
punctuation	words
split a body of text into tokens words punctuation

4081982
inherited	subclassing
calling a constructor from clone would be problematic as this would break inherited in case a subclassing wants to add its own additional cloneable logic

4081982
inherited	subclassing
another problem is that any subclassing that forget to override clone will automatically inherited the default shallow copy which is likely not what you want in case of mutable state which will now be shared between the source and the copy

4081987
hex	binary
i assume that by a hex file you actually mean a binary file not a text file with hex codes

4082020
cos	sin
x y z sin pi m m cos 2pi n n sin pi m m sin 2pi n n cos pi m m

4082062
ubuntu	linux
when i log into a particular ubuntu linux 10.04 64bit host via ssh i get a bash shell

4082070
mdpi	hdpi
i have put the bitmap in all density-folders hdpi mdpi ldpi and scaled them according to the documentation the mdpi-bitmap is 25x25 pixels and the ldpi-bitmap size 75 of the mdpi-bitmap size and the hdpi-bitmap size 150 of the mdpi-bitmap size

4082128
put	get
i could solve the problem by making sure that in the application i first get all instances that i want to delete put them in a second container then loop over the second container and delete the instances but since there is always the risk that an observer explicitly deletes other instances that were already on my to-be-deleted list i have to put explicit observers to keep this second copy up to date as well

4082154
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
how ever you do it you will need separate year month day hour minute and second values so that you can construct an nsdate from nsdatecomponents using nscalendar s -datefromcomponents method

4082202
width	height
try 20 is height 10 is width

4082216
hide	show
that way i can do some show hide on the tables like a next prev navigation

4082234
mouseup	mousedown
if you re creating a custom drag function you could use mousedown and mouseup events

4082261
width	height
it s a chess board and so i want it s width to be the same as it s height

4082279
squeak	visualworks
i know that there is a reader for sif in gst but i m not sure if visualworks or squeak have readers for this format

4082283
put	get
is there an easy way to get this filter to not put a space there

4082303
post	get
for example using fiddler i issued several requests to and i got 200 response for the head get and post but i got 405 for the trace

4082382
imap	nntp
--you could use php s imap functionality which supports imap pop3 and nntp

4082410
width	height
so when the keyboard appears or disappears or when orientation changes i need to detect the width and height and re-layout accordingly

4082431
mousemove	mousedown
on mousedown you should flag a possible drag and save the mouse coordinates where the mousedown occurred then attach a mousemove handler

4082431
mousemove	mousedown
the mousemove handler should change the css class of the dragged element only when the distance between the saved mousedown coordinates and the current mouse coordinates is greater than some delta

4082431
mouseup	mousedown
finally on drop mouseup then handle the drop event as desired and clear the possible drag flag and the saved mousedown coordinates

4082478
httpwebrequest	networkcredentials
if the website is using http basic authentication a browser-generated login dialog you can set the httpwebrequest s credentials property to a networkcredentials instance

4082532
allocator	stl
1 is it possible to implement an allocator that uses alloca to allocate memory on the stack and is otherwise c++ stl compliant

4082569
free	malloc
every new should match a delete every to a and every malloc to a free but don t use them in c++...

4082576
integer	fractions
always remember that floating point stores binary fractions your number will be represented with a summation series of 2 -n where n is any integer from 1 to mantissa size raised to some exponent n

4082595
free	malloc
if you malloc it free it

4082692
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
the only thing you should look out for is new vs new that s why i like c type memory allocators so much more calloc malloc free if i don t need constructors and destructors ie

4082729
ssl	https
note you might need to use curl_setopt to turn off curlopt_ssl_verifyhost and curlopt_ssl_verifypeer if you want to reliably follow across https ssl

4082748
vim	emacs
emacs - and i suppose vim maybe - have several advantages

4082751
post	get
facebook is ajax intensive series of http get post operations without full page refreshes

4082753
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are the most polished and multi-purpose software i can think about

4082759
feedback	review
the review is where what was finished in the sprint is shown to others typically stakeholders to get feedback and update the product backlog with new items that may come from seeing the product

4082776
post	put
so on the show view i want to show a post and at the bottom have the fields that when completed and submitted create a new comment associated with the post and put it in the database

4082776
put	get
i just can t get a form to work to put new ones in

4082840
nsdateformatter	nscalendar
well i ve written enough date formatting code to know that constructing nscalendar and nsdateformatter on the fly utterly kills performance

4082868
post	get	instances	transient
the forumpartitionrouter is the more obvious different forums are stored in different databases this is interesting because it s clear that they have some awesome management tools that allow them to define these partitions to their django servers when the servers are started treating each django instances as a transient and ephemeral object of their system and the server uses the forum_id to go and find the right database from which to get the related members of the forum in this case the post

4082900
daemons	systemd
you can write a daemons from scratch using the pcntl functions since you don t care about multiple worker processes it s super-easy to get a process running in the background. or cheat and just make a script that runs forever and run it via screen or leverage some solid library code like pear s systemd daemons or nanoserv

4082906
children	parent
give the #container div a min-width 1000px property that way the parent will always be wide enough to hold both the children side-by-side

4082912
int	chars
if you are parsing a text file with the int represented in decimal ascii chars you can just use

4082925
google-chrome	safari
it works fine on google-chrome but not on my ipad safari

4082935
dns	spf
is there a way to search a particular dns server for the spf records

4082954
relaxng	schematron
you can do this using a co-occurrence constraint with a relaxng schema or you could use schematron in conjunction with any of those schema languages

4082954
relaxng	schematron
i ve resolved issues like this before by using embedded schematron rules with schemas good discussion of this with xsd on xfront and with relaxng on xml.com

4082960
openjpa	openejb
openejb bundles openjpa as default persistence provider

4082965
children	parent
also if there are children pages they need to be in a nested and show as a dropdown when the parent is hovered on

4082979
try-catch	exception-handling
you might want to put the try-catch into a separate function as the body of your foreach loop is getting large once you catch several types of exception-handling

4082980
post	get
i will post a solution as soon as we managed to get the exception solved

4082996
put	get
i get really annoyed at repeated code patterns like this so for me it would probably be worth it to extract the repeated copy paste control code and put it in it s own method

4083001
typedef	struct
you would use such a struct just the same way you would with however compilers often emit the name of the struct not the alias and so you may get better error messages involving the struct if you give it a name and typedef that as opposed to typedef ing an anonymous struct

4083003
codeigniter	kohana
have a look at codeigniter or kohana

4083022
onchange	onkeyup
i have used both onchange and onkeyup and neither seem to be helping

4083033
put	get
get the diameter and height for option 2 from my query and put those dimensions in my p tag.

4083131
hide	show
i can retrieve level1 and level2 calling show and hide on them successfully

4083142
children	parent
.show and .hide on a parent doesn t affect the children if they re hidden they stay hidden...they re handled independently

4083154
folder	directory
i tried deleting my .suo file my bin directory and my obj folder then rebuilding but still no dice

4083163
folder	directory
so the installer will create the logs folder give all authenticated users ntfs permissions to wreak havoc on that directory and blow away all of the log files that were created after the original installation as part of the uninstall process to leave a clean uninstall

4083175
width	height
we can t accomplish min width height with just the usercontrol because if we set the height for it then the parent container won t scale it verticaly and the same goes for width

4083175
width	height
if we try to juggle them around then there are situations where we end in an endless width height resizing loop

4083175
width	height
what we need is another hidden control in the same space that fills it completely and can tell us what its width and height is everytime it changes

4083175
width	height
then we can use the math.min width height solution

4083193
vsto	add-in
there are several ways to do this but since your using vb.net your best off using the newest approach which is building a vsto com add-in

4083193
vsto	add-in
there are numerous other questons available on how to best build a vsto add-in some in c# some in vb.net but all this information is exactly the same for both just different syntax

4083193

put	get
the open command works fine and i get a succeeded in active and passive mode but when i try to do anything check for a file put a file download i get 500 illegal port command

4083322
width	height
in all the examples that i can find that use a jtextarea the height width is known before constructing the jtextarea and if the jtextarea would require more height then it is put inside of a jscrollpane

4083322
width	height
obviously the height of jtextarea is dependent on the width and the text contents

4083322
width	height
the correct dimensions should be the width that i provided when i constructed it and the minimum height that is required to display all the text with the provided width

4083322
width	height
i m tempted to basically create my own jtextarea that takes a width and string and computes the necessary minimum height based on the width and font settings but i figured i would ask around first before spending the time to do that

4083325
vim	emacs
what toolmakers are banking on is that those extra things provide enough of a benefit that it will outweigh how effective vim and emacs are as editors

4083333
openrowset	openquery
if the databases are on different servers you ll need to look at using one of openquery openrowset or linked servers to do the query but fundamentally even with all these you d still be writing a variation on the command above

4083430
hex	binary
if you are opening the binary file in what is known as a hex editor you will need to understand hexadecimal

4083431
division	multiplication
when a multiplication or division involves a signed zero the usual sign rules apply in computing the sign of the answer

4083447
capitalize	capitalization
note according to this capitalization of day names article the names of the days of the week are not capitalize in french like they are in my default english locale but that is taken into account automatically too which means the weekday name passed to it must be in the language of the current locale and is also case-sensitive

4083531
versioning	upgrade
however i must consider the scenario when a user has an old versioning of the world state on their phone because they were in the middle of a game they upgrade the app and now the app cannot load the world state

i considered about converting to nsstring and re-converting into sint64 with nsscanner or strtoll but i believe there s better way

4083602
google-chrome	safari
add it as a javascript function...i believe that webkit supports it so it should work in ios android google-chrome and safari

4083609
int	double
it s safe to assume that updating a double is never atomic even if it s size is the same as an int with atomic guarantee

4083654
super	self
as i understand it the purpose of self super init

4083654
super	self
it could be argued that super init is unlikely to fail but then why assign the results of it to self and check for nil

4083680
post	get
basically if a post heading takes up 40 characters then i don t want to display any other headings basically i need to get the length of all post titles combined and work out which ones can be displayed to fit within the character limit constraints

calloc	malloc
why does calloc take two arguments instead of one like malloc

4083928
multiplying	multiplication
this function is only for pretty way pass the size of element and number of elements when in malloc you must multiplying this values to get needed number of bytes this function check integer overflow too in multiplication

4083931
calloc	malloc
the only notable difference is that calloc is required to initialize the allocated space to zeroes while there is no such guarantee with malloc

4083946
calloc	malloc
for this reason since calloc uses two arguments of type size_t it can allocate bigger blocks than malloc will ever be able to since malloc takes only one argument of type size_t

4083955
decoder	encoder
assuming you have access to a bencode encoder and decoder you could

superclass	subclassing
if i have subclassing of a class within the dylib do i create another protocol for the subclassing and make the superclass of the newly created class implement that protocol

4084105
junit	mockito
i agree that junit and mockito are excellent starting points

4084106
addition	multiplication
in addition as darren mentions in his answer you will likely have to use the element-wise multiplication operator instead of the matrix multiplication operator

4084151
scheme	racket
to be fair though the sxml folks are interested in supporting all scheme not just racket so they can certainly be forgiven for not spending lots of time writing documentation in the racket format scribble

4084242

why use getter and setter

4085445
getter	setter
make your attributes private and use setter and getter to access your attributes

4085445
getter	setter
because using setter is the way to go you should also use getter otherwise there is still a possibility to set your attributes without using the setter

4085445
getter	setter
please have a look at the magical __set and __get methods to make your life easier when it comes to setter and getter

4085445

super	extends
you can extends string class with only replaceall method and super call

4085842
getter	setter
or it might have just a getter and setter for one

4085864

this will create both getter and setter a tostring and correct hash equals methods including both variables

4085966
equals	tostring	tostring	getter	getter	setter
no need to generate remove code when you change fields getter setter tostring hash equals

4085975
division	multiplication
51 70 100 are of type int therefore the operators for integer multiplication and division are chosen

4085987
dictionary	map
a dictionary is a hashtable where by definition you need a non-empty key or the hash function cannot map to the corresponding element

4086030
equals	gethashcode
i don t have access to the code and it doesn t implement equals and gethashcode therefore i need to write a wrapper class i think

4086030
equals	gethashcode
the equals and gethashcode impls should use all the private member fields

4086060
equals	gethashcode
i would inherit from classa and override equals and gethashcode

4086073
memcached	apc
use apc xcache or memcached to save variables to cache instead of a database

4086077
equals	gethashcode
inherit your own class from classa and then implement gethashcode and equals in it

4086100
inherited	properties
as per griver and driis above - inherited or aggregate classa and implement equals based on the a properties

4086106
equals	gethashcode
this allows you to override the type s gethashcode and equals methods

implements	extends
nowadays when you want to create a new thread to do something the reccomended way of achieving this is to not extends thread but instead implements the runnable interface

4086666
firefox	safari
the thing is this works in firefox and safari - but it does not on mobile webkit

4086666
onclick	onfocus
i also tried to capture all events and prevent them - because there is an onfocus event being fired by the button after onclick

asterisk	pbx
have a look at voip pbx systems asterisk

4087127
accelerometer	gyroscope
the precision of the gyroscope and accelerometer sensors is much greater than the precision of the compass and gps

4087127
accelerometer	gyroscope
the compass and gps are for finding out where the device is on the globe and the gyroscope and accelerometer are good for finding out where the device has moved in the last few milliseconds

4087127
accelerometer	gyroscope
trying to simulate a gyroscope input to control a 3d simulation like the jenga game jobs showed in the keynote that introduced the iphone 4 will not work perfectly with just the compass accelerometer gps

4087212
hash	md5
you can also store the file hash like md5 of a file in the db so you can have secondary lookup option in case someone does rename the file of course they could move it as well in which case this would not help much .

4087213

4087383
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the reason for using copy at nsstring is that you might get a nsmutablestring passed to your object instead which might change right under your feet

4087400
uu-parsinglib	parsec
if have an lr grammar you are working from a yacc grammar it is a good deal of work to turn it into an ll one suitable for parsec or uu-parsinglib

4087400
uu-parsinglib	parsec
for ll combinator parsing uu-parsinglib and it predecessor uu-parsing are nice but they are lacking something like parsec s token and language modules so are perhaps less convenient

4087400
uu-parsinglib	parsec	attoparsec	uu-parsinglib
if you are decoding some formatted file rather than something like a programming language attoparsec or similar might be better than parsec or uu-parsinglib

4087688
hash	salt
the salt must be known to verify a password since it enters the hash function along with the password so it is stored as cleartext as you intend to do

4087688
hash	salt
for instance when you hash the salt password you actually hash the concatenation of 10000 times the salt+password sequence

4088373
superclass	subclassing
the second approach violates the principle that superclass should not know about each of its subclassing

4088373
superclass	subclassing
i think the element you re missing is that the base class can define template methods like getboardsize countredpieces countblackpieces that can be overridden by subclassing and your superclass has code that uses those template methods therefore telling its subclassing what to do but not how to do it

4088375
width	height
when i launch the application in portrait mode the view initially has a width and height of the portrait orientation

4088388

objc code transmits bit pattern of long long int which got by unsignedlonglongvalue which java code tries to interpret as bit pattern of double

4088451
put	get
the methods get head put

4088530
put	get
in jpa 1.0 only basic mappings can be marked as apart of the id requiring redundent mappings and some code to ensure that the values relationships get put into the cache correctly when persisting

4088530
put	get
if you mark the joincolumns as read-only you will need to get the values from the referenced dept and put them into the correspoinding basic id attributes manually when you want to persist a project

4088534
ienumerable	ilist
if you can use ienumerable instead of ilist to pass your data to rest of your program you would be able to collapse this list using the selectmany linq method

4088581
vsto	add-in
nope that s about it when doing a shared add-in without vsto

personally i think the simplest approach to do an http post and get the response is to use the webclient class

4088689
folder	directory
i have written some code to delete virtual directory however all that it is doing is that it deleted the folder structures beneath the virtuals and not the actual virtual entries in iis so that if i open iis i can still see the listings under default web site

4088716
inherited	properties
they both inherited from defaultmodelbinder and they both encode a single properties on two separate view model classes using an iencodingservice that is injected into their constructors

4088719
int	double
however if you handle double or floats instead of int based types such as hours or days setting the interval to zero may be a little bit extreme while zooming you will end up having overly precise labels such as 2 907343253253235

4088723
min	max
max and min length

4088738

4089299
lisp	prolog
i m not going to say that php is the most efficient language to be doing this in...i would suspect c++ or java to be much better alternatives if you aren t exactly on board with jumping into prolog or lisp but there s also fann which is a library for neural networks and has bindings for various languages including php but it doesn t seem to work with php 5.3 and appears to no longer be maintained but i m sure it s still great for other languages

that allows subclassing to override the setter getter and do something different to just fetching the value from the ivar

4089372
int	chars
for primitive types int chars bool and friends just set the variables to be equal

4089391
children	parent
i am using mvvm for a wpf app and i have a telerik radtreeview and when i collapse a parent i d like to recursively collapse all children and their children etc so that when i expand the parent again i don t see any grandchildren because all children are collapsed

disk	ram
as far as i can see without changing your system on root level to install memcached or store session files on a ram disk this is not possible

4089404
memcached	apc
in memcached you can access the data from various languages c python etc.. while apc works only for php

4089427
imagemagick	wand
the code you re looking for is in imagemagick wand import.c

4089439
nsurl	nsstring
turns out that info objectforkey uiimagepickercontrollermediaurl returns a nsurl and not a nsstring

4089440
fileinputstream	filechannel
fileinputstream has file getchannel which returns a filechannel which can tell you the current position in the stream

4089440
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
so if you give a bufferedreader a fileinputstream to read from you can find out where the bufferedreader stopped reading in the fileinputstream and you can also set the fileinputstream to that position before you give it to the bufferedreader

4089440
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
so the position of the fileinputstream is not the same as the position in the bufferedreader

4089440
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
you may have read 20 lines from the bufferedreader but the bufferedreader may have read 30 from the fileinputstream

4089477
ddms	adb
you can however do it over adb from the ddms window of your development machine as adb runs in the graphics group which has permission to the framebuffer

when i post 56 cents and i put as shown in the code 00 cents in the new object it still shows the 56 cents thus it looks at it is right ignoring my new m variable

4089789
google-chrome	firefox
you could try which displays those uicolor in a browser that supports rgba firefox and google-chrome

4089794
portrait	landscape
when you create a uisplitviewcontroller and add it to uitabbarcontroller it will work fine in portrait mode even if you swap from portrait to landscape and back

4089794
portrait	landscape
it will launch in portrait mode but will immediately switch to landscape mode if you hold it that way and the problems seem to be gone

4089827
dns	spf
i was able to look up the spf records on a specific dns by using the following query

4089849
hide	show
you can however hide and later on show it again

4089896

the root folder of the pylons app should probably be where you point the vserver at and let pylons handle its own chunk of the directory tree

4089900
inherited	properties
the map class creates new instances of these objects which all inherited from the drawable class which contains the basic methods and properties needed to draw the object to the screen

4089917
min	max
this would let them choose before in the 1st one and after in the 2nd one to provide for a min and max search on date

4089927
width	height
setting the width and height to 100 kind of works but it requires a lot of tinkering when you have a lot of paths

4089934
openssl	gnutls	ldd	gnutls
in addition it s possible that your version of svn is linked against another library than openssl for its ssl tls stack for example gnutls this should be visible using ldd on the svn binary

4089979
spaces	delimiter
query seven columns in management studio and then save the results as a tab-delimited text file the resulting file is generated and delimiter properly but when i run the same query in ssis to produce the same text file it insists on right-padding all varchar columns with spaces

hide	show
the only way i was able to consistently get he window to hide and show is as follows

4090001
min	max
specific max and min length is not supported and will probably not be implemented but who knows

4090023
mp4	h.264
i have a library of footage encoded as h.264 aac inside mp4 containers

4090029
put	get
however that all depends on how big your data set is - if it s lots of data to get the next 20 rows i d put something like press here for more results and wait for the user s input to fire off the request

4090056
unix	solaris
i use teamcity to build c++ on unix solaris

folder	directory
the images are being displayed by a css file residing in a virtual directory folder

4090180
metaclass	subclassing
i had an event metaclass from which every specific event could subclassing ie ui events npc events etc

4090180
metaclass	subclassing
eventually the design of having an event metaclass from which i have to keep subclassing was not very flexible for me and it was tedious work so i went with another approach where i can attach properties arbitrarily to an event object and the handling component would have to know how to deal with it

4090204
firefox	safari
they look great in firefox safari but the social media icons don t render correctly in ie

4090336
hide	show
and when clicked i want it to hide and show another box

4090374
apache	lighttpd
why was it working with apache mod_php and stopped working with lighttpd fastcgi

4090374
apache	lighttpd
apache was somehow fixing all the headers just before there were actually sent out and lighttpd does not really care

4090387

while a crypto hash function can t be easily reversed there are online rainbowtable services which can revert them for short or common inputs

4090427
pop-up	dialog
i need to show a grid or table of data in a pop-up dialog box on android

4090436
realloc	malloc
the main exception i can think of is code that allocates a big array then reduces the size once the size needed is known - but even this might require moving data on some malloc implementations ones which segregate blocks strictly by size so i consider this usage of realloc really bad practice

4090559
mouseover	mouseleave
the problem is that because the arrows are on top of the photo when i mouseover the arrows to click they dissapear because the mouseleave from the photo is triggered

4090579
typemock	moles
microsoft moles and typemock have this capability

4090605
serializable	deserialization
i think the best solution will be to implement some methods for serializable deserialization of such collections by yourself

4090609
getter	setter
when i run doctrine orm validate-schema it pops up a bunch of warnings about my mapped columns being public and not using getter setter methods to wrap them

i have this function to generate a number from min to max

4090729
min	max
now i would like extend this query to get min max and avg of mynumber

4090734
getter	setter
here is the result of what we ve done so far ignore the fact that we have a million getter and setter -- it s a requirement for the project that we won t actually be implementing in that way

4090741
getter	setter
and as for your second question a property is distinct from it s getter setter methods

4090776
hide	show
i tried using show hide methods but this won t change the stack order

4090798
backgrounding	multitasking
if it is running in multitasking mode i imagine that you d be able to access location data through a backgrounding task

4090821
accessor	properties
as for the second question the custom attribute is set on the properties itself not on the properties accessor methods

4090822
rar	zip
how can i view rar or zip file content before downloading it

4090838
portrait	landscape
thanks for your code on fixing this for portrait and landscape

4090838
portrait	landscape
in my app this works because i just wanted to force them into portrait to start and if they move to landscape after that it rotates and works fine because i support all orientations

4090838
portrait	landscape
if its not then its in portrait and if it is then its landscape based on how the splitviewcontroller works by setting that to nil or not

4090868
superclass	subclassing
the first line of your subclassing constructor must be a call to super to ensure that the constructor of the superclass is called

4090914

i was under the impression that if a user attempted to visit a website that had been secured with an ssl certificate but did not use https and instead used plain http in the address box a 403

4091032
width	height
just create a coordinate region using the width and height of the latlonbox

4091056
vsto	add-in
currently all this is possible and simple to do with a .xlam what are the pros cons of moving to vsto or creating a c# add-in i notice vs2010 has a new project option of creating an excel 2007 add-in

4091068
uu-parsinglib	parsec
we ve had great success using uu-parsinglib - we ve switched to that from parsec as it s quite a bit more flexible and powerful - eg it can support lazy parsing if needed and you don t need to explicitly use a combinator like try in parsec to mark possible back-tracking points

4091083
google-chrome	safari
i am able to do js functions from a except for safari google-chrome

4091089
apache	nginx
i have nginx reverse proxying to apache and if i add deny from 111.111.111.111 to my htaccess it still allows them through as nginx doesn t forward the remote_addr ip of the visitor

4091140
drawingml	presentationml
you d need to create an xslt or use another transform technology such as linq in .net to convert presentationml and drawingml assuming powerpoint 2007 and later to a different mark up

4091162
versioning	upgrade
update i was asked which framework versioning we re using - it s 2.0rtm and it s extremely difficult to get upgrade past that point because it s on an xpe platform

4091173
subtract	add
interval is more portable than assuming that you can add or subtract days although i ve noticed some slight differences in the interval syntax between oracle and postgresql

4091189
width	height
for part 2 of your question simply add the icon to the itemtemplate and make it slide from outside and or grow changing width height with the vs animation

4091239

while your app tree may be in a full trust environment nothing is enforcing the rule for the public protected methods and classes

4091503
redhat	fedora
i know that revolution analytics recently released the revolutions 4 ide for redhat but i was wondering if anyone has tried to run this ide on either fedora or even ubuntu

4091503
ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
i know that fedora and redhat share a similar kernal while ubuntu used the debian kernel

4091509
free	malloc
_malloc_crt used elsewhere in the c runtime such as to allocate memory for the environment and for argv on the other hand calls straight to malloc and _free_crt calls straight to free

4091525
free	strdup
your string handling in numpair looks ok strdup + free and your field container delete looks okay but it s hard to say because you don t show what v_ is

4091577
post	get
i made the following entries into my route file so that the get for profile will route me to the profile action in the user controller and the post for profile will route to the update_profile action in the user controller

the strength of jsf is mainly being a java ee maintained standard and the availability of relatively a lot of 3rd party component libraries primefaces richfaces icefaces openfaces tomahawk etc

4091610
struts	stripes
you should pick a request action based mvc framework instead like spring mvc struts or stripes along with a js library like jquery

4091623
rar	zip
another answer is to encrypt the zip file or rar file

4091631
post	get
i want my app to be able to perform simple get and post requests to my server

4091639
google-chrome	firefox
you can also use a javascript profiler such as firebug in firefox the ie developer console in ie8 or higher developer tools in google-chrome etc

4091658
google-chrome	firefox
ie sends the whole path to the server on file upload while firefox google-chrome do not

4091690
put	get
if you can open a browser and put replace ip with your server s ip and assuming your server is answering on port 80 stock http port and get your server to respond then no you don t need a domain

4091721
hash	md5
the way i was thinking of implementing it is having a userdir column in the mysql db along side userid and password md5 hash although i understand userdir is a redundant key if userids are also unique - is this an issue to be worried about

4091751
disk	ram
we re testing a single instance of membase 1.6.0 on a large ec2 instance with 5gb ram 750gb disk linux fc8

4091751
disk	ram
i should also mention that this happens once the data is larger than ram and it s increasing size on the disk

4091778
public	protected
you can do this using the protected extensions for a protected function but it throws an exception if public

4091797
post	get
one solution is to change ape s default xhr method from post to get

4091806
telerik	radcombobox
1 rcbcomboboxinradpanel is a telerik radcombobox

4091812
google-chrome	firefox
i need an embeddable audio player that will play wav files in ie firefox and google-chrome

drive	createfile
these drive are not including as a physical drive and cannot be accessed using the devicestream class or createfile win32 api method as cited in the topic above

4091821
drive	createfile
the first cd-rom drive appears as device cdrom0 though attempting to open this via createfile will fail apparently per

4091826
int	chars
also it gives guarantees that say short is at least as big as chars int as big as short etc

4091864
int	chars
besides i suppose that because of some obfuscated necessity the second parameter has type int but is in fact a chars

4091864
int	chars
i think i am not wrong but can anyone explain to me why is it an int not a chars

4091874
range	minimum
the c standard do not explicitly say that long has to be at least 4 bytes but they do specify a minimum range for the different integral types which implies a minimum size

4091874
range	minimum
for example the minimum range of an unsigned long is 0 to 4 294 967 295

4091877
int	chars
so chars short int long long long

4091879
int	chars
the second parameter is of type int because in c chars constants like a are of type int

4091885
hash	md5
one thing that jumped out at me immediately was the md5 hash you provided.

4091885
hash	md5
in every case i ve tested my md5 hash end with two equals signs like the following captured from fiddler

4091921
width	height
but the images are still scaling that is unless i set them to a specific height width

4091940
put	get
however when i put it on the server i get a segmentation fault with the following traceback

4091954
pull	push
since case 2 can only make use of 4 threads and case 3 can make use of more it s not at all crazy to think that in the 4-thread case the clock speed wins but in the 8-thread case the increased memory contention 8 threads trying to pull in push out values tips the hand to the higher-bandwdith xeon

4091954
multiplying	add	cos	sin	cos	exp
if you want to try to see if finite memory bandwidth is playing a role here you can artificially add more computation to the problem eg multiplying exp sin a by cos b cos b or something to ensure the problem is compute-bound eliminating one variable as you try to get to the bottom of things

4091969
yacc	bison
lex yacc flex bison are the gnu versions - the old school industry standard

4092007
invokelater	invokeandwait
i think on the blackberry the right thing is invokelater or maybe invokeandwait depending on what you re trying to accomplish

4092007
invokelater	invokeandwait
if the timer thread is dedicated to this single purpose as it appears you can probably replace invokelater with invokeandwait if you like

4092014
ostream	istream
also it appears that the class declaration only needs a forward declaration of ostream and istream

4092024
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian .

4092062
int	chars
for example iirc on the ti c5x a long is 32 bits but sizeof long 2 because chars shorts and int are all 16 bits with sizeof chars 1

oledbcommand	sqlcommand
can you try using sqlcommand instead of oledbcommand

4092192
width	height
yup although youâ ll need an extra and this solution assumes the has a known fixed height and width

4092222
hash	md5
now for every link that goes from domain1.com to domain2.com you should add a _get variable that contains a randomly generated session id md5 hash will do

udp	tcp
qt c++ framework has a very good network class that i ve used for tcp and udp server client type connections

4092290
range	minimum
secondly the c language standard guarantees minimum range for each integer type these guarantees are present in both c and c++

4092290
range	minimum
knowing the minimum range for the given type you can always say how many value-forming bits this type is required to have as minimum number of bits

4092349
maven	m2e
nexus and sonatype are pretty much locked on maven and m2e

4092349
gradle	ivy	hudson	bamboo
artifactory provides an awesome hudson teamcity and bamboo integration and gradle ivy support

4092349
maven	m2e	nexus	artifactory
so while nexus gives you nothing once you step out of sonatype comfort zone maven m2e artifactory embraces and collaborates with all major build tools

4092349
nexus	artifactory
as you see artifactory thinks outside the box while nexus thinks inside the box and only cares about maven and maven artifacts

4092349
nexus	artifactory
artifactory has a simple and straightforward rest api don t know how it works for nexus

4092349
nexus	artifactory
but while nexus stops there being strictly a maven repository manager artifactory goes on and on being a general binaries storage for binaries of any kind from any build tool and ci server

4092359
hide	show
if you use a webkit-transition to show hide the element attaching the following event to the element appears to fix the select inside of it

everytime i press the back button i get the last string object that i put to my stack and set the jtextarea to this string object

4092511
interpreted-language	compiled-language
another is the namespacing - you can have a code to compress the lot into a single include file more meaningful in interpreted-language like php than in compiled-language

4092526
google-chrome	firefox
also you can run using the google-chrome backend which is firefox with lower security barriers

4092528
min	max
i also know i can chain max and min together

4092542
width	height
without hardcoding the width and height

4092558
maven	pom.xml
i would like to update my maven pom.xml with the latest hibernate hibernate-annotations and ehcache dependencies

4092565
min	max
if you wanted to you could even make the min max a list so it looks more mathematically pure

4092571
min	max
chaining max and min together is the normal idiom i ve seen

4092586
width	height
with images that resized to the div by absolute and the li which class .image_block which has width height and float at 100px so something like this

4092586
width	height
so what i want to acheive is as soon as i drag a picture from one of the random width height it adds .image_block

4092589
nsscanner	nsnumberformatter
i was originally using nsscanner because it was easier than nsnumberformatter to use but i ran into the same problem it doesn t parse the entire string just the first number in the string

4092619
children	parent
so the session that retrieves a parent may not be the same as the one asked to retrieve children

4092624
width	height
i was wondering if there was an inexpensive way to get the width and height of a jpeg after loading an array of bytes

4092624
width	height
i know jpegbitmapdecoder can get the jpeg s pixel width and height but it loads alot of information as well which i assume would be an expensive operation

4092624
width	height
is there another way to get the width and height from the array of bytes without decoding it

4092641
profiling	benchmarking
besides ruby-prof and and the core benchmarking class what do you use to profiling your ruby code

4092767
nsstring	nsdata
the data from the json string nsdata to nsstring is

4092771
post	get
another alternative may be to place the data as a hidden attribute in a form which uses the post method to get around the 1024 char limit and simulating a submission of the form in javascript to accomplish the redirect including the data

4092791
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a subclass of uiviewcontroller called helpviewcontroller that is created the same way as several other similar classes i have for adding to a uitabbarcontroller

okay well i figured out to do it knew it was simple just had to change the width and height of the ui.helper object with so heres how i done it

4092918
multiplication	modulo
modulo operations are expensive as are multiplication to a lesser extent

4092918
multiplication	modulo
the number of multiplication and modulo can be decreased by approximately a factor c 100 by switching the color-loop with the position-loop

4092918
multiplication	modulo
this allows you to add the return values of several calls to solve before doing a multiplication and modulo

width	height
i would then use that to help me construct the tags by using the src attribute data to lookup the values to use for the height and width attributes

4093133
width	height
so you could probably get away with just a pgf picture with 0 0 12.8 1.05 which would fill the whole width 0 - 12.8cm x width and just give you enough for the footer page number 0 - 1.05cm y height

then the variable two spaces and both a cr and linefeed are echoed into a file with notice the two spaces between the

4097156
spaces	linefeed
the reads the second token the delimters are standard spaces and tab so the second token is only a single cr as the following cr linefeed is removed as standard line ending

4097175
width	margin
i thought that there might be a way that once the menu has been created and the width is then known that you could then apply the margin settings

4097181
mouse	keyboard
since you re developing the app yourself you should be able to use the windows api directly to create and monitor mouse keyboard events

listview	gridview
in a listview i have a gridview where the row background is colored depending on a property of the item in the data context of the row

4097480
getter	setter
closure object is functionally equivalent to the following normal perl object but with faster method calls since there are no hash lookups or other dereferences around 40-50 faster for short getter setter type methods

4097480
getter	setter
which is around 70 faster than pre-caching a method from a normal object for short getter setter methods

4097482
firefox	safari
this happens only in ie7 - ie6 safari and firefox all behave as expected

4097493
width	height
if you want to display the entire image these should be the width and height of the image

versioning	upgrade
so if i have an aggregator project that lists 300 projects all that use apache commons-io and i want to upgrade them all the the latest versioning of commons-io i can just change the versioning in the dependencymanagement section of the root pom

4097595
int	double
this could cause some problems with high-valued int since the log2 function is casting to double and some numerical issues may arise

4097686
ssl	https
https ssl support

4097694
division	multiplication
i m doing multiplication and division of float s and int s and i forget the implicit conversion rules and the words in the question seem too vague to google more quickly than asking here

4097694
multiplying	multiplication
how about for multiplication â if i multiplying a float and an int is the answer a float

4097701
width	height
first of all the name of your function is misleading because what it does is not letterbox images regardless of the specific height width aspect ratio involved -- so here it s been renamed aspectcrop to better describe what it does

4097708
powermanager	batterymanager
i have read powermanager and batterymanager classes but they are of no use

4097754
uidatepicker	uipickerview
try using a uipickerview with different components and prepare a custom uidatepicker if you want

jdom	dom4j
it s important to note that my example code is for jdom not dom4j as the person was asking

4097874
for-loop	loops
but you notice that i am stuck - how can i loops the var in the of the for-loop

4097888
getter	setter
barring that it appears i should be able to workaround the problem using explicit getter setter but that is not very groovy

4097966
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it s true that under modern at least versions of firefox google-chrome opera and safari an anchor tag with an empty href href not a missing href will display as a normal link that simply doesn t respond when clicked unlike the hash-href which jumps to the top of the page

4097987
hide	show
first show the uiactivityindicatorview then spawn a new thread that loads the images then on the last line of the method that is executed in the new thread hide the uiactivityindicatorview

i m making use of red carrot s checkbox tree plugin but trying to adapt it to use with a nested list of radio button

4098324
children	parent
but any children of the deselected parent remain selected and the list does not collapse

4098324
button	checkbox
can anyone suggest what i might need to change in the script to achieve the same behaviour as with checkbox though retaining radio button behaviour of single selection allowed at each level

4098400
children	parent
i implemented a navigation system which switched between different view controllers with one parent handling the children

vmware	esx
simply running an installer should function the same under vmware as on the real pc especially if you are using vmware esx

4098537
profiling	instrumentation
your best bet is to learn a bit more about instrumentation and memory profiling so you can determine for yourself what the problem is

4098544
ant	maven
i d like to introduce maven to my fellow coworkers who mostly use ant to build their projects

4098556
subtraction	addition	division	subtraction	division	addition
that said it is possible to do a correctly rounded double precision division using only conversions between double and single double precision subtraction addition and single precision operations but it s pretty complicated if you really want to do it right

4098607
width	height
if you re setting its width and height with wrap_content it shouldn t matter but it s worth a try

4098618
int	boolean
but i want to do a search with 3 more parameters paramvaluationid int paramvalue boolean paramtitle string

4098658
getter	setter
but i guess that implies that there must be a getter for the property not only a setter

4098671
jms	jta
i m trying to use ehcache s transactional abilities together with atomikos and apache tomcat for usage with jms and hibernate but that s just to assure the sceptics i really need jta

put	get
i m currently working on a small poc where i m trying to put an instance of myvalue which implements serializable and when i try to commit the transaction i get the __ with classnotfoundexception as the root the stack trace is at the end

4098671
put	get
when i jar the myvalue file and put it under tomcat_home lib i get no exception

4098671
classcastexception	classnotfoundexception
if you don t do that you will get a noclassdeffounderrors or a classnotfoundexception or even a classcastexception during your web application deployment

4098672
scatter	graphing
i m trying to plot 2 scatter plot graphing on one report using ssrs2008

4098684
gif	png	tiff	png
the safari web content guide mentions that the maximum size for gif png and tiff images is 3 megapixels 3 1024 1024

4098753
getter	setter
if i take out the getter and setter methods then it doesn t work it tells me i need to create some getter and setter methods or use synthesize - but putting synthesize in the implementation throws an error too

4098753
getter	setter
but with the getter and setter methods i get an exc_bad_access and a crash

4098768
width	height
width and height are semantic in the case of img es and object s

4098779
punctuation	words
for example a person that types 60 wpm where words are an average of five chars is typing 360 characters per minute which includes spaces between words but excludes punctuation

4098809
width	height
you need to make sure the component uses the same width height padding and gutter settings

4098818
short	base	unsigned	short
as an alternative hack you might be able to get most of what you want using a base pointer and unsigned short offsets

4098847
width	height
you should set width and height properties of each img tag

4098875
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
according to the article google-chrome 4+ safari 5+ and opera 9.6+ all support the properties

this in combination with the getter and setter ensures that this invariant will hold true

4099002
128bit	64bit
so can you achieve 128bit atomic operations by doing 2 64bit ops with the lock prefix

4099060
jar	war
i have a multi module project consisting of several jar modules and a war module

4099062
getter	setter
obviously with obj-c there s usually no reason to write getter and setter thanks to useful mr synthesize

4099099
getter	setter
property syntax within the setter getter because that invokes the setter getter again instead of directly assigning to the variable

4099116
int	double
of course it would work for basic types like int and double but imagine a type with several different members

4099182
width	height
i think the simplest solution is to set the size of your usercontrol to some constant value where height width and then drop the whole thing in a viewbox which will handle the scaling whilst maintaining aspect ratio for you

4099185
innodb	myisam
i ve been reading up whether to use myisam or innodb for a log table lots of writes very few reads

4099187
textview	imageview
in a layout xml put a linearlayout oriented vertically containing first an imageview widget then a textview widget

4099199
for-loop	loops
a fortran do loops is the same as a matlab for-loop

4099221
google-chrome	safari
visit this url using safari or google-chrome browser

4099221
width	height
set the width of the browserâ s window to make sure the height of the green box is greater than the height of the red box

4099221
opera	firefox
the red box never disappears in other browsers ie firefox and opera

4099230
innodb	myisam
my guess is that for a log you would probably be doing only a few queries so myisam may be the best choice for you but if the log is being frequently displayed and filtered in your application then you should use innodb

4099244
folder	directory
usually i build publish the site to a folder on my dev machine ftp into the live server then drag-and-drop the new published files and folder to the live site while making sure not to overwrite any user-generated directory

4099250
uiview	subviews
for uiview subviews in view subviews

4099280
put	get
the instant you put a delete call into your code an exception can be thrown which would cause the delete to get skipped leaking memory

4099347
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
why might paging sorting grouping filtering â not work in the aspxgridview

4099380
zlib	libpng
you may want to check here for some uses for libpng which will need zlib

4099415
children	parent
there are any number of circumstances in which for instance the availability of commands in the parent view depend on the state of its children

4099435
persistent	transient
fredley s answer about sqlite or storage may be overkill if that data doesn t need to persistent beyond this one session in the activity or if the data you re working with is also transient network data that changes often that s temporarily loaded into an arrayadapter and in any case it s a bit misleading because just dumping data to disk doesn t solve the fundamental issue with your conflation of views of data with your models

4099438
keydown	keyup
use keypress instead of keyup keydown because the latter two do not accurately protray the keycode reference see last paragraph

4099443
accelerometer	gyroscope
looking at the magnitude of each of accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer data using norm and plotting these over time

4099452
hide	show
if the textbox is already visible the code should hide it and create a new usercontrol in its place that show the text see below for details of that usercontrol

4099472
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
edit this works in every browser i ve tried including opera safari google-chrome firefox ie6 7 8 9

4099480
folder	directory
the easiest way is to have a directory that s outside of your code folder where you store the user data

4099528
hash	salt
but more important than strength of the salt is the way you hash it

4099564
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works fine on firefox and google-chrome not with ie

4099566
versioning	upgrade
note that this approach also would allow you to create more advanced scenarios like prompting the user to upgrade to a different versioning of the app pro for example or that they need to upgrade their silverlight to get the latest

4099608
viewdidload	viewwillappear
this all works fine but the caveat is that the size of the scroll view and any other view for that matter is adjusted to the orientation of the device not in the viewdidload method but in the viewwillappear method

4099610
google-chrome	firefox
when i m working on this via everything works perfectly ie 8 firefox google-chrome - it all works

4099610
google-chrome	firefox
again - works perfect on firefox google-chrome when called by anything - just not ie 8

4099619
post	get
my php script parse the user information from my mysql data base and shows it when a get or post action is made

4099664
stringstream	ifstream
the ifstream will use a buffer however so while that s probably faster than reading into a string then creating a stringstream it may not be any faster than working directly from the input stream

4099673
width	height
this sets the default width height and background for all buttons

4099673
width	height
note that when you drag an image onto the design surface in visual studio 2010 it sets the width and height for you

4099673
width	height
you need to remove the width and height from the button elements themselves to enable the style to control those properties

4099751
hide	show
i assume this is to do with a gallery not having scrollbars to show hide

4099814
width	height
so when i create say a rectangle in wpf with width and height both set to 96 the size of the rectangle actually depends on which screen it appears on

4099834
innodb	myisam
also myisam has table-level locking while innodb uses row-level locking which won t make much different for a high-read low-write table

4099916
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload or viewdidappear

4099929
google-chrome	firefox
this would need to work in ie6+ firefox and google-chrome

4099993
width	height
setpixels int pixels int offset int stride int x int y int width int height
