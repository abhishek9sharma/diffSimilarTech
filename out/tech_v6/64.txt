error-handling	exception-handling
all in all exception-handling is the way to go but if this is not possible for some reason i have to disagree with the majority of the answers here and suggest something like getlasterror for larger less disciplined teams i d say return errors through the call stack for smaller more disciplined ones on the basis that if a returned error status is ignored this allows us to at least notice an error later and it allows us to retrofit error-handling into a function that wasn t properly designed to return errors by simply modifying its implementation without modifying the interface

this behavior was actually added to a recent build of gecko firefox s layout engine in this bug report along with this rather short mailing list thread and it was implemented in webkit many years back

i have no problems when using firefox google-chrome opera or ie9 but in ie8 ie7 and ie6 not that i should care about ie6 none of the links work

9102701
projectile	angle
the best solution i could find was to add two properties to the projectile class to store the sine and cosine of the initial angle

9102701
cos	sin
the loop that moves your bullets is simplified too now that there is no sin cos call for every projectile on the screen

9102707

subtract	add
but every time you add or subtract two floating point numbers you ve got a chance of introducing an error whose size is the last bit of the largest operand

subtract	add
the trick then is to reduce the number of add and subtract currently you re doing 6 every zoom step and make sure your errors don t accumulate on every iteration

9102987

9103284
hide	show
the problem was that we were putting many uiviews over one another so when i was trying to hide and show the buttons the view on which these buttons were being hidden or show was simply hidden behind another view....so always check how many views you are creating only create it once in one place

width	height
if you take a square width height and chop off a fixed portion from one side you no longer have a square and you have to think about what that means to your graph

9103878

9113053
prepare	execute
prepare your statement as string and then execute it

9113100
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
secondly the browsers above ie7 and other browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari have a better rendering engine and intuitively handle buggy markup

9113100
google-chrome	firefox
whereas in other browsers like firefox google-chrome even though the markup is invalid they handle it intuitively as even though the div has 99 and is a block element but its parent span is a inline element it occupies the height based on the amount of the content behaves correctly and return proper height

9113136
opera	google-chrome
for example in google-chrome 18 the first variations of the temporary swap and xor swap are over 60 slower than the second variations but in opera 12 both variations of the temporary swap and xor swap have similar performance

google-chrome 15 firefox 10 and safari 5.1 now provide apis to programmatically trigger fullscreen mode

9113223
for-loop	arrays
but you could avoid for-loop sorting arrays in descend mode so you could delete all the rest of arrays saving just the first file

9113228
yslow	pagespeed
have a look at the yslow plugin and pagespeed both very useful in improving performance

9113249

9113459
children	parent
if you use inheritance and query for parent classes you can t get children while you can with sqlalchemy

9113475
superclass	subclassing
you could make the superclass a mappedsuperclass and not define the id in it then you could define it differently in the subclassing

9113516
innodb	myisam
talks about innodb but we use myisam and could move to innodb as a final resort

9113537
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 15 firefox 10 and safari 5.1 now provide apis to programmatically trigger fullscreen mode

9113538

rss	feed
the two files i have included get me through my university s proxy server and the config holds my mysql database details and urls for the rss feed

9113669
division	modulo
we need to use modulo and division to achieve the conversion

9113669
division	multiplication
most optimizing c compilers optimize it out to a multiplication operation which is much faster than division it can be done only if the divisor is constant though

9113738
perl	tcl
i m attempting to implement the tcl dictionary sort in perl in order to order some files

9113757
versioning	upgrade
you will find that a jquery update does not normally include many breaking changes changes that will break code used with a previous versioning and so for the majority of cases you should not get any problems when you upgrade

9113773
stdout	stderr
simply redirect stderr to stdout

9113801
int	chars
i know i could do that in this way described below but the problem is the value may be variable and it is a column type chars not int

9113842
folder	directory
if it is related to your workspace have a look at the files in the .settings folder in your workspace directory

9113885

you can use the itemscontrol.itemcontainergenerator to get a tabitem out of your tabcontrol then you can use findname on the tabitem.contenttemplate to search for named instantiated controls

9113912
allocator	stl
can we place any stl in the shared_memory by providing custom allocator

9113919
getter	setter
also dont miss to add getter setter for msg variable in your redirectedpageaction action

9113955
int	boolean
you can t cast a boolean to an int

9113955
int	boolean
but you can write a utility method booleantoint boolean b which transforms a boolean into an int

9113961
int	boolean
i think they want you to literally replace boolean with int true with 1 and false with 0 like this

9113965
hash	salt
i would also prefer to rely on some kind of secret token perhaps a hash of the password and some server-provided salt which could be intercepted and spoofed

9113967
hide	show
then you can add a uibarbuttonitem that when triggered it calls a toggle method to show or hide the toolbar

9113971
int	boolean
you can t cast directly from a boolean to an int in java

9113977
int	boolean
you cannot cast int to boolean in java

9113995
pop-up	dialog
my expectation is that this will pop-up the download dialog on the browser

9113995
client-side	server-side
as it is the javascript array being passed to the controller is null on the server-side it works correctly client-side

9114027
children	parent
we spawn 6 child processes to php-cgi thinking that this will limit the maximum of persistent connections open to 7 1 for the parent process and 6 for the children

9114044
width	height
is there any way to get rid of this behavior and resize images to 100 of the stage width height if possible

9114044
width	height
stage width height is set on init

9114083
width	height
determine the visible area using modulo arithmetics over the size of the game area mod w and h where these are the width and height of the table

9114083
width	height
if the table is 80x100 0 0 top left coordinates with a width of 80 and height of 100 and the rect of the viewport is at 70 90 with a width of 40 and height of 20 you index with 70-79 0-29 for the x coordinate and 90-99 0-9 for the y

9114083
width	height
or 100 where n is the top coordinate x or y for the rect and i is in the range for the width height of the viewport

9114107
ant	maven
for reference you may want to look at the source for the maven-idea-plug it generates .iml files for a maven project and may provide you with a hint on how todo this with ant

9114119
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
got the answer from apple basicaly it would be more complicated to do this in the nsviewcontroller so i just implement it in a nswindowcontroller

9114119
nswindow	nsapplication
according to the documentation that message is sent to the objects in the responder chain plus nsapplication is documented as sending it to its delegate and nswindow sends it to its delegate

9114132
stateless	stateful
i have a stateful bean injecting a jpa persistenceunit and another stateless bean

9114151
getter	setter
imho the whole point of using getter setter instead of public methods is to allow you to do things when properties are changed

9114176
express	node.js
what open source node.js and express projects are there

9114187
tcpclient	networkstream
2.pull a networkstream out of the tcpclient by calling getstream

9114209
innodb	myisam
the script was tested using myisam and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than innodb

9114209
innodb	myisam
why is innodb so much slower than myisam in my case

9114226
uiview	subviews
textfieldkpd then creates a uiview keypad subviews which itself creates 13 uibutton subviews for itself

9114236
put	get
getting a hold of the servletrequest should be enough to put you on track to get the ip address

9114251
public	protected
derived class can access all public and protected members of base class but not private members

9114289
pdcurses	ncurses
i ve found pdcurses which is more like the ncurses but it lacks a lot of ncurses libraries

9114295
filtering	grouping
note the use of where on the selection of the orders grouping is so that null orders are filtering out at this point instead of ending up with a grouping containing a single null order for customers who don t have orders

9114323
content-disposition	content-type
i haven t - because i don t know how to - set content-disposition or content-type for example

9114324
innodb	myisam
innodb provides more complex keys structure than myisam foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in innodb

9114326
width	height
you just haven t set the width and height properties of the webbroswer so it is defaulting to 0 x 0

9114341
post	put
so in route module it s still a post request not a put

9114365
screens	hdpi
bitmap is defined only for hdpi screens and the padding attributes are given in dp

9114368
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
also once the inherited comes into play this becomes even more complicated - to deal with as transient properties may be in both subclassing and the parent

9114393
implements	extends
the way i implements contexts in rails was by creating a directory app contexts for modules which extends the controller actions

9114393
put	get
this method requires developers to have remember to put the hidden field in every form on the site and it doesn t work for get requests

9114415
width	height
no point setting the style if its just a in-memory canvas and you shouldn t really ever want to set the width and height style of a canvas anyway it just confounds things

9114447
width	height
i was able to get an image to partially render by setting height width properties on the image element

9114447
width	height
rather it s showing up as a thin long line which is equal to it s height but the width is only 3 px

9114447
width	height
the image height width were 380 680

9114450
fadein	hide
if this is a single level drop-down then there are many ways to achieve this using the fadein .fadeout or .show hide works great for showing and hiding objects such as dropdown content

9114457
post	get
in my code i need to connect to g+ via api and get the post of g+ pages

9114493

if the latter you should do that in rowdatabound of the gridview

9114581
uiview	subviews
is there an easy way for listening for when a child or subviews has been added to a uiview

9114581
width	height
content width or height positions etc

9114591
move	drag
iâ m not sure if the best term is resistance or elasticity but iâ m looking for the feel as if an element is attached to a point by a rubber band or bungee cord so that the further you drag the less the object move

9114600
textview	imageview
each row contains two textview and an imageview

9114600
textview	imageview
i populate the textview from a json file but this works fine so i think you can safely ignore this and i populate the imageview based on sharedpreferences...which is where the problem lies

9114652
couchbase	couchdb
it is written in objective c so it can be included in ios applications and it s able to replicate with other couchdb couchbase instances

9114656
punctuation	words
first observation replace each words with a single letter in a big alphabet hash the worlds in some way remove whitespaces and punctuation

9114680
width	height
the form allows users to submit info and also upload an image the form s target is the iframe which is set height 0 width 0

9114686
doc	rtf
officewriter is another potential solution for you if you need true doc and docx as opposed to rtf or some other format

9114687
button	checkbox
and on button click i want that atleast one checkbox selection is required

9114717
error-handling	exception-handling
the tendency by some has been to approach the diagrams with a legalistic bent and worry about things like when to use for related use cases or how to express error-handling as exception-handling to a defined list of process tasks

9114752
backtracking	greedy
but we can at least improve it by changing to to prevent useless greedy that will just have to be backtracked again and wrapping the second in to prevent backtracking that can t help

9114779
cpu	processors
the instruction pointer is a special purpose register see this article for a list of all the 8086 registers inside the 8086 central processors unit cpu

9114810
alarmmanager	chronometer
hello i m new to java and android i m trying to use alarmmanager with a chronometer to display a toast every 10 seconds after the startbutton is pressed

9114866
put	get
all multy key s probably fail cause the put key1 key2 val and the get null key2 end up using the equals of key1 key2 and null key2

9114866
put	get
i think the way to go is using a index decorator see the key1 key2 examples above and if the extra index key s are properties of the stored value you can use the property name s and reflection to build the secondairy maps when you put key val and add an extra method get propertyname propertyvalue to use that index

9114899
move	drag
i ve read about the drag drop but that s a bit annoying if you want to move to the other corner of the city because you have to move step by step the pin

9114900
uiview	subviews
uiview has 2 methods to call after subviews interactions

9114937
hide	show
i want to hide tags from 00 00 to 07 00 and when page load my table show from 08 00 but i want to have a possibility scrolling to first element in table

9114943
post	get
is it possible to pass the data with a post request or get parameter

9114988
folder	directory
it works if you tell it what folder to index and remember checking off the include directory for each of them

9114992
keydown	keyup
these are keyup and keydown methods implemented using sendinput with the known scan code keyeventf_scancode in keybdinput struct

9115013
width	height
something standard like dc makes sense but i suspect there are also some image-specific schema lying around out there that you could make use of if you want to annotate specific details of the image width height resolution etc

9115017
simpleadapter	simplecursoradapter
i tried simpleadapter and simplecursoradapter but content is a type of object doesn t fit with the adapters

9115020
g++	gcc
will the order of declared fields be respected versus any optimization or possible implementation of gcc g++

9115028
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
seems to work fine on other browsers tested on google-chrome firefox safari

9115075

one possible solution is to extends the diy usb fan with a usb circuit board implements the switch on off logic with all the adaptations effort it takes

9115087
folder	directory
i need to attach my database that resided in the mydata directory of my application folder to the instance of sql server on client s machine

9115100
g++	gcc
or possible implementation of gcc g++

9115108
post	get
the first problem you are having is in mvc you don t need to add the .aspx to the file in the url the route handles that here is a blog post that show you how to get this to work

9115111
public	protected
in c++ of course that is only true if it is a standard layout type that is roughly a class or struct with no public private protected mixed members no virtual functions and no members inherited from other classes

9115113
post	get
this is probably some thing very simple and i tried a couple of things and various post but none seem to get it working

9115171
maven	m2e
i m using eclipse to work on a spring project that is controlled via maven well the m2e plugin in eclipse

9115171
maven	pom.xml
whenever i make a change to the maven pom.xml file the interface complains and says i subsequently need to run update project configuration from the maven item seen in the context menu when you right-click the top-level project

9115187
google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine in firefox but not google-chrome

9115187
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox size increments whereas google-chrome size stays equal to 0

9115203
datamapper	activerecord
also look at datamapper 2 the first one was similar to activerecord

9115260
width	height
use background url image link no-repeat and define then define your width and height also make sure you define text-indent -9999px or a higher number this way you will be left with image and your text would be out of the screen

9115279
spaces	delimiter
i can create it as one string delimiter by spaces

9115297
google-chrome	firefox
for example we would represent ãƒ ã ãƒ³ãƒšãƒ¼ã as when writing our http headers and google-chrome and firefox seem to understand this in a graceful way

9115302
mdpi	hdpi
i am confused about how to use the ldpi mdpi and hdpi folders and how to properly position sprites to draw over a surfaceview canvas

9115302
screens	hdpi
so far everything is fine they are correctly placed in my hdpi 480x800 screens

9115307
nunit	mstest
it was originally created as a class project for nunit instead of as a mstest project

9115309
width	height
to make sure that i get the correct height and width of the area i want to show on an image

9115366
stdout	stderr
ps typically tmp contains directories which can not be read by normal users so running ls -lar tmp produces output to both stdout and stderr

9115366
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout and stderr to

9115367
pop-up	dialog
currently i expose actions to item in a listview using long click to pop-up an alert dialog

9115398
put	get
this code which you d normally put into a get or set method would then be by-passable by any developers who make use of the code in the future but who don t necessarily know the code as well as you

9115413
dictionary	map
i would like to transform this object and properties into a dictionary map to make it easier to iterate

9115454
boost	stl
is there any other merging function in the stl or in boost that i could be using

9115471
for-loop	arrays
you could also preallocate the arrays and use a for-loop to set the value of each field

9115479
portrait	landscape
my page could be a3 or a4 and landscape or portrait

9115481
tablet	galaxy
i connect a samsung galaxy android tablet with a usb cable to computer running windows 7

9115504
jobs	cron
i have zero understanding of cron jobs so i think that is out unless someone wants to help me out with that

9115506
post	get
1 - i have to get all the users who s post match the current project

9115517
int	chars
then you think const3 is int but if you put it in a float it would become float at compile-time or if you put it in a chars it would become chars at compiler-time

9115568
portrait	landscape
basically i have a text area that looks good when it loads whether in portrait or landscape but when the device is rotated it does not resize

9115592
width	height
i don t know why width and height are declared outside of rectangle in your code

9115605
pdfsharp	migradoc
migradoc uses pdfsharp

9115622
width	height
in your example width and height are global

9115622
width	height
it also has width and height naturally

9115623
for-loop	arrays
and then you write of the end of the arrays in the for-loop because the arrays is only half as long as you think it is

9115633
inherited	properties
is there be a way to set the modal dialogs so that they inherited the status of the parent and get hidden in a cascade just by setting the properties on the first form

9115635
post	get
but i cant figure out how get that into my post form

9115640
width	height
yes you can calculate it using device width and height

9115661
pop-up	dialog
can you put your dialog xaml in a pop-up window

9115664
width	height
to get this to behave how you are expecting you will need to create instance properties rather than using the global variables width and height

9115664
width	height
as others have noted the global variables width and height will be shared by all other code in the current scope nb

9115671
getter	setter
also to prevent the problem mð î î ð ð ll described in the comment while still keeping the private properties and getter setter this is the way to go

9115671
width	height
much easier is anyway to use public properties as stated in other answer unless you really care for the integrity of the width and height vars

9115679
width	height
width and height should be this.width and this.height otherwise you will modify the global width and height variables and those values won t be tied to the single instance of rectangle

9115679
width	height
initial width and height of your object can be passed in the constructor function for initialization otherwise width and height are set to 0 - or other any value - by default

9115682
opera	google-chrome
also the production channel of google s google-chrome now supports webrtc and so does opera

9115709
int	chars
where chars has as many bits as int

9115709
int	chars
there is a system where this can be a problem 16-bit chars and int and the system used a 16-bit chars code utf-16 where the high bit can be set

9115709
int	chars
with chars signed it will promote to signed int and can safely be passed to the family of functions

9115709
int	chars
with chars unsigned it will promote to unsigned int and the cast to signed int may be undefined

9115709
int	chars
on such a system your code is indeed broken but that would be your own fault for the completely unnecessary conversion to unsigned chars and the dangerous on this system cast int uchar

9115709
int	chars
to summarize on systems with it is the implementationâ s responsibility to ensure that every code point when stored in a chars variable can safely be passed to the ctype.h functions which expect int arguments

9115733
put	get
and if you re looking at address data then you can be fairly sure that odd characters are going to get put in there

9115753
min	max
the factor 2.55 comes from the given max min values of 0â and 100â celsius

9115773
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in firefox safari google-chrome and ie and it works across the board except for ie 9

9115817
getter	setter
the whole benefit of using getter setter methods over public fields is that they allow you to do more than just set a field

9115825
for-loop	arrays
so what you do in the for-loop is sequentially fill data while the data just as well could be interpreted as a single arrays containing the whole block of data or as a pointer

9115866
put	get
i m doing a qt project where i m having some qlineedit that whatever i put into them it doesn t get any data and in others i don t have this problem

9115882
visualvm	jhat	visualvm	oql	oql	jhat

background-color	transparency
when i set the divs background-color transparency in firefox everything works as planned which is the div gets the click and the input below it does not

9120294
maven	pom.xml
the dependency plugin seems to be only interested in the dependencies that are listed in the dependency section of the pom.xml but there doesn t seem to be a way to show the parent poms which are also required dependencies for maven to work

9120304
queue	fifo
but if i have several nodes and load balancer in front then i can not guarantee fifo ordering of requests for async execution for the same client since i have already several queue

instead of setting background-color to transparency set opacity to 0 it will work in ie too

9120344
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
you can use an nsbitmapimagerep to build up an nsimage float-by-float

9120344
put	get

after that ondestroy and oncreate will not be called when orientation changes

9120399
folder	directory
since i have no way of detecting the completion of those ftp uploads i set him up with a special ftp account that is rooted into the uploads directory and designed an interface that monitors that folder and allows him to start transcoding those files for web at his discretion

9120423
portrait	landscape
it uses screen size 1 in landscape mode and size 2 in portrait mode

9120423
portrait	landscape
edit in big devices like 10 landscape mode uses xlarge layout and portrait mode uses the other layout

9120431
integer	unsigned
65535 happens to be 2 16 - 1 which is the maximum number than can be represented in an unsigned 16-bit integer

9120485
folder	directory
they also need to reside in the same folder directory

9120504
implements	extends
you would need to implements your own appender class that extends appenderbase and configure the siftingappender to use it

9120531
mouseover	mouseout
because the mouseout event always happens before the mouseover event one unique temporary class name is enough to deal with all elements

9120548
folder	directory
they also need to reside in the same folder directory

9120549
clang	llvm
you can run clang fronted to emit llvmir then start opt program with some optimizations then with other and there will be llvm ir bitcode files between phases

however i want it so that if you click another it will hide the one currently being show and then show the one you clicked

9120583
folder	directory
or create a folder in xcode and drag the directory into the project

9120602
multiplying	modulo
another thing to try is just a straight divide see if divide works but not modulo maybe the problem is the multiplying instruction

9120637
fflush	gets
some automated backup software will issue a fflush tables command before commencing with a backup but this command gets replicated to the other db server

9120646

int	double
is there a way i can multiply divide long long int and get a double as an answer keeping up to 3 decimals as precision

9120774
innodb	myisam
if you re using myisam then this is a limitation of your storage engine and you should look at innodb instead

9120785
google-chrome	safari	yslow	pagespeed
yslow just like pagespeed web inspector audits in safari google-chrome developer tools audits cannot know whether you can control the affected resources or not so they will suggest that you apply every fix possible

9120803
int	double
cast at least one of the long long int s to double

9120813
floating-point	integer
if you want to perform floating-point arithmetic on integer values you need to convert them to a floating-point type

9120813
division	multiplication
note that converting just the first operand is enough to cause both the multiplication and the division to be done in type double

9120827
queue	fifo
use ehcache or some other distributed cache i built a queue wrapper around ehcache to enable it to be used like a fifo queue and it also has rmi or jms replication so multiple nodes will see the same data

9120865
min	max
you can do pretty much everything you want - restrict days set min or max date etc

9120866
ember.js	javascriptmvc
i m new to ember.js as well as javascriptmvc frameworks

9120875
firefox	safari
as of now my code works in firefox but safari still loads the bookmark associated with that number

9120912
margin	height
should i just target each images and count the container height and use the remainer as top margin or is there easier solution

9120933
put	get
if i do put the left join then i get an error that the b.b_id is an unknown column

9120939
punctuation	words
replace each words with a single letter in a big alphabet hash the worlds in some way remove whitespaces and punctuation

9120970
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works fine for firefox google-chrome safari but it stays with a 200px height in ie unless in quirks mode

9121036
lxml	beautifulsoup
you should not use regex for these purposes use a parser like lxml or beautifulsoup

9121065
inline	constexpr
in c++11 you can initialize arbitrary constexpr essions from constant expressions inline

9121069
getter	setter
and remake your getter setter for it

9121174
typedef	struct
an anonymous struct with a typedef in the global namespace

9121174
typedef	struct
a tagged struct with a typedef in the global namespace

9121174
typedef	struct
specifically the global typedef label cmtime is bound to an anonymous struct in the struct namespace and may not be referenced unless its declaration is visible

9121174
typedef	struct
the complications worsen when the the struct s typedef is distinct from its tag

9121178
width	height
set the image width ensuring that it scales it s height proportionally

9121214
min	max
your min max and step values look a bit weird but i guess you just got them mixed up

9121234
post	get
if i get rid of this you can view the post but pagination doesn t work

9121243
children	parent
my suggestion would be to pass a reference to your parent view model to the children on construction

9121244
free	malloc
if i am loading variables into this new space using assembly code and it isn t enough to fill the whole space should the variables be pushed in at the beginning of the free space or pushed to the point where the last variable would take up the last amount of free space given from malloc

9121279
hide	show
i have a page that uses rich fileupload and a a4j commandbutton what i want to achieve is the first time the page is loaded the fileupload shoul appear be rendered my backingbean default is true and so it renders correctly and when the user hits the commandbutton i would love to hide the fileupload and show an outputtext this is not happening no error at all

9121279
hide	show
is seems that formrendered is always evaluated to true when i want it to be false once a user clicks the button and so the fileupload hide and show the outputtext

9121283
free	malloc
see the question how do malloc and free work

9121330
google-chrome	firefox
it is really fast in google-chrome but slow in ie and firefox

9121334
free	malloc
avoids n calls to malloc free it s faster and simpler to allocate deallocate

9121357
for-loop	arrays
you can try length cacheing - create a variable for example and use that in the for-loop s condition rather than getting the length property every time - depending on the implementation there is usually an overhead with looking up an arrays s length so if you have a big arrays this difference can be noticeable

9121357
put	get
also create temporary variables to keep your str and ank strings as they get bigger then only put them in the innerhtml right at the end

9121362
pop-up	dialog
when a user clicks my download link there is a slight pause between the click and when the download dialog pop-up in the users browser this is because my server is creating a zip of a bunch of files and it could take a short while

9121362
onsubmit	onload
im using a hidden iframe to trigger the download and the onload onsubmit events seem to fire before the popup is shown when the iframes src attribute is set or when the iframes is added to the dom

9121367
google-chrome	firefox
i can kind of hack it to do what i want in firefox and google-chrome out of the box does it the way i want by setting the height of column b to less than the size of it s content

9121370
jobs	cron
if you server supports cron jobs use them

9121374
ddms	adb
using adb push to add files i was expecting to see the list change but although the files show up the ddms perspective they are not in the data directory that my app is looking at and thus the activity is displaying empty as shown in the code below

9121382
jtextfield	jdatechooser
field component usually a jtextfield but it also could be a jcombobox or a jdatechooser control

9121408
int	double
however when i tried removing the static assert to take a look at the alternative compiler error i was shocked to discover that gcc doesn t even complain when you try to make a const double referring to an int

9121408
int	double
on my machine int is 4 bytes and a double is 8

9121408
int	double
that means that when printing a double it should interpret 8 bytes at that address as a double and print it yet there is actually a 4 byte int at that location

9121415
dictionary	map
i would change to using a dictionary variable that would let you easily map string names to values

9121421
solaris	aix
it needs to be cross platform compatible between windows aix and solaris

9121430
rtp	rtcp
the rtp specification says that the rtcp packets for a given rtp stream will be sent on a port that is +1 of the main rtp port

9121430
rtp	rtcp
so for example if you have video arriving on rtp port 9010 then on port 9011 you can expect rtcp packets

9121430
rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	rtsp	rtcp
when i m negotiating a unicast stream via the rtsp protocol i have to suggest pair of ports that i would like the video sent to me on 1 for rtp and 1 for rtcp .

9121430
rtp	rtcp
the problem i have is that i actually need a pair of ports and i need the rtcp port to be +1 of the rtp port in fact i think i need the rtp port to be an even number

9121440
post	get
if you can post more details about your intended use case you ll probably get better answers

9121466
accessor	properties
a warning is raised stating that the properties type does not match the accessor type

9121472
free	realloc
the second array of actual structures might be significantly larger by sizeof struct foo times the number of elements and growing the array even slightly might run out of memory if realloc 3 does not have sufficient free space to work with

9121500
post	get
however reading again of a javascript variable to a php variable i see that you would like to pass a variable from javascript to php which you have several methods to do in a form via get or post in a link via get or via ajax

9121503
gtk#	monomac
for windows it uses winforms or wpf for linux it uses gtk# and for os x it uses monomac cocoa

9121606
free	malloc
i guess using malloc and free withing the same scope produces overhead but what s the alternative

9121639
for-loop	loops
but then when you loops back to the begining of the for-loop q is incremented to 2 so you look at hedf next skipping fedf

9121656
getter	setter
for instance if methods including getter or setter are called on the objects provide mocks or stubs that you can verify had the expected things called

9121666
button	checkbox

9121766
forth	rebol
the three languages i like best for this type of thing is rebol forth and factor

9121779
popupwindow	pop-up
i use a popupwindow in my activity that i would like to dimiss but i see the following documentation about the dimiss method for pop-up windows

9121787

9121857
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
setup triggered by navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller x

9121859
pop-up	dialog

9121889
superclass	subclassing
this function should then reconvert the superclass back to their respective subclassing

9121905
post	put
however you will run into issues because after a like facebook also likes to put up a dialog that allows the liker to post a link to their wall about it

9121922
mouse	keyboard
i have two shared libraries one for setting up windows and rendering to them with opengl and another seperate input library which gathers mouse and keyboard input for the windows which are created in the rendering library

9121963
ciimage	uiimage
in the uiimage docs under the ciimage property it says if the uiimage object was initialized using a cgimageref the value of the property is nil. apparently the uiimagepickercontroller does initialize the image from a cgimageref because this property is indeed nil

9121990
put	get
but i get all sorts of errors when i try to put code that actually draws something into a page or block.

9122004
folder	directory
the following command displays the working folder mappings for the workspace in the current directory

9122006

9122008
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	pop-up	dialog
the following code produces the expected jqueryui modal pop-up dialog in firefox google-chrome and opera

both memcmp and strcmp will work fine

9122054
draggable	droppable

9122249
vim	emacs
i think if say some vim users or people who want the post management but not org-mode publish but perhaps markdown or something else right now its hard-coded to just open emacs - if those people wanted to help make this more generic then well that d be great

9122260
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
your example from fiddle works fine on my firefox 10 google-chrome 16 ie 8 and opera 10 something

put	get
it would put a session cookie in the first dynamic response that would get tracked throughout

9122266
hide	show	qmouseevent	qkeyevent
to do this with a key press or a mouse click you need to reimplement qkeyevent and qmouseevent for all widgets that will have the focus when you want the fullscreen show and the fullscreen hide as an available option

9122885
rdf	owl
there s nothing at the level of turtle itself but you could use owl imports for referencing other rdf files

my personal thought is that it is better to put it in post for a couple of reasons

9132638
post	get
it is more semantic to look at things that change something on the server should always be sent via post and things that only change what is requested should be sent through get

cucumber	simplecov
background running rails 3.2 cucumber 1.1.4 and simplecov 0.5.4

stdout needs to end up in a file and stderr needs to end up in perl

9132832

google-chrome	firefox
turn on console in google-chrome or firebug in firefox see what s breaking it on the live site

9132851

i m trying to get a vector of a vector and my friend told me that it s inefficient to put a vector of a vector because it uses sequential memory and vector of a vector will require huge amounts of space

9132856
cvs	svn
i used to work with cvs for several years but for some reason the company started to create all of their projects to svn

9132856

next thing i know is that i have to convert my current netbeans java cvs project into a svn one

9132861

this is possible by using the fileapi that is part of html5 but it s only supported in modern browsers webkit gecko and the api is not completely finished yet so it s kind of a changing target

9133047
stdout	stderr
well there are generic ways to do it within perl too but the bash solution which the above makes me think you re looking for is to redirect stderr first to stdout and then redirect stdout to a file

9133047
stdout	stderr
however do not do it the other way ie put the 2 1 at the end or else all the output of both stdout and stderr will go to your file

9133055
post	put
instead of putting the link in the message parameter you can put it in the link parameter of your http post to the graph api

9133065
stdout	stderr
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately it s

crypt	md5
the othe question you refer to only provides links to the traditional crypt 3 method based on des and the 1 method based on md5

post	get
well how does your code look which is the result you expect which one do you get if you get an error post the exact error message

9133311
children	parent
set a fixed height for the parent then set the children with height 100 meaning 100 of the parent element

9133312

by giving .artist-container a higher z-index you are placing it higher in the stacking order than the child image though children always have a higher z-index than their parent

mouse	keyboard
another good strategy would be to build a program that simply runs the gui of your export program by sending mouse and keyboard events directly to it

9134362
for-loop	arrays
if you are using your own set up webserver you could enable curl where you can parse the xml sourcecode saving it into variables and showing it step by step using an arrays and a for-loop

9134362
explode	substr
so you know what the source actually looks like when using curl next step is to find the specific data in that url and parse your way to that point using explode creates arrays and substr and you can save those into an array like

9134382
ready	each
each document ready block will be run sequentially as shown here

9135945
hash	salt
make sure you salt your hash - this prevents rainbow attacks or at least requires the rainbow-attacker build a table with your salt in mind

9135945
hash	salt
for example hash hash card#+salt1 +expiredate+salt2 - requires knowledge of both the card # and the date to generate easy for you but can t easily be reverse-engineered rainbow requires for every card # every useful expire date + knowledge of both salt

9135945
hash	salt
dynamic salt throwing a random value into the hash is great for reducing rainbow attacks - you store that random piece in the table with the hash value - now when building a rainbow you have to build one for every dynamic salt

9135945
hash	salt
however for your needs you can t do this - you need to know the right random salt to use the second time you create the hash otherwise you ll never get an intercept on the second card use .

9136356
innodb	myisam
if you are not using innodb table and instead are using myisam you can use mysql s built in full text search

9136357

this scenario assumes you have premade views ready for each controller scenario i included action code as well in case you wanted to use that

9136992
ready	each
if no premade views are ready then just put in the code that should show up for each case instead of rendering another view

note that sometimes hiding for example button or checkbox is not the best solution

9137134
hide	show
to use a uiactivity view just show it in the webview s didstartload delegate method and hide it in the didfinishload

9137180
superclass	subclassing
so basically you can call a superclass from your class but not a subclassing

9137180
superclass	subclassing
there s no relation there unless you initialize your subclassing by passing a reference of itself to it s superclass

9137189
move	drag
as i drag the slider i m hoping to get the above-specified behavior but all that s happening is the squares are rotating as they should while the lines do nothing they should move up and down with the squares

in this function i check model properties and call model.trigger hide or model.trigger show

9137201
multiplying	multiplication
unless you use a fast algorithm such as karatsuba multiplication the algorithm to multiplying two numbers as you described is the simple o n 2 algorithm that you learned in elementary school - multiplying each digit of the second list by each digit of the first list carrying as necessary

post	put
i tried to put the itunes link of the app in the message but it post a link to itunes as i wrote

9137217
for-loop	loops
to do this with the structure that you are using arraylist it would be done using 2 for loops one for each list enhanced for-loop since its an iterable object

when asking for a width or height from a css styled element you will have a value returned as a string containing px to filter off this px and make it an integer i use the parseint function

9137292
getter	setter
i see that there are no getter and setter methods in cakephp models to access columns in a database like there is in symfony

9137292
getter	setter
without those getter and setter methods i can t really do pure oop programming in cakephp

9137292

i am working on a drupal module proving rss feed generation though not posting it to drupal answers as my question is not really drupal-related

9137299
rss	feed
what i am wondering is whether an rss feed could have multiple elements

9137307
next	except
moving iterator from one element to the next is an o c operation both in the list and in the multi map except c is slightly smaller for the list so it is unlikely you ll gain much by combining the two

9137330
hide	show
i have tracked down the problem to the way that popuppanel show hide itself which affects the other subclasses like dialogbox

9137330
children	parent
when a parent s visibility css property is changed internet explorer doesn t notify its children about the property change events

9137334
width	height
as you can see the width and height are interpreted very differently

9137347
super	self	superclass	subclassing
in the implementation of a subclassing you can call a method of the superclass by using the super keyword instead of self

9137372
filtering	grouping
your grouping query is just an equality filtering on a single property of the customer kind

9137372
filtering	grouping
if that s not ok option 2 or a set of separate customer-to-group pairing entities in the same entity grouping would make the grouping query with ancestor filtering strongly consistent with updates

9137376
post	get
you also should capture the msg that you get from a post

9137412

i was wondering if there is a way to only load the image as 16x16 instead of like 2000x2000 not just change the width and height of the image and also not changing the actual size of the image with php

9137539
respond.js	modernizr
first off based on the forums i have been reading you should not include respond.js from modernizr they are more than likely going to drop it

9137562
viewdidload	dealloc
think of viewdidload and viewdidunload as being like the init dealloc for the view property of the view controller

9137568

it will hide the div but when i try to submit the form it won t show the iframe

9137646
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
you probably should be using maven with the eclipse m2e plugin and configuring the annotation processing in each project s pom.xml files .

9137646
maven	pom.xml
this page describes how to configure maven s java compiler plugin and this one lists the attributes you can set in the pom.xml file

9137671
onresume	onpause
likely when you switch from one tab to another setcurrentitem just detaches the ui from the currently active fragment or calls its onpause method and then re-attaches the ui for the newly selected fragment or calls its onresume method

9137737
int	chars
error pm136 illegal explicit conversion from underlying misra type unsigned chars to unsigned int misra c 2004 rule 10.3

i tried to override onpause onresume ondestroy with this

9137752
onresume	onpause
i tried to override onpause onresume ondestroy

9137795
viewdidload	viewwillappear
ui-related things should go in viewdidload if they re related to setting up the views or viewwillappear if they re related to configuring the views loading them with data

9137822
hide	show
the more elegant way would be to add a filter method to the mycollectionview which would use underscore methods to filter the views you want to show hide and do its job of well.

9137822
hide	show
jquery hide show can be a bit taxing - though it s a concern you will have only with large amount of data views

9137868
ubuntu	debian
are you running php 5.3.2 on debian ubuntu by chance

9137868
versioning	upgrade
the easy fix is to upgrade php to the latest versioning or i think it was fixed in the next versioning of php

sounds like you should just use assign for any primitives like int or boolean

9137935
hex	binary
i am writing a relatively simple program using tkinter that is a converter for binary decimal and hex

9137972
post	get
i don t have the error meesage i receive in osx but something about the resource is unavailable i ll post an update when i get back on that machine but what is the issue here

cpython	ironpython
i am unsure how to use multiprocessing without jython or cpython or some other ironpython whatsahoosie and have opted to use threads for my multicore centos program

9137993
accessor	properties
when you access a view controller s view properties the view accessor method checks whether the view has been loaded yet

9137996
mouse	keyboard
the program allows for a whole lot more and is worth a closer look if you need to automate tasks that require special mouse keyboard actions across multiple windows

9137999
super	self
setattr super clazz self name value

9138045
inherited	subclassing
it would seem that a subclassing does inherited the private fields in that these very fields are utilized in the inner workings of the subclassing philosophically speaking

9138045
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing in its constructor calls the superclass constructor

9138045
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the superclass private fields are obviously inherited by the subclassing calling the superclass constructor if the superclass constructor has initialized these fields in its constructor

9138045
accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
but of course without accessor methods the subclassing cannot access the superclass private fields it s like not being able to pop the back panel of an iphone to take the battery out to reset the phone.

9138045
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the private fields even if not accessible by the subclassing are the inherited state of the superclass

9138068
portrait	landscape
what s more android fun is if i just rotate my phone orientation that will fix the bottom layout and it lays out perfectly in both portrait and landscape

9138077
int	chars
during some processing i am using the int value of chars of these capital letters

9138080
width	height
remember width and height of the images must be the same

9138131
button	checkbox
the form consists of 10 questions and the answers are either 1-value radio button or multiple-value checkbox

9138149
fseek	ftell
the fseek and ftell functions are both defined by the iso c language standard

9138149
fseek	ftell
so if the file was opened in binary mode ftell gives you the number of characters from the beginning of the file -- but an fseek relative to the end of the file seek_end is not necessarily meaningful

9138149
fseek	ftell
in practice on unix-like systems text and binary modes behave the same way and the fseek ftell method will work

9138149
getchar	ftell
i suspect it will work on windows my guess is that ftell will give the byte offset which may not be the same as the number of times you could call getchar in text mode

9138149
fseek	ftell
since the fseek ftell method is system-specific anyway such as stat on unix-like systems

9138149
fseek	ftell
on the other hand fseek and ftell are likely to work as you expect on most systems you re likely to encounter

9138149
fseek	ftell
if working on linux and windows is good enough and you re not concerned with large files then the fseek ftell method is probably ok

9138173
hide	show
if you want easing then just create a div style the arrow with css hide the div and show it with jquery

9138207
haskell	ocaml
they are both in the same ball-park as pascal ocaml haskell and lisp which makes them about half as fast as c and c++

9138236
fadein	fadeout
i am using fadein fadeout to give a slight delay so when the mouse moves from the menu to the submenu the submenu stays visible .

9138253
httpconnection	downloading
can i use same httpconnection for full downloading

9138257
width	height
i have tried a few different things pulled from the net like replacing the right bottom of the ortho call with width height aspect ratio but nothing seemed to correct the problem

9138281
goto	break
then have the loop break if and goto a label before the loop where you have an algorithm that generates a new number maybe somthing as simple as adding one or what ever you want

9138281
multiplying	add
also don t forget that if and the number hasn t failed yet but isn t at the end yet that you need to multiplying the value by 10 then add the next number in the array to be able to test the next place

9138284
folder	directory
the aim is it to create a directory struction based on the work id but its not creating the folder or uploading the file but it is returning that it has succeeded but also failed ive spent the past few day trying to fix it but to no avail can anyone see what is wrong with it or point me in the right direction

9138309
pull	push
how would i set up my server to pull data from a mysql database and then push it to the browser

9138320
client-side	server-side
php runs server-side not client-side

9138327
comparator	comparable
i am trying to overwrite the default comparator method in java by writing my own and using implements comparable however it seems that java is still using the default method

9138348
comparator	comparable
you are implementing it wrong as comparable the raw form of does not declare a method comparator string it declares a method comparator object

9138348
comparator	comparable
most likely you want to implement instead of comparable and accept a word to comparator

9138395
cos	sin
also not sure whether my code for sin cos and sprt are correct

9138421
integer	unsigned
in c89 which the misra rules specify the type of an integer constant suffixed with a u is the first of the list unsigned int unsigned long int in which its value can be represented

9138421
integer	unsigned
the definition of the bitwise shift operator specifies that the integer promotions are performed on each operand this does not change an unsigned int and that the type of the result is the type of the promoted left operand

9138421
int	chars
the only explicit conversion here is the cast of this unsigned int value to unsigned int so this must be what the compiler is warning about - although there is no unsigned chars in sight which means that the checker appears to be buggy

9138427
nodejitsu	heroku
heroku does not sure about nodejitsu or nodester.

9138480
for-loop	loops
to read the file in you ll want to use the open function along with a loops a for-loop would make good sense to read each line

9138555
post	put	post	get	put	get
test rest uris get post put delete - i must be able to assert data returned against data sent

9138564
put	get
but i don t get what exactly to put there

9138570
filtering	grouping
the first query the legal one grouping your products by category and then filtering to select the grouping that have a product with 0 units in stock

9138615
rel	attr
the other answers on this question helped me but ultimately the jquery forum thread this + option selected attr rel option selected is not working in ie helped the most

9138625
explode	implode
i can do this fine in js with the eval function but in php my efforts have resulted in a complicated series of explode and implode functions

9138709
inherited	properties
prototypal inherited is limited to properties of objects

9138728
post	get
i have a wcf rest service when i used get method it works fine when i pass the data along with the url but i need to use post method and when there is no data to pass in post method it works fine

9138755
put	get
so what is being said in this passage is in my mind good advice always double-check that when you go to do something you re going to get more out of it than what you put in

9138758
getter	setter
sometimes it s worth the extra effort to create protected getter and setter methods and make all data private

9138758
superclass	subclassing
in other words it s not a discussion about classes in general - only about how should a superclass best make things visible to it s subclassing

9138796
portrait	landscape
my game is in portrait mode but i want the ad to be in landscape mode

9138898
ssl	https
based on what i read that i need to have an ssl setup and installed on my web server so that i can use the https secure connection on the page where a login is going to be used

9138900
google-chrome	firefox
the pdf must be opened in the browser browser control or ie firefox google-chrome etc and edited in place

9138965
width	height
i think you ve tangled map height and map width it s indexed by y x and you access it by x y

9138971
put	get
trying to get each button_select_sub li s text and put it in an array

9139086
gridview	sqldatasource
btw i ve created some gridview and sqldatasource to show all users and it works

9139093
ssl	https
if your site has an ssl certificate setup properly forcing users to an https url should be fine

9139101
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
a grid ext grid supports paging sorting filtering grouping summaries editing out of the box

9139144
innodb	myisam
foreign key constraints can t be applied to myisam engine.both table should use innodb engine for supporting foreign key constraints

9139170
ssl	https
here is a tutorial on wamp2 https and ssl setup if you just need a development environment

9139197
nsstatusbar	nsstatusitem
how can i get all nsstatusitem elements in the nsstatusbar

9139205
post	get
as far as updating the view after a post i don t know if i get exactly what the problem is but here is the third part of a good tutorial

9139224
gridview	sqldatasource
when you published it the sqldatasource gridview worked because it was pulling the connection named connectionstring that pointed to the correct server

9139225
post	get
post this to server and parse it so you know which image object should get the loaded attribute

9139266
pull	push
i am trying to pull text from various parts of a webpage and push them to an array one index per webpage. the following code loops forever and i can t figure out why

9139299
shadowing	named
furthermore these mutable values and the class s parameters should have different named to avoid shadowing and confusion

9139314
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to run a cleanup.php script on a magento site hosted on ubuntu linux 10.04.1 the script command is

9139323
width	height
i was thinking you could use one of the max- css properties but they only support width and height

9139333
int	chars
a second problem is that getchar returns int not chars

9139344
fgets	getchar	fgets	feof	feof	getchar
notice that feof 3 is valid only after a read operation getchar fgets etc... so coding while feof stdin is generally wrong contrarily to what i wrote in the previous version of this answer

9139344
int	chars
you ll better test that getchar is returning eof so your mychar should be an int not a chars

9139380
width	height
you ve obtained the new screen width and height from the resize event

9139391
ssms	ssdt
this two software are two different things one is a database server sql server 2008 r2 the other ssdt is a set of tools that expands functionality of visual studio to allow the developer to use a lot of feature that are in ssms directly inside visual studio

9139400
children	parent
when creating dropdown menus it s always more advisable to put the children ul elements as direct children of the parent li item for example

9139400
children	parent
in that light check out this jsfiddle which i built on your original code where the children line up with the parent exactly simply by assigning them a width of 100 effectively hitting the edges set out by the parent

9139420
filtering	grouping
so here we first filtering out all the irrelevant skills with the where clause and then grouping by user

9139504
post	put
for example if i have a 20gb vhd i would like to break it up into chunks of say 5gb each without splitting and saving the individual chunks first and put post these to blob storage like s3 rackspace azure etc

9139575
width	height
actually i am using this modified version of the library which enables you to query the width and height of the svg as specified in the svg document

9139610
getter	setter
therefore themeselector is just a property of that type which has setter and getter

9139634
uitableview	uisearchbar
as hinted at in the self-answering comment if you want to get table search behavior like the built-in contacts app you can t just slap a uisearchbar into a view with a uitableview instead you need to use a uitableviewcontroller together with a search display controller

9139638
inherited	subclassing
in my eventclass i have a concrete method compareto event in which i expect it inherited by all subclassing

9139638
inherited	subclassing
to make it compile i have to add a int priority in eventclass and i was thinking i can shallow it in subclassing and it will works just fine with the compareto inherited

9139689
g++	gcc
i compiled the code on my system using gcc then g++

9139702
superclass	subclassing
the additional declaration of int priority in the subclassing shadows int priority from the superclass

9139710
octal	decimal
here you are giving octal numbers as input and expecting the output in decimal and thats the reason you say output is wrong which is correct

9139724
crossover	mutation
the mutation and crossover operators will help ga to jump the discontinuity in the search space and lead to better exploration

9139762
width	height
i d like to add a vertically-tiled png image underneath just a stripe of 1px height which would display a fixed width 800px of white and the rest should be some other color like red in the example below or gradient and should grow

9139784
pascal	delphi
the wmi delphi code creator tool allows you to generate object pascal

9139813
int	chars
since you want the digits in base-10 i think this would be easiest to read if you convert the intermediate fibonacci int to strings then step through each chars in the string as a chars array

9139813
int	chars
as you step through it you can convert each digit back to an int by subtracting the chars 0 from it

9139823
innodb	myisam
currently the storage type of table is innodb i want to add full text search on the table which is only possible on myisam engine

9139881
public	protected
edit what i mean is from inside y which is inherited from x you can simply call protected public members of it s base class x i.e you re accessing it s base members simply

9139891
bash	zsh
using only bash and zsh

9139891
bash	zsh
bash and zsh interprets as a new line

9142610
m2e	pom.xml	m2e	maven-ear-plugin	maven-ear-plugin	pom.xml
if you have a plugin execution defined in your pom.xml like the execution of maven-ear-plugin generate-application-xml you also need to add additional config information for m2e that tells m2e what to do when the build is run in eclipse should the plugin execution be ignored or executed by m2e should it be also done for incremental builds .

int	chars
and in this example you can see that i compared two chars just like i would compare int egers - with simple

9143225
salt	md5
if you re running your passwords through md5 you ll get a bit more security from adding a cryptographic salt

9143228
ready	each
you can t just blindly write a string of characters to a uart - you need to check status on each character - it works in the single character example because the uart is always going to be ready for the first character but for the second and subsequent characters you need to poll or better yet use an isr but let s walk before we run

9143229
versioning	upgrade
all the code that every one wrote against the first versioning of the interface would no longer compile forcing an upgrade

what i m making is a 2d tile map in canvas and for objects in the map that are greater than one tile in size they have their width and height set to negative numbers to tell me how many tiles offset in x y they are to get to the tile with the relevant data

9143445
int	chars
if you want the int value -1 as a chars then you can do that by saying unchecked chars -1 but you should be aware that this is a very bad idea

9143453
width	height
the issue is that the elements while they do exist in the dom when the javascript is initially run haven t actually been rendered in the browser and thus do not have an actual width or height yet

9143464
width	height
make sure the parent width and height are larger or the same as the msg control s width and height

portrait	landscape
if you don t really need landscape support for your application you can also block the activity to portrait mode and you don t have to manage the orientation changes

9143653
width	height
in order to position the child views correctly depending on orientation i need to take the width and height of the framelayout in account

9143653
width	height
in order to get a callback to the fragment when the width height has been calculated i override onsizechanged in framelayout which calls the fragment

9143658
portrait	landscape
if your application doesn t have a different layout for landscape and portrait then this is a good route to take

getter	setter
a getter and setter bundled together in a first-class value is referred to as a lens

9144041

9144043
primefaces	richfaces
i m working on a webapp which combines primefaces 1.1 and richfaces 3.3.3 in a jboss 4.2.3 server so this application uses jsf 1.2

9144066
google-chrome	firefox
the issue is almost certainly related to internet explorer using windows authentication rather than basic authentication what you d likely get with firefox or google-chrome

9144108

answer seems to be that there is no default type when java.util.date or java.util.calendar is used as key of the map

9144289
width	height
in the above draw ... method the texture will initially be placed at x y with a given width height and then scaled and rotated around originx originy

9144304
width	height
how many bits per component how many components per pixel where is the width and height defined what s the standard for said format files

9144327
filtering	grouping
you need to grouping those restricted pages behind a common url pattern or whatever and then map the filtering on exactly that url pattern which does roughly the following in the dofilter method assuming that you re storing the logged-in user in the session the usual way

9144352
google-chrome	safari
-webkit-transform in webkit browsers google-chrome safari etc.

9144499
rss	feed
alternatively you could have both your rss feed view and the uiwebview in the same view and simply hide the rss feed view and unhide the uiwebview when you want to present the web view and do the opposite when you want the rss feed visible

9144505
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
because runtimeexception s and its subclasses are unchecked-exception and do not need to be declared thrown or caught

9144686
free	alloca
i was revising c and came across to alloca free functions which is described as allocating storage on a stack like space

9144686
free	malloc
is this same as the malloc free

9144709
free	malloc
and yes this is different from malloc and free which allocate on the heap

9144709
free	alloca
don t attempt to free memory allocated with alloca because it is automatically free when the function that calls alloca returns to its caller

9144712
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
malloc calloc and realloc functions allocate space on the heap

9144721

9144827
lodash	underscore.js
as suggested by barry p jsfiddle underscore.js or lodash also have a debounce each with slightly different apis

9144840
versioning	upgrade
my guess would be that the .net framework installed on the server got upgrade and the private constructor is no longer present under the new versioning

9144862
punctuation	words
you might want to write another query or procedure or add some nested replace statements to further remove punctuation from the resulting temp table of words but this should be a good start

9144892
google-chrome	firefox
under firefox it does not fire no matter what just under my google-chrome it behaves like this

9144937
width	height
38 mm width x 21.2 mm height each cell

9144946
children	parent
most controls specifically the common controls which includes sliders will send a wm_notify to their parent when certain events happen allowing the parent to handle these events for a collection of children

9145021
for-loop	loops
finally the for-loop assign to loops variable even if it is not used

9145025
firefox	safari
the code below works perfectly on desktop safari and firefox but not mobile safari

9145039
width	height
kheight and kwidth are the height and width of the screen and they are never 0 or nil

9145045
groovy	gpath
the gpath mechanism in groovy lets you do things like

9145045
groovy	gpath
but other classes in groovy also have some gpath magic and there is where things get more interesting

9145056
super	implements
i m currently trying out different ways to implements the concept of a super but the fact that i can t get this to work with the existing code is stuck in my head

9145058
versioning	upgrade
first i would encourage you to upgrade to the latest versioning as it has a lot of bugfixes

9145075
versioning	upgrade
you must either upgrade ioncube loader to versioning 4.0.9 or newer or disable it by commenting or removing this line in your php.ini file

9145078
setinterval	settimeout
instead of settimeout i used setinterval

9145092
post	put	post	get	put	get
note this will put all of your micropost records in the html element and it will tick but the content is static meaning you re not going to get new post in there unless the page is refreshed

9145094
children	parent
edit i modified the original post to handle cases of multiple children in the same parent

9145097
range	min	range	max	min	max
the basic idea is assigning a color range yellow- black to a depth range min distance from sensor- max distance from sensor

9145179
subtraction	addition
this addition or subtraction to the value does not occur because the progress has changed but instead based on how long it is held at that point of progress

9145180
width	height
i think what s wrong with yours is that you didn t specify a height or width they are both 0

9145186
ssl	https
as it is now i am told heroku converts ssl to non-ssl calls and sets the http_x_forwarded_proto to https so i think i need to deal with this in restlet but i m not sure how

9145198
udp	tcp
both zeromq and 29west lbm use a brokerless approach to messaging and support the same transports tcp udp ib so latency should be broadly similar

9145222
children	parent
this does yet handle a case of multiple children in the same parent but i am unsure if it does so the way you want

9145251
int	double
the one that takes a double as the argument returns a long not an int

9145260
int	double
static long round double a static int round float a

9145272
int	double
because math.sqrt returns a double the version of math.round gets called which returns a long but you want to put it into an int thus the ide suggestion

9145284

9145353
crossover	mutation
the ga on the other hand has the population size mutation rate the crossover mutation operator and selection operator

9145353
crossover	mutation
that may seem much at first but often you choose between two or three crossover operators and maybe two or three mutation operators and mutation rate usually doesn t have such a big effect on the performance as long as it s 0

9145426
width	height
you basically look at the browser s width height to determine which css properties to apply to the page

9145437
int	chars
do you really want to refer to the first chars in the line string with index 0 and is it really supposed to be an int

9145452

works in firefox but doesn t work in ie and google-chrome

9145452

9145539
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox the input boxes show the way they should in ie9 the input is about 3 pixels longer in google-chrome about 3pixels shorter and in safari about 10 pixels or more longer

9145539
pop-up	dialog
to check the style click on new address next to the last textarea box and the jqueryui modal dialog box should pop-up

9145541
cpu	processors
the game company just buys the processors and uses it - they don t pump 200 000 000 into designing their own cpu and trying to compete with the likes of motorola intel freescale etc

9145574
google-chrome	firefox
i disagree with robertc s statement but back to your actual question i found firefox and google-chrome display identically if you set a width in pixels but not if you set a width as a percentage.

9145574
google-chrome	firefox
i m just really hoping things progress to the way firefox handles flexbox while google-chrome is close i just don t agree with how some things are handled and the lack of animation between flex values just plain sucks

9145577
superclass	subclassing
eliminating the need to set properties of the superclass in the subclassing as intended by the superclass es implementation

9145590
youtube	vimeo
youtube vimeo and facebook videos are embedded as if posting manually

preferably i d like to be able to set the relativesource the converter and the mode once in the tabcontrol the path once in each tabitem and only have the converterparameter set per radiobutton

9145649
width	height
it would be a class with variables such as x y width height text clickhandler enabled and so on

9145649
width	height
now you re free to make as many button instances as you want each one has it s own state enabled or disabled text width height all of those

9145715
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
seems to work in google-chrome firefox and safari can t test in ie atm

9145768
try-catch	exception-handling
edit all exception-handling will be handled with try-catch if necessary

9145798
jobs	cron
generally in linux you call separate processes with cron so i d think it would be best to reduce the quartz jobs down into separate stand alone programs

9145809
fadein	fadeout
i tried looking at jquery source but could not figure out what they were doing exactly for fadein and fadeout

9145820
ubuntu	mint
b on ubuntu mint it s all i tested so far i execute with subprocess.check_output xdg-open file_name but this is not always blocking ex when you open one text file by default with gedit if gedit is already open the function returns immediately

9145832
ubuntu	centos
i am assuming that centos uses sudo like ubuntu does

9145850
put	get
there are also the non-blocking i o functions which include an implicit yieldâ the current â œtaskâ is put on hold until the i o completes but the other tasks get their chance to run

9145896
inherited	subclassing
and i have two subclassing that inherited from this model called mysub1 and mysub2

9145916
oncreate	onnewintent
the flag flag_activity_single_top will start the activity if its not started or if it is running it will be caught in onnewintent so you will need to put some code in both the oncreate and onnewintent to extract the bundle and check for the action

9145920
post	get
now i really need to post data and get all of the products under that product category

9146025

9146033
cocos2d-x	corona
i seemed to find small hints that corona uses 32bit pixel format for everything so we cannot use different pixel formats as we do with cocos2d-x

9146035
hlsl	glsl
hlsl is specific to directx and glsl is specific to opengl

9146035
hlsl	glsl
there s no way to compile a glsl shader in directx or a hlsl shader in opengl

9146035
hlsl	glsl
cg is an intermediate language created mainly by nvidia that can be compiled as both glsl and hlsl

9146035
hlsl	glsl
from what i have seen cg isn t quite as popular as glsl or hlsl but i haven t looked into it much

9146047

a user chooses a video url and has a choice of using vimeo or youtube and upon saving i would like to validate that the url code of the video youtube or vimeo is correct

9146231
youtube	vimeo
when i have the youtube code i cannot save a vimeo video and vice versa

9146269
stdout	stderr
presumably java like c and c-derivatives does not buffer system.err stderr etc. unlike system.out stdout etc

9146283
opennlp	stanford-nlp
you can use one provided by nlp tool like opennlp or stanford-nlp

9146314
crossover	mutation
isnt it something like o p g o fitness pc o crossover + pm o mutation

9146314
crossover	mutation
if p g pc and pm are constant that really simplifies to o o fitness o mutation + o crossover

9146379
crossover	mutation
if the number of generations and population size is constant as long as your mutation function crossover function and fitness function takes a known amount of time the big o is o 1 - it takes a constant amount of time

9146384
width	height
override the imageview and in onlayout you can get proper width or height after calling super.onlayout

9146393
for-loop	loops
i could of course adapt this method and replace my triple for loops with one for-loop that repeats the repmat method o number of times but i feel like there should be a way to do this without loops

9146407
smartsvn	tortoisesvn	rapidsvn	smartsvn	rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
if you ll create external svn-repository accessible from workplace and home it can be own server or hosted googlecode sourceforge unfuddle assembla github solution reconfigure versions to use new repo and install svn-client on windows tortoisesvn is nice maybe - smartsvn from syntevo crossplatform rapidsvn you ll be able to use and modify your code from virtually any location

9146468
gridview	entitydatasource
i have a gridview that is populated from an entitydatasource in asp.net

9146475
children	parent
since ul#menu li targets any all s that are children of the ul#menu parent you would only need the one selector.

9146491
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this on google-chrome firefox iphone and it works fine

9146512
serializable	deserialization
as to type it is assumed that handlers are constructed for specific types and no extra type information is passed during serializable or deserialization process expected type if handlers are used for different types must be passed during construction

9146574
int	chars	free	malloc
if i read in data elements as chars i don t get any malloc errors but if i read in as any other data types say short or int the program successfully reads in the bytes but when i free the pointer i get this may be due to a corruption of the heap

9146629
ostringstream	std
you need to to use std ostringstream

children	parent
i also created the web.sitemap file to organize all the parent and their children pages

9146709
put	get	versioning	upgrade
if you wanted to you could let the cookie expire every few months so it would get retested every once in a while or you could put the exact browser versioning into the cookie too and reruns the tests and set a new cookie if the browser versioning every changed software upgrade

9146743
inherited	properties
i was going to create a style for mappolygon but i can t seem to add a setter for anything other than the properties inherited from control which doesn t help very much since the mappolygon doesn t actually use many of those properties

9146758
width	height
you can explicitly define your layout width and height in layout xmls to be 800 480 for all the un-supported resolutions like 1024x600

9146758
width	height
i don t recommend fix your width and height to a specific value but since it s client request i guess you have to take it

9146863
button	checkbox
i need it such that if user check on the checkbox item respective button images will be shown.

9146876
children	parent
if you really need the children to have different code than the parent for some reason you are better off separating that code out of the main code as its own script and then using exec after the fork to run the child script

9146902

9147178
post	get
i am curious as to how you got more than 1 loop to run by definition it should work like you re experience but for some reason when i post the same concept i can only get the while to produce one result even though there are 10 images

9147187
children	parent
the need is to normalize the scores of the children of a parent on a scale of 0-1 edit sum of the scores of the children must sum to 1

9147250
getter	setter
those getter and setter are never called by the binding system hence you should never place additional code there

fgetc	fread
fread gives you as much control as fgetc and has the advantage of being able to read more than one character in a single i o operation

9147389

9147725
superclass	subclassing
as a good general rule the superclass should never know about the subclassing

9147725
superclass	subclassing
consider redesigning your class hierarchy or use an abstraction such as the subclassing implementing an interface and the superclass expecting in instance of that interface

9147729
superclass	subclassing
the fact that the subclassing constructor has parameters of the superclass type is basically irrelevant as far as java is concerned - it s just a coincidence

this approach has the advantage of being able to hide show any element without knowing or caring what its normal display style is

9162197
addclass	removeclass	hide	removeclass	hide	show
so to hide an element addclass document.getelementbyid asset hide and removeclass to show it

9162440
width	height
the first is your logo which is set to be aligned in the bottom right corner with width height scaled to it s actual size

9162440

post	get
you may wish to read more about html form elements and how a form works difference between a post and a get request request variables and the different types of input elements

9162445
post	get
in the php script that the form post to you may need to track which button the user clicked to get there if there is more than one and which message needs to be deleted

9162468
width	height
it s working correctly - it s resizing to a height of 300 and keeping the aspect ratio which in this case makes the width 400

9162489

hide	show
so you could do something like this assuming you are wanting to use a checkbox to hide show

9162748
folder	directory
one bad ideas is to set documentroot in a local vhosts file to the mysubdomain folder â but that exposes the directory structure in things like

9162748
folder	directory
how does one create local testing access where the httpdocs not the htdocs local folder is identified as the public directory

9162750
jboss	glassfish
if you re already targeting a servlet 3.0 compatible container tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc with a servlet 3.0 compatible web.xml in your webapp then you can make use of the new el 2.2 feature of invoking methods with arguments

9162750
jboss	glassfish
if you re however targeting an older servlet 2.5 compatible container tomcat 6 glassfish 2 jboss 4 5 etc then your best bet is to install jboss el to achieve the same

you only have mouseenter not mouseout

9162780
tclientdataset	bde
tclientdataset local files unfortunately are not a replacement for the bde as a local database engine

9162780
tclientdataset	bde
if you re using tclientdataset only you re not using dbexpress at all and tclientdataset can work with any dataset implementing the required interfaces including bde ones

9162780
postgresql	mysql
you should look at alternatives like sqlite firebird there is an embedded version if you need only local access or postgresql if you re looking for small and free engines mysql is free only if your application is gpl or there are several other engines available from stripped down versions of commercial ones sql server express and oracle express or relatively cheap ones

9162813
versioning	upgrade
we are a team that needs to upgrade an application to a new versioning and we have to know the code that has already been reused or considered as useless

awt	swing
i ve wanted to do something i know from awt swing development add command to event queue so that it will be executed after processed ui events it means also after finishing preference change operation

9162876
xslt	xquery
thus whether it is xpath 1.0 or 2.0 does not even matter if you want to create a list of new nodes containing the letters you can t do that with xpath alone you need a host language like xslt or xquery to create new nodes

9162886
abperson	abrecord
my context is an app where i would not select the contact from the peopleviewer but by having a abrecord uid previously stored in a database for example 6b2b9b69-cfc4-46f2-aeb1-43a99382d305 abperson

more specifically i ve disabled the following events onclick onmousedown onmouseup onmouseover onmouseout onmouseenter onmouseleave

9162917
opera	google-chrome
this makes it better in google-chrome ie9 but opera still flickers a lot so i suppose that something is still wrong

9162933
google-chrome	firefox
while this works fine on google-chrome but the tb_window collapses in firefox

9162948
wxpython	listctrl
when it comes to something like this i think the usual method i ve seen advertised is to use a virtual listctrl see the wxpython demo

9162985
min	max
it could be min max limit 1 or some other criterion

9163037
getter	setter
second is used together with synthesize in .m module and setter getter s are created for you by the compiler

9163037

poco c++ - net ssl - how to post https request

9163056
apache	nginx
i m not sure who is recommending to you that you use both nginx and apache but that s a horrible idea

9163056
apache	nginx
apache can be just as good but requires building from source and knowing exactly what configuration to use to match nginx

9163130
inherited	properties
for the vm layer i like the containment pattern more than inherited and at this layer i also implement inotifypropertychanged which is also a properties of the vm and not the data model

9163146
subtract	add
update values for all nodes following the deleted node add the number of incoming nodes and subtract the number of outgoing nodes for this node

9163161
clang	llvm
and then compiled it to llvm ir by typing clang -s -emit-llvm main.c -o main.ll

9163161
clang	llvm
is this maybe because i m using incompatible versions of clang and llvm

9163172
try-catch	exception-handling
repository level must have try-catch construction that handle sql exception-handling and write errors to log

9163172
try-catch	exception-handling
if you want to notify user about something gonna wrong if business logic provide exception-handling - you should use try-catch constructions in your controller actions and use modelstate.addmodelerror as one of ways to notify user or use other way to pass info about error into view

9163220
apache	nginx
is it possible to apply this rule using apache nginx or any other recommended tool

9163227
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox

udp	tcp
1 enumerate all current sockets open in the system including the process that created it and for both tcp and udp what ports and addresses they are current bound to

9163248
hide	show
whenever you hide .star you need to show .unstar and whenever you hide .unstar you need to show .star

9163249
unsigned	short
this is also a bit iffy since it assumes the resulting address can validly be cast into a pointer to unsigned short

9163251
post	get
however how do i get the source of the post data the body of the request

9163263
accessor	properties
1 properties is a special way to define getter- and setter-methods or as we call them accessor in objective-c

9163263
accessor	properties
using properties will declare your accessor for you and is equivalent to declaring setmyarray and myarray yourself

9163263
accessor	properties
remember that properties declares the accessor for your properties synthesize will implement them

9163278
width	height
it seems like they ignore their layouts and fill the entire screen instead of the layout width and height from their xml layouts

9163278
width	height
a similar issue occurs on my ics-based galaxy nexus which completely ignore the match_parent tag for height and width

9163304
uninstall	upgrade
i would day that rolling your own self-update will never reach the sophistication of either of these technologies clickonce rpms appstore and offer the user the expected behavior vis-a-vis discovery upgrade and uninstall

9163326
width	height
i have a control docked to a window which i need the height and width of

9163326
width	height
obviously as the window changes size these values change but when i am requesting them using the height and width variables they are giving me the original height how can i get the new height

9163337
mdpi	hdpi
use drawables with different sizes for hdpi and mdpi and then give your ratingbar a specific height in dp

9163397
gwtupload	gwt-rpc
actually there are two ways of uploading file with gwtupload as you mentioned and via gwt-rpc this one is a bit difficult due to browser security

9163439
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of 1394kdbg.sys

9163460
sudo	passwd
the slow response from sudo when you enter an erroneous passwd is so that if you are mounting a crude brute force try and guess the passwd attack with sudo you are slowed down every time you guess wrong so that the attack takes longer

9163461
post	get
so even if you modify the value in the model if you have a different value in the modelstate which often happens in post actions it will be the value from the modelstate that will get used

9163470
min	max
is there a way in ios for me to get the max and min values of an nsmutablearray of double numbers

9163484
bonjour	avahi

9163543
iprincipal	iidentity
i m trying to figure out when rolling my own custom membership provider not inheriting from the asp.net membership if i need to work with the iprincipal and iidentity

9163566
post	get
to get the post data source execute

9163566
post	get
to get the post data source execute har.request.postdata.text

9163567
iprincipal	iidentity
for example the user property of httpcontext is an iprincipal which contains an identity property of type iidentity

9163661
parallels	bootcamp
this current installation is far more stable and i can still wrap parallels around the bootcamp partition - i guess parallels is just not quite 100 perfect for installing windows

9163669
children	parent
the children of said parent group then display as single line

9163669
children	parent
i have 7 parent groups and 39 children on one page

9163687

9176672
mouseover	mouseout
ipad iphone doesn t support mouseover mouseout events

9176695
free	malloc
if you need to try your code with high-level applications you can name your functions malloc free compile them to a shared-object .so and then use ld_preload and ld_library_path environment variables to load your .so and replace system s malloc

9176716
google-chrome	firefox
i have the entrance animations working in google-chrome and firefox but they are having no effect in ie7 or ie8

9176720
mouseover	mouseout
you re using mouseover and mouseout which are not supported on touch screens

9176759
x86	64bit
your any cpu compiled program is loading an x86 stub which is firing your 32bit hook then the x86 stub checks and sees that the environment has 64bit support and launches the 64bit clr version

9176759
x86	64bit
in this scenario your 32bit hook dll is getting the wh_shell message and is trying to inject into a process the x86 stub that has already ended or its injecting the 32bit hook into the 64bit clr process

9176768
implements	extends
java don t allow a class to extends two classes and if i implements separately they will not communicate with each other

9176792
oncreate	onnewintent
when i checked the phonegap code i thought this should never happen in my understanding onnewintent is only called when the activity is loaded otherwise oncreate would be triggered instead

9176820
width	height
if i set my embeded object width and height video gets cut from both the sides

9176820
width	height
how to play video widthout cutting with specific height and width

9176823
children	parent
it was a problem wich has occured before and the solution was getting the parent and then to children

9176831
google-chrome	firefox
this solution assumes that most developers develop using google-chrome or firefox

9176847
free	malloc
then check that variable at the start of your malloc and free function

9176850
google-chrome	firefox
this approach works on firefox google-chrome and ie

9176862
lan	localhost
i set up config.php and tested the site from localhost and another machine via the computer s lan ip and it worked as expected

9176867
int	chars
it would also be handy if instead of one generic container i could store numbers in an int and chars in a chars

9176874
opera	firefox
on ie9 firefox 10.0 and opera 11.61 the browsers cache correctly and don t re-request the images only the html which has a cache-control no-cache header attribute

9176874
google-chrome	safari
on google-chrome 16.0.912.77 m and safari 5.1.2 7534.52.7 a conditional request is made for every image on every page every time

9176920
post	get	hide	show
it s hard to get the show hide code trackering javascript but this strange function hooks into the update panel and will fire when the update panel post back

9176941
put	get
mails get put in a queue and the server processes them one at a time

9176956
treemap	treeset
comparators can also be used to control the order of certain data structures such as treeset or treemap

9176967
dbcontext	objectcontext
should i be using dbcontext objectcontext or both

9176982
servicebus	masstransit
i am reading a lot about servicebus implementations nservicebus masstransit ... and i think i have understand how a servicebus works

9176991
children	parent
probably the reason for this is that you are not setting the parent children relationships between the components

9177009
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext is just a wrapper around objectcontext

9177009
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext is just a set of apis that are easier to use than the apis exposed by objectcontext

9177077
int	boolean
now the other properties includes stuff like int strings and boolean and i just save them with

9177119
struts	wicket
frameworks such as java server faces standard on java ee 5 and higher struts 1.x or 2.x spring wicket etc

9177144
draggable	droppable
i have a div block and within that 2 tables one of which has a number of draggable elements table rows and another of which has a number of droppable zones each zone of which is a table in its own right

9177144
draggable	droppable
however unsurprisingly i lose the draggable droppable capability

9177144
draggable	droppable
btw the draggable and droppable elements each have their own unique id

9177176
post	get
by setting since until you will get at most limit post

9177182
hide	show
in a jsplitpane you have the setonetouchexpandable method which provides you with 2 buttons to quickly fully hide or full show the jsplitpane

9177202
filesystems	ntfs
i am building a java application to process files on a local fs ntfs but a solution that would allow an easy extension to linux filesystems in future would be nice

9177234
domxpath	domdocument
you could use domdocument parser and domxpath to access your link

9177275
x86	64bit
my understanding is that a .net application is platform independent so pure .net code should run either on a x86 or on a 64bit machine

9177289
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade to a newer versioning of junit you just have to download the new versioning and replace the old versioning with the new jar

9177318
post	get
i m fairly new to dynamic php can do the basics of php and mysql and get post for forms but that s about it

9177380
hide	show
you cannot just show hide your options in ie

9177396
textview	imageview
when i remove the imageview and place a big textview instead it also doesn t pad and work nicely

9177464
min	max
without stl the simplest solution would be to find the min max values in the array and dynamically allocate an array of bool

9177502
min	max
i want to check if the value in b16 is greater than min date and less or equal to max date

9177511
hide	show
as far as i m concerned the stuff that is inside the load function should happen after the file.html is loaded but it hide the loader image and show content div in this case huge image but it can be anything and it still loads this content - the loading process is not finished

9177544
nsis	izpack
actual installer advanced installer bitrock installbuilder inno setup install creator installer vise for windows installshield install4j izpack nsis openinstaller scriptlogic msi studio smart install maker symantec wise installation studio and wix

9177552
google-chrome	firefox
the #upload_file .click event works great in all browsers but the #upload_file .change works only in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

9177552
google-chrome	firefox
so my form is submitted only in firefox and google-chrome

9177553
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml in question modifies the maven build lifecycle by associating a number of goals with the phase install

9177615
children	parent
i m also using fluent nhibernate and because of that i store children and parent in my entity

9177633
clang	llvm
i have tried to compile clang and llvm using the clang getting started manual

9177633
x86	64bit
note that i am using ubuntu 10.04 on a 64bit x86 system

9177639
daemons	launchd
what is suggested instead is to launchd either a daemons thread or create whole different processes that reads from msmq and processes the long-running tasks there

9177646
int	chars
the + is not a valid chars when dealing with int simply the absence of a minus sign would indicate positive

9177830
kerberos	ntlm
so my suggestion would be ditch your dll turn off ntlm in iis leaving only kerberos to handle the authentication

9177851
required	placeholder
- using i18n files and resourcesbundles with placeholder where required in the page

9177872
maven	pom.xml
you may create a bash script which uses the maven install plugin to produce a generic pom.xml

9177884
typedef	struct
in your example the struct and the typedef have the same name

9177898
typedef	struct
by typedefing typedef struct student student you re able to say struct student by simply saying student

9177914
typedef	struct
the typedef allows you to virtually create an alias for student instead of having to use struct student constantly thereby actually making it behave more like a built-in type

9177941
maven	pom.xml
in my maven pom.xml i add the following dependency declaration

9178001
mouse	keyboard
is there some way to find out what caused the onchange event on select box in internet explorer ie8 - keyboard or mouse

9178001
google-chrome	firefox
i have a code which doing something when user selecting a value and this code works great in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie no surprise huh

9178001
mouse	keyboard
in ie it works fine only if user uses mouse but not a keyboard because then it fires a onchange event on every keypress not on enter as normal browsers

9178011
rdf	owl
the simple answer is support for sparql rdf owl etc

9178018
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
a for-loop or a foreach loops will work fine but it will be a lot less coding if you just create a single for-loop and push content into an arrays of arrays or an arrays of strings.

9178031
opera	safari
http_referrer does t work in ie browser it works fine for all browsers like mozilla safari opera etc.

9178062
macports	homebrew
if you re on a bsd system including mac os x you need to run date -j + s 0143.38 unless you have gnu date installed with macports or homebrew or something

9178077
post	get
also if you implement ajax calls that means you have to expose a rest web service on server side something that responds to an http get or post call

9178078
public	protected
initially i couldn t assign anything to it but by setting it to public rather than protected i was able to use it in my test and avoided trying to call the base class initialize method

9178079
post	get
then you need to post process it in any language or script to get longest text

9178084
portrait	landscape
they are in pixels the origin is top left x axes increases to the right and y axes increases to down that s true for either orientation portrait or landscape

9178102
typedef	struct
typedef struct student student

9178103
implements	extends
as long as the component extends uicomponent you should be okay as uicomponent implements ivisualelement

9178103
implements	extends
if your component does not extends uicomponent then you ll have to implements ivisualelement which may require component changes

9178159
min	max
so i think i need to select only k rows based on a certain column of given matrix with min max queue

9178193
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
supported browsers are mozilla - firefox and family internet explorer with msxml3.0 and up konqueror kde 3.3+ for sure safari and opera

9178235
google-chrome	safari	mp4	webm
your code is working as you can see in google-chrome and safari which take the mp4 source so i m quite sure the webm videofiles are broken

9178254
int	boolean
in order to support addition on a logical vector note that logical is defined by programming language environment and is not the same as a boolean one is best served by reusing code for adding int

9178262
draggable	droppable
i have a list of draggable that can be dragged into the trash the fixed droppable but i don t want the horizontal scrollbar to appear when dragging them near the trash

9178282
put	get
unfortunately it doesn t seem to get called when i put my wifi conection on and off

9178338
google-chrome	safari
just tried safari and google-chrome and they are behaving with this issue as well

9178344
typedef	struct
thought of typedef ing a struct to pass around from a higher scope to avoid global variable use if performance dictates not using method local varables

9178376
int	chars
you made the variable c into an int not a chars

9178405
folder	directory
i tried adding the lib folder containing derby.jar to the home directory of the application.jar but i still get the same problem

9178407
google-chrome	firefox
which works like a charm in google-chrome but in firefox i get this

9178418
post	put
i was under the impression that rails will regenerate the form_authenticity_token after any post put or delete action

9178432
post	get
what i want to do is to let a user follow other users and then in a stream get their post

9178492
versioning	upgrade
developers currently using the xfbml like button can include the attribute in their like button code to generate a combined button and those using an iframe versioning of the like button will need to upgrade to xfbml to display a send button

9178499
post	get
then you d get post something like

9178506
gif	png
if you re targeting other browsers as well the easiest is probably to generate an image on the server side gif jpg png

9178524
inherited	subclassing
you are using the inherited also known in entity-relationship modeling as subclassing or category

9178524
children	parent
all classes in one table have just one table covering the parent and all child classes with all parent and child columns with a check constraint to ensure the right subset of fields is non-null two different children do not mix

9178524
children	parent
this requires parent s relationships in your case inventory - storage to be repeated in all children

9178556
google-chrome	firefox
working on firefox google-chrome safair ie 9 8

9178586
phpmyadmin	heidisql
this should output the exact query sent to mysql and you could copy-paste it in phpmyadmin heidisql or whatever you use to manage mysql and see if it returns what you expect

9178600
datamapper	activerecord
the ones that pop into my mind first are the datamapper and activerecord patterns

9178613
mdpi	hdpi
the ondraw method is called 60 times per second but if i add for example 50 100 cards it drops accordingly i don t resize any card cause i use the proper folder mdpi hdpi ecc for each device and i get the exact size of the image without resizing it.

9178662
min	max
i ve created a pivot report off of that sheet that contains sum min and max of amount by category

9178669
hide	show
for each step of a visualization process i hide and show some layers i move some i rotate some and i edit some texts

9178711
ubuntu	linux
then i compiled on ubuntu linux with g++

9178722
mouseleave	mouseenter
use mouseenter and mouseleave instead

9178730
addition	multiplication
i have a data type of very simple algebraic expressions with only identifiers addition and multiplication and i want to parse strings such as a + b c + d into this type

9178748
super	abstract
as super class objects cannot be instantiated in the main function abstract keyword is specified before the class name.but what difference does it make if an abstract keyword is used before the superclass over-riding method or not used

9178751
put	get
on the other hand if i put pdb.set_trace anywhere then i get an error

9178788
width	margin
i want to be able to fullscreen this slider and dynamically calculate and change the width of the .page and the margin value of the .pageleft .pageright classes

9178788
width	height
edit the main reason i m trying to do it this way is to maintain the aspect ratio of the images by setting the width of the image to be 3 4 the height of the image which is set to 100 of the container

9178823
width	height
-paper parameter indicates the width and height of page containing 4 times your original pdf page so its dimensions need to be

9178823
width	height
calculated doubling width and height of your original page size

9178858
maven	pom.xml	maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
this pom.xml has the plugins for maven assembly and maven maven-antrun-plugin

9178858
maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
after andrews suggestion i modified the distribution pom.xml slightly so that the maven-antrun-plugin was part of the same package phase

9178860
x86	64bit
the article back to basics 32-bit and 64bit confusion around x86 and x64 and the .net framework and clr explains the differences pretty well

9178875
gentoo	linux
i followed the gentoo linux x86 quick installation guide the base system is installed on virtualbox

9178888
uisegmentedcontrol	uiappearance	uisearchbar	uiappearance	uisearchbar	uisegmentedcontrol
you don t have direct access to the uisegmentedcontrol on a uisearchbar so you will have to set the global appearance of the uisegementedcontrol using the uiappearance protocol on the uisearchbar

9179022
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it looks perfect in ie9 ie8 and recent versions of firefox google-chrome safari opera

9179022
google-chrome	firefox
looks good and was found by picking something that looked close to what you wanted then using trial and error to find something that works in both google-chrome and firefox they render text differently

9179040
put	get
side note i get the data via a stream is the only option to put this stream to a temp value replace the illegal character with a valid one and make a new stream of it or can you add something in the stream to do this

9179061
junit	testng
it supports multiple unit test frameworks notably junit and testng

9179073
division	multiplication
priority is for division and multiplication if you don t use brackets

9179099
implements	extends
obviously you can extends that to implements your own set even if just to utilise auto-implemented accessors

9179101
jobs	cron
on ubuntu there are cron jobs that run it from time to time but to find newly created files you have to run in manually

9179158
inherited	properties
every entity that you want to automap must have an id properties or inherited from a class that has an id properties

9179197
jar	war
so how does one go about registering and coding an ordinary jar or war as a service daemon that can be started and stopped with those commands

9179261
put	get
if your requirements are to provide client authentication to the server using public private keys then things get more complicated because if you put the key in the apk no matter how much you obfuscate it including embedding it in a native library it will only slow down a dedicated nefarious user

9179274
uiview	subviews
if you want to add a uiview as a subviews to another view you do

9179297
fullscreen	minimized
here s my problem today i have no problem working this way in ubuntu and a dual screen mode but in windows 7 buisness 64 don t try other version yet the display frame actually goes fullscreen but when i click anywhere outside the display frame control frame include the display frame is automaticly minimized

9179298
post	get
analogous to queryparam in get can someone tell me how to get params in post

9179320
tabcontrol	tabitem
the tabitem will flash when you merge the resourcedictionary into the window.resources of the tabcontrol s parent window the resourcedictionary is in resourcedictionary.xaml here

9179473
put	get
for example if i put the string 1 2 and 3 as an array then i get on the server

9179500
google-chrome	firefox
only tested using firefox and google-chrome at present - same issue in both

9179519
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
the order of precedence for this is multiplication and division evaluated left to right and then addition and subtraction

9179519
subtraction	addition
afterwards when you evaluate from left to right for addition subtraction you are left with

9179519
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
remember that division and multiplication are evaluated before addition and subtraction

9179557
pascal	delphi
it makes the delphi code from the imported unit accessible to the pascal script interpreter

9179566
inherited	base-class	inherited	subclassing	base-class	subclassing
as with c++03 you can optimise the initialisation you want to perform once in all your constructors either by putting them into a subclassing or a base-class often with protected or private inherited as it s an implementation detail

9179566
public	protected
i quite like the inheritence as i then use it in a as a class member rather than a member of some aggregated object and i prefer the inheritence protected or private here but sometimes if the base class has members i want to be public i will use public inheritence but give the base class a protected destructor

9179578
google-chrome	firefox
this occurs in ie firefox and google-chrome

9179626
getter	setter
the shipmentactionid class also has the unit and listindex properties with the same signatures on the getter and setter methods

9179643
move	drag
how do i definitively disable this function and do so without it effecting the current ability to drag and move events to different days

9179680
integer	unsigned
name that can be parsed as a 32-bit unsigned integer

9179689
put	get
i then take the mouse move and apply the following code to get the spherical coordinates and put that into the calculatelookat function

9179701
opera	firefox
plus the scroll down occurs on firefox and opera but not in chromium

9179715
width	height
i m developing an integration on a opencart site with an hardcoded solution for calculate a cost of a product according to some input like height width and quantity and other some hidden value

9179744
strlen	strcpy
the operations are inefficient strlen strcpy and strcat because the length need be recomputed at each time

9179768
maven	pom.xml
if you re using maven you shouldn t have just a jar you should only know about pom.xml dependencies

9179774
mouseup	mousedown
also the mouseup and mousedown events will work but this will mess with the ability to drag the map while drawing

9179782
fuzzy	stemming
if you don t need stemming fuzzy search complicated wildcard search you can do search with mongodb

9179791
maven	m2e
furthermore i m using the m2e plugin for eclipse version 1.0 and the gmaven plugin in maven version 1.3

9179791
folder	directory
after i do this every time the directory src test groovy gets removed from the source folder in eclipse and i have to add it again and set the output directory

9179831
hide	show
this is great but how can i compare the positions of the two elements and move the arrow accordingly or hide it and show another so that the popup above the thumbnail is pointing down to it

9179841
screens	tablet
what do i have to do to hav it stretched out to occupy the full area of the tablet screens

9179876
clang	llvm
if you built llvm + clang according to instructions the hello sample should have already been built

9179883
g++	gcc
does anyone know if there are any plans to develop support in g++ gcc for the new c++ amp standard which was released recently by microsoft as an open specification

9179897
prepare	execute
then prepare the command and execute it

9179922
tabcontrol	tabitem
if it s your ui that is taking a while to load then users might just have to deal with an initial load time the first time the tab loads however you can stop the delay when switching to an already loaded tab by extending the tabcontrol to keep it from destorying it s tabitem

9179922
tabcontrol	tabitem
the default behavior of wpf s tabcontrol is to unload a tabitem when you switch to a different tab and reload it when you go back

9179948
inherited	properties
i want to write a template function that checks some timestamp properties class inherited from timed but also has to work for types that do not have a timestamp

9179986
vmware	virtualbox
update sorry i was getting confused because the error mentioned vmware even though you re running under virtualbox

9179999
jobs	cron
i have configured these jobs to become scheduled builds based on a cron expression

9180027
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
i have this function that works with malloc realloc and free at future

9180028
hide	show
i have two radio buttons and two panels on my webpage and i would like to show panel 1 when radio button1 checked changed and hide panel2 and similarly panel2 needs to be show when radio button2 checked changed and hide panel1

9180033
uiview	subviews
that way there is no worries about the subviews catching redispatching events to the parent uiview

9180058
floating-point	integer
one point to make is that floating-point numbers representing integers are different from integers they might exceed even the range of a 64-bit integer for example

9180061
dictionary	map
and the dictionary would map the printjobid to one of these for each print job

9180079
put	get
if you don t put brackets you ll get the function s content

9180087
button	checkbox
there is a checkbox and a few button

9180098
oncreate	ondestroy
and checking my logs i could see that the oncreate and oncreateview methods were called a lot of times but onsaveinstance onpause and ondestroy weren t called at all

9180098
textview	imageview
and the fragments i added were somewhat simple an imageview an edittext a couple textview a seekbar and a listview

9180100
getter	setter
i am using special getter setter to intercept changes made to properties of an object and it currently works great for any normal user-defined properties

9180100
getter	setter
however i would love if i could employ the same idea to built-in properties like htmlinputelement.value or array.length but these are unfortunately defined as unconfigurable and thus i get an error when attempting to redefine them using a getter setter

9180131
getter	setter
one way to do it would be to have an extra unencryptedemail property in my contact model that would have a getter and a setter that would decrypt and encrypt the email property but i find that having to add an extra property is not as clean a solution

9180139
google-chrome	firefox
the javascript above opens a new tab in the version of google-chrome and firefox i have but not in ie

9180263
postgresql	mysql
for example both postgresql s money and mysql s currency fields are not recognized by django s models so it will emit models.textfield followed by # this is a guess

9180300
free	realloc
a failed call to realloc does not free the original pointer so it would leak

9180428
post	get
the problem is the script needs to post to that url and get the json data

9180451
int	chars
alphanumeric keys longer then 4 bytes 4 chars will perform less then an int 4 bytes

9180475
calloc	malloc
the sizes of your malloc calloc are wrong you multiply by the intended count which makes the array grow by count

9180503
put	get
in my pre-oo days i retrieved the info from the db put it into variables then used compress to send and extract to get all the variables

9180505
getter	setter
a good practice you can adopt is to call _bar the internal variable you re going to modify by getter and setter and call them simply bar

9180520
jcomponent	jdialog	jwindow	jdialog	jwindow	jcomponent
jpanel has by default flowlayout you have to define that exactly if you want to change layoutmanager jcomponent have got implemented various layoutmanagers jframe jdialog jwindow from java5 has borderlayout by default

9180614
versioning	upgrade
the versioning we re using has some issues that have been patched in later versioning so it would be nice if we could upgrade to a newer versioning

9180636
comparator	comparable
note that some of the data structures in java.util may require you to provide your own version of hashcode hashset and some may require you to implement comparable interface or provide a comparator treeset

9180648
teamcity	jenkins	cruisecontrol	jenkins	cruisecontrol	teamcity
i would like to configure my continuous integration tool it could be anything from cruisecontrol hudson and jenkins to teamcity to build latest tag if it has been created in either of those folders

9180668
google-chrome	firefox
the code works in firefox and google-chrome and even in internet explorer when the page is not loaded inside the canvas iframe but in app canvas iframe these functions never call its callbacks thus neither getuserdata nor fbaskauth are ever called

9182176
gesturedetector	motionevent
within that overridden method you can then call your gesturedetector object with the motionevent s

9182176
gesturedetector	motionevent
then in the overridden ontouchevent in my child view s i pass the motionevent s to the gesturedetector that has been registered with that view

9182176
gesturedetector	motionevent
however both of these methods i ve used achieve the same basic objective here to channel the motionevent s that targetted various view s to the same gesturedetector object

9182279
youtube	vimeo
this behavior is for any js embeded video regardless of youtube vimeo amazon s3 etc

9182333
regasm	regsvr32
i thought they were .net dlls at first but they cannot be registered with regasm and a tlb cannot be generated using this but can be registered with regsvr32 so i guess that means they are com dlls...please correct me if i am wrong

9182354

opencv	emgucv
if you are using c# i believe that you can use emgucv a wrapper to the opencv library to solve the first part of the problem

9182442
ienumerable	icollection
of course you could use a more specific type than object like tree or icollection or ienumerable .

9182448
hide	show
by using .closest and making a container div and giving the target div for hide show a class of it s own we make the jquery code much more independent of the exact physical html so it doesn t rely on there being nothing between elements

9182500
accessor	properties
based on the bug thread it would appear there are some ambiguity problems with supporting a dotted properties accessor

9182511
portrait	landscape
this all works great in portrait mode but when the application changes to landscape mode which we want to support the default behaviour is for the tabs to move up into the top action bar which seems to eliminate the ability to have a screen title shown and seems crowded with the actions that appear on the right of the top action bar

9182556
width	height
for example an image tag with attributes src width 1 height 1 should be captured but its not

9182598
getter	setter
i would but by no means is necessary rename those attributes and getter setter and remove id from it as you are now technically speaking managing objects not ids

9182623
zipoutputstream	zipfile
unfortunately it seems as though when i dispose a zipoutputstream it needs to write in random file locations in order to create a valid zipfile

9182635
width	height
give your element a viewbox with fixed width and an exceptional height

9182653
srp	principles
generally i base my code by thinking on a tdd-oriented level extracting all dependencies from classes making them more usable following the srp principles and thinking what can go wrong when other people on the team use the architecture for example one big advantage of separating into assemblies is that you control your references and clearly state no data-access code in domain

9182667
ksort	usort
i have had a look at usort and ksort as well but couldn t get a working answer

9182686

int	double
so it could be an int or a double or a

9182846
width	height
reference width height

9182847
width	height
using .width and height will return a unit-less number that is in pixels if you want to get the exact height width set including px or em then you can use .css width and .css height

9182895
width	height
i know that the best way to make a gradient image is to have its width set as 1 and just let it repeat but i m confused as to what the height should be

9182936
jobs	cron
i was thinking about just running cron jobs with python scripts that also use sqlalchemy

9182963
hide	show
you should be able to achieve effect like on flusta.com using some combination of hide with sliding + show with bouncing effects

9182973
width	height
when you have a vertical gradient that means you need to repeat it horizontally and that means you need a width of 1px and a height of the gradient height you want to have

9183018
getter	setter
by design the getter and the setter of a property be declared of the same type

9183050
qpainter	qwidget
i m pretty sure qwtplot does this but i m trying to keep things light so i m just using a simple qwidget + qpainter for now

note that for single request i mean avoiding issuing a head request prior of get post

9183181
width	height
this is good for static things such as height and width

9183201
apache	nginx

first give ids to the checkboxes and hook onchange not onclick

9183407
children	parent
the children can be just hidden but all children have to be directly after its parent node

9183411

if you want to switch layouts you either need to create a new activity to go in to or put all of the views you want into your one layout and hide show only the relevant ones with setvisibility or with something like a viewflipper

9183460
gtk	clutter
i think it has something to do with the fact that gtkclutter.init must be called before gtk.init and clutter.init but the latter two are called upon import of the gtk and clutter packages

9183473
firefox	safari
this has a normal speed in safari but the zoom effect is really slow in firefox

i m trying to see what is supported and to compare mapping-by-code possibilities with fluent nhibernate

9183490
set	bag
set and bag

9183507
for-loop	arrays
the problem was not the counting for the arrays it s the embedded for-loop which will take o n n and in andrew s solution it s only o n +o n +o n +whatever take to find a object of the key in the dictionary which i guess would be in a hash table lookup and that s really fast

9183525
punctuation	words
you could use wordpuncttokenizer to separate the punctuation from words and later filter out the bigrams with punctuation with apply_word_filter

9183562
uitableview	nsindexpath
the problem is when i called - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath because i need to add to the cell with 90px an scrollview that have 90px of height but it s added on the middle of the cell instead on the top

9183564
google-chrome	firefox
while my code works just fine in both firefox and google-chrome my workplace requires that it also works in ie

9183575
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in ie9 firefox and google-chrome

9183577
iccube	mondrian
iccube had the right-ish idea just mondrian needed || instead of + and currentmember.name instead of just name

9183591
google-chrome	firefox
adding default makes firefox and google-chrome validate the cursor rule

9183593
cpu	hyperthreading
there is hyperthreading technology which can handle more that one thread per cpu but it is hardly dependent on type of calculation you want to do

9183603
udp	tcp
a tcp client will never receive udp packets since tcp and udp are two separate protocols at the socket level

9183603
udp	tcp
the socket will see you are listening for a tcp connection it will receive the udp datagram see no listeners and throw it away

9183651
maven	m2e
i see that for some jars maven m2e automatically downloads sources and or javadocs

9183690
hash	md5
the concrete given sample is the md5 hash computing of a file

9183728
google-chrome	safari
since i need webkit i ve tried the operation using safari and google-chrome

9183728
google-chrome	safari
even though my macbook is several years older than the dell laptop the load time for the macbook is more than 4 times faster than the dell laptop safari seems to be a bit faster than google-chrome on both platforms

9183879
jasmine	qunit
is it possible to integrate javascript tests with jasmine oder qunit in cruisecontrol

9183902
jobs	cron
i don t have a great cron specific answer for this but in case its helpful there are alternative schedulers which give you more information about the running jobs from a central view something like cisco s tidal scheduler

9183903
onresume	onpause
when i am having issues with the life cycle methods what i would do is add oncreate onpause onresume etc etc in all my activities with a log.d in onpause inside to trace down exactly which method is being called at what time

9183908
hash	salt
step 2 extract salt from the password hash

9183908
hash	salt
step 3 use the salt to compute the hash from the plain text received from the user

9183908
hash	salt
seriously read up on salt password hash

9183941
google-chrome	safari
i find however that the size of the database is dependent on the platform and the database size varies greatly between safari and google-chrome

9183984
superclass	subclassing
all method and variable can be overridden bydefault in subclasses.if we want to save the subclassing from overridig the members of superclass we can declare them as final using the keyword final

9183998
int	boolean
you can either use the action with store_true | store_false or you can use an int and let implicit casting check a boolean value

9184016

9184055
portrait	landscape
when i run my app now the presentation of this view controller causes my app to start in portrait rather than landscape

9184089
crossover	mutation
for some problems i found that using crossover at the beginning and then mutation it will speed up the process for finding a solution however this is not very good approach since i will end up on finding similar solutions

9184089
crossover	mutation
if we use both crossover and mutation i usually get better optimized solutions

9184114
dateadd	datepart
the datepart hour is not supported by date function dateadd for data

9184212
hash	md5
for authentication generate a hash i.e md5 of the password then compare the hash stored in the database

9184250

when used with numbers int long double etc. it adds them just as you would expect

9184250
int	double
ps in case of int long double etc

9184268
vim	emacs

i made a dialog in visual studio 2005 i added some checkbox and button

9184341
button	checkbox
is there a way to make all the button and checkbox an object

9184431
put	get
is there a way to get around having to modify my build to put the files in

9184455
width	height
the root of the problem seems to lie with the onsurfacechanged command passing down the presumably altered width and height

9184455
width	height
perhaps calling setlayout int width int height explicitly with the desired width and height may get you better mileage.

9184479
for-loop	arrays
when json.stringify encounters an arrays it iterates in a similar way to a for-loop from 0 to simplearray.length to find the values

9184479
inherited	properties
however defining the object with makes json treat it as an object and therefore it loops over the object s properties excluding inherited properties from the prototype chain

9184531
cvs	svn
cvs and svn are both easy to setup on a server and they have clients for all the platforms mentioned

9184634
integer	unsigned
only using a parameter value which string representation is that of an unsigned 32-bit integer value less than 2 32 -1 accesses an element of the encapsulated array structure and write access affects the value of the array instance s length property

9184645
dictionary	map
another way would be to override something that stands just before mvc tries to map the request to a specific route but has already parsed the request url and filled the routevalues dictionary

9184652
google-chrome	firefox
and then on mouseup all works fine on firefox but on google-chrome when all onmouseup handlers are finished the gets selected loosing the precedent selection of caption

qpushbutton	qframe
the selector qframe qpushbutton will simply ignore qpushbutton because it is not a valid pseudo-state

i assume what you really wanted was for the rule to apply to any qpushbutton with an objectname of btnname which is also a descendant of a qframe

9187145
hide	show
your sample code won t work because you cannot give the filter authority to both show and hide items in the listing

9187145
hide	show
in general a filter should either show or hide or similar and in this case it should hide

9187145
hide	show
the master should ensure that all listing items are initially show so that the filters can selectively hide them

hide	show
it is tempting to think that you could alternatively do things the other way round - namely to hide all items initially then allow the filters to selectively show

9187163
onmousedown	onmouseup
it looks to me that all tutorial about html drag and drop set the onmousedown and onmouseup events to the document rather than the element itself and as i tested with below codes

objective a text with 6 text-shadow values to be shown same across google-chrome safari firefox and preferably ie new versions

9192764
google-chrome	safari
on a mac with google-chrome and safari it doesn t look the same since safari shows the text bolder

9192810
post	put
since a put request will not populate obviously since it s not a post request

9192811
int	double
now here s the thing if i change the std vector to an int or a double it works

9192847
stdout	stderr
stdout is path 1 and stderr is path 2

9192847
stdout	stderr
knowing this you can establish new path s that you want to be the output destination then coerce them into stdout and or stderr

9192867
websphere	ibm
it is running in ibm websphere 6

9192904
nfa	dfa
regex is a nfa and is as such in most cases slower than a dfa or hand-written parser

9192938
put	get
i thought that i put my configuration in there which explains why the application didn t get registered with wink on startup

9192960
ant	maven
integrate that with your build tools like ant or maven etc

9192990
google-chrome	firefox
not that i just want to watch the values in the javascript console google-chrome firefox or whatever

9193060
hide	show
alternatively you could create some new controls and hide show the control

9193063
button	checkbox
i have put in the checkbox on every row and a button

9193065
hide	show
i have a class that can hide and show a taskbar button however the taskbar button show up very briefly when launching the c# app

9193065
hide	show
here is the code im currently using to hide and show a taskbar button

9193073
width	height
you can also remove the width and height attributes on your svg as such are counter-intuitive to the rendering of vector graphics

9193085
maven	pom.xml
in our maven pom.xml file i updated the slf4j dependency to

9193118
ant	maven
you can use ant or maven as your build tools

9193139
client-side	server-side
the common way to do this is to implement dual validation client-side and server-side

9193143
disk	ram
it would be great if it can store n elements in ram and rest in disk

9193170
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
this designation is meant to drive home the point that you never mix new and delete with malloc realloc or free or bit level sets for that matter

9193170
free	malloc
during interviews it s good to say that new and delete use the free store malloc and free use the heap

9193170
free	malloc
new and delete call the constructor and destructor respectively however malloc and free do not. yet you will often hear that the memory segments are really in the same area - however that can be compiler specific that is to say it is possible that both can designate different memory spaces as pools not sure why it would be though

9193203
width	height
you can try removing the width and height attributes on the svg root element adding instead

9193243
hide	show
if you don t want to show a new form you could wrap all controls labels textboxes.... that are related to your user inside a container for instance a simple panel and hide show the panel depending on your form state

9193258
ant	maven
if you want the jar to be created everytime you build try using maven or ant that does these packaging tasks for you automatically

9193263
portrait	landscape
i know in android you can provide different xml layouts for portrait and landscape

9193272
mouse	keyboard
however it s very important to remember that the requestpermission method only works in event handlers triggered by a user action like mouse or keyboard events in order to avoid unsolicited infobars

9193316
mouseup	mousedown
define an interval in mousedown and when the mouse click is release mouseup clear that interval

9193428
vim	kate
kate has a vi input mode that support most basic vi commands and vim extensions such as text objects

9193490
google-chrome	firefox
on a google-chrome or firefox console i ve issued the following command

9193549
onresume	onpause
the system s allowed to call onpause onresume any time it likes i m afraid

9193555
gtk	drawingarea
class egclass public gtk drawingarea

9193581
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have tested up until firefox 10 it has improved a bit but is still not running very smoothly compared to safari google-chrome

9193581
width	height
width height left and top

9193581
width	height
the image resized has a max width height of 800px

9193582
uilabel	uibutton
you should not create new uilabel and uibutton and adding them as a subview every time

9193615
ember.js	sproutcore
you may also want to checkout the sproutcore 2 ember.js s previous name demo app contest

9193615
ember.js	sproutcore
generally speaking to convert sproutcore 2 to ember.js just change the sc namespace to ember.js

9193676
ubuntu	linux
freetts no audio linux ubuntu - no errors

9193702
width	height
suppose you want to optimize the size of a rectangular parallelepiped dened by its length height and width

9193702
width	height
the corresponding phenotype is a parallelepiped of length 1 height 7 and width 10

9193714
junit	jmockit
as robotium is restricted to application boundaries it can t access system data hence tested the behavior using junit jmockit based unit test

9193725
versioning	upgrade
i have taken the backup of my live portal and i want to upgrade it to newer versioning in localhost and then move the upgrade versioning to my live site

9193737
gtk	cairo
if you need to create a cairo context for drawing with the gtk c api it goes something like this

9193775
oncreate	ondestroy
incremented in oncreate decremented in ondestroy

9193775
oncreate	ondestroy
calling startservice or bindservice from a testcase should result in a second onbind or onstartcommand but should never result in a second oncreate before the first ondestroy

9193808
getter	setter
he said if we use setter and getter in that class then by using those setter and getter we can get that private data easily

9193811
width	height
another very important clarification you need to have a height width set or at least a minimum height and width set otherwise certain browsers firefox will not load the resource

9193816
children	parent
i think that even if you call finalreleasecomobject on the parent object if you haven t released the child objects too then even though there are no reference to the parent there may still be references to the children hanging about

9193851
getter	setter
the support for data hiding can be explained by the fact that the getter and setter methods are like gateways to the data

9193852
getter	setter	public	protected
if you make the setter getter public protected default then you could access the private members on different levels

9193852
getter	setter
if you make setter getter private then the data is really hidden

9193860
nswindow	nsimage	nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
note in addition in os x v10.7 you cannot create weak references to instances of nsfontmanager nsfontpanel nsimage nstablecellview nsviewcontroller nswindow and nswindowcontroller

9193902
width	height
because a jframe has a 5px border around it look at any frame on your computer screen you ll notice a kind of embossed border - that border is 5 px in width adding 10 pixels onto height and width

9193909
getter	setter
basically the getter and setter allow you to expose class variables as you like and hide any others

9193909
getter	setter
getter and setter also allow you to perform any other necessary steps such as validation

9193909
getter	setter
getter and setter can have different access modifiers themselves so you can expose data to certain classes but not others by using different access modifiers

9193912
portrait	landscape
that way i can show my content in the normal fashion in landscape mode and in a slider in portrait mode thus saving space

9193916
uilabel	uibutton
i have done similar with uibutton basically i created a uilabel with a width and centered text and set it as the custom view for it

9193919
uilabel	uibutton
you can inherits from uitableviewcell make for it .xib and put any control you want uilabel uibutton etc

9193925
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
in java access to private members is done through accessors and mutators getter and setter it is all about hiding and controlling access to your members so you can control how inner state of instance will be modified

9193941
put	get
while this question did get answered i never got a clear answer of where to actually put the song file

9193957
getter	setter
if we want to make the values accessible we provide access methods getter setter for example

9193957
getter	setter
but there is no requirement to provide getter and setter for all fields or to name them according to fields in general

9193963
accessor	properties
be aware that any properties of a class can be accessed if the mutators and accessor are public

9193971
webrat	cucumber
i want to use webrat in combination with cucumber for writing acceptance tests for a web application

9193987
vb.net	vb6
when i call my dll from vb6 everything works fine but when i call it from vb.net 2.0 framework targeted - vs2010 i get this error

9193995
cos	sin
and the get set for x y do some coordinate transformation with sin and cos

9193995
public	protected
so to sum up my answer to the question would be the public interface of a class might provide set get but the actual implementation can and should be hidden by making all members private or protected

9194020
post	put
i can understand some frowning-upon making up yet another media type but i humbly suggest it s more correct than the post put alternative

9194029
mouse	keyboard
if you use a control in your datatemplate that handles mouse clicks a textbox that gets the keyboard focus this will prevent the listbox from receiving these events

9194036
mouseover	mouseout
.live mouseover function and .live mouseout function .

9194053
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer overflow unlike its signed counterpart exhibits well-defined behaviour

9194132
implements	extends
take a look at spark s own buttonbarskin for a good example and make sure these buttons at least implements iitemrenderer or just extends buttonbarbutton

9194133
draggable	droppable
i was testing out an interface i built using jquery ui draggable droppable and sortable and noticed that the drag and drop doesn t work in the mobile browser

9194189
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i got a little problem with ie6 which doesn t appear on google-chrome or safari or firefox

9194198
int	chars
there is a string.indexof chars int overload that takes a position to start the search at

9194255
subtract	add
and i basically want to add or subtract the value of the options if it s off subtract if it s on add it

9194255
subtract	add
the thing i can t work out is how to get the text of the select to do an if statement so if it s yes add the value if it s no subtract the value

9194259
disk	ram
a source bitmap is raw saved randomaccessfile on disk no ram memory then source bitmap is released now there s no bitmap at memory and after that the file info is loaded to another bitmap

9194281
tax	shipping
this causes the tax for the shipping cost to be added twice

9194304
subtract	add
i d also suggest if you re using html5 that using the data-x attribute to store the flag whether to add or subtract the value would be more semantic

9194322
children	parent
for example only release the parent when all its children s work are complete or put the release code in a completion handler block that will only be called when no child method is being executed

9194351
post	get
or you could use the post-redirect-get pattern in your post action method display the same view if there are errors or else redirect to a get view that displays something else

9194355
junit	jmock
jmock depends upon hamcrest and junit uses and includes some hamcrest classes in it s jar so this is probably where the problem comes from

9194411
hide	show
bit of a hack but you can hide the ecb windows call swap-windows and show them again like so

9194436
width	height
actually the content_css should have your site .css adding purpose so for textarea you can restrict in your css and you can set the width and height

9194439
rss	feed
on this page i had an rss feed from my homepage www.stafflink.fi but now this application page is empty

9194476
range	max
if anyone puts value in this value manually lets say to database max value then application would throw out of range exception

9194478
for-loop	arrays
i am writing a bash script where i need to create arrays inside a for-loop and name each arrays using the string contained in the counter an arrays element each iteration

9194481
hide	show
this will basically hide all controls and then show just the one you want

9194500
google-chrome	firefox
it by default have some firefox ie google-chrome instances

9194503
memcpy	strncpy
i strongly encourage the use of the safer strncpy or if you just want to copy data no 0 necessary the faster and safer memcpy

9194524
folder	directory
i create a directory in the documents directory with the string my folder by pressing a button

9194524
folder	directory
but if this directory already exist i want it to be named my folder 1 and if this exists then my folder 2 and so on.

9194534
move	drag
you d obviously want the locations of drag move touches etc. and you can get those from the event itself

9194537
post	get
then when i try to post on facebook i get the same message and i am not able to do it the operation cannot be completed

9194547
implements	extends
good but lacking the view code like the base class etc how other views implements extends it

9194569
width	height
an offset equal to -2.0 bbox width and 0.0 height scaled to base space

9194586
hide	show
so i added a new menu item to show and hide the console as an extension point and created a handler for it

9194598
google-chrome	firefox
in ie this works fine...in google-chrome and firefox 10 the buttons aren t clickable

9194615
google-chrome	safari
fyi using javascript style parameter names like backgroundcolor works fine for me here in safari 5.1.2 and google-chrome 16

9194629
vim	sublimetext	vim	textmate	textmate	sublimetext
try textmate vim or sublimetext 2

9194668
pop-up	dialog
if you want to handle pop-up dialog use

9194708
portrait	landscape
think of it as an ipad changing from landscape to portrait and a div flipping when this happens

9194718
google-chrome	firefox
in real life it s a bit more complicated since firefox and google-chrome does not wait for the file selection dialog to close before continuing the script after and internet explorer waits till it s closed before continuing

9194745
noexcept	throw
there is even a noexcept construct available to see if something might throw

9194751
put	get
and check here android how to get access to raw resources that i put in res folder

9194766
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
or use google-chrome or firefox or opera

9194808

9194819
post	get
desktop canvas integration i get post with signed_request parameter and can exchange that to access token

9194845
translation	localization
i can see localization works because the site can be seen translation in slovak

9194879
post	get
however when i post the form since the property is defined as a list of baseobject s i only get the fields that are defined on baseobject.

9194898
google-chrome	firefox
at a guess without the full code i would suggest checking the relevant js files have loaded correctly for this plugin in firefox and google-chrome

9194942
imperative	declarative
the user agent code becomes declarative and reactive rather than imperative sequences of get this then do this and then do that you simply have the mechanics for following links and many instances of when you receive this then do that

9194961
hide	show
one more idea is to hide any references when you open a document in database a but provide a button to show or update references

9194966
uicontrol	uibutton
uibutton is a sub-class of uicontrol

9195030
children	parent
iterator.remove will remove the last element from its parent s list of children you can access the parent using your parent field

9195083
google-chrome	firefox
i got this working in google-chrome firefox ie

9195087
ant	maven
ps other strategies like one uber-project with different build targets or 3 projects with entwined ant maven builders are messier

9195106
mouse	keyboard
mouse clicks and keyboard events

9195139
innodb	myisam
the database is using innodb but i also use one table running myisam to be able to perform full text search

9195153
fadein	fadeout
it also supports 2 different duration values for fadein and fadeout

9195166
ordinals	difference
i would like to know any difference between ordinals and hint value in the native dlls

9195193
idictionary	ilist
system.web.mvc.controlleractioninvoker.invokeactionmethodwithfilters controllercontext controllercontext ilist 1 filters actiondescriptor actiondescriptor idictionary 2 parameters +190

9195200
uicontrol	uibutton
a simple way to do this is to extend uicontrol instead of uiview this will allow you to add a target to all the default events same as uibutton etc

9195207
min	max
for the n 2 smallest items maintain a pair of max and min heaps

9195207
min	max
keeping corresponding items in both heaps in-sync allows while extracting largest item from the max heap or 2nd smallest item from the min heap extract corresponding item from the paired heap

9195258
for-loop	loops
you forgot to assign site correctly in the while loops - which would probably better be replaced by a for-loop iterating over the queue or something

9195258
put	get
there you get all ips you want at first you can limit to ipv4 but switching to ipv6 is easier then and can maybe put them all into the db

9195318
for-loop	loops
using else in the for-loop only triggers if you don t break out of loops earlier

9195336
piston	tastypie
am evaluating at different python restful api frameworks particularly tastypie and piston

9195362
post	put
about your second question because i ve never used pre and post actions i put these kind of tasks into the batch file i can t say anything but i guess it shouldn t be a problem

9195408
min	max
by using nsfetchrequest and returning nsdictionaryresulttype you can use nsexpressiondescription to yeild the results for functions like max and min

9195426
folder	directory
in the folder containing your files you place a .htaccess which rewrites all requests to a php handler script in the same directory something like this untested

9195437
submit	submission
in form submit checkbox sets value to on rather than true i explain how after submission a form i my checkbox values are submitted as on rather than true

9195437
puts	gets
what that does is it looks at all the inputs gets the values puts them in an object and then posts it to the server in an ajax call

9195437
submit	submission
it is in this situation where i am not submission via ajax but rather via submit that i get the serialized value of on rather then true

9195459
rss	feed
to retrieve the content i use jfeed which loads the content from a rss feed

9195471

9195770
google-chrome	firefox
as you ve done for google-chrome firefox

9195774
google-chrome	firefox
i picked the addon sdk for porting my google-chrome extension to firefox

9195776
hash	salt
obviously if you do apply a random salt then you need to store that with the hash password in the db so that you can check against a supplied password

9195779
tablet	galaxy
the code functions correctly on all honeycomb models that i have tested and in fact i have two tablet hooked up to my computer one samsung galaxy tab running 3.2 and a motorola xoom wifi running 4.0.3 and the code fails on ics and works on hc

9195786
primes	modulus
it is perfectly possible to use rsa with a modulus n that is composed of more than two primes factors p and q but two things have to be noted

9195786
primes	modulus
the security of rsa is effectively bounded by the magnitude of the second largest primes factor of the rsa modulus n

9195786
primes	modulus	modulus	fractions
finding small primes factors that are less than 2 32 can be done in a fractions of a second on a modern computer simply by trying to divide the modulus n by each such primes and check if the residue is zero meaning n is divisible by that number or not meaning that number is not a factor of n

9195807
fflush	gets
how can i write a logfile from a c# service so that it gets fflush to disk in a timely fashion

9195816

9195830
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller containing 5 tabs with every tab containing a uinavigationcontroller

9195852
primefaces	richfaces
it s unfortunate that primefaces does not support what richfaces already supports request-time re-evaluation of el in attributes

9195870
put	get
also i should mention that i put system.getproperty spring_profiles_default in my code and it does get the value passed from mvn -d so it looks like spring can not get it for some reason

9195901
opera	firefox
but why does not match this in latest firefox and opera

9195917
longlistselector	silverlight
i have a longlistselector in a windows phone silverlight project that is bound to a nested observablecollection

9195974
hash	salt
the purpose of the salt is to make it arbitrarily more difficult for an attacker to use a precomputed table of hash common passwords

9195974
hash	salt
if the salt is always the same then the attacker just precomputes a table of hash common passwords with that salt

9195974
hash	salt
the attacker now knows which two users have the same password because they have the same salt hash and can make the reasonable assumption that this is the weakest password in the database

9195977
uiview	subviews
the only solution which i found was to create an instance of uiview and add the uitextview as a subviews

9196003
folder	dir
updated the parent folder so the newly created dir appears in my working copy

9196022
getter	setter
he was arguing that if data hiding is an oop principle then aren t we breaking it by exposing via getter and setter

9196022
getter	setter
doing it via a getter or setter

9196059
width	height
try assigning the swiffy output which renders as a div some height and width via css

9196108
for-loop	loops
the if statement is not in the for-loop block so loops will spin through the assignments and the if statement only goes against the values assigned in the last iteration

9196108
int	boolean
second neither my draft nor yours returns an array just an int or a boolean

9196108
int	boolean
this gives you the output int or boolean for each member of the candidate array

kryo	avro
on a sidenote it is also the fastest serialization technique in many benchmarks beating kryo avro protocol buffers and jackson json

9196170
uiview	subviews
the only solution which i found was to create an instance of uiview and add the uitextview as a subviews

9196174
range	min	range	max	min	max
for example if you know min and max value for your id then pick a random value within the range and get the next object

9196215

9198429
orientdb	neo4j
this can be a solution but you would end up with code that is written specifically for neo4j which have his own api different from others graph databases like orientdb for example and going on with the development you would probably need a more flexible way of retrieving data and map the results to your objects so i suggest to take a look at the tinkerpop stack that is basically a series of java apis and abstraction layers to work with graph databases

similar to setting width and height on images in html to something other than its native resolution

9199281
google-chrome	firefox
doing so with a plain object as a base element works flawlessly but when using a domelement as the base element the base element is modified if a property by the same name exists on google-chrome and firefox

9199281
inherited	properties
being so affects how the prototype inherited in this case works making the native setter implementation for the value to act instead of the creation of the properties on the extended object

9199294
inherited	private-inheritance
the private-inheritance variant can introduce unnecessary multiple inherited

9199342

9199644
pop-up	dialog
it just pauses the execution of the program and a dialog box pop-up saying runtime check failure #3 - variable number is being used without being initialized

width	margin
the problem appears to be the lack of a parent container for the floating pane that caused the resize handler to have zero width and lie outside the floating pane s defined margin box

9199653
queue	fifo
linkedlist is as good as any for just basic fifo operations but there are others there that implement the queue interface in case you need something more advanced

9199668
children	parent
i tried adding a the buttons as children of a relativelayout that was centered in the middle inside the parent relativelayout and that sort of achieves what i m trying to but then the eclipse complains with a warning stating that one set of relative layout tags is useless and that i should consider getting rid of it

9199668

so what you really want is to allocate some persistent memory with strdup or malloc so that you can return it from the function

9204675
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
if you allocate the memory for content with malloc 3 you can grow the space required with realloc 3 but this introduces the potential for a horrible error -- whatever you handed the pointer to must clean up after the memory allocation when it is done with the data or else you leak memory and it cannot simply call free 3 because the content pointer might be to statically allocated memory

springboard	backgrounding
thanks for the comments i think ive sorted it out i did not have icloud on my iphone as its older one and i ve been testing on simulator and thats is why ive had this issue so if any one else has this problem the way to fix it is to start and stop your app in the simulator first as when you stop the app by clicking stop in xcode after running it kill the app the wrong way here is the log 9 02 12 12 46 52 pm application app name exited abnormally with signal 9 killed springboard 5273 which then stops the app from accessing core data while in backgrounding ill send apple a bug report but i dont know if its something they want to fix

maven	pom.xml
there is no simple maven command that will show you the chain of parent poms for a pom.xml

9204999
maven	pom.xml
you are right that technically the parent pom.xml is a dependency of your project but it is not a literal maven dependency and is handled completely differently

i want to create a dynamic widget for ibooks 2 but i can not dynamically resize the widget to match portrait or landscape mode

9211302
folder	directory
the first part of the problem was the build folder path was too long 274 characters but after changing the working directory from to it s down to 230 characters as the longest path so it should be ok

9211309
ibatis	mybatis
i m also learning ibatis mybatis and gradually getting my grips into it

9211311
superclass	subclassing
and an instance of a subclassing is also an instance of the superclass

int	chars
is a pointer to a function that returns an int and takes a chars and an int as parameters

9211332
int	double
where the parameters are an int and a double

9211346
int	chars
is a pointer to a function accepting a chars and an int as parameter and returning an int

9211349
int	chars
a pointer to function taking chars int and returning int

9211362
min	max
we only know the distance max kend - min kstart of the line and the kilometer x where it is on the line

9211362
put	get
the purpose of this set of queries is to determine the_geom in table b by calculate some math and put the output into a st_interpolate function to get the_geom of where the point in table b is

9211409
minimum	max
prove that given a max flow an s-t cut is minimum if and only if its capacity with respect to the residual network is zero

9211439
unsigned	short
most compilers treat it like a unsigned short

9211466
hive	hdfs
these are pretty completely different things -- you re talking about using a non-distributed recommender with mysql versus a hadoop-based non-distributed recommender with the output of hive on hdfs

9211499
implements	extends
then you can write multiple custom attribute classes that extends mycustomattribute and purely need to implements the validation logic for a particular scenario

9211545
mp3	wav
the list gets its items by reading a folder and filtering for mp3 wav - files

9211545
put	get
i figured out how to make the file play via onlistitemclick but i don t quite get how to put the options correctly in contextmenu and assign my list to it

9211569
width	height
also there is another way if you have access to the innerdocument of iframe if sop doesn t stop you from doing this you can compare its size against the size of iframe and increase iframe height width if necessary

9211627
accessor	properties
it happens if there is a c# simplified properties accessor defined in the interface otherwise it s ok

9211650
affinity	processors
the processors affinity mask details will be on the right

9211672
executable	upx
the executable is then compressed to roughly half of its compiled and linked size using upx

9211676
serializable	deserialization
generally speaking most serializable deserialization is tolerant of this or can be configured to be tolerant of this

9211684
hide	show
you can t show or hide sections directly with code but you can affect data sources which in turn can trigger rules

9211716
stdout	stderr
this will redirect both stdout and stderr into your file and capture and print the return code

9211731
consistency	acid
for instance when it is used with myisam it will use no acid transactions but consistency will be ensured by a r w lock at the table level

9211731
innodb	myisam
innodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisam

9211736
calloc	malloc
you can substitute malloc with calloc to initialize the elements to 0 otherwise the array might be filled with random values

9211790
public	protected
so the rmi works fine if a just return a int or something but when a try to return gamestate which is a class defined inside the gameserver java file the following error occurs game state is declared neither public protected or private

9211801
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu 11.04

9211832
post	put
in this case you would use mvc to put a rest api on top of your service layer so that you can make ajax post s using something like jquery directly to the web service to update and retrieve data for the web page

9211874
int	double
since 0 is an int literal which uses 32 bits and d is a double variable that uses 64 bits will the remaining 32 bits be filled with random garbage or does java promote the literal correctly

9211875
for-loop	arrays
easy to do with an arrays and a for-loop

9211883
folder	directory
i ve added the style sheet folder to the iis list of virtual directory - still not working

9211895
width	height
if the types x y width and height are used throughout the application then not only will there be no cast but your application will be much safer and much better documented too yeah.

9211898
min	max
there are probably other special cases you want to deal with to constrain it -- just pick min and max radians and check them before using in a transform

9211898
min	max
use min and max to limit angle1 and angle2 remember it s radians so and

9211910
maven	pom.xml
you could however roll your own maven pom.xml project that only depends on the core jars you need

9211937
int	double
conversion of an int or a long value to float or of a long value to double may result in loss of precision-that is the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value

9211937
floating-point	integer
in this case the resulting floating-point value will be a correctly rounded version of the integer value using ieee 754 round-to-nearest mode

9211937
int	double
converting from a 32-bit java int to a double which in java has 50+ bits of precision will not lose the magnitude or any precision

9212010
int	double
but it can not automatically cast double to int ie.downcast

9212068
client-side	server-side
it seems like you re confusing server-side and client-side actions

9212103
width	height
however i am failing to understand why the width and height of the images and that of its corresponding outer div is coming to 0px

9212103
width	height
an easy solution would to be change the height width from within javascript but i m sure there would be a better solution

9212157
int	chars
you say that dropping the last 3 chars of the string gets you most of the way that is the same as converting to an int and then dividing by 1 000

9212165
ctime	mktime
c qt 2010.05 mingw bin.. lib gcc mingw32 4.4.0 include c++ ctime 68 error mktime has not been declared

9212252
bitarray	bitset
a bitarray also known as a bitmap a bitset or a bitstring is an array data structure that compactly stores individual bits boolean values

9212268
width	height
probably you should make your texture have a power of 2 as height and width 512x512 or even less since it s only for a blur effect

9212323
rss	feed
i had exactly the same problem with rss feed

9212335
folder	directory
the proper way is converting the svn repo to a git repo using git-svn and then performing a clean clone throwing away the old working directory with the .svn folder and the git-svn remainders

9212349
folder	directory
besides if you have upgrade your svn to the several latest revisions there would only one .svn folder just under the root directory

9212354
voip	sip
the most widely used protocol in voip is sip and uris look like this

do always use getter and setter to access your properties

9212906
getter	setter
you put a setter and getter and do the following

9212975
versioning	upgrade
i m using radgrid from telerik radgrid.net2 i know i should upgrade to a newer versioning but that is not an option here..

9213052
getter	setter
would just creating getter setter methods on my controller class be okay

9213061
mouseup	mousedown
in other words the mousedown effects without having a mousedown wait 5 seconds mouseup effect then move to the 2nd .caption and do the same.

9213063
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i want to use text stroke in and i need it to be cross-browser firefox google-chrome safari opera ie7+

9213076
textarea	textbox
the above script works fine only when the textbox mode is set to single and the text displayed on the delivery address is copied and pasted on txtbillingaddress when the checkbox is checked but when the textmode is set to multiline the jquery fails as textarea is rendered in a different way

9213079
box-sizing	border-box
it works better with the box-sizing -moz-box-sizing for firefox set to border-box

9213088
width	height
i have just discovered that if i try to merge two videos with different width height the output is a video whose height and width is the same of the big video but contains the small one with black and wide borders

9213088
width	height
how can i merge two videos together and get an output video with a correct format width height

9213094

9213137
textarea	textbox
when you use textbox control in multiline mode it renders a textarea so accordingly your selector should be different

9213138
direct3d	directdraw
for my case see attached screenshot i can run all directdraw tests but my card doesn t support direct3d it is grayed out

9213144
calloc	malloc
i know this question may be marked as a duplicate of difference between malloc and calloc but still i would like to ask it

9213144
calloc	malloc
because i feel we can do the same using malloc which can be done by calloc

9213158
keydown	keyup
in addition also play with keydown and keyup events to figure out what suits you most

9213170
int	boolean
method.invokenative object object class class class int boolean line not available native method

9213192
tostring	getter
option 3 is provide a getter that returns the formatted phone number i called this tostring above

9213200
calloc	malloc
well calloc also initializes the memory block to contain zeroes unlike malloc

9213215
daemons	systemd
also i m not sure if it also works in other environments maybe as a systemd daemons or so

9213221
switching	screens
i have a tab host with three tabs two of them have activities that contain the same subclass of fragment i am testing the behaviour of the fragment on different positions .so when i switching from the first tab to the second the fragment shows succesfully but when i come back to the fisrt nothing is on screens .may be it is a problem of lifecycle can someone help me to figure out a solution to that

9213231
calloc	malloc
thus if you intend to set your allocated memory to zero then using malloc you have to compute twice or use a temp variable which is what calloc does

9213239
ubuntu	linux
how can i change them on ubuntu linux

9213275
portrait	landscape
so...on to my issue when loading the web app from the home screen in landscape you can see the page content behind the splash screen lighter green area in the landscape image below where the states bar was in portrait

type in maven in the filter field and select maven pom.xml file

9213323
accessor	properties
a properties may apply access modifiers to individual accessor for instance

9213332
calloc	malloc
as others have mentioned though the call to calloc will actually zero-out that memory where-as malloc will simply give you a pointer to that memory and the memory may or may not have all zeroes in it

9213357
hide	show
i have two hyperlinks above this area and would like to use those to show hide the text below

9213357
hide	show
when you click the other link it will hide the previous body of text and show the new text

9213368
cobertura	emma
like cobertura or emma reports after running the unit tests it shows me which all part of my code was fired up by the unit tests

9213377
serializable	deserialization
in case of viewmodels serializable and deserialization the referenced class instance could have duplicated instance isn t it

9213394
hide	show
i would strongly suggest using classes for both the hide show button and the hidden content areas

9213399
public	protected
one option is to design the contained type in such a way as to make its properties read-only using the access modifiers public set protected set private set etc

9213419
post	put
they handle post as update and put as new

9213501

i would like to know if there is a better way to insert the information from arrays directly without using a for-loop 500 times

9213659
exponent	modulo
the public key parameters for the rsa algorithm are the exponent and the modulo

9213659
rsa	dsa
if you re using dsa rather than rsa the public key is made up of

9213660
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox would require extensions

9213660
google-chrome	firefox
then i ll have to rewrite it as an extension for google-chrome firefox

9213678
gentoo	linux
i just installed gentoo linux amd64

9213689
integer	fractions
if you use exponents to show both integer n 0 and fractions n 0 values you have the problem that you need one exponent for 2 0 1

9213689
integer	fractions
so we are back to even numbers again 254 for both sides integer and fractions but with a lower bias

9213689
subtract	add	division	multiplication	division	exponent	division	subtract	multiplication	exponent
the same with multiplication or division you need to add or subtract exponent and if it falls below the lower threshold 0

9213707
express	node.js
passport.js offers great authentication for node.js and express including a middleware solution

9213727
next	except
i can t say anything specific without seeing a code but keep in mind that if you do not set the off screen page limit to some specific value all fragments except the current and next one are completely destroyed and created on demand when you go to the next page.

9213732
ncover	testdriven.net
unfortunately as far as i can tell testdriven.net does not yet support using other ncover arguments like ea

9213732
ncover	testdriven.net
so my best advice is to contact support testdriven.net to find out the latest on configuring and using ncover parameters

9213765
glassfish	weblogic
java ee startup classes with glassfish and weblogic

9213795
folder	directory
the output from pde build for the mac looks just like every other platform - a folder with the launcher inside next to your plugins and features directory

9213813
viewmodel	caliburn
caliburn micro has a lot of this built in to the framwork allowing you to save properties of a viewmodel or the entire graph to both phone state and app settings

9213822
calloc	malloc
for these situations calloc num size should be preferred though you could also test for overflow before calling malloc if the fact that calloc initializes the newly allocated memory to zero bothers you

9213829
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in production with google-chrome and works fine locally if i use firefox or ie for google-chrome it doesn t

9213898
memmove	memset
the worst thing possibly going on in your code is a kind of memset memmove operations which happen to overwrite memory occupied by your core data stack manager

9213942
octal	decimal
the most negative hexadecimal and octal literals of type int are 0x80000000 and 020000000000 respectively each of which represents the decimal value -2147483648 -2 31

9213942
octal	decimal
the hexadecimal and octal literals 0xffffffff and 037777777777 respectively represent the decimal value -1

int	double
a member method named foo returning an int and taking a double argument named num

9214042
int	double
a member method named foo bar returning an int and taking a double argument named num1 and a float argument named num2

9214050
int	double
you therefore need to parse it as a double and then get the int part

9214064
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested my code in all main browsers ie firefox and google-chrome and i get the same error message

9214078
width	height
why don t you use width 100 and height 100

9214085
put	get
after trying for a while to get it to work i decided to just make a blank phonegap project put the childbrowser plugin in and get it to go to google as in the example

9214102
cobertura	jacoco
from my experience jacoco is relatively light and doesn t impose much overhead whereas cobertura will impose a tremendous slowdown

9214102
cobertura	jacoco
on the other hand jacoco merely flags hit or no hit whereas cobertura gives you per-line hit counts

9214102
cobertura	jacoco
this means that jacoco will only let you find dead spots whereas cobertura will let you find rarely hit spots

9214103
range	max
although it would be better if i could limit the max range to be a year before today

9214107

9214203
ant	maven
i would appreciate your time if you could direct me to some simple tutorials articles that explain basic usage of ant and maven

9214203
ant	maven
specially if there is some basic example that really explains how well maven and or ant are used and provide benefits over static build process

9214217
infobox	infowindow
the problem is when in my kml file i add extended data a infowindow is displayed with the infobox

9214217
infobox	infowindow
without this extended data google map doesn t display this infowindow and it s fine only the infobox is displayed

if it were me i d bolt it to an incremental scroll shift and toggle an active selected class down through the sequence to show hide each frame

9214265
portrait	landscape
i have a uisplit-view that uses table-views in the left hand master area and it seems that after pushing several table-views on the root controller followed by popping them off and all the meanwhile rotating back and forth between portrait and landscape the button in portrait seemed to stop responding

9214267
post	get
when you make a hit to a json or xml web service using ajax then the parameters are just getting encoded as either get or post and is typically sent using the application x-www-form-urlencoded content type anyway see for an example specific to jquery

9214317
bindparam	pdostatement
you can use pdostatement bindparam which may be significantly faster than cis functions depending on the use case

9214383
folderbrowserdialog	filesystemwatcher
after showing the folderbrowserdialog some events will not fire in the application for example the dowork event of a backgroundworker or the renamed event of a filesystemwatcher

9214383
folderbrowserdialog	openfiledialog
if i replace the folderbrowserdialog with an openfiledialog the worker runs as expected

minix	linux
is there a linux distro other than minix with good documentation for the source code

9214491
width	height
right now i am resizing the swf onload to the screen width and height because window inner height and inner width also distort the aspect ratio

9214494
children	parent
setting the state to deleted should work if no children are loaded into the context because ef will send only a delete statement for the parent to the database and the database will delete the children as well due to the cascading delete in the database

9214494
children	parent
if however you have loaded children into the context setting the state on the parent to deleted won t set the state of the children

9215125
many-to-many	one-to-many
so my choices seem to be a shop class and a staffrole class with nhibernate many-to-many mapping between them but that won t map isrequired well in my object model so it makes sense to have a shopstaffrole class as well and one-to-many mappings between it and both shop and staffrole

9215526
int	chars
perform something like and then decode the int x into alphanumeric chars

post	get
i even added log methods to check and could see that the logs till the post method innvocation gets executed but the run method logs don t get displayed

9215550
mxmlc	compc
is it expected to see such a big difference when moving from mxmlc compiler to compc

9215550
mxmlc	compc
i know mxmlc optimizes its usage and will skip files that are not used in the application it is expected that the compc build would be slightly slower as it compiles more files but i don t think the difference should be 10 fold should it

9215563
min	max
if that is what you want use min id or max id in the select list and do not add anything to the group by

keep a priority queue of these objects ordered by time so the soonest-to-expire is always at the front this degenerates to a fifo queue if all requests get the same timeout

9216297
division	multiplication
bit shifting is much easier for a processor to do than multiplication or division

9216319
memcpy	memmove
copy should use memcpy or memmove which in turn will use fast machine code instruction

9216362
min	max
just store min x1 x2 in x_id_1 and max x1 x2 in x_id_2 whenever you insert

9216402
getter	setter
i think you need getter and setter

9216418

regarding the getelementbyid method i don t know what specifications have to say but the location differs between safari and firefox so it should be treated as an implementation detail

9216491
google-chrome	safari
on safari and therefore probably also google-chrome and other webkit derivatives it is on document s prototype s prototype

9216497
inherited	properties
this should handle all cases of setting the properties makes them easier to implement in your inherited classes and cleans things up

inherited	properties
there an object created via new foo x will get its own properties bar with the value x it s own properties baz with the value and an inherited properties datum with the value 42

9216551
post	get
what s more it doesn t work in the simple way like populating the form fields from request parameters get or post

9216609

9216742
getter	setter
this may be overkill for your situation but if you wanted you could create a constructor function with getter and setter for specific private variables

9216786
jar	war
you ve already discovered two of the possible solutions introduction of an additional parent pom for the wars perhaps the additional pom extends the original parent so you don t have to duplicate all of its config or duplicating the jar plugin config in all of the war poms

9216786
jar	war
another possibility is to use the maven-assembly-plugin instead of the jar plugin to build the classified jar for the war projects

9216786
jar	war
the assembly plugin is not included in the default lifecycles for either jar or war packaging so you could configure it in the parent s section and then only reference it in the war projects as raghuram described

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested with google-chrome firefox ie 7 8 9 and opera no problem with these

vim	emacs
another option is scion which is basically an external wrapper over the ghc api which acts as a server providing ide-like capabilities for editors like emacs and vim

9217472
min	max
this minmaxintervals function uses dice to collate the sequence and then maps the min and max functions over the resulting intervals

ffmpeg	libavformat
google for ffmpeg libavcodec libavformat

9217506
centos	linux
this is all done on linux centos

9217521
maven	pom.xml

9217543
valgrind	callgrind

i ve created latest folder in the past with a delete directory copy command but i don t want to eat up the hard drive space or add potentially minutes to the build execution time

9217642
int	boolean	int	double
from boolean to byte sbyte ushort short uinteger int ulong long decimal single or double

9217648
int	boolean
all historical versions of basic i ve seen which have supported bitwise boolean operators with int have used all-bits-set -1 as the value for true comparisons

9217648
vb.net	vb6
while vb.net is its own language quite separate from vb6 there is a lot of code which has been ported from vb6 to vb.net and may rely upon the fact that comparison operators yield all-bits-set when true

9217649
chr	multibyte
using str_replace to try and fix the bad windows character chr 148 right double quote in the above valid emdash string which does not even contain any double quotes will result in a scrambeled character at first i thought that str_replace might not be multibyte safe and tried using mb_eregi_replace but the problem was the same

9217659

9217758
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
it looks great in safari google-chrome and opera on my mac

9217758
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
perhaps it is font sizes used in ie or firefox as opposed to safari and opera

9217773
keydown	keyup
since you tagged this as flex in your main application add an event listeners for keyup and keydown

9217773
keydown	keyup
assuming your app does not have any other keyup keydown event listeners added to the stage this approach should work in theory

9217788
put	get
the issue is that when i get the values a vb macro in excel the msg id s are populated into the spreadsheet and i have to take the results and put them back into the spreadsheet another macro

9217823

9217986
submit	submission
if your submit button is submission a form remove the tag

9217996
int	double
the trouble is you are converting a decimal float double to an int so the value is simply truncated decimal values are chopped off

9218006
spock	grails
i would like to follow the progress of my grails spock integration test by outputting to stdout at the beginning of each test

9218012
folder	directory
after further scrutiny i found that ui_mainwindow.h which is generated every compile by qmake had been moved into the source directory instead of the build directory which must have caused some internal conflict with qcreator where it would not regenerate it and just copy the old one to the build folder

9218015
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
i ve been asked to look into openrasta as an alternative to asp.net-mvc asp.net at work and as a starting point i m trying to replicate the movies tutorial from the asp.net-mvc asp.net website

9218323
apache	nginx
i am new to server-side development so many of the things i m saying are probably being said incorrectly and while i understand how node.js works on its own i have seen discussions about proxying http requests through another server technology a la nginx or apache for efficiency

9218350
x86	64bit
assemblies marked for x86 can still run on 64bit windows

9218352

you have to make a rdlc file but what you can do is to fill this rdlc with columns you need and depending on what you need you show hide the columns

9218383
x86	64bit
in your project which is 32 bit only then x86 or only 64bit only then x64

9218395
sorting	filtering
this works perfect if we not decide to filtering but if we want to filtering the values we see the ugly binding.donothing in the filtering drop down items the sorting and filtering is also wrong

9218404
vim	emacs
the developers which work to the same project using unix emacs or vim editor are bored to see each time the ctrl-m m character

9218430
division	modulo
on the odd chance you are not familiar with it the modulo - aka percent sign - will give you the remainder of division

9218454
getter	setter
is there any way to implement this without creating getter setter or using a pointer to a new a int with the desired value

9218473
folder	directory
use the path relative to the resources folder that you included as a source directory in the build path options if you weren t aware of how to add the folder as a source folder right click on the project go to properties go to flex build path click the source tab and add it there

9218547
uitableview	nsindexpath
in your - void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath make sure check whether indexpath.row is equal to array count if that s the same then

9218562
getter	setter
you could just make it a class with everything public thats all a struct is and use an initialisation list - no need for getter setter

9218567
getter	setter
i have used the property decorator to turn getlocalname into the attribute local_name - in python getter setter are considered bad practice

9218583
apache	nginx
when you say through another technology i assume you mean through a dedicated web server such as nginx or apache

using getter and setter is in my opinion more correct than accessing the right hand sides s members directly

9218633
put	get
they will be called when a view did get put into the dom or will get put into the dom respectively

9218637
maven	m2e
i suggest trying out the m2e-wtp plugin in addition to your currently installed m2e plugin which doesn t contain support for wtp based projects this plugin is available in the eclipse marketplace via the embedded marketplace client or on the web it provides a tighter maven integration with wtp and should improve the overall maven with wtp experience

9218700
post	get
.load uses post or get depending on the parameter passed

9218738
width	height
i would also recommend not even doing 9 td s in the 1st because it s redundant the images will push the boundaries of the table to fit their specs regardless of td height width settings

9218815
mef	prism

the background-size property is supported in ie9+ firefox 4+ opera google-chrome and safari 5+

9218942
int	double
but why the double and add 1 rule as opposed to doing what python does which is to hash int to themselves

9218962
int	boolean
accessing a byte boolean can be more work than accessing an int or long so if performance is the only consideration a int or long can be faster

9218981
getter	setter
i m still new to ruby but i recall that class fields are all private so they would need to be accessed through getter setter methods

range	minimum
i recall minimum executables in the 400k code range on a powerpc

9218985

in comparison the rtems minimum c executable is probably in the 32-40k range on that same target

9219019
zypper	yum
most linux distros i think but am not completely sure maintain these sort of dependency lists for yum or zypper or apt or whatever the package manager is by hand and only one layer deep leaving it up to the package manager to traverse the graph

9219038
width	height
similarly if i wanted it to repeat-y it would make the 100px the width instead of the height

9219040
width	height
you can create a single full width element with the height and background color you desire

9219052
put	get
when all is said and done i get 69 and 12 put those together i get 6912 but didnt need a full 4 digit adder to get there

9219052
subtract	add
the avr may have other ways to solve the problem but most processors at least have two forms of add and two forms of subtract so that you can cascade the adder to be as wide as you need

9219146
post	get
i know there are many post about this issue however i cannot find one single answer on here that describes exactly what i am trying to do and i have been searching for hours...so hopefully you all can help me and steer me in the right direction the main thing i cannot figure out how to do is get the source file and pass that to my update function where i will ftp that file to the remote server.

9219204
width	height
width 100 and height 100

9219209
width	height
need to set the width and height of the wrapper div also if the image is not in the same directory as the css the reference is wrong

9219226
inherited	subclassing
as for the updating as far as i can gather you would add extra overhead by doing all that separately from the raw data however it might not be avoidable in which case you might as well subclassing the bullets into various subclassing that implement the various differencies all of which inherited a common draw -function or override a getvertices -function and possibly a gettexvertices to allow for varying implementations there

9219227
disk	ram
of course when the source file is open it s content by the time of editing as wel as any user changes even not saved are loaded in the ram but it doesn t compare it to disk content that d be too slow it listens to a system event when the system tells it the file changed

9219230
google-chrome	firefox
assigning the handler directly to onload works in google-chrome firefox and ie tested with ie 8

filtering	grouping
on the main report i have a parameter to filtering by grouping and i have it set to filtering by grouping unless you choose all for the parameter then it shows all grouping

9219276
filtering	grouping
this filtering setup works fine on the individual sub reports however if i run it selecting all as part of the main grouping it causes the sheet to loop indefinitely and doesn t show the data properly

9219320
width	height
set the width and height of the wrapper as others have said and join those css styles in one declaration and you can get rid of all other styles once you set the dimensions of the container

9219335
hash	salt
that s most likely because the membership provider hash the password and salt it for saving and retrieving the hash is compared not the unhashed password

9219354
implements	extends
right now i m trying to use a jdbcpagingitemreader by extends abstractsqlpagingqueryprovider to implements my own query-based paging strategy but it s proving more difficult than anticipated

look a bit into these technologies and make a little server-side script that gathers data from the database and send it in a structured format to the phone json xml then make a script in javascript on the client-side that parse these data and utilise them

9219535
getter	setter
as such it was fairly unclear how fluid or otherwise the resulting setter getter could be expected to be

you can either pull down those changes to your local branches and solve any problems before pushing which you might have to resolve on your other machine on the next pull otherwise or you can push to specific branches with the -notation

9219607
oncreate	setcontentview
add oncreate and setcontentview inside the method

the children are execing sort and are sorting input they receive from the parent

9220028
getter	setter
i thought that using property synthesize statements was equivalent to me creating the getter setter

9220028
getter	setter
i had always assumed that if i was using a property in this sense it was perfectly valid to use the getter setter with dot syntax in the form

9220065
floating-point	integer
for example if you compare an nsnumber object that has an integer value with an nsnumber object that has a floating point value the integer value is converted to a floating-point value for comparison

9220094
post	get
it s not clear to me from your code where the post action is getting from or what it is doing with it but you will need some way of passing this same this to your get action probably as a single string that is comma separated

9220100
for-loop	arrays
i m writing a pitch detection program in java and compare two doubles in each iteration of a for-loop in order to determine the highest magnitude point in a sample arrays

width	height
then if the ratio is say 150 you can change change the width and height of you fixed object using javascript and multiplying each by .66666

9220193
getter	setter
by using the getter and probably a setter too you will adhere to the information hiding promise whereas by using direct access to the member variables you won t

9220193
getter	setter
considering convention you would have to stick to setter and getter - no matter what names you give them though

9220221
int	chars	int	boolean
there is a deal code which shuffles the deck which is in base 36 and in a saved game i have two other data structures with boolean and small int - less than 36 - all will work as digits in base 36 or using just one case of letters and numerals and a few punctuation chars as separators in the mix

9220232
filtering	grouping
thus you filtering on ranking 1 to grab the first from each grouping

9220295
public	protected
i see that i can go into the designer.cs file to change the access modifiers from protected to public but it would be too much work if i have to update that file every time i make a change to the ascx file

in that case the button takes the height of the image that a put in the width is ok

9220403
integer	unsigned
in order to state which children a voxel has i m using an unsigned 8-bit integer

9220403
children	parent
it so happens that a pointer to the parent in this case it stored as a global variable and each voxel also stores a pointer to it s children could this be the problem

example of rss feed link not working

9220458
hide	show
putting the javascript code as near the top of the document and not wrapping the code in a document.ready event handler allows you to minimize the flash of content that is common when trying to hide show content based on js

9220464
put	get
in the terminal i get what i want output i just want to use a variable and put the output into a variable

9220496
primes	modulus
if 1000000007 or whatever modulus is primes you can do divisions using the modular inverse

9220498
multiplying	division
then the result of the division can be found by multiplying the numerator n by the reciprocal 1 d to get n d

9220516
width	height
because absolutely positioned elements do not fill the box of the playarea div the height and width you assign each child div do not expand playarea s height and width

9220516
width	height
in this case giving playarea a width of 580px and height of 785px will position the p element correctly

9220541
portrait	landscape	viewdidload	viewwillappear
my app is fixed to landscape mode yet during viewdidload and even viewwillappear the following portrait dimensions still return

9220547
hash	salt
however dictionary attacks don t try to decrypt the password hash so salt or no salt it doesn t matter they will just try out many passwords until one works

9220557
hash	salt
if the attacker has the password hash and salt used by your site app they will simply brute force salt + password

9220557
hash	salt
however using a salt offers more protection against rainbow tables precalculated hash tables so they re still worth using

9220570
hash	salt
if a hacker has both the hash and salt used as well as knows the algorithm used to hash the password then it s simply a matter of time to crack it

9220570
hash	salt
which brings us to the primary reason why we hash salt things in the first place to buy time

9220581
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
ok so i am not that knowledgeable with math outside of basic addition subtraction multiplication and division i do not know much more then that

9220597
fontfamily	font-size
the bounding boxâ s height is based on font-size and fontfamily but is independent of the actual string

9220597
fontfamily	font-size
when we recreate the text in svg by generating it in php we can get the font-size correct and the fontfamily correct

9220617
hash	salt
calculation of hash on the fly are done pretty quick as with salt he will need to recalculate all and wont be able to use predefined lists

9220669
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to open an user control memo.ascx as pop-up using jquery dialog in an aspx page

9220699
subtract	add
the modulussubtract in compose only came in 6.6.1-6 and according to that changelog it was previously named subtract and add so you can use -compose subtract instead

9220732
awt	swing
addendum see also painting in awt and swing opacity

9220735
innodb	myisam
based on this oracle blog article and attached whitepaper i assume that migrating from myisam to innodb may solve your problems

9220735
innodb	myisam
innodb delivered 4.6x higher throughput than myisam while achieving

9220735
innodb	myisam
you should probably benchmark your queries on both myisam engine and innodb make sure that you set up foreign key s correctly

9220770
int	double
you see the warning because log10 is defined for float double and long double but not int and it s being called with a int

9220770
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop is doing a linear search for the maximum of digits in any of the numbers in the arrays

9220791
int	double
as for the ambiguous call error you get it because you are calling log10 with an int argument which can be converted equally to float double and long double all types for which log10 is overloaded so the overload to choose is not clear to the compiler

9220808
gitolite	gitosis
first use gitolite instead of gitosis

9220808
gitolite	gitosis
add a repo to gitolite gitosis

ember.js	backbone.js
we re going to use backbone.js or ember.js but i have a concern

int	chars
so far i have only managed to convert it from say int 65 to chars a

9220910
portrait	landscape
the second issue i have with the same data is that when i turn the phone to landscape while the tables stretch out nicely the dropdown list description actually truncates gets smaller cutting off some of the value which was otherwise displayed ok in portrait mode - any idea how to prevent

9220923
put	get
google doesn t seem to agree with that and no matter what i put in the accept-encoding -header i always get the content back encoded in gzip

9220935
subtract	add
you could programatically retrive the current axis with plt.axis and then subtract add a small margin on and re-set it

9220959
background-color	transparency
likely problem an element with no background or background-color transparency will not trigger click events in ie 6-8 at least not sure about 9 when clicking that non- background

9221059
google-chrome	firefox
in my opinion google-chrome firefox and ie s current behavior is a bug ndash

9221060
post	get
if you posted to get to the current page instead of a post then a response.redirect to get the current page when you hit the browser s refresh button it s going to re-post

9221070
qtkit	avfoundation
to do this it s easiest to use avfoundation frameworks instead of qtkit as editing manipulating the video is much easier imo though it seems to be a bit slower and the code may be less compact

9221072
dictionary	map
a dictionary hash map etc. would easily handle those requirements although your third requirement would be an o n operation

9221107
getter	setter
a possible downside is that this object is totally open such that if you invoke a nonexistent method on it it will just return nil if you invoke a setter it will create both the setter and getter

9221141
hash	salt
using a salt is to be recommended even if you use a slow hash method

9221188
post	get
get data from services on the server side using http get post or ajax calls

9221263
width	height
issue is that user may link to an image that is of extremely large height and width which is more than the height and width of the div it is in causing some overflow layout issues

9221269
width	height
basically itâ s a way to make elements inline but preserving their block capabilities such as setting width and height top and bottom margins and paddings etc

9221282
hide	show
if all of your data is known ahead of time you can put it all on the original page response then hide show the appropriate divs but it sounds to me like you want live data in which case you need to request the live data from the server

9221308
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this is in httpd.conf not .htaccess

9221342
qobject	qwidget
also would it be possible to create a plugin that inherits from the interface and a baseclass that inherits from qwidget that inherits from qobject

9221353
google-chrome	firefox
this submits on firefox but not on google-chrome

9221372
versioning	upgrade
if whoever bundled the app on the device does a proper job of it then the app will still have a market link even as a system app and market will prompt the user to upgrade it if a new versioning is available

9221385
mouseover	mouseout
what you need to do is set the css display property to block on mouseover and none on mouseout

9221404
hash	salt
if every password is hash with an individual salt you can t re-use information in the same way

9221430
stdout	stderr
opens a gnome-terminal executes folder script1 and directs stderr of the gnome-terminal command to stdout

9221430

put	get
so i added the google analytic code to my site and when i load the page my page returns blank i tried posting it right before the closing head and also tried to put it right before the closing body ..i still get the same result i have done this on another site and it worked fine so i dont know whats going on...anyone has any idea

when i try to put new shot in list of shots for the player i get nullreferenceexception

9221550
avr-gcc	winavr
after reading about how to set up an arm cross compiler i get the feeling that something like winavr avr-gcc was doing a lot of stuff like this for me behind the scenes so i wouldn t have to deal with it

9221590
chown	chmod
chmod to 755 and chown to regular user took care of the problem

9221606

9221625
rspec	minitest
i recently switched an application from rspec to minitest it was well worth it

9221625
capybara	minitest
the improvement extends to integration acceptance testing i find minitest with capybara much more readable straightforward than cucumber much less brittle

9221646
for-loop	loops
you can shed the do while loops in favour of one for-loop

9221647
hide	show
do i need an container and show hide mainview progress

9221668
google-chrome	firefox
lets assume you are using a browser like ie firefox or google-chrome and that we aren t talking about using network functions from the arduino

9221693
hide	show
and script using show and hide instead of changing the visibility style

9221747
for-loop	loops
there are several great suggestions for refactoring the code to remove the duplication of effort here but to get the program functioning immediately you ve got to break out of the for-loop surrounding loops

9221749
setcontentview	findviewbyid
assuming you use findviewbyid to initialize button you would need to do that every time that you do setcontentview r.layout.view1

9221750
pull	push
a regular spring would apply both tension and compression forces pull and push depending on the deflection

9221778
disk	ram
another difference unlike ec2 auto-scaling scalr allows you to scale based on cpu ram disk network users.

9221804
nstableview	nssegmentedcontrol
so either you wired things up the wrong way or you have a severe memory management problem where the nssegmentedcontrol is deallocated and an nstableview is currently to be found at its memory location

9221819
folder	directory
i ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling socket.io i ve tried moving the project folder to different directory locations i ve tried moving the socket.io to an external folder and a few others that i can t seem to remember atm

be a good citizen though and unbind the service on onpause and rebind in onresume so that the service can be killed if needed

9221924
disk	ram
little disk usage not too much ram needed

9222034
put	get
but when i put this in a loop it fails to get the inputstream

9222037
ceil	floor
adding ceil and floor calls might be another option as they would give you better control over the floating point to integer conversion

9222050
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload viewdidappear have been called for the controller having this webview when you are loading this string to webview

9222099

9222145
cos	sin
sin and cos should do the trick

9222154
put	get
the mapper won t return the out parameters but you can get mybatis to set them onto the parameter object or put them into a map like this

9222154
getter	setter
so given a simple java object with getter and setter for all the fields

9222161
screens	tablet
i initially chose one of my screens and in the layout editor i chose qualifiers for 7 tablet of w1024dp and landscape

maven	pom.xml
you just need to add the extra stuff - for example here s mine from a standard pom.xml we use as a parent to all of our maven projects

9222168
touchesmoved	touchesended
we have to write the same in touchesmoved and touchesended also

9222209
width	height
i ve seen examples where you can display inline content in fancybox with a pre-set width and height but i want it to change size depending on users browser widow size

9222210
cpu	processors
if you get through the protection of the cpu operating system and were to write to an address in that space it will go right out the processors through the pcie controllers and into the video card either causing havoc or maybe just changing the color of a pixel

9222212
put	get
i know just a little objective-c and need a tutorial that will explain everything because i do not get a bunch of the code like why they put it there and why it has to be a capital letter or why a space is there

9222283
powerpc	i386
i was compiling qt with -universal option to generate libraries for both i386 and powerpc architectures but the openssl that i was compiling it with was built for x64_86 arch

9222283
powerpc	i386
i built openssl statically for both i386 and powerpc and then compiled qt and everything is fine now

9222353
getter	setter
the second method would be to have a pojo which would have a getter and setter method for this variable and store it in the pojo which in turn is stored in an arraylist

9222378
allegro	sdl
if you don t want to implement the blitting yourself use sdl or allegro

9222383
maven	pom.xml
then in the pom.xml of artifact a i use a special configuration of the maven dependency plugin as follows

9227756
postgresql	mysql
this is also very useful for migrating your db to other rdbms for example mysql to postgresql or oracle

9227763
post	put
the problems i have start when trying to send the nmes as a json http post or put request to my webserver using the following code

9227792
hide	show
one way to do something like this is to have a layout that contains the row of buttons you want to show or hide

9227792
hide	show
you can then use an onclicklistener to set the button clicks to show or hide the layout

9227795
daemons	systemd
this is fine when it comes to human interaction with the systemd as the human can enter the passphrase to unlock the private key and then decrypt the data however when it comes to automated services which need to access the data to process transactions at a later date there is an issue with how best to provide the credentials to the service daemons process

9227795
daemons	systemd
the daemons process will be run as its own user and group on a linux systemd

9227885
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i think your login view should be represented by a simple uinavigationcontroller or even a uiviewcontroller

9227893
associativity	operator-precedence
in order to understand the order of operations you need to remember that the cast will be applied to the object to the right but the rules that affect when it is applied depends on msdn s operator-precedence and associativity

9227909
button	checkbox
if the values are mutually exclusive you might consider using radio button instead of checkbox

9227926
screens	tablet
we have tested this in several devices and while mobile phones seem to run the application fine we haven t detected any issues on any of them some tablet seem to have problems when drawing the textures in the screens

9227934
maven	m2e
as far as i remember the support of wtp was removed from the plugin since the maven eclipse m2e plugin got more advanced

9227977
qobject	qmetaobject
quazipfile qt_static_metacall qobject qmetaobject call int

9227997
filtering	grouping
i ve researched for a way to edit the module s schema to reflect the relation between client_id and partner_id with their grouping name to get the filtering form select fields right but i ve ended believing that that is a wrong approach

9228019
width	height
place image as background or set height width to 100 in css

9228022
screens	mdpi	screens	tablet	tablet	mdpi
for example an image that filled a screens on a phone-sized mdpi device with a screens resolution of say 480x320 wouldn t fill the screens on an mdpi tablet device with a screens resolution of 1280x800 without blowing the image up

9228022
put	get
one idea could be to put your images at the highest resolution you can get in the drawable-nodpi or assets folders

9228023
width	height
it s been caused by the fact that the image img sometimes was not completely loaded at the time the script asked for its width and height

9228059
versioning	upgrade
well the problem seems to have hidden in the fact the project was upgrade from older versioning of vs i suppose starting from 2005

when selects the first dropdownlist value create javascript ajax event to get data and put them all in second dropdownlist

9228129
post	get
i m trying to get rid of an exception httpexception applicationerror 5 i get when using httplib in a python27 api running on google appengine - further detailed in this post applicationerror2 and applicationerror5 when communicating with external api from appengine

9228153
httpresponse	request
you could use net.httpwebrequest to request a given url to get the lastmodified property of the httpresponse

9228161
getter	setter
first of all check your getter and setter in bookingbean.java

9228170
jar	war
it s a good option for when you have a jar library that doesn t change often but you update the war frequently

9228170
jar	war
and obviously you could have a mix so maybe the jar is standalone but you have a multi-module project that contains the two war files

9228186
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
i ve done something like this myself and i think you should do it exactly as you said simply track each move with the touchesbegan and touchesmoved and touchesended and use the cgrectintersect with your uiimageviews or coordinates however you want to do it

9228188
superclass	subclassing
object slicing refers to assignment by value of a subclassing instance to a superclass instance thereby losing part of the information the subclassing specific data members are ignored

9228309

firefox	safari
i have css3 gradients and css3 background-clip but firefox safari and ie don t render them

9228417
fontfamily	font-size
the letter can have different font-size or fontfamily attributes etc

9228517
children	parent
note that the method doesn t check whether the children of a parent node was loaded just pushes the new node into an empty childnodes array

9228517
children	parent
after all these operations end other children of a parent node are never shown in the tree

9228525
for-loop	loops
i know i could use unique function to find the whole distinct users and after to run the for-loop through all the rows check if equal and then sum up but the problem is that i have more than 8mln rows and to run double loops it would be too expensive

9228538
hide	show
if the user selects another cell hide the currently selected cell and show a new cell below the newly selected cell

9228572
outputstream	inputstream
check here to see how to convert outputstream to inputstream when you ll be able to make another audioinputstream and save your audio file

9228799
jlabel	jslider
typically it s not documented which default alignment a component type has jslider is centered by default me incorrectly thought that a jlabel were centered while it is left-aligned

9228802
maven	pom.xml
maven at least provides a mechanism to break a project up into separate modules each with a metadata file pom.xml describing the modules s license

9228802
maven	pom.xml
assuming your module is open source indicate that license in a commented header and publish that license in the maven pom.xml

9228826
setcontentview	findviewbyid
calling findviewbyid on the activity object will only work if the current activity layout is set by setcontentview

9228835
ant	maven
if i m not wrong when you go to eclipse s run- run configurations and create an android application to launch your project you basically ask eclipse android sdk to build the .apk with ant for you not with maven

9228842
temp	tmp
change tmp and temp variables from userprofile appdata local temp to c temp and press ok in all open dialogs

9228844

i have found object graph serialization in .net and code versioning upgrade but i don t think the linked articles apply when there are major changes in the model

the way a cherry-pick works is by taking the diff a changeset represents the difference between the working tree at that point and the working tree of its parent and applying it to your current branch

9229397
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
your code suggests that you are using a uigesturerecognizer most likely a uitapgesturerecognizer to detect the initial tap

9229397
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
the problem is that uigesturerecognizer is being greedy and stopping the uibutton from receiving the touch

9229423
set	bag
collections list set collection bag could be set to empty collection so that you dont have to check for null as the underlying nature of hibernate does not distinguish between a null collection association and an empty one

9229424
hash	md5
however you also could consider cryptographically hashing the content md5 sha1 etc... and adding a unique index to the hash

9229506
post	put
i put out a blog post on this

9229516
popupwindow	pop-up

post	put	post	get	put	get
rest uses a uniform set of standard verbs put post get delete quite unlike soap

other than testing the app in portrait mode then close it to test it in landscape mode

9230853

assuming that we re talking about overloading operator for all classes derived from std ostream to handle the matrix class and not overloading for matrix class it makes more sense to declare the overload function outside the math namespace in the header

9230863
stdout	stderr
we ve got an old web ui wherein part of it polls an appliance via ajax to get the results of long-running commands so the progress and stdout stderr of the commands can be displayed to the user

another potential solution is to have a look at some of the uiview methods for adding removing or exchanging subviews

9230917
hide	show
i believe you want to show hide these options based on the vegetarian option selection

9230918
ironruby	ironpython
the good news is that the code of ironpython ironruby and the dlr is open source and has recently been re-licensed under the apache2 license

9230937

9230998
put	get
then you have to put eclipse s package-list which you get here in your working-directory

9231095
public	protected
there is no reason you can t add more parameters to the afterconstructionhook but since your reference to sender is already of type tmycomponent i don t see the point when you can access everything public or protected in tmycomponent sender from within your hook function and if you inherit locally known as a protected-access class you can access the protected stuff too

9231125

9231344
free	malloc
the only pointers you may ever pass to free are those obtained by malloc or those obtained from functions which are specified to return a pointer to memory as if obtained by malloc

9231344
free	malloc
strtok_r does not return a pointer to a string as if obtained by malloc so you may not call free on it

9231363
post	get
if the parameters are in the post or the get then you would use requestparam instead

9231410
int	double
currently that means i have two versions one for double and one for int

9231410
atoi	atof	atoi	strtod	atof	strtod	strtol	atof	strtol	strtod	strtol	atoi
it is common to see this in the standard libraries but they are not consistent enough to use a guideline atof atol and atoi is one set and strtod strtol strtoul is a different set and abs labs is a third

9231446
hash	salt
thereafter you ll save the hash and salt in your database something like

9231446

i m implementing a jpa-like process all classes representing a table must subclassing a dbtable abstract-class which contains a hashmap linking column names string to java.lang.reflect.field i got from calling getclass .getdeclaredfields in the superclass constructor called from the subclassing constructor

9231591
superclass	subclassing	implements	modifiers
i want to dynamically set these members of the subclassing from a resultset which would call the field.set this resultset.getxxx column in a method originally implements in the superclass as a helper but i get a java.lang.illegalaccessexception class dbtable can not access a member of class mytable with modifiers protected

9231591
abstract-class	superclass
so it turns out the method is executed in the superclass context the abstract-class

floating-point	integer
as a general rule i would provide at most one floating-point and one integer version unless it s really performance-critical to get the benefit of working on smaller types

9231834
inherited	properties
by using for..in you are looping through all of the array object s properties including inherited ones through the prototype model

9231841

if i don t like some small thing because of git diff in the shell i don t use emacs vc features very often although when i do i love them i open it with vim and get the hell out faster than i could hit alt-tab

9232189
vim	emacs
the fact that emacs editing commands are more readily available while typing make typing much faster than it is in vim

9232189
vim	emacs
that means things like org mode which i use for everything todo lists bug tracking notes long emails documentation... make more sense to me in emacs than they would in vim

9232198
apache	nginx
writing your own server may be a nice learning experience but i am not sure you d be able to make it nearly as performant as nginx or apache

9232244

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i tested this with google-chrome firefox and safari and it worked fine

9232287
subclass	abstract-class
itemizedoverlay is an abstract-class so you need to create your own subclass of it

9232300
debugdiag	debugging	adplus	procdump
i am not very familiar with debugdiag but tools such as adplus debugging tools for windows and procdump will both let you create dumps for this

9232314
int	double
just don t convert t2 and t1 to some other type int or double before doing the subtraction

9232314
subtraction	modulo
well modulo 2 32 the result of subtraction wraps around too

9232355
getter	setter
i haven t debugged it but i bet eventually calls defaultmbeanserverinterceptor.registerobject which creates a dynamicmbean for you and properly registers your standard javabean properties setter and getter

9232369
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
unfortunately i am seeing an issue in safari that doesn t appear in firefox or google-chrome

9232392
google-chrome	firefox
this code needs activex control support so it works in ie only in firefox or google-chrome in throws an error of activex needed

9232451
post	get
now i need to use the mysql function password to get the password post hash

9232454

my system is an independent server running on my company intranet which hosts the domain controller ldap server etc and uses kerberos protocol

9232482
kerberos	ldap
network info iis 6 ldap kerberos

9232524
requestfactory	gwt
however i m working with gwt requestfactory and have implemented a locator for my brand and one for my car so i would assume the locator would take care of that business for me

9232546
pop-up	dialog
again i am just trying to get around having that dialog box pop-up

9232547
typedef	struct
the trick here was to forward declare the actual struct type not the typedef d name

9232557
hide	show
the hiding is done with jquery and we want to change the value of hide_todo to true if the user clicks hide and false when the user clicks show

9232587
width	height
set the height and width properties webkit will assign them to the appropriate orientation

9232595
int	chars	int	double
simple types bool byte chars short int long float and double

9232602
keystore	jks
what would make sense would be to build a new keystore jks that you would use as a truststore using the ca certificates not sure if you ve been provided with them

9232602
keystore	jks
that s why it might be better to create a separate truststore keystore jks might be easier for the ca certificates

9232604
comparator	icomparer
since my implementation of priority queue has an icomparer field i think it is sufficient to add a comparator property to edit this field like as follows

9232604
queue	fifo
how to manage the transition from fifo mode to priority mode when there are still elements in the default queue

9232622
sorting	grouping
there is another way by using jobconf but that again does not seem to work in terms of setting mappers reducers partitions sorting and grouping classes

9232660
daemons	launchd
if you are launchd your daemons using sudo launchctl

9232660
daemons	launchd
when you will launchd your daemons using sudo launchctl

google-chrome	firefox
following code works perfectly on firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8

9232690
rss	feed
i have a sharepoint 2007 site the exposes rss feed to a static html page

9232738
webclient	httpwebrequest
i searched around and found different codes in which you can inherit the webclient from httpwebrequest and set the timeout for example

9232766
html5lib	beautifulsoup
i was finally able to resolve this issue through parsing the html through html5lib before handing it off the beautifulsoup 4

9232867
post	get
once i get these templates created i ll post them somewhere findable so others in this situation can same some time

9232881
post	get
when twilio makes the request you should be able to get the variables out of the post request like any post request

9232910
post	get
as mentioned in this post there are lots of things you can t even get a notice for losing power internet connection etc

9232946
unsigned	short
thus if you have an unsigned c type that goes from 0 to 255 the smallest java type that can represent the upper half of that range is a short

9232953
folder	directory
if not go into the hudson home jobs directory and open the config.xml found under the folder named after the job and remove the reference to the plugin

9232957
magento	oscommerce
i ve been developing e-commerce sites for a long time starting with yahoo oscommerce zencart and then moving on to magento several years ago

9232983
dictionary	map
you could have a dictionary that is a map from your keys to filenames and then each file has the 1000x1000 array in it

9232992
children	parent
when a parent is selected their children show up in a new dropdown

9233036
observer-pattern	mediator
in the original book that coined the terms observer and mediator design patterns elements of reusable object-oriented software it says that the mediator pattern can be implemented by using observer-pattern

9233036
observer-pattern	mediator
however it can also be implemented by having colleagues which are roughly equivalent to the subjects of observer-pattern have a reference to either a mediator class or a mediator interface

9233036
observer-pattern	mediator
or if mediator is implemented using observer-pattern the button would say hey observers which would include the mediator my state changed someone clicked me

9233036
observer-pattern	mediator
in my example that probably makes less sense then directly referencing the mediator but in many cases using observer-pattern to implement mediator would make sense and the difference between observer and mediator would be more one of intent than a difference in the code itself

9233051
width	height
if i have a swf that s being loaded into other peoples swfs which i have no control over is there any way i can get properties from the stage such as height width fullscreenheight etc. or does this have to be exposed by the loading swf

9233083
actionscript	haxe
there is a library for haxe which makes it possible to compile actionscript assembly language into abc at runtime but this is still lower-level than the actionscript you normally write

9233083
actionscript	haxe
actually there is a runtime library for executing haxe code which again is very similar to actionscript

9233098
post	get
when i try to assign the data sent with the post method to an object i get the following error

9233154
bmp	png
however silverlight s image control doesnt support displaying bmp s so i need to convert the bmp byte to png or jpg byte

opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
bearing in mind i want the outcome to be cross browser compatible ie6 -ie9 firefox 3+ google-chrome safari opera how sensible does this approach sound

9233198
hash	salt
edit i should note that this technique transfers the responsibility of security to the server - you ll want to use salt hash for password comparison on the server an idea you ll see in some of the other comments for this question

9233198
hash	salt
this prevents the plaintext password from appearing anywhere except the edittext view on the device the ssl communication to the server and the server s ram while it salt and hash the password

9233207
verilog	vhdl
the synopsis is that synthesis transforms high level verilog vhdl constructs which don t have real physical hardware that can be wired up to do your logic into low level logical constructs which can be literally modeled in the form of transistor logic or look-up tables or other fpga or asic hardware components

9233256
prepare	execute
i ve extended the pdo class to create a simple db class and currently use prepare + execute for all queries run to the database even the ones that do not have parameters select from table

9233256
prepare	execute
the question is is there a performance benefit to actually use pdo query for simple queries that do not have parameters instead of prepare execute

9233259
width	height
i have a 2.1 avd with the default values so the screen is smaller and this works exactly as expected- the image is scaled up to fill the width and the view height is wrapped to the scaled height

9233259
width	height
on my droid bionic with a longer screen and on any avd with the same screen dimensions this doesn t work- the image is scaled to fill the width but the view is wrapped to the original pre-scale image height so the top and bottom are cropped off

9233268
ord	chr
use chr and ord

9233278
range	max
i believe the range i would like to filter is a floiting point with max 6 digits

9233294
google-chrome	safari
the first thing would be to open the console in google-chrome or safari and check the javascript console to determine if it is a javascript error

9233303
prepare	execute
yes because when you call pdo prepare the server must create a query plan and meta information for that query then there is additional overhead to bind the specified parameters when you use pdo execute

9233305
width	height
iâ ve tried jquery bigtext and jtextfill but they both seem to depend on a fixed width height

9233305
width	height
as each database query returns various number of rows columns i canâ t set a fixed width height as it would not maximize the screen with a small table result

9233317
apache	nginx
node.js isn t running on neither its own nor apache nginx it doesn t need a webserver to run at all imagine a node.js script that copies files for example

9233317
apache	nginx	ssl	https
and sure you can if you have written a webserver in node.js put it behind apache nginx to let them serve static files for example or to use https since ssl support for node.js isn t very stable yet compared to apache nginx

9233334
unsigned	short
this seems to work with word being unsigned short

9233339
mouse	keyboard
set it to false and excel will block all keyboard and mouse input except for any dialog boxes you display

9233352
internationalization	translation
the first big step is internationalization aka i18n implement the structure that will allow to translation your website and present it to user in different cultures

9233352
internationalization	localization
internationalization is a bit like climbing the mountain in front of your village and localization is getting down from the top of the mountain to the villages in the different other valleys climbing up the mountain is not an easy task but it s the shortest path to travel to the surrounding valleys

9233368
apache	nginx
i migrated from apache 2 to nginx and i ve got problems to handly my subdomain control

9233369
inherited	properties
then make specific styles for each of the specific controls and use the basedon properties to inherited from the basic style

9233382
filtering	grouping
the having then filtering those grouping

9233406
post	put
put another way if you had 100 urls you could post that array probably as json as well to mysite.tld huntergatherer - it does whatever it wants in whatever language you want and just returns json

9233412
content-length	content-type
you can configure apache to only return the minimum set of headers which would basically be content-type text plain or another shorter mime type possibly custom mimetype content-type a b and content-length 0 thus not returning a response body at all

9233430
junit	testng
you can use parametrized test with junit or testng or write a simple wrapper java application

9233442
for-loop	loops
in general though a foreach loops only directly touches the source expression once when it fetches the iterator - whereas a for-loop has no magic in it and how often it s accessed simply depends on the code - both the condition and the step part of the for-loop are executed on each iteration so if you refer to the variable in either of those parts you ll see any changes.

9233445
inherited	properties
or if #testobject2 is a children of the #testobject1 element and it inherited the properties declared in that css piece

9233462
verilog	hdl
verilog is both a scripting language and a hdl hardware description language

9233462
verilog	hdl
almost all of that is irrelevant when you are restricted to the synthesizable subset of verilog which can be used as an hdl

9233462
verilog	hdl
having done so would demonstrate that you understand how to use verilog as an hdl

9233476
post	get
it works fine and i get the correct post in page #1 but i see the same post as seen at page #1 when i click page #2

glsurfaceview clients are required to call onpause when the activity pauses and onresume when the activity resumes

9233725
onresume	onpause
so i insertet the onresume onpause calls in my main activity onresume onpause

9233765
folder	directory
eclipse is installed under my home directory as well but in a different folder called eclipse

9233783
mp3	ogg
and it doesn t really care what the input format is since if mplayer can play it at all it can extract the audio so it should work fine with mp3 ogg avi whatever

runtimeexception	invocationtargetexception
i use guava s eventbus unfortunately it catches and logs the invocationtargetexception that occurs when an event-handler throws a runtimeexception

9233979

9234066
put	get
the ui is powered by jquery mobile and when i successfully get back the data from the db i put it in a listview

9234078
superclass	subclassing
in your subclassing you dealloc the instance methods the subclassing allocated but then the superclass needs to do the same so you have to explicitly call it

9234123
octal	decimal
standard c only has decimal no prefix octal 0 prefix and hexadecimal 0x or 0x prefix constants

9234172
octal	hex
from what i understand octal was more popular than hex among users of 18-bit architectures since a word would be exactly 6 octal digits

9234180
children	parent
in the parent entity i can list all children attached in the

9234180
children	parent
i would like to select all parent who have children where

9234186
hex	binary
it is easy to convert binary into hex

9234192
inherited	subclassing
the point is that you are creating subclassing by inheriting them in your case this seems to be a custom viewcontroller myviewcontroller which inherited data and methods from uiviewcontroller

9234202
ssl	https
for https there will be a small overhead for the ssl tls channel itself but the bulk of it will be taken by the handshake in particular the server certificate assuming you re not using client-cert authentication should be the biggest

9234205
serializable	deserialization
the user data will be duplicated on serializable deserialization

9234244
public	protected
besides of ide tricks a real warrior s way would be using assembly.load to load application dll into the memory and then using reflection search through all the types for public private protected static fields

9234297
jtree	jtable
i did not yet look at how a jtable handles the filtering with rowfilter s and perhaps the same can be done on a modified version of a jtree

9234359
rss	feed
facebook s feed are available in rss natively .

9234435
width	margin
specifiy a width and margin 0 auto

9234435
margin	height
this would place your element with a margin of 10px top left and right and give it dynamic height

9234553
width	height
see this post about resizing a swf set to 100 width height

9234554
post	get
however because some data lots of text i would like to switch from http get to http post

9234569

9234674
width	height
i have a mobile site unfortunately i can t direct access to do anything on html so i m using jquery to style its width height etc. the problem is the site has actually 762px width which is a normal site for pc and i gave 320px width for an iphone screen everything works well but at the time when page loads it comes from the middle of the page to fit the 320px screen size

everything works correctly and as it should in firefox opera and ie7+

9234883
google-chrome	firefox
display none works for firefox but not google-chrome or ie

9234883
google-chrome	firefox
firefox won t do it technically invalid html per the spec but google-chrome and ie will and it will hide the option

9234895
width	height
this will give you a proportionally resized image with the boundaries of max width and max height

9234902
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on google-chrome and firefox as well as my own version of ie8.06

9234927
inherited	properties
the traits_type inherited from std streambuf defines a number of functions to determine properties of characters

as i said when i ll place open dialog below the dialog div outside of accordion div the pop-up comes up normal but once i put the button there pop-up doesn t come out

9234982
crypt	salt
i believe that crypt is supposed to return the salt value prepended to the front of the return value

9235029
int	chars
its not valid to call printf expecting a chars and giving it an int

9235056
int	double
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

9235059
children	parent
current children are un-bound removal of foreign key to parent entity

9235079
swt	swing
swing and swt are well just old-school

9235079
swt	swing
i m having a library in mind that has an api similar to swing or swt but renders in html5

9235088
hide	show
then just show or hide this literal in your server code based on your other logic

9235092
translation	localization
translation services aren t a replacement for localization

9235115
google-chrome	firefox
how can i do this for example if i inspect the element with google-chrome or firefox i can view the links but from the command line i am not aware if this is possible

9235119
post	put	post	get	put	get
he argues that good ol xhtml is actually perfect for this since tools for parsing it xpath are readily available it supports forms think get link templating and put post and delete methods and has a well-understood way of identifying hyperlinks plus some other advantages mainly achieved through the ability to use the api with any standard web browser eases the jobs for devs qa and support staff.

next	except
it s working fine except that .requery causes the form to briefly return to the first record before going back to the current record and then on to the next record

9235283
portrait	landscape
besides the fact the monogame runs the game in portrait instead of landscape i have noticed that the movement of the player sprite behaves really different

9235291
vmware	virtualbox
instead get a virtualization software like vmware virtual pc or virtualbox and run your application stack in the virtual environment

9235342
google-chrome	firefox
similary to css transform jagged edges in google-chrome same occurs with firefox on 3d transforms eg - remember firefox

9235345
.when	each
yep you can have multiple statements between the .when and .otherwise and you can always call .endchoice to explicitly end each conditional block.

9235367
fadein	fadeout
once you click the first section button which brings you to the second section it validates the elements in the first section if the first section is deemed valid then it proceeds to fadeout fadein to section b....and so on

inherited	properties
the class to be exposed inherited from a base class both of which have comvisible properties set to true

rspec	machinist
if rspec is somehow assigning a context method to machinist s lathe s objects then that method will be called before method_missing

9235400
nunit	mstest
shameless plug but i wrote a simple assembly that makes asserting exceptions and exception messages a little easier and more readable in mstest using assert.throws syntax in the style of nunit xunit

9235409
width	margin
might want to try adding absolute positioning on the canvas wrapper with left 50 and a negative margin at half the width 675 2

9235413
width	height
i suspect that the image may not be ready in the dom when jquery attempts to measure its height and width

9235418
qscrollarea	qtablewidget
is there a way to find what row the user is currently viewing inside of the qscrollarea that the qtablewidget provides

9235442
implements	extends
if you think on classes and you understand your model as abstractaction fooaction and baraction it is probably because you can have the same methods implements in a different way on the subclasses or extends some parent method

9235447
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome firefox safari but when it comes to ie there is a strange behavior

9235453
width	height
invisible elements return a width and height of 0

9235454
width	height
you can bind a load event handler to the element before adding it to the dom to get the width height once it s available

9235454
width	height
you can also explicitely set the width height of the image using css or inline attributes

9235470
wan	lan
so things you can usually get away with on a lan will lead to more errors on a wan

9235493
width	height
i am wondering if there is a maximum pixel width or height to html documents or if browsers start to have difficulty with the dom at certain lengths

9235493
width	height
are there limits to the pixel height or width of documents

9235497
width	height
try logging the image s width and height once the image has loaded

9235553
width	height
it would be new to me that there is a limitation for maximum width or height of a webpage

9235579
nstextfield	nstableview	nstablecellview	nsoutlineview
there you can determine whether the nstablecellview instance containing your nstextfield instances is currently selected by using this code which i use with a nsoutlineview but it should also work with nstableview

9235582
ethernet	wireless
i m getting a wierd problem when the internet connections are changed from wireless to ethernet cable and viceversa as per the users it is occuring rarely 3 out of 10 times but we cannot avoid it

9235592
udp	tcp
now if we use tcp instead of udp

9235592
udp	mtu
again many memcpy s will be needed to assemble the packet which shouldnt be larger than 65535 and then it would be fragmented by the kernel to send it in packets of size of the mtu not much difference as with udp here

9235592
udp	tcp
for this particular application sending simple data chunk to the client from an index given by the client tcp will not perform any better than udp

udp	tcp
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

9235592
udp	mtu
the whole point for making the protocol to run faster is to assembly udp packets as large to the mtu as possible

9235593
accessor	properties
while the synthezised properties would the be used via self.foo which would then utilize a call to one of the synthesized accessor methods

9235619
jwindow	jdialog
top-level windows jframe jdialog jwindow are not added to containers

9235634
ready	each
don t know how your combine process works either but if it could be organised so say once queries 1 3 are ready you could do an intermediate process or if it s in some logical order once all the queries are ready to read could you start reading into to simple classes and then throw each one at a combine task..

9235660
getter	setter
another interesting fact of objective-c is that using dot syntax to access variables in this way is really just a handy way of calling setter and getter methods to access them

9235674
rss	feed
you use this frontend when you have static data that could change from time to time that has no relation to the current user that is it is the same for all users like an rss feed or dynamically created javascript file for example

9235674
post	get
with it you can cache content not only based on the request uri but also based on information in a cookie session get or post parameters

9235674
post	get
by default caching based on cookie session get and post is disabled so for this to have any effect on a user logged into your site you have to tell the cache if there are any pages you want to cache based on that information

9235674
post	get
use the page frontend if you want to cache pages with dynamic output based not only on request uri but the cookies session data or get post parameters

9235978
udp	tcp
good for both udp and tcp

9235978

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uisegmentedcontrol	uitabbarcontroller
i decided since i need everything nested in a uinavigationcontroller stack that the best way to achieve this 3 separate projects into one kind of thing i would create something similar to the uitabbarcontroller in which you have 1 uiviewcontroller class which stores and nests other uiviewcontroller -- however i want to use a custom uitoolbar with a uisegmentedcontrol to delegate between the different view controllers

9236153
portrait	landscape
how can i get a nice rotation working where in portrait i show the dialogfragment as a dialog and in landscape it is embedded

9236157

9238844
accessor	properties
properties are a shortened form of accessor methods get set

9238846

9239008
getter	setter
and also i have write the setter and getter for all my variables that i have initialised in my java page

9239015
google-chrome	firefox
i know the server needs to support jsonp and i don t think it does but when i change datatype to jsonp i can see the response page resources show up in both google-chrome and firefox -- so the server actually sends the response to the browser a static html webpage + some java script -- which contains the data i want to get at

9239018
keydown	keyup
how can we respond to keydown keyup keypress messages or what have you

9239062
post	put
post or put requests on the other hand default to not use a persistent connection and will not retransmit your operation which could well be a credit card purchase or something else with significant side effects

tablet	galaxy
everything works in the emulator and on my samsung galaxy sii phone but my tablet doesn t appear in the list of devices

9239102
pow	math.h
for exponents you can use math.h which you ll need to import s pow float base float exponent function

how to send the normal output of ls to the stdout the error output of ls to stderr and the error output of time to time.txt

9239246
hide	show
uinavigationcontroller has a property navigationbarhidden that allows you to hide show navigation bar for whole nav controller

9239246
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
each of three uiviewcontroller will have nav bar since they are in uinavigationcontroller

9239272
opera	firefox
# - firefox and opera interpret this character as the marker of a hash as in location.hash

9239301
x86	64bit
the anycpu setting will cause the assembly to jit ed to x86 on 32 bit platforms and x64 on 64bit platforms

9239301
x86	64bit
as for your example setting active solution platform to x64 project platform to x86 and project target to x64 would mean that when selecting that solution configuration the project assembly would be built to jit only to 64bit causing an error if you tried to run it on a 32 bit platform

9239333
opensuse	linux
am using linux opensuse eclipse helios package

9239333

9239497
client-side	server-side
i hear everyone saying output encoding has to be done client-side instead of server-side

9239540

what should i add here in order to get all this variables and put them in the arraylist lns in one location

9239558
integer	unsigned
the typedef name uint_fastn_t designates the fastest unsigned integer type with a width of at least n.

9239570
hide	show
eg if three columns in repeater control and if it is null then hide and if notnull show that field.

9239584
getter	setter
a good approach would be to create a user object getter and setter left out

9239589
integer	unsigned
the typedef name uint_fastn_t designates the fastest unsigned integer

9239589
unsigned	short
for example on a 32-bit machine uint_fast16_t could be defined as an unsigned int rather than as an unsigned short because working with types of machine word size would be more efficent

9239593
fgets	getline
you should be using formatted input functions like getline if you your implementation has that scanf or fgets

9239612
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

9240445
google-chrome	firefox
if it is will it work in the major browsers such as ie firefox and google-chrome

9240508
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
i d recommend at least saving the password as a hash so use something like md5 and i d use a salt key too so something like md5 password. salt - the salt can be a timestamp of when the user signed up a random string of letters numbers which i d recommend - and save this as well in the database

9240508
salt	md5
when the user signs in sanitize the data check username exists and grab the salt key of that matching entry then md5 the incoming password with the salt key and see if the strings match

9240528
webclient	httpwebrequest
in this case you could use a webclient or an httpwebrequest to manually forge and send an http request to a given resource and fetch the result

9240742
post	get
well so far so good i just get the users who liked the post and check two-by-two which ones are friends

9240748
hash	md5
also about the md5 hash thing - no even if it s in private scope you can still view and modify it in a javascript debugger

9240763
width	height
to make it work i thought to use an array of objects with the width and height of a background-image of every element i bring to it

9240763
width	height
to do this i ve created an empty img element set the src attribute to the background image and once it s loaded getting width and height

9240763
for-loop	arrays
i ve thought to handle it starting in a for-loop which prepares every image when the jquery event load is called i create the new arrays element with every info about the loaded image

edit in code this would look like this getter setter omitted for brevity only

9240977
put	get
you can get it to work if you set the startitem to foo and put bar underneath it

9240986
hash	hmac	hash	md5	hmac	md5
if you just want a simple md5 hash then you will need to use code for md5 alone without the hmac part

9240986
hash	salt
you may also want to look into the use of cryptographic salt to protect password hash otherwise users with the same passwords will have the same hash

9241070

9241813
for-loop	arrays
now because you have a count of all unique nc pdisp objects you can one by one remove them as each dc event occurs by doing the typical if pdisp is pdisparray i then this is in vb comparison wrapped in a for-loop and for each one taken off your arrays count will get closer to 0

9241824
srp	ocp
database normalization is usually good and this particular case could probably be used as a text-book example of why as it shows the connection between ocp srp in the domain layer and the normalized tables in the database

py2exe if assuming you have it creates two directory when it compiles by default and moves the executable into a dist folder that has all the modules in a zib file called a library

9244785

9245465
int	chars
in my case i know i am going to be freeing basic types like chars and int

9245489
free	malloc
you can and should pass to free every pointer that has returned by malloc no matter which type or struct it points to

9245489
free	malloc
be careful to not pass to free pointers that you didn t get from malloc

9245519
width	height
changing the height and width parmeters in png wordcloud_packages.png width 1280 height 800 only changes the height and width of the canvas..but the plotted area remains small

on debian-based systems and this includes ubuntu linux mint and aptosid sidux at least besides the options of installing rhino and others already mentioned you have have other options

9245612
versioning	upgrade
edit this approach has another benefit - if you end up writing multiple primitive layers for different apis you may be able to let the user pick between them you may have a more expensive higher-quality map layer which you charge for and a cheap free one which you don t - allowing people free access to a lower-quality versioning and letting them buy an upgrade to the better maps

9245623
winpcap	pcap.net
well this may be an overkill and i m sure there are much better opinions but just to get some of the job done you may look at winpcap and it s perfect .net wrapper pcap.net

9245625
post	get
i am inclined to use post call because telerik grid requires some data in json format and json doesn t work well with get

9245628
tcplistener	tcpclient
i m transferring files over a tcp sockets connection but it seems the speed is limited here the way i send files over tcp sockets tcpclient and tcplistener

9245628
tcpclient	networkstream
on client side where cs is a cryptostream which read a filestream and tcpstr the networkstream of the tcpclient

9245667
for-loop	arrays
i m attempting to implement two functions which serializes an adoption instance appends a delimiter then appends it to the end of a text file and loadadoptions which opens the text file explode s the contents on the delimiter and unserialize s each object in a for-loop through the contents of the arrays explode returned then calls display on them

9245669
postgresql	mysql
as long as your sql is compliant with a different database you can theoretically use the exact same php code with mysql sqlite postgresql etc. and much better parameter binding for prepared statements

9245709
post	put
that suggests that i could put in a hack that periodically post pointless changes to the database but even then i won t know if i ve received all the changes

9245736
folder	directory
basically i had copied the folder to a new location and modified it forgetting that it would bring along all the hidden .svn directory

9245759
ienumerable	iqueryable
now if i change the iqueryable to ienumerable as follow will there be any changes on how the query will be executed in this case

9245783
for-loop	loops
this is a different kind of loops than a traditional for-loop

9245802
apache	nginx
and because your file actually exists abyss apache nginx will act if you re sending status 200

9245802
apache	nginx
i m not sure if there s an option to override the server s response the way you want it but with apache nginx you can t do this

9245808
vbscript	jscript
if you want to run script you are better off using .execscript which comes with pre.net and .net wb control or .invokescript which comes with .net wb control only - using these are a much better idea as you can use vbscript as well as javascript jscript

9245814
bluetooth	usb
i have bluetooth device usb physically attached to my pc

9245829
strtol	strtod
you can safely scan numeric values using the functions strtol strtoll strtoul strtoull strtof strtod strtold

9245895
mouseup	mousedown
the way i did it was add mousedown and mouseup listeners to an invisible display object that would be on top of my content

9245895
mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown i would record mousex and mousey and current milliseconds via a timer then on mouseup i would check the differences and determine what kind of event it was

9245933
ienumerable	iqueryable
then is it considered as unfeasible to count iqueryable objects and it is better to use ienumerable

9245939
ant	maven
ant does seem to offer a nice solution to this maven s strict structure isn t really that great for something that isn t really a build anyway

9245963
google-chrome	firefox
it happens both on google-chrome and firefox the video was done on firefox on a high spec macpro

9245973

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has proxyplus and firefox has foxyproxy among others

9246022
ienumerable	iqueryable
i m not familiar with the infeasability of iqueryable but this blog post seems to indicate that iqueryable is much more preferable to ienumerable because iqueryable allows access to the underlying expression

9246028
int	chars	int	boolean
i think the rule of thumb is that primitive types like int chars boolean and maybe string are copied but objects just have their reference passed

9246060
for-loop	arrays
edit also you should use memset instead of a for-loop to zero an arrays

9246072

i am running it under linux ubuntu 11.10 python 2.7.2+ python-pygame 1.9.1release-0ubuntu4

9246109
filtering	grouping	ienumerable	iqueryable
since not all method calls can be mapped to database queries it is sometimes unavoidable to use an ienumerable but all filtering joining and grouping should be done on an iqueryable if possible then as a last step you can use the asenumerable extension methods to switch to using ienumerable and linq to objects

9246116
icollection	iqueryable
what will be the differences if i define the navigation proprty of this class to be either list icollection or iqueryable as following

9246131
hide	show
when i run the actual use case and select a file it doesn t hide it after one is selected but the hidden waiting div does show as it should

9246133
children	parent
so children also do not change the environment variables of their parent when they change their own

9246181
ienumerable	icollection
a downside is ienumerable could count slowly but if the object implements icollection then this interface is checked for this value first without having to enumerate all items

9246220
class-method	delegation
ok so now you would have to pay attention to the delegation methods of the uiview animation delegation methods it s not actually a different class it s just a delegation of the class-method

9246229
vundle	pathogen
you could also consider using the duo of pathogen vundle for auto installation

9246326
hex	binary
i found the following way hex to binary conversion

9246345
rss	feed
how do i generate the rss feed for these blog posts

9246388
getter	setter

9246389
folder	directory
when i start a program under the path search folder will the first folder become its current directory

9246405
public	protected
btw it s a good practice to always have only one class interface enum per file and have the file with the same name of the class this second part may be mandatory in java i don t remember for sure - it applies to public classes but i dunno if it also applies for default package protected ones

9246417

9246504
stdio	puts
stdio and when you #include those original versions the associated c library functions are visible in the global namespace as before--but in the same breath c++ also says that the old header names are deprecated which puts the world on notice that they may be removed in a future version of the c++ standard

9246532
ordinals	difference
if your own orm is using reflection then you ll need to cache that but i suspect the difference may be that you are not caching the ordinals

9246544
put	get
the low level api roughly looks like a hashmap of hashmaps with a handful of primitive operations like get put delete and query

9246559
integer	unsigned
that s because on your system time_t is a larger integer type than unsigned int

9246559
integer	unsigned
srand wants an unsigned int which is probably a 32-bit integer

ready	each	versioning	upgrade
in the majority of the commercial java world i believe the current dominant practice is you should upgrade when you are ready to. in other words as the developer you first need to realize that a new versioning of a library is available for each of your libraries

9252690
debian	linux
but other practices do exist for example within the debian linux distribution it is theoretically possible to delegate a lot of this work to the debian package maintainers

9253454
post	put	post	get	put	get
i am soooo confused by the playframework flash stuff....high level makes sense put stuff in flash on the http post to be able to retreive on the http get after the redirect

9253454
put	get
and i am guessing you could put stuff in get request to be retrieved on next get request but very very ick ugh yuck on that one since flash is shared between tabs

to get the custom layout to put into the actionbar add this menu item into it

9253575
int	chars
eof is an int value outside the range of a chars since its very purpose is to indicate that no chars is present so if you want to be able to compare a value to eof then you need to retrieve and store that value as an int rather than as a chars

9253637
width	height
the image then forgets about the max height and width

9253698

i read up on indexer accessor usage on properties but when it comes to handling them for xml i am coming at a loss

9253701

you may also choose to cast it to an int if chars is not your preferred type

9253766

ccmenuitem	ccscene
ccmenuitem is meant to be child of a ccmenu not ccscene and offers no touch processing per se

9253836
width	height
check for opposing layout attributes that can cause the layout inflater to ignore the desired width height

put	get
you could always put the second one in an iframe and on your form submit communicate with the iframe to get the content but it is a less elegant solution

9255654
post	get
it turns out the calls to methods automatically always do redirect and my post is calling a render method copy from examples which i did not know does not do a redirect so it would keep the errors in flash for the next get which does not happen as the body is sent back in response to the post which is usually a bad thing and then on the next get my errors are the re and validation.haserrors gets those errors from flash causing the issue

9255654
post	get
so if you use render in your post you don t call validation.keep nor params.flash from what i understand or call another get method that you have

9255654
post	get
for some reason when i tried just changing render to redirect my stuff just threw some platform exception which seemed weird so i could not use redirect method for some reason as i would prefer to stay more rest compliant here where http post returns a 303 redirect to get the next page even if that page is itself with errors

javascript is a scripting language which is typically used for client-side functionality although it can exist at server-side node.js

9256745
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
what s happening in this case is that the wikipedia article contains one piece of code that handles a general case that handles preorder inorder and postorder traversals all in one

9256745
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
you can think of preorder inorder and postorder traversals all as special cases of a more general algorithm

9256745
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
specifically suppose that you want to do a tree traversal and perform some operation at a particular time during the search either preorder inorder or postorder

9256745
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
one way to think about this is that you do some preorder operation before visiting the current node some inorder operation between visiting the node s child and the node itself and some postorder operation after visiting the node

9256745
preorder	postorder
the advantage of the wikipedia code is that it lets you do operations that would require both a preorder and postorder step

fadein	hide
however if an animation was running before which brought the element to opacity 0.005 for example and you stop hide fadein then the element has opacity 0.005 when entering the animation and fadein will only bring its opacity from 0 up to 0.005 making it look invisible

in imperative programming many things like a for-loop a while loops an if statement don t have values they just do things

9272574
for-loop	loops
since a for-loop is intended to just do things even in ocaml the expression inside loops should have type unit

9272574

9273385
width	height
i get original width and height from metadata object

9273398
getter	setter
create getter setter using dynamic methods or expression trees

9273398
getter	setter
cache those getter setter in a dictionary

9273398
getter	setter
have your method look to the dictionary and invoke the getter setter

9273405
width	height
in this case the highest element will define the size of your wrapping div thus defining the baseline 3 while on the other hand the modification of position and width stated in 2 can t be applied to such minimal spaced maximum height elements

9273410
git-rebase	amend
i believe the git-rebase will then automatically continue after the amend

9273410
pull	push
you should then be able to push this back to the central repo and others should get the changes with their next pull

9273445
width	height
when the files are loaded in the wrong order first js then css any javascript code relying on properties set in css files for example the width or height of a div won t be loaded correctly

9273673
uigesturerecognizer	uitouch
the difference is that you can write everything one of the defined uigesturerecognizer does in uitouch code but it will be complex and probably buggy so you have access to some of the most commonly used gestures for free

9273691
children	parent
the value is unique to the parent but all the children need to use it so that seems wasteful given that there will be a lot of other calculations going on

9273695
button	checkbox
i which the user is requested to input name and password and some checkbox and radio button

9273719
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine with google-chrome and firefox but this doesn t work in ie6 or ie7

9273730
hide	show
so each time an user answers a question a the view might call setvisabilityb in the presenter which handles whether to show or hide question b

9273730
hide	show
so far so good but the answer in question b show hide question c and when the user changes his hers opinion on question a the view have to call both setvisabilityb and setvisabilityc .

9273795
getter	setter
in the setter - not the getter - you need to call a propertychangedevent that notifies the ui to react to it

9273815
height	border-box
for some reason chrome applies border-box to it which causes your height 13px

9273818
libjpeg	libpng
you can use libpng libjpeg etc.

9273831
ember.js	sproutcore
i am wondering whether there is a straightforward mechanism like in sproutcore or ember.js where just a binding will do

9273877
uiview	subviews
generally speaking - uiview hittest withevent will look into its subviews recursively and might return itself or any of its subviews

9273949
org.json	gson
for encoding data in json yes gson is a good approach but i think that org.json would be more easy to use

vim	sublimetext
it s really valuable to have an ide or maybe vim config or sublimetext setup that allows to jump to symbol definitions really easily

9274013
tex	sweave
however having said that i have not actually seen an example where sweave outputs a dataframe as a tex file - all of the sweave examples i have seen so far seem contrived and not something that i can build upon

9274013
tex	sweave
it is not clear to me what sweave offers over and above manually building the tex string manually

9274091
jtextpane	jeditorpane
i m not sure if the links below to articles about pagination and printing of the jeditorpane jtextpane will do the trick for you but surely they did a lot for me

9274126
post	get
if i want to get wall post made by my self i came up with the following fql query

9274219
width	height
it is equal to the width divided by the height

9274219
width	height
you can apply that factor to any new width or height you set the video to

9274219
width	height
another way to do it is to find out by which factor to scale the video then set scalex and scaley instead of width and height

9274219
width	height
to create a proportional subclass of any displayobject by overriding the setters for width height scalex and scaley to make all scaling proportional

9274267
prepare	execute
this interceptor is very useful for any situation where you need to ensure some logic runs before the actual execute method runs.so if you see this is some kind if init for your action class and it makes sure that before the action s execute or any other method get called this method prepare your execute method to work fine

9274350

9274382
filesystems	ntfs
for windows if the filesystems is ntfs you can use

9274409

9274409
hide	show
the presenter can hide or show the questions as needed

9274441
for-loop	loops
quite often a for-loop can be converted into a query to be evaluated lazily and then a foreach loops which performs some action on each value returned by the query

9274460
unsigned	short
you can store each float in 2 bytes by representing it as an unsigned short ranges from 0 to 65 535 and dividing all values by 2 8 when you need the actual value

9274469
mouseleave	mouseenter
all you need is to subclass qscrollbar and reimplement mouseenter and mouseleave for it as you ve done for qtableview

9274480
onresume	onpause
after i touch the screen is called onpause and onresume

9274485
innodb	myisam
depending on which storage engine you use whenever you query a table mysql needs to open from 1 innodb up to 3 myisam files on disk

9274792
int	chars
otherwise the string s chars are converted into bytes according to the platform s default chars encoding and these bytes are written in exactly the manner of the write int method

9274801
xslt	xquery
as xslt 2.0 uses the same functions as xquery 1.0 xpath 2.0 you can also use the function fn element-with-id

9274840

9275218
post	get
many a times a get a problem that the code needs to be parsed one good example is when i wanted to display ads between the post

9275221
csv	tsv
but if you still want to use csv tsv files you can still easily do so

9275239
min	max
you re doing something odd with your min and max

9275243
draggable	droppable

std	ostream
for c++ iostreams flushing a stream amounts to calling the member function std ostream flush which in turn calls std streambuf pubsync on the associated stream buffer this ignores the detail that the stream are actually class templates

9275346
ostringstream	std
on the other hand flushing a std stringbuf which is the stream buffer used to implement writing to a std string used by std ostringstream actually doesn t do anything the string is entirely within the program and the std string representing its value is constructed when the std stringbuf str member function is called

9275346
std	ostream	ostream	istream
when reading from an std istream the tied std ostream if any is flushed

9275346
cout	cin
by default std cout is tied to std cin

9275346
std	ostream
if you want to set up a tied std ostream yourself you can use or if you want to remove a tied std ostream you can use std cin.tie 0

9275346
std	ostream
when an std ostream is destroyed or when it would normally destroyed in case the std ostream is one of the standard streams the std ostream is flushed

9275346
std	ostream
you can also explicitly request flushing an std ostream

9275346
std	ostream
you can call the member function std ostream flush std cout.flush

9275346
std	ostream
calling std ostream flush will do nothing if there is no stream buffer

9275346
cout	cin
generally this isn t a problem because the normal case where buffered output needs to become available when reading from std cin is handled by std cout being tie d to std cin

9275378
menhir	ocamlyacc
indeed menhir is mostly backward compatible it can read ocamlyacc source files but improves over ocamlyacc in many directions grammars can be combined symbols can be named etc.

folder	directory
more specifically as shown on the picture .svn folder contains info about working revision the one your working copy has and timestamp of all files in the current directory of working copy

9275790
width	height
what it does is it adjusts the height of the view only if the new height that is based on aspect ratio of the drawable and the adjusted width in our case that s exact width of the parent view is smaller than the adjusted height which at this poin is just drawable s native height plus padding in our case

9275804
folder	directory
if in the same folder change sample_config.xml to sample_config.xml as sample_config.xml would look for the xml file in the root directory

9275916
hash	salt
regarding the hash password stored in the database you could add a salt to improve security

9276012
hash	md5
if that is right you might as well store the session id and timestamp on the same place and just go ahead with a guid for the file name instead of providing them to your md5 hash function which would be safer from a collision standpoint

9276026
ubuntu	debian
one handy way to use local lib is to install your distro s local lib under debian ubuntu apt-get install liblocal-lib-perl then use that to set up your own private cpan library

you can use the datatable object in silverlight as the source of a datagrid although it s more common to wrap the datatable in a collectionview to allow for implicit grouping filtering etc

9276414
innodb	myisam
this table can be read by multiple asyncronous process to send the mails in the queue so in this scenario the rows have to be blocked to send only once the emails so is not possible to use a myisam table type and is using innodb

9276834
haskell	ocaml
what s great with ocaml and probably haskell pattern-matching is that the compiler translates the code into the optimal sequence of tests when it is possible the program will never test twice the same condition at least when you avoid the when guards

9276868
portrait	landscape
it can be viewed in portrait and landscape mode

9276868

i don t think this is possible with emma or cobertura

9277122
disk	ram
pre-emptive paging with big enough ram is just pointless and the only thing it does is to slow down any other disk activity that happens at the same time

9277138
post	get
the main advantage is to prevent the user from issuing another post if after receiving an error the user presses f5 it would just repeat the last get to which it was redirected

9277263
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
unfortunately on my pc regardless of browser firefox google-chrome safari the error is silent and doesn t cause the problem

9277263
google-chrome	firefox
however tracking it with firebug and google-chrome tools seems to show that it is because of a node was not found error in firefox google-chrome â œnot_found_err dom exception 8â

9277347
hash	md5
you could try the rsync approach initially use a fast hash such as adler32 or crc-32 and only use the slower md5 when you get a collision on the fast hash

surprising win by google-chrome by a huge margin vs firefox and ie9

9277582
hide	show
i ve studied apple s multiple detail view sample code and so use the master view as the uisplitviewcontroller delegate which provides the hide show popover selectors and then passes the calls down to whichever substitute detail view is selected

9277615
nexus	artifactory
but a much better solution is to install a server like nexus or artifactory because they allow you to create your own repositories and they still work should the internet fail for example when some idiot breaks your router or your isp has some problems or someone drives a 18 inch double-t steel beam through a bunch of fibres

9277626
sysml	uml

9277649
decoder	encoder
easiest approach write an encoder that converts a legal csv to your own dataformat and a decoder of the transformation back to legal csv

9277694
width	height
the first is because you are setting a height and width on the li tag which is an inline element so cannot have a set height or width

9277694
width	height
the second is that you are setting the background image on the anchor tag nested within li.current_page_item - which does not have the height or width set

9277696
pull	push
so you can push and pull changes and branches from there

9277709
children	parent
i am having a real headache reducing the load times of large lists of items being retrieved and believe if i could do the above in a single linq statement then i might be able to save a lot more time than making repeated calls to the db to get 10 children for each parent

9277709
children	parent
so rather than looping through the parentitems with a foreach which i am doing currently and making 10 or pagesize calls to the db on each iteration how can i take 10 children of each parent node with a linq statement

9277709
children	parent
is there a way i can select x amount of children from each parent using linq

9277710
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works fine in google-chrome firefox safari it works also fine in ie9 of one pc but not on the other pc

9277836
hide	show
i would not change the original link i would hide the link to do x and show the link to do y that would be much less obtrusive and a better action toggle

9277886
imperative	declarative
what s bad about this is that when microsoft were designing asp.net mvc they opted for declarative validation logic using data annotations instead of imperative which is much better suited to validation scenarios and can handle just anything

9277933
int	chars
using int arithmetic where s i is the ith chars of the string n

9277942
post	get
the post doesn t get deleted when i press delete and it doesn t change post_status when i click approve

9278189
udp	tcp
to see how well i m doing in processing incoming data i d like to measure the queue length at my tcp and udp sockets

9278240
cpu	processors
now of course modern processors mostly eat memory in cache-line-sized increments but our means of expressing groupings and dividing the now-virtual address space remained and the smallest amount of memory which a cpu instruction can access directly is still an eight-bit chunk

9278240
cpu	processors
the machine code for the cpu instructions and or the paths going into the processors would have to grow the same way the number of wires connecting to the memory controller would in order for the registers to be addressable - it s the same problem as with the system memory accessibility i was talking about earlier

9278293
maven	pom.xml
if using war files the name of the war file itself you can just right click an rename which if using maven is set in the pom.xml

9278618
prepare	execute
on the other hand there are prepare statements they are usually see exception below parsed and planned in one step and execute in a second step

9278618
prepare	execute
when the prepare statement is execute the specified statement is parsed rewritten and planned

9278618
prepare	execute
when an execute command is subsequently issued the prepare statement need only be execute

9278618
prepare	execute
in some situations the query plan produced for a prepare statement will be inferior to the query plan that would have been chosen if the statement had been submitted and execute normally

9278618
prepare	execute
named prepare statements can also be created and accessed at the sql command level using prepare and execute

9278644
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie9 is very picky google-chrome takes it all and firefox is kinda in between like safari

stdout	fflush
when you close a program with a bufferedwriter activated the system triggers the buffered writer to fflush its output to whatever endpoint it s hooked up to be it a file or stdout

9283578
outputstream	inputstream
fyi guava has bytestreams.copy inputstream outputstream which you can either use directly or look at how it solves this problem

9283638
google-chrome	firefox
the following works fine in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

9283638
google-chrome	firefox
the strange thing is that google-chrome does see the css â if i don t put the xml-stylesheet instruction google-chrome warns me that this xml file does not appear to have any style information... and displays the xml as a tree just like firefox does â but i don t know why it ignores it anyway

9283648
put	get
i decided to put the user name before the date since that s the easiest thing to accomplish but i get you can accomplish the opposite with a user_upload_dir filter and some regex

9283710
postgresql	mysql
this feature is supported by db2 sql server since version 10.0 - 2008 postgresql since version 8.2 mysql and h2

one of the overloads takes an icomparer instance to use for comparisons - the ones that don t use the default comparator

9283727
tablet	galaxy
i want to be able to run a cgi application on my samsung galaxy tablet running android 3.2

9283760
post	get
also old versions of flash before 9.0.18 allow malicious flash to generate get or post requests with arbitrary http request headers using crlf injection

9283798
put	get
by using the below wizard in visual studio installer to get the location of my .exe which the user can choose to put where he prefers i manage to place this command just where needed

9283839
int	chars
in antlrworks the input int a12q2efwe chars eq45dsf is being parsed using the debugger as follows

9283843
ienumerable	iqueryable
to get round the problem you simply need to do the bits that aren t in linq to sql with linq to objects so you need to convert iqueryable to ienumerable using something like asenumerable

9283859
for-loop	loops
your for-loop would have worked if you ran it in reverse start at the highest index and loops while

9283872
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
technically there could be a more general implementation that handles all of the aggregate-functions max min sum count ...

9283890
ssl	https
this is not an explanation nor a true solution it s simply the most pragmatic way of dealing with this issue that we ve found in our case doing a wcf soap request over https using a client ssl cert with an apache java based server

9284050
post	put	post	get	put	get
put your website url set the number of post that you want to have in comments get the code

9284050
post	put
first part put it in header right after and the in single.php single post template

9284076
wordpress	joomla
since now you have wordpress working assuming you know the what is the connection string go to joomla home and edit configuration.php and make sure the following parameters are configured correctly for joomla 1.5

9284086
spine.js	backbone.js
backbone.js or spine.js offer routing on the client-side but in my experience i only got that to work for really simple cases but this could also be caused by my limited knowledge experience in such frameworks

9284131
stdout	stderr
for a sequence of commands enclose them within parentheses then append the symbol but be sure to redirect stdout stderr somewhere otherwise your script will hang waiting

9284158
hash	salt
i add a per-user salt to the hash storage of a user s password so the stored password hash looks like this hash password + perusersalt

9284158
hash	salt
in this case the salt and hash storage of passwords is useless because the correct combination of username and password will yield a successful login

9284179
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
if the method returns some ienumerable icollection or ilist then i like to make it static if possible and leave it on the repository even if it uses navigation properties

9284184
folder	directory
if it is starting at the root of your website then it is a relative path because if you move your website to a different folder then the paths to these directory and files don t need to change they are relative to the web root

9284202
children	parent
one parent two children

9284217
hash	salt
if the user has a simple password the salt and hash won t really matter

9284217
hash	salt
you have to require a secure password from the user then do the one-way encryption hash it with the salt and use ssl like you are

9284221
width	height
you d still have to figure out how to randomize the height and width of the pieces add an onclicklistener and then move the pieces

9284233
free	malloc
think wrapper functions for malloc and free . it would also need a lock mechanism to enforce singular access so that the two processes don t stop on each other

9284239
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
finally in mouseup you set a flag that indicates that mousemove should not be doing anything until mousedown again

9284265
voip	sip
crazy idea user would define a phone number of your server sip voip as forward when declined -number

9284274
prepare	execute
currently instead of using the db driver i m using a model instead which has all my pdo code like prepare fetch execute etc

9284281
vim	sublimetext	vim	emacs	emacs	sublimetext
golang itself is distributed with plug-ins configs for the most popular editors vim emacs sublimetext etc...

9284283
pull	push
we need to be able to push pull to remote repositories

9284314
entity-relationship	diagram
as a requirement we needed to create an entity-relationship diagram then from that diagram derive the database schema

9284314
entity-relationship	diagram
if the professor specifically mentioned part was unnecessary then there must be some way to remove it that results in a simpler entity-relationship diagram and schema - but i can t see what it is

9284314
entity-relationship	diagram
but now i have to figure out exactly what modifications to the entity-relationship diagram would correspond to this schema

9284320
google-chrome	firefox
tried it some time ago and found it not consistent between firefox and google-chrome yet

9284347
children	parent
it includes basic operations like looking at children and at the parent of a node while also allowing easily iterating through the structure

9284404
filepath	unc
i m honestly not certain whether unc paths are supported or not but if you want a fully-qualified filepath you need to use iirc

9284451
ready	each
why don t you open the file ready for writing and write each line as you re looping through the resultset

9284480
lxml.html	elementtree
however as far as i know the base elementtree library lacks some convenience classes for things like selectors so a solution that allows me to use lxml.html without etree.htmlparser would still be useful

9284510
folder	directory
just recompile locally look in the bin directory of your web app sort by last modified and you ll see the dlls that get updated - these should get moved to the corresponding bin folder of your server

9284541
filesystems	ntfs
this property is stored as an alternate stream on the ntfs filesystems - specifically a stream named zone.identifier

9284541
filesystems	ntfs
fat32 filesystems obviously don t have ntfs alternate streams

9284546
glfw	glew
my specific question is this why when i use the glew 2.7 library also using glfw does glew_version_3_2 evaluate to true even though the advertising for my gpu says it s only 2.0 compliant

9284563
post	get
now what we observe here is that in both our get and post actions we have repetitive mapping code between our domain model customprofile and our view model changeprofileviewmodel

9284580
hide	show
show a hidden field if an option is selected and hide that field if not i have this part working - although if i use a variable it doesn t work

9284583
audiotrack	audiorecord
i did using the classes audiorecord and audiotrack but these are not suitable to transmit the pcm data

9284622
put	get
on the asp.net layer i pull data into a dataset and then call getxml to get an xml string and then put the xml into a text file for import export

9284640
dbcontext	objectcontext
ef modeladapter is based on objectcontext so you will have to use objectcontext api .net 4.0 instead of dbcontext api if you want to use it

9284709
division	modulo
the download for stl says the stl was developed on sgi mipsprotm c++ 7.0 7.1 7.2 and 7.2.1. and as far as i can tell without actually having the compiler and hardware mipspro passes the division to the cpu and mips hardware truncates to 0 which would mean std modulo has always been misnamed

9284762
division	modulo
in ruby and python is in fact the modulo integer division is done towards minus infinity in these languages

9284762
haskell	scheme
haskhell and scheme have two separate operators mod and rem for haskell and modulo and remainder for scheme

9284778
google-chrome	safari
i am having a problem with links inside a jscrollpane in safari and google-chrome on windows

9284778
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the problem only occurs in safari and google-chrome works fine in firefox

9284797
google-chrome	firefox
there is a second issue with your code however in firefox loading external dtds only works with google-chrome urls this check is hardcoded

9284824
try-catch	exception-handling
it doesn t appear to be a bad_alloc exception-handling because i tried wrapping the code in a try-catch with a bad_alloc catch handler

9284840
hide	show
basically i have 2 divs i want to hide show in multiple places stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 etc as so

9284840
setinterval	settimeout
i ve seen a lot done with window settimeout as well as setinterval and .queue

9284844
children	parent
but it brought all the children themselves and not the parent anchors

9284847
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works fine in firefox and ie however google-chrome continues to submit the entire form vs

9284903
put	get
this might get you close enough to what you need otherwise the basic approach is sound but you may need to fiddle with that pattern to get it match exactly the stretches of text you want to put through anonymiseword

9284911
packets	multicast
after looking up packets decoding for multicast and broadcast packets i am having some difficulties in creating the decision logic

9284911
subnet	packets
i cannot know what subnet a packets is from and so i cannot determine specific broadcast addresses due to custom sub-netting

9285005
submit	submission
everytime i try to submit the form it comes back with my failed validation error that there was a problem submission the form

9285108
post	get
short version i need to get an array of distinct tags matching web or any other term for that matter out of the post collection

9285127
client-side	server-side
when i access an x y coordinate client-side i expect the property to be lowercase but server-side it is uppercase

9285136
cpu	affinity
process1 rt priority 40 cpu affinity cpu 0

9285136
cpu	affinity
process2 rt priority 39 cpu affinity cpu 0

9285273
nsstring	nsobject
one of the objects is an empty nsstring which has just the default nsobject s implementation of valueforkey which naturally doesn t know anything about the above key file ... so it throws an exception

9285283
guava	lambdaj
there are already quite a number in circulation - functional java the functional parts of guava lambdaj and others - all doing much the same thing or at least having overlapping bits doing much the same thing

9285283
guava	lambdaj
at the company where i work where there are a lot of big fans of functional programming we seem to have settled on functional java having had lambdaj guava and a couple of homebrewed functional frameworks in our codebase and having rewritten bits of it in scala

9285359
width	height
a shadow of a zero rect x 0 y 0 width 0 height 0 won t show at all

9285373
google-chrome	firefox
i have a web application that has been running just fine in internet explorer 9 firefox and google-chrome but a couple strange features occur in internet explorer 7 and sometimes even 8

9285373
google-chrome	firefox
again this works in ie9 firefox and google-chrome but it will not open the dialog in ie7 or ie8

9285383
pull	push
to resolve your immediate problem you should make a backup of the local file remove the original pull from the remote branch and then git rm followed by a push to make sure the remote repo deletes the file as well

9285428
x86	64bit
libx86 uses lrmi the opposite of dpmi on x86 and an x86 emulator on x86-64 since afaik vm86 mode cannot be used from 64bit mode

9285469
aggregate-functions	sum
this looks like you are running into a constraint issue on your table that you are inserting into or values you are operating on...like aggregate-functions max sum avg.. exists on a null value

9285501
button	checkbox
the spacebar can typically be used to interact with most clickable controls such as button and checkbox

9285540
codeigniter	cakephp
the .net framework is largely built around separating presentation from content which is not a focus in php unless you use a framework like cakephp or codeigniter or others

9285547
width	height
measures the object s width height

9285550
google-chrome	firefox
which would work in firefox but not in google-chrome

9285552
int	double
mpi has built in pair data types - mpi_double_int for a double + an int or mpi_2int for two int that you can use

9285552
int	double
if the value you re reducing isn t an int say a double you create a structure containing the reduction value and the int index and use the appropriate mpi pair data type

9285565
google-chrome	safari
firefoxâ s firebug add-on or the web inspector in google-chrome safari should be able to show you the stylesheetâ s mime type.

9285575
qdialog	qfiledialog
i have a qdialog that opens a qfiledialog like so

9285593
hide	show
or probably better hide this input field and show only if nol value is selected

9285619
hide	show
obviously you will probably want to extend that to hide the input again if another value is selected and perhaps show hide the label element too

9285632
filesystems	fat
if trying to write to alternative file stream on fat filesystems failes then it s output to stderr will be redirected to nul

9285644
udp	tcp
turn off options such as tcp segementation offload udp fragmentation offload general segmentation offload large receive offload and generic receive offload

9285653
put	get
variables from an html form passed as part of the url get put into a array by php

9285654
innodb	myisam
i m not sure which mysql engine you re using but your should consider doing those statements within a single transaction too you would need innodb instead of myisam

9285743
freebsd	linux
if by all network interfaces you mean all interfaces that are connected to physical networks and aren t capturing on things not thought of a networks - the loopback interface is an example of the former and the usb capture devices on linux and freebsd 9.0 and later are examples of the latter - then

9285774
primefaces	icefaces
the impression i m getting about the new icefaces 3.0 ace datatable nã e primefaces 2.0 datatable is that it is intended to be used in a view- or session-scoped bean but i don t see how one could get around staleobjectstate and or lazyinitializationexceptions if one has model objects coming out of the dao in request a and entitymanager a and then being modified or paged in by request b with entitymanager b

9285776
put	get
i have a monitor that won t get any darker so i want to put a translucent black filter over every site i visit.

9285781
tabcontrol	tabitem
and i am binding the itemssource of a tabcontrol when i add a new tabitem in the contructor of mainwindowviewmodel it is working

9285788
installation	upgrade
after extension upgrade installation or uninstallation refresh all

9285836
int	chars
then as has been suggested before all you need to do is iterate through the string two chars at a time here it would be useful to iterate by index convert those values to int and then convert that int to a chars

9285849
rss	feed
i have made and rss reader and have a listbox with all the feed in it

9285863
ienumerable	ienumerator
after this didn t work i to find out had to implement the ienumerator and ienumerable interfaces and add the required methods to my class

9285868
packets	pcap
struct pcap_pkthdr is not the structure that defines the format of packets headers in a pcap file

9285868
winpcap	libpcap
it s the structure that defines the format of packet headers as provided to programs using libpcap or winpcap

9285868
winpcap	libpcap	packets	pcap
the structure that defines the format of packets headers in a pcap file is not in any of the pcap include files because libpcap winpcap provides routines that read those headers and transforms them as necessary to pcap_pkthdr headers

9285868
packets	pcap
unlike struct pcap_pkthdr the time stamp in packets headers in a pcap file always have a 32-bit seconds field and a 32-bit microseconds field even on systems where time_t and the tv_sec value in a struct timeval are 64 bits

9285868
winpcap	libpcap
libpcap 1.1 and later know how to read pcap-ng files the libpcap winpcap api isn t powerful enough to handle all pcap-ng files but it can for example handle pcap-ng files that only have one section and only have packets from one network adapter and libpcap 1.1 and later can read those

9285868
winpcap	libpcap
i would suggest just as unwind suggested that you use libpcap winpcap to read capture files rather than writing your own code to do it

9285875
post	get
but i m not able to get the json results from said post

9285923
svg	vml
so i was wondering is there a way to render svg images as vml or bitmap on browsers that don t support it

9285949
draggable	droppable
you can use the revert option with a value of invalid to send the draggable back to where it came from if it s dropped anywhere other than on a valid droppable

9285951
public	protected
this may be a very stupid question and it s making feel like my brain has gone...but i cannot fathom how to set a protected or public variable from a base class

9286020
move	drag
when i drag an image changing his y axis and then try to resize it it s automatically move to the las y axis position x is consistent

9286028
x86	64bit
for example if you are running win 7 64bit or win server 2008 r2 you may install 32-bit jre in c program files x86 java jre6 and 64bit jre in c program files java jre6 and perhaps ibm java 6 in c program files x86 ibm java60 jre

9286039
for-loop	loops
and using a for-loop really is the most sensible thing because you are modifying something in the body of loops and not for example creating a new iterable or list. you can however simplify the code by using a collections.defaultdict like so

9286092
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
does it in latest google-chrome firefox and safari builds which tells me it s not a browser issue

9286118
width	height
to match the container s height in which case you get a width

9286118
width	height
to match the container s width in which case you get a height

9286125
hide	show
show hide works perfectly fine

9286132
maven	pom.xml
i m using maven eclipse and have updated my pom.xml to use selenium 2.19 for the server

9286133
google-chrome	safari
then you run into this webkit bug and get incorrect rendering in google-chrome and safari while other browsers are rendering this per spec

9286140
post	get
besides the httpservletrequest#setcharacterencoding doesn t affect get requests it affects post requests only

9286147
post	get
as your form method defined is post so use to get values after submit instead of

9286155
ienumerable	ienumerator
i found remove the implementing of ienumerator ienumerable then you don t have to use xmlinclude

9286155
ienumerable	ienumerator
i guess if class implement ienumerable and ienumerator

9286155
ienumerable	ienumerator
what i suggest is to implement ienumerable ienumerator

9286237
min	max
what happens if i change the algorithm from min heap to max heap without rearrange the internal array

9286241
visualvm	jprofiler
other options include using visualvm or jprofiler or dynatrace like tools

9286280
cos	sin
essentially store sin x and cos x values for a bunch values

9286280
cos	sin
now using sin a sin b cos a cos b y-a and y-b approximately calculate sin y

9286282
int	boolean
sql isn t the best at handling casting between types without using something like cast or convert which means that the int value isunumeric returns will only be resolved as a boolean when you use some comparator etc to produce a true false result

9286322
post	get
when a user of my gae app clicks the back button i need to prevent them from seeing a cached version of the page - that is i need the python get or post code for that url to be run

9286373
innodb	myisam
the only difference between the tables besides the fields themselves is that product is an innodb storage engine and has other tables referencing it as their foreign key while news is myisam and does not

9286388
put	get
follow-up this approach does suffer from losing type safety but it only impacts put k v and as get object and containskey object always accepts object

9286436
voip	sip
i m trying to write a voip app for android using the android sip api yes i know this only works with some androids with version 2.3

9286441
width	height
inside magento templating code i want to get the width and height of the original product image uploaded by admin when creating product so as to make according adjustments

9286442
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
everything is working very well on internet explorer which is extrange but the onclick event is not working on safari google-chrome or firefox

9286442
onmouseover	onclick
are there some functions like onmouseover or onmouseout or onclick that does not work on those browsers

9286463
int	chars
do you want the user to enter an int or a chars

9286469
portrait	landscape
i have the following problem i have an image that i want to disappear when i change my phone from portrait to landscape

9286471
maven	pom.xml
how do we configure maven pluggins pom.xml to compile both

9286471
maven	pom.xml
is it possible to configure maven pom.xml to have profile differences or build differences based on the jre version we are compiling to or do we have to have 4 pom.xml

9286493
width	height
this will put a separator that will allow you to resize in the designer and disables adding text changing the autosize forces the size s height to be 2 and width to be whatever you want and disables adding text

9286514
filtering	grouping
google grouping thread which suggests that there is a duplicate filtering present in the scheduler

9286520
google-chrome	firefox
i ve opened the developer tools network tab in both google-chrome 16 and firefox 7 on this cuzillion test page and both appear to show scripts and images being downloaded -all in parallel can post screen-shots

9286568
for-loop	arrays
it outlines what you d have to do in the general case though since you re working with c-imports what you can do is modify it a bit so that a there is a temp variable which is an arrays like result but use to overlay it on the my_type.value and then use the for-loop to copy it out

9286590
switching	screens
so basically i ll switching the src for an array of images based on the user s screens resolution

9286610
children	parent
the decisions on the previous point will affect the number of pipes opened in the parent vs the number opened by the children

9286664
min	max
now we change the heap from min to max but without rearranging the elements and insert a new element 25

9286664
children	parent
now the max-heap property holds for the root node its children are indeed smaller but not for the other nodes 3 is still the parent of 7 and violates the max-heap condition

9286700
post	get
if it s pure page-to-page navigation rather use plain get links instead of post forms

9286708
children	parent
children before parent

9286720
mouseup	mousedown
then mousedown mouseup occurs and set the global dragging variable to have the move method work

9286736
min	max
yes if you want to do more than just the basic sum min max or count you need to write your own reducer

9286808
udp	tcp
for instance zeromq can leverage udp multicast to run faster than any tcp protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api

9286820
pop-up	dialog
i ve tried to use this post as a reference in order to have the pop-up dialog while my content loads

9286846
multiplying	multiplication	multiplication	exponent
is this correct in both in assumptions multiplying floating point numbers and number of multiplication in exponentiation with integer exponent and in conclusion

9286849
rss	feed
with my setrequeststring you will see there is a string input parameter so i can request different rss feed with the same method

9286854
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
on debian probably ubuntu and maybe other linux distributions you can find your system s installed completions in etc bash_completion.d

9286858
put	get
how can i take that argument and get the necessary window to put the screensaver into

9286868
curses	readline
i think that the best way to solve this is to use gnu readline for your input rather than the default curses input

9286888
width	margin
there does not seem to be a css equivalent to either marginheight or margin width and there is no way to access the source within the iframes

9286908
glut	sdl
otherwise you probably need to roll your own but make use of opengl glut gtk frp ogre bindings sdl and perhaps fungen if it s back on track

9286908
xml-conduit	hxt
xml process haxml hxt xml-conduit - good stable and powerful libraries

9286908
hunit	hspec
testing - quickcheck lazysmallcheck test-framework hspec hunit

9286984
post	get
almost all topics get responded to within hours and i have never seen a post which was never responded to

9286985
width	height
i was putting height for width and width for height

9287008
switching	screens
if you have a layout with 2 buttons on the screens and then switching to one with 3 buttons on the screens you have to somehow differentiate between those layouts in your code

9287042
scrollable	panels
the problem you are having is that you are nesting scrollable panels

9287042
