versioning	upgrade
this may not really be the answer you are looking for but it sounds like you are overcomplicating the problem by trying to manage this as an upgrade where you aren t going to continue to support the old versioning

1600035
versioning	upgrade
when the user upgrade to the new versioning the age is still stored so when you access the dateofbirth field you just check if a dateofbirth exists and if it doesn t you calculate it from the age and save it so when you next access it it already has a date of birth and the age field can be ignored

1600044
french	turkish
but it could contain some customer name with french turkish characters which i am willing to disregard and see as

1600177
executable	upx
upx is an excellent compression utility for dlls and executable

1600183
translation	localization
the tool helps you easily manage translation of your resources by letting translators work on a single localization project file and creating the satellite dlls right-away from the translation

1600218
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have added event handlers to the mypopupanchor element for the events mouseenter and mouseleave

1600327
hide	show
easiest way is to add a uiactivityindicatorview on top of your navigation bar and show hide it as needed

1600329
post	get
others will post nicer cleaner answers but this will get you started

1600340
config	ini
i have a sqlconnection which is shared between projects in runtine it reads the config from an ini file is there some way to load this same config in design time

1600403
for-loop	loops
you could put it in your coding standard that for loops should be used only when the full for-loop construct is followed the index must be initialized in the initializer section the index must be tested in the loop-test section and the value of the index must only be altered in the counting expression section

1600421
implements	extends
and by the way extends abstractlist takes away most of the boring work of implements a list

1600441
google-chrome	safari
this is different from non-ie browsers where external requests from xhr -loaded documents are allowed or don t exist like in safari and google-chrome

1600442
postgresql	mysql
mysql is probably the rdbms most used with rails and hence the most supported but i use postgresql which is also very well supported and have had no issues with using it

1600484
put	get
the error message says only get put and delete requests are allowed

1600485
free	malloc
if you are using low level malloc free brk etc to implement new and delete you may reserve an overhead area and return the followed right usable area to the user too just as gnu c ++

1600486
hash	salt
if you control the message content you can perform simple authentication and validation by placing your data between some sort of begin and end lines and appending a salt hash

1600507
qkeysequence	qabstractbutton
it seems the only method is qabstractbutton setshortcut const qkeysequence key

1600508
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
by the way firefox google-chrome and opera all opens blank targets in tabs by default.

1600514
opera	safari
it also has improved css load detection which is disabled by default but helps in making sifr replace elements faster in safari and opera

1600531
textmate	scite
most ror developers use a simple text editor textmate on macos scite on windows - mostly because most features refactoring code completion of ides designed for languages like java c# can t be applied that easily on a dynmic language like ruby

1600531
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql might be the best choices since they are the most used ones so you can hope for continuous support

1600561
typedef	typename
that typedef defining barbar is one that requires a typename in order for the compiler to be able to check the template for blatant syntactic errors before it is instantiated with a concrete type

1600582
int	chars
move the chars in question to the chars field and then your un-signed int field will have the ebcdic value you need

1600582
int	chars
you can get fancier by having a larger chars field and have an array of 1-byte un-signed int in the same place like this

1600582
int	chars
for each byte in the chars field assign its memory address to the pointer assigned to your 1-byte un-signed int field

1600586
division	multiplication
if your division instruction is not fast enough but the multiplication instruction is you can use the following technique and it sounds as if this is the technique you re after

1600586
multiplying	division
you can exploit this by realizing that division by a number n is the same as multiplying by 2 32 n then taking the more significant 32 bits of the result

1600593
division	multiplication
a division of an integer by an integer constant can be replaced with a combination of a shift and a multiplication

1600612
public	protected
as a user of the class you usually just need the public interface if you derive you need also the protected interface only if you are changing the class itself you need to look at the private stuff

1600631
folder	directory
i m currently trying to write a small service to delete one directory and all the files contained within it there is one issue which i don t know how to resolve which is that the users don t have persmissions to access the folder or update it so i m trying to run the delete as an administrator from within ad

1600707
interpolation	splines
a simple way of doing extrapolations is to use interpolation polynomials or splines there are many routines for this in scipy.interpolate and there are quite easy to use just give the x y points and you get a function a callable precisely

1600707
interpolation	splines
however i encourage you to play with the polynomial or splines interpolation from scipy.interpolate to see whether the results you obtain suit you

1600760
strcpy	strncpy
look into strcpy or strncpy or you can copy using for loops

1600835
for-loop	loops
now every time this loops is hit there is only one comparison instead of two on a one-core machine with a for-loop the condition is true for i 0 false for i 1 whereas the do while is false all the time

1600836
many-to-many	one-to-many
to quote from this page a many-to-many relationship is really two one-to-many relationships with a junction link table

1600836
button	checkbox
there are 2 ways of doing this - either add a checkbox to every row in your table and have one button labeled add relationships to selected rows wording needs improvement

1600840
implements	extends
login.html should be mapped to your logincontroller.java which extends basecontroller and implements a login method which takes at least a httpservletrequest and model as parameters

1600844
ienumerable	ienumerator
why do we need custom collection and custom enumeration by implementing ienumerable and ienumerator i know what ienumerable and ienumerator does and how to implement them

1600847
portrait	landscape
the problem is that my application is design for landscape mode and the camera control can only show in portrait mode

1600926
ienumerable	ienumerator
generics are quite powerful so i haven t had the need to write a brand new class that implements ienumerable and ienumerator in a long time

1600930
mouse	keyboard
without it you wouldn t get mouse keyboard or other system events

1600940
public	protected
don t create a private protected public member variable of these types instead create the formatters parsers in the methods where you need them

1600951
implements	extends
that s a very handy way to extends a class without having to define and implements whole new classes

1600953
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this bug is not present on the mac which runs java 1.5 but on windows running 1.6 - including ie firefox google-chrome safari but not opera strangely

1600988
ienumerable	ienumerator
of built-in collection class options that you can derive from you should very very rarely have to implement ienumerator or ienumerable yourself anymore

1600988
ienumerable	ienumerator
so in the great majority of cases a custom collection class should not implement ienumerable and ienumerator itself it should derive from one of the existing built-in collection classes that already do that for you

1600991
ordinals	difference
i know marking string parameters as const can make a huge performance difference but what about ordinals types

1601017
swt	swing
everything from swing to swt to j2me to blackberry to iphone includes this concept

1601033
ordinals	difference
declaring ordinals types const makes no difference because they are copied anyway call-by-value so any changes to the variable do not affect the original variable

1601124
atomic	interlocked
you need to understand the reason to avoid cargo-cult programming. marking strings as const makes a performance difference because you no longer need to use an interlocked increment and decrement of the refcount on the string an operation that actually becomes more expensive not less as time goes by because more cores means more work that has to be done to keep atomic operations in sync

1601126
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i do not have a mac to test on but this css seems to do the trick in safari google-chrome firefox opera and internet explorer on windows

1601129
children	parent
what would be the best fastest way to callback to the parent build process with all the millions of file io reports that the children will be generating

1601209
ienumerable	ienumerator
if it is the latter derive from a built-in collection class that already has ienumerable in it like than rename it so that it s classname communicates that it is a collection orders or ordercollection and delete the ienumerable and ienumerator implementations they come for free by deriving from .

1601220
vim	emacs
it took me ages to figure discover that the version of ctags that is preinstalled on my system was the emacs one and didn t have the --recurse option but now that i ve run ctags-exuberant on my copy of the openjdk sources to attempt to get some kind of code completion going vim hangs whenever i try to invoke it with c-n or c-p

1601283
mvp	presenter
it s a mvp framework for windows form which allows you to do dependency injection of your presenter in your view

1601300
document.write	window.open
you can open a new window window.open and write the content of the inner document stream programmatically using document.write

1601339
apache	nginx
using a more efficient web server like nginx to handle static file serving and then reverse proxy app requests to a separate apache instance

1601339
apache	nginx
implement php with fastcgi on top of nginx using something like php-fpm getting rid of apache entirely

1601341
post	get
now what i need to do is get related records for a post in a single query

1601341
post	get
it s easy to join one table and get related post but when it comes to different tables.

1601419
udp	tcp
for best efficiency you can design your own protocol on top of tcp ip using tcp or even udp and maybe even compress the data on the fly if network load is a big issue

1601438
moq	nmock
i m sorry but i ve never used nunit.mocks - but i do have some experience with nmock and moq which by the way i highly recommend

1601469
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp s and codeigniter s communities are among the most helpful

1601476
public	protected
for example make methods and fields public protected and remove final

1601585
war	manifest.mf
just to add to the information here in case of a war file the meta-inf manifest.mf file provides the developer a facility to initiate a deploy time check by the container which ensures that the container can find all the classes your application depends on

1601610
opera	firefox
in this case it works in opera but not firefox

1601621
subnet	packets
if they are on different physical subnet what mac address would you send the packets to

1601621
arp	tcp
in that case you can send an arp request and then send the packet to the mac address you get the reply from and it will arrive at host 2 - the same way tcp ip packets are usually sent over ethernet to hosts on the same network

1601646
decimal	ieee
i m performing some data type conversions where i need to represent uint long ulong and decimal as ieee 754 double floating point values

1601648
bmp	png
the scanned image is saved locally on the user s computer as a bmp jpg tif png file

1601661
int	double
double x will convert x from an int to a double

1601661
int	double
so int double x converts form an int to a double and then back

1601661
int	double
essentially the code is checking that the conversion to double is reversible and therefore that the double can store the exact value of the int

1601752
post	get
trying to hide the url for example by doing a post instead of a get to the image-generating page is just security by obscurity which is not a good idea

1601770
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly on firefox and google-chrome but on ie tried it on 6 7 and 8 it works only the first time after that it won t show the message

1601783
int	double
ieee 754 double has 52 bits for mantissa and you are converting from to int long so it quite easy to test

1601783
int	double
if your int consume less than 52 bits then it should be convertible without problem to ieee 754 double

1601783
int	double
so for sure int can fit in double without any problem both sign and unsign

1601791
strcpy	strncpy
i am trying to understand the difference disadvantages of strcpy and strncpy

1601792
junit	cactus
cactus api let you warp up junit test for servlets struts web app

1601792
junit	cactus
you can also run coverage tools like emma that let you know what percentage of the code is covered by your junit cactus tests

1601804
stdout	stderr
this option must be set to true to allow the parent to specify stdin stdout and stderr handles for the child in the startupinfo parameter

1601813
copying	overwrite
when you copy from src to dest it continues copying past the end of dest and overwrite part of src

1601879
uilabel	uibutton
you will connect your uikit related instance variables uilabel uibutton etc. in interface builder and therefore won t have to instantiate those objects in your initializer

1601915
x86	mips
i don t have a mips system lying around but on my x86 loonix box i tried #include and discovered that # is the comment character so i tried .include and that worked as soon as i quoted the file name .include something.i

1601930
actionscript	mxml
what the question says i want to use compc either command-line or ant to build a .swc from some actionscript and mxml code

1601930
flexunit	cairngorm
when i set up the flexunit cairngorm mock-as3 and hamcrest-as3 libraries as rsl libraries with the .swf location set to something that exists i get a runtime failure

1601938
ubuntu	debian
if you did go with debian you could most likely do all your development on ubuntu and then push to your embedded system

1601988
boost	stl
is all of c++ stl and boost supported

1601992
post	put	post	get	put	get
edit2 like jersey i am looking for rest support post get delete put

1602028

this includes going to and from boolean int floats and strings as required

1602078
google-chrome	firefox
ie 8 google-chrome firefox work fine

1602093
kerberos	ntlm
the problem we re seeing is every now and again on a refresh the token drops from kerberos down to ntlm

1602108
client-side	server-side
if a server-side control is hidden it doesn t render anything to the client-side markup

1602198
erd	entity-relationship
however if you re planning to invest some money toward erd tool spend it on entity-relationship studio

1602229
getter	setter
100 test coverage gui testing testing getter setter or other no-logic code etc

1602270
config	ini
i ve decided to use ini file to store simple key-value pair config for my java application

1602321
pull	push
2 - when i want to work on the code at work i m confused how do i go about making commits to the local repo on my work desktop and then at the end of the day push my changes to the bare repo on my vps so that i can pull the updates to my home desktop

1602352
accessor	properties
i am trying to see what the value of ball.center.x is at a certain point but because center is a properties accessor selector i don t get the value when i hover over it in the xcode debugger

1602378
hash	md5
the simplest renaming scheme would be to calculate an md5 hash of the filename and not of the file itself which is what md5sum does

1602384
unix	bsd
like mach and most bsd unix systems

1602386
interpreted-language	forth
as others have mentioned forth is an interpreted-language that has been used in a number of embedded environments as well as in quite a few bootloaders

1602390
google-chrome	firefox
if the page is served as text html then firefox and google-chrome the only two i ve checked in won t recognise the xml namespaces necessary for the svg to work

1602419
fast-forward	merge
if you leave some uncomitted changes you can finish commit before git pull but then you wouldn t get fast-forward but a merge

1602426
pull	push
you can then push to and pull from it on each computer when necessary simply using git push and git pull

1602427
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
the m2e plugin manages all the dependencies defined in the maven pom.xml file automatically

1602438
uiview	subviews
guys please note that i am not dealing a uiview and adding a tableview as its subviews but i am dealing with a uitableview

1602449
versioning	upgrade
that is to say if you upgrade the file to a new versioning it will not work with the old deserializer

1602467
ivar	subclassing
if you re subclassing uitableviewcontroller you get a tableview for free no ivar or nib required however since you re using a background i would stick with ib

1602478
folder	directory
i just added two new directory registration and openauthid in the main templates folder

1602507
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization into an xml file c#

1602583
stdout	stderr
the most likely culprit is that unison is sending some output to stderr instead of just stdout

1602583
stdout	stderr
popen takes an additional stderr argument so you can try capturing that instead of or in addition to stdout

1602648
int	double	int	chars	int	boolean
for the primitives data types boolean byte short chars int float long double the shape is the size in bytes it uses or in bits here 1 byte 8 bits

1602648
int	chars
now you might assign an int 32 bits to a chars 16 bits or to a short 16 bits the problem would be that if the value holds than 16 bits 131 071 for instance

1602651
superclass	subclassing
you should use the proper constructor based on the subclassing you want to create instead of calling the superclass constructor and assigning type manually

1602663
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
if you re using wcf you shouldn t be using wsdl.exe but svcutil.exe instead

1602663
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
however from your code sample it would appear as if you re using the xml serializer and not the datacontractserializer - probably because you used wsdl.exe instead of svcutil.exe

1602666
boost	stl
the basic stl boost data structures should work but threading with boost could be a problem

1602680
int	chars
will also give an error because c + i will result in an int 32 bits and assigning it to a chars 16 bits may cause loss of precision

1602719
public	protected
if using a helper to expose protected members you have to declare the helper in the same unit that you use it unless you expose a public method which exposes the required protected members

1602731
sse	avx
this is an interesting development given that their 4-way simd sse instruction set is about to be joined by 8-way avx and 16-way larrabee instructions and in the interests of portability it ll likely be much better to code with an abstraction like valarray than say intrinsics

1602788
struts	wicket	struts	stripes	wicket	stripes
struts stripes wicket spring mvc

1602806
webkit	gecko
if you do have control over the computer or can instruct the user to install an application you d be best suited by building an actual application with embedded webkit or gecko

1602819
hide	show
you can also add some effects in the show hide through jquery s effects

1602824
hash	md5
md5 hash for the words

1602880
hash	salt
the password is going to be hash and salt anyway and

1602880
hash	salt
again it s going to be hash and salt so db size is not an issue

1602880
hash	salt
so the conclusion is even if you hash salt the password short passwords are still a risk

1602917
hash	salt
if your passwords are properly hash and salt rainbow tables are a non-issue incidentally

1602974
int	chars
the problem with ordering is that atoi is only reading the int ie it stops at the . chars

1602981
hash	md5
a hash function can be as simple as add 13 to the input or complex like a cryptographic hash such as md5 or sha1

1603082
ubuntu	linux
dillo 2.1.1 for ubuntu linux didn t like either line maybe that system lacked both courier new and courier

1603088
postgresql	mysql
the advantage of mysql and postgresql is of course the starting price of 0 which is pretty nice in a usual self-funded startup

1603119
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want to bind handlers for mouseenter and mouseleave to a set of elements grabbed using the jquery selector

1603119
firefox	safari
this actually works fine on mac win firefox safari but on ie6 and ie8 only the first element grabbed by the selector displays the desired behavior

1603120
versioning	upgrade
you can start with the free sql server express edition and later if you need you can upgrade to the full versioning which supports clustering etc

1603122
min	max
you can also control the min and max number of threads in the thread pool by using setminthreads and setmaxthreads

1603127
postgresql	mysql

1603138
daemons	launchd
cron is a common name for a gnu linux daemons that periodically launchd scripts according to a schedule you set

1603138
daemons	launchd
you add your script into a crontab or place a symlink to it into a special directory and the daemons handles the job of launchd it in the background

1603138
daemons	systemd
there is a variety of different cron daemons but your gnu linux systemd should have it already installed

1603140
cpu	affinity
for general-purpose applications there is no reason to set the cpu affinity

1603140
cpu	affinity
however there are instances where it is necessary to set the cpu affinity

1603140
cpu	affinity
for example in real-time systems where the cost of migrating a thread from one core to another which can happen at any time if the cpu affinity has not been set can introduce unpredictable delays that can cause tasks to miss their deadlines and which preclude real-time guarantees

1603140
cpu	affinity
you can take a look at this article about a multi-core aware implementation of real-time corba that among other things had to set the cpu affinity so that cpu migration could not result in missed deadlines

1603146
daemons	systemd
a mail alias will do this inside the mail systemd without you having to fool around with daemons or services or anything of the sort

1603206
put	get
use something like this - create an iframe from gwt maybe put it in lightbox or something similar populate it the way you want using the current state of the app and when the user is finished he ll just close the lightbox frame and get back to the main application

1603206
post	get
you could also pass around data in a hidden way no visible data in the url or even through post using the window.name hack - there s even a sample implementation for gwt to get you started

1603221
rss	feed
i like using niokrigi or scrapi for parsing the xml in the atom rss feed

1603229
move	drag
it must be in the 2002 or newer format you will not be able to drag and drop the tables to your datacontext so either manually create the objects in your dbml or you can use sql server migration for access to move it to a sql server and then drag and drop all you want

1603231
cpu	affinity
regarding cpu affinity

please repeat this procedure until the printed time is somewhat stable and post this line together with some comments on your hardware i used cpu-z to get the infos and operating system like this

1603391
verilog	vhdl
without even know the answers to these questions i would not use an fpga unless you are building a real-time system and have electrical computer engineers on your team that have knowledge of hardware description languages such as vhdl and verilog

1603422
public	protected
in an asp.net page you can bind directly to public protected properties of your page s code-behind class

1603431
button	checkbox
on the publish tab under the options button there is a checkbox for generating the page

1603460
nhibernate	automapper
the only problem is that fluent nhibernate crashes when the automapper hits a class that s already been mapped in the classic fluent nhibernate style

1603467
inherited	properties
you need to set singular properties of your dojo.dnd.source which is inherited from dojo.dnd.selector

1603473
iasyncresult	idisposable
if iasyncresult was idisposable disposal of the object would take care of cleaning up the handle

1603492
disk	ram
at 78 million rows even just changing the clustering key to int identity will save you up to 60 bytes per row - that alone would come out to be up to 4 gbyte of disk space and ram usage in your server

1603535

1603605
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
my problem is that i use the grouping sorting and filtering

1603605
sorting	grouping
that means if i were to limit the data with the linq skip and take methods or using something like a paginated observablecollection the grouping and sorting would be wrong because it would only be applied to the first page of data

1603609
int	chars
however 10 chars long numbers may be able to fit in sql server s int datatype depending on the size so int vs

1603613
post	get
if i follow the directions given by howard in this post i m able to get it running in debug mode

1603616

i have a fixed size uitextview say width and height of 150 150

1603644
haskell	sml
i haven t read the paper on edison but if it s nothing more than the haskell implementation of purely functional data structures doesn t it make more sense to port the sml code that s in the book thesis

1603674
stdout	stderr
but if the exec d process decides to close stdout or stderr and send them elsewhere - there s little you can do

1603679

then implements -layoutsubviews and call super in that method before setting the frames of your subviews and set the frame of the uitextfield according to the contentrect property of the cell

1603783
width	height
rectangle has 1.0 ratio for area height width when circle s ratio is about 0.78

1603798
gif	bmp
for example i have a scenario where i m showing a preview image but if that fails this is a real scenario where i m previewing images and certain gif bmp formats cannot be previewed it s simply a scenario where i display an alternate image instead of preview

1603805
bmp	ppm	bmp	pbm	bmp	png	bmp	pgm	tiff	pbm	tiff	bmp	tiff	png	tiff	pgm	ppm	pbm	ppm	pgm	pbm	pgm
it supports bmp dib jpeg jpg jpe png pbm pgm ppm sr ras tiff tif

1603811
int	chars
since key itself is a string php converts that to an int 0 and you get the first chars

1603833
x86	64bit
adding true support for edit and continue to the 64bit version of the clr is a fairly large work item and other features were prioritized higher due to the fact that there is a reasonable workaround in most cases target x86

1603866
int	double
i need to do maths on both floats and int with much bigger accuracies and magnitudes than offered both by int float double in .net

1603868
children	parent
you could probably clean up some performance by storing a reference to the parent and just getting children each time instead of re-running the selector

1603968
hex	binary
on windows and ms-dos fopen translates ms-dos line endings r n hex 0x0d 0x0a in the file to unix style n unless you append b to the file mode to indicate binary

1603971
post	get
after you ve managed to make page requests using the get http verb learn about how to make post requests and how to add headers like content-type to your request

1604023
postgresql	mysql
we have a software that runs on multiple dmbs mysql postgresql and ms sql server i m wondering why the oracle version of the product consume more resources than the other ones

1604026
nant	cruisecontrol
we always compiled our web apps but we migrated from vss to svn and then setup cruisecontrol and nant to automate our builds and deployments

1604062
trac	bugzilla
any tips scripts or other artifacts that will make importing data from a trac instance into a bugzilla instance less work

1604062
trac	bugzilla
even if that were available then the problem becomes how to map trac data to bugzilla data.

1604089
hide	show
basically what i m going to do is to toggle hide show

1604152
arduino	avr-gcc
1 the arduino programming language is based on wiring and is essentially c c++ several simple transformations are performed before passing to avr-gcc . 2 the goal of the arduino project is to make tools available that are accessible low-cost low capital investment flexible and easy-to-use for artists and hobbyists

1604161
ssl	https
we recently updated the iis server to use an ssl certificate and now the same application has a https url

1604164
hide	show
after that i want to hide the welcome screen and show the tabbarcontroller

1604165
jquery	simplemodal
i used a jquery plugin not long ago called simplemodal

1604165
button	checkbox
on the modal i had multiple checkbox and to carried the values of the checkbox back to the page the modal was on after a submit button was hit

1604173
hide	show
my recommendation is to always just have 1 frame and have layers which you hide and show as necessary

1604174
queue	fifo
the standard refactoring is to store the data you would otherwise be passing to the function in a lifo a stack or fifo queue

1604196
allocator	stl
i would like to use different instances of an stl custom allocator class to manage different memory spaces and then be able to specify an allocator instance to an stl container such that each container only draws from its assigned memory space

1604196
allocator	stl
i see how i can pass an allocator type into the template parameters of an stl container but i want something akin to passing an allocator instance into the constructor of an stl container

1604231
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop executing and in that loops i call a dialog and implement onconfirm for the dialog

1604256
jobs	cron	whenever	capistrano
check out the whenever gem -- this may be stretching beyond what you re intending to do but it uses very simple ruby syntax and makes it dead simple to setup cron jobs within a capistrano deployment script

1604259
allocator	stl
then when the stl container constructs its allocator the allocator uses the memory spaceassigned to that allocator

1604259
allocator	stl
pass the allocator type to the stl container constructors as required

1604274
put	get
i don t get why one would have to do that but try to put wagon-ftp-1.0-beta-2.jar in m2_home lib

1604279
cvs	svn
just see how many famous open source projects are switching from cvs svn to mercurial and how many are switching to git

1604284
allocator	stl
the stl containers allow you to pass the allocator in as an argument to the constructor

1604301
allocator	stl
unfortunately stl allocator cannot have state or at least have to be very careful how that state is used - each instance of a particular allocator type must be equivalent for stl containers to work effectively with them

1604301
allocator	stl
i don t recall the details right now but i know that scott meyers discusses this problem at length in effective stl item 10 be aware of allocator conventions and restrictions

1604301
allocator	stl
for example see this paragraph from an article by anthony aue improving performance with custom pool allocator for stl

1604306
wav	caf
i m playing multiple wav files i tried using caf but same thing happen with avaudioplayer

1604374
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i also moved logic from viewdidload into viewwillappear in the root controller since i originally set the title in there and other things and that didn t help either

1604376
width	height
suppose i have a scroll view in a view a scroll view s size is 320 width 2000 height

1604402
activemq	rabbitmq
you could also consider using an more enterprise messaging solution such as rabbitmq or activemq

1604463
children	parent
all children of first parent

1604463
children	parent
all children of second parent

1604463
children	parent
but that gives me parent first then the children

1604463
children	parent
i need parent and immediately its children

1604473
post	get
check ftp and other services check your code for where you get input cookie querystring post params etc but the most likely is you installed an old known vulnerable version of wordpress or some webapp and a roving worm found it and exploited it

1604475
width	height
the other guys are right...if your div is returning to its original size...it is because the page is being allowed to reload...in which case your initial div width height are applied by the browser...as your alternate width height are only applied by jquery onsubmit

1604489
children	parent
is there any way to be able to have my generated folder class have parent children attributes instead of simply folders

1604522
onclick	onkeyup
obviously there are different ways of implementing callbacks but you said you knew the power of callbacks in js and they are always onclick onload onkeyup etc so i wanted to give an example that somewhat resembled that behavior

1604537
children	parent
all children of first parent

1604537
children	parent
all children of second parent

1604537
children	parent
5 1 all children of first parent

1604537
children	parent
3 2 all children of second parent

1604537
children	parent
but that gives me parent first then the children

1604537
children	parent
i need parent and immediately its children

1604581
post	get
also this can break the usage of the super globals get and post and can only be suppressed by logic to prevent their execution

1604604
hide	show
is there any way to navigate between pages without reloading the whole thing other than simple hide show functions

1604604
hide	show
or with hide show how can i link to a certain part of the site

1604604
hide	show
i could have a copy of the markup as a separate file with the onload hide show different for each one and use the same coding file for functionality

1604613
pull	push
are you supposed to git pull a specific branch into the web servers or create a new alias to git push to

1604636
stateless	stateful
ajax is the 3rd piece to making the stateless web application appear as stateful

1604702
uiview	calayer
if you want to test this yourself i highly recommend picking up the image editor opacity which can generate quartz code for a drawing including a full uiview or calayer subclass as well as output a png of that same drawing

1604710
decimal	ieee
floating point numbers are represented in ieee notation based on the powers of 2 so terminating decimal numbers may not be a terminating binary number that s why you get the trailing digits

1604717
folder	directory
so the fix is just copy that aspnet_client system_web 2_0_50727 folder into your website s root directory

1604747
versioning	upgrade
finally if you have upgrade from leopard to snow leopard and installed your own versioning of ruby on leopard you need to remove it

1604757
ssl	https
the best way to do this that i m aware of is via https via tsl ssl

1604758
listview	gridview
personally i wouldn t use a datagrid control since it restricts your control over your output and they ve been replaced by the newer gridview listview controls although datagrid is not obsolete so feel free to use it if you want

1604770
bash	zsh
also zsh and bash support this natively in echo

1604778
ido-mode	magit
the latest version defines a minor mode which turns itself off in a read-only buffer or the minibuffer allowing things like ido-mode and magit to work properly

1604800
sfx	zipfile
the sfx exe is also a regular zipfile that you can read and extract with winzip or other zip tools including windows explorer compressed folders

1604800
sfx	zipfile
the way it works is pretty simple in the code that produces the sfx copy your unzip stub exe winforms wpf or whatever to an output stream and then without closing the stream save the zipfile to the same stream

1604868
int	chars
the error reporting method is taking an int here and the pipe chars is bitwise or-ing their underlying int values together to achieve the final int passed to the function

1604874
uiscrollviewdelegate	uiwebviewdelegate
that means using the uiscrollviewdelegate methods is not an option to do what you want and the uiwebviewdelegate protocol does not respond to those scrolling event type of messages

1604916
min	max
you re using union rather than union all you won t have entirely duplicated rows between the two subtables in the union but you may still very well have several values of time for one value of the id and you give no hint of what you want to do - min max avg sum or what

1604926
post	get
if you ajax requests are always post then you could check the method and assume a post is an ajax call because it s pretty hard for the average user to create a post accidentally where as they can always get any url if they know of it

1604967
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i found many css js menu scripts on various sites they work well is in firefox ie7 and safari opera if js is disabled but not in ie 6 and for ie 6 small js file need to add because ie doesnt support hover but my question is can we make pre css dropdown menu for ie6 because

1604979
versioning	upgrade
i d like to upgrade to the new versioning of xcode 3.2 and snow leopard but chances are my partner won t

1604986
pull	push
pulling a branch means you can make some evolutions within that branch due to some bugfix and adjustments to make once the code is on a production environment and push it back for all the other developer s repository for them to pull back and take into account

1604996
subtract	add
you must be knowing at what timezone your server is then make the time utc and add subtract the time to get the local time of the user

1605056
mouseover	mouseout
i don t know what your code looks like but when you display your options box using hover or mouseover mouseout just include the zero clipboard div.

1605066
regression	anova
regression linear anova qr svd and more

1605069
portrait	landscape
the first time you rotate portrait - landscape everything is fine

1605075
django	turbogears
templating turbogears django zope

1605081
folder	directory
apple used to include this type of example code in the xcode tools package under the developer examples bluetooth folder but upon downloading the latest version of xcode 3.2.1 these bluetooth examples have been removed from that directory

1605102
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome display the returned value as a multi-line comment just fine

1605125
superclass	subclassing
but if you then try to declare a subclassing of your singleton class the subclassing constructor wont be able to see the constructors of the superclass .

1605197
jobs	cron
you can probably use something like cfengine chef for deployment it can deploy everything - including cron jobs

1605218
firefox	safari
the middle column will collapse in recent versions of firefox and safari although apparently not ie7

1605218
firefox	safari
since both safari and firefox behave this way i assume this is officially sanctioned behavior

1605240
gentoo	ubuntu
i use ubuntu for my host system and a chrooted gentoo install for building apps for an embedded target

1605324
post	put
x also makes it possible to put comments into the regex itself so the things like # post title there are just comments

1605332
fileinputstream	filechannel
i am trying to figure out if there is any difference in performance or advantages when we use nio filechannel versus normal fileinputstream fileouputstream to read and write files to filesystem

1605333
symfony	kohana	codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	cakephp	kohana
stick with vanilla php and don t confuse it by throwing something like codeigniter kohana symfony cakephp or zend on top of it

1605385
client-side	server-side
javascript has strong restrictions about accessing files on the local file system i think that you are maybe mixing up the client-side and server-side concepts

1605403
folder	directory
preferably using the cms template folder directory structure.

1605427
for-loop	arrays
i am iterating through that table with a for-loop and populating an arrays of objects with data

1605478
teamcity	nant
we use teamcity nant and psexec to run a command on a remote machine as part of the release packaging

1605478
teamcity	nant
everything works fine when i run the nant from the console but when running from teamcity psexec hangs freezes 50 of the times

1605482
boost	stl
it s certainly possible to write c++ mex files which use stl and boost

1605500
inherited	properties
in this case icat inherited ianimal s color properties

1605619
children	parent
a children has a parent in one of the tables parent or parent2

1605621
imperative	declarative
postsharp provides a basic declarative pointcut system but enables you to develop imperative pointcuts so you can write code typically using system.reflection that evaluates the pointcut at compile time

1605629
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
use ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse

1605698
google-chrome	firefox
must work for ie firefox and google-chrome

1605705
vim	emacs
is there a dedicated xml editor or a configuration for vim emacs to edit xml easily with integrated xsd validation

1605741
hash	salt
maybe a bit unrelated but i m wondering if you are salting the hash on the client how are you exactly keeping the salt secure

1605744
width	height
assume we have an input position of 2 1 5 1 we have a zn z-near of 1 and a zf z-far of 10 and a w width of 1 and a h height of 1

1605814
post	put
so i don t know if is there any traditional way to retrieve this kind of call from url with methods like post delete and put on the requests etc.

1605814
post	get
hi so i managed to make get requests but now i m having a serious problem in retrieve post request for example i m using the update status api from twitter that in curl would work like this

1605814
post	get
i finally manage to get it working but probably there s a way to make it cleaner and beautiful as i m new on c# i ll need more knowledge to do it the way the post params are passed makes me very confused because is a lot of code to just pass params

1605816
yacc	bison
this tutorial is the best i ve seen for working with flex and bison or lex yacc

1605848
webclient	webrequest
for finer grained control you might find webrequest to be more useful but webclient seems the best fit for your needs

1605981
onreadystatechange	onload
as onload doesnt work in ie you need to add onreadystatechange

1606017
hide	show
i need to show toolbar with play pause buttons when i touch the respective picture boxes and hide when i touch the other one

1606018
graphics2d	bufferedimage
check this for how to create a bufferedimage using the graphics2d passed to the paint method of any component there are many ways to create buffered images this links a few...

versioning	upgrade
here s the upgrade versioning to open the table contents in .xls format

1606125

raw sockets may tap all ip protocols in linux even protocols like icmp or tcp which have a protocol module in the kernel

1606150
versioning	upgrade
oh and this is on python 2.4 so please give really really good reason for upgrade if you want me to use a newer versioning and i ll go for 3

1606194
ppm	pbm

1606199
postgresql	mysql
suppose you use a real database ie any database except mysql but i ll use postgresql as an example to do this query

1606210
inherited	properties
trace styles conceptually this shows where a given style properties was inherited from etc

1606248

to use the php extension for imagemagick i need to upgrade my server to imagemagick versioning 6.2.4

1606378
ironruby	ironpython
i just wondered if you can do ironpython ironruby phalanger h# etc is there any technical reason that would prevent creating vb6.net

1606427
vb.net	vb6
why would you bother when there is vb.net and tools to aid in migration from vb6

1606481
inherited	properties
project inherited should work here properties are inherited if you place them in the parent pom and if the profile is activated

1606481
maven	pom.xml	inherited	properties
i ve setup a simple multi-modules build demonstrating properties inherited from a profile in the parent pom.xml with maven 2.2.1

1606481
inherited	properties
as you can see the profile is activated but not active and the properties defined in the profile in the parent pom is inherited

1606517
rss	feed
i m trying to use file_get_contents in php to display an rss feed

1606622
int	chars
in other words because the bool will get promoted to an int your test will return true whenever the strings start with different chars tmp1 will be false which gets converted to 0 and so tmp2 becomes true

1606666
debian	linux
it sounds messy but basically it will be like the cacti or the opennms systems just google them and it s based on alot of technologies thing like ruby mysql to save the actions and to have users db linux i would use debian snmp agents cron to schedule the basic system working ssh telnet take a reaction of some harmful action php rubyonrails to build an web interface that can also connect to your database .

1606681
vsto	add-in
i created a setup project not clickonce for vsto add-in for outlook

versioning	upgrade
i m considering buying the pro versioning of one of these mind mapping applications to upgrade from freemind and store my mind maps on the cloud

1606787
postgresql	mysql
there s no way of deleting files from mysql postgresql would give you that facility but mysql can t

1606827
16-bit	64bit
we have 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit hardware architectures and operating systems

1606852
subtract	add	subtract	addition	multiplying	add	multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	subtraction	subtraction	add	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
then you also want to add subtract multiplying those 2n-bits integers and now you need 2n-bits general-purpose registers for storing the addition subtraction results and 4n-bits registers for storing the multiplication results

1606854
put	get
you can t put it in the dealloc-method because although it can access the static variable any instance method that is created that get s released will also release the sharedinstance

1606870
stdout	fflush
this is the default behavior - when connected to a pipe programs must explicitly fflush stdout for realtime results otherwise standard c library will buffer

1606917
int	double
i have some xaml textboxes that need to allow nothing but double and some that need to allow nothing but int

1606921
tcpdf	fpdi
i m using fpdi together with tcpdf to add a page to a already existing pdf-file

1606921
tcpdf	fpdi
i find no documentation in fpdi or tcpdf about this automaticly generated page counter

1606923
dictionary	map
if you would solve the problem in the object model using dictionary there is the option of directly map the dictionary as map but then the data is not in columns but in rows

1606923
dictionary	map
or you map the dictionary as dynamic component which will map to columns

1606925
hide	show
instead i prefer to just hide show elements as appropriate

1607004
free	realloc
if realloc fails and returns null is the former buffer free d or it is kept intact

1607031
realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the

1607031
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call

1607031
free	realloc
to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

1607104
hash	salt
every time i have anything to do with passwords they are one way hash with a changing salt hash userid + clearpassword

1607113
hash	salt
i would agree that the safest way remains the one-way hash but with a salt of course

1607140
dia	visio
dia - best freeware flowcharting visio tool

1607143
int	double
my mistake the time is stored as an unsigned double instead of an int

1607169
dia	visio
there s an open-source program with features similar to visio called dia

1607201
int	chars
make a hash from the chars digits in your case to int for counting

1607214
agile	sprint
but it was my understanding that agile practices specifically scrum were based upon the concept of tasks being buckets that store individual deliverable goals and you add remove adjust them as the clients needs evolve after each sprint

1607274
terminate	timeout
however i want the process task to terminate with success after 5 minutes so i set the timeout to 300 seconds but it still terminate with a failure

1607423
ssl	https
however when setting up the webserver to support ssl it should not be any difference in how you deploy it as far as i know you just tell the webserver to respond to https instead of http

1607460
sharepoint	splist
you can catch the httpcontext in both splist and document libraries if you upload the document from the sharepoint interface internet explorer

1607478
cpu	processors
if several processors can each write to different places in the cache line then the cache line can ping-pong between cpus and that s a lot more expensive than if it the cache line goes to a single cpu and stays there

1607488
prepare	execute
passing a query to an execute method of a prepare statement or something guessing my oracle drivers is deprecated

1607533
postgresql	mysql
my 2 cents stick with mysql or postgresql simple sql and try not to make any stored procedures or use proprietary sql

1607538
profiling	debugging
if your code makes extensive use of template you might be interested in templight a tool developed by a hungarian research team for debugging and profiling c++ template metaprograms paper

1607539
gridview	detailsview
i would like to include a detailsview below the gridview that shows the information of the selected gridview row and allows the user to edite that row

1607539
gridview	detailsview
is there an easy way to link the selected gridview row to the detailsview

1607541
client-side	server-side
but be aware that php is entirely server-side and javascript is entirely client-side

1607545
post	get
so basically what i need is a way to either restore viewstate to a control manually or to get the control s value from a post variable or the equivalent in c#

1607578
put	get
i use linq to query to get the results from the dataset and put them into another variable

1607612
superclass	subclassing
in python how do you make a subclassing from a superclass

1607621
crossover	mutation
i need to be able to test differing crossover methods and differing mutation methods to compare their results part of the paper i have to write for the course

1607668
teamcity	ncover	teamcity	nant	ncover	nant
i personally use ncover in nant for my code coverage reports which integrates quite nicely with teamcity

1607793
folder	directory
the default data location of mysql data folder after creating 32 000 database on that location i want to change the data directory to other location

1607824
filtering	grouping
it must come before the grouping by in the query and acts as a filtering before things are sum med which is how most of the answers here work

1607824
filtering	grouping
this can be used to filtering on the resulting properties of grouping after grouping ing - for instance

1607840
unsigned	short
also early versions of the windows sdk didnt use wchar_t for wchar but unsigned short

1607840
unsigned	short
the windows sdk on gcc gets interesting as - im led to belive that gcc 32bit has a 32bit wchar_t - on compilers with 32bit wchar_t wchar would be defined as an unsigned short or some other type thats 16bits on that compiler

1607915
uitableview	reloaddata
in the viewdidappear method of my uiviewcontroller i call reloaddata on my uitableview

1607995
dictionary	map
what i would do is maintain these condition variables in a dictionary or map or hash table whatever your language calls it

1608008
3des	sha
the shared 3des key is itself encrypted using the sha hash value of the ltpa password padded with 0x0 upto 24 bytes

1608085
int	boolean
as some have pointed out this works fine because boolean are int a subclass specifically

1608116
put	get
once you ve done that you can just put the following code after your dial statement has returned callduration execute_agi get variable answeredtime

1608172
xen	openvz
is there a way to export a openvz vm from proxmox to xen

1608259
width	height
true .getthumbnailimage height width null

1608276
postgresql	mysql
in addition to mysql postgresql and ms sql server you might also want to look at apache derby aka ibm cloudscape aka javadb

1608280
jar	.war
i assume because you explicitely say jar that your webservices are ejb endpoints and not jax-rpc servlet based webservices because those would be packaged in a .war

1608280
folder	directory

1608584
min	max
is it possible to declare an array and ask the user for the min max values then initialize it

1608611
keydown	keyup
i m working on a small program and i m having a problem where it seems that some of the controls on it inside groupboxes are not triggering the keydown event on my form when i press and release any arrow key just the keyup event

regasm	regsvr32
update after further inspection we are able to regsvr32 u the old ocx file and use regasm to register our .net dll

wkt	gml
st_askml is one of several output formats including wkt gml geojson etc

place the struct definition outside of the class using a typedef

1609412
daemons	systemd
if you have systemd configuration access don t over-do it and set up some iptables pf etc to load-balance connections across n daemons instances processes as this will work out of the box

1609412
daemons	systemd
depending on how blocking the nature of the daemons n should be from the number of cores on the systemd or several times higher

1609412
daemons	systemd
if you don t have systemd access or ops can t be bothered you can use load balancer daemons there are plenty of open source ones instead of iptables pf etc and use also n service daemons like above

1609425
weka	orange
if you want to play around with different algorithms in simple intuitive package which requires no programming i suggest you take a look at weka my 1st choice orange or rapidminer

1609678
vbscript	vba
unlike vba vbscript has only one data type â variant so you don t specify the data type when declaring a variable

1609693
mouse	keyboard
sigh i have some code from codeproject for hooking global keyboard and mouse events

1609766
prepare	execute
prepare statement is created and execute - so it should be no different from jdbc

1609794
subtract	add
the l distance between 1 2 is 2 subtract a add d

1609794
subtract	add
the l distance between 2 3 is 2 subtract b add e

i unrolled the beginning and the end of the cycles to eliminate min and max from the code

1610062
for-loop	arrays
the following for-loop creates the inner arrays which are of type int using the jni function newintarray

1610076
getter	setter
while ed s comment is true i do prefer actual properties over the setter getter antipattern

1610081
int	double
that way it d be easier to see that it was in fact a double and not an int i guess

1610088
getter	setter
more recently a doubt began to make its way because that makes taking the address of a getter or setter ambiguous

1610092
udp	tcp
however note that tcp provides guarantee of delivery and order whereas udp provides none

1610095
cpu	processors
on the pc you have a nice processors register that gives you easy cheap access to the cpu usage

1610100

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this page works in ie google-chrome and firefox but not in safari or opera

1610125
getter	setter
personally i think getter and setter found in pairs are a code smell carried over from visual languages and their properties

1610125
getter	setter
i think the most common cause of getter and setter is not carrying the object model deep enough

1610125
put	get
etc. it just seems there wasn t enough thought put into how the class should be used and rather the author made the class easy to get at the data so he wouldn t have to consider how the class should be used

1610153
getter	setter
from my understanding it is a shortcut for having to write each member s getter and setter

1610155
folder	directory
all files are loaded in to a directory with in the application folder of the project layout

1610164
versioning	upgrade
i did something similar to upgrade to a newer versioning of the jasper report libraries in the jasper plugin and it worked for me

libc	tcmalloc
i d like to find a way to get gcc to globally link against tcmalloc like it does with libc .

1610180
getter	setter
second yes adding magic setter and getter is like adding setter and getter

1610203
int	chars
int getpwuid_r uid_t struct passwd chars size_t struct passwd

1610311
getter	setter
as a matter of fact here is where the getter and setter practice originated

1610311
getter	setter
so the magic getter and setter in php can be useful on many circumstances

1610311
getter	setter
now if you want to keep private variables and still use magic getter and setter

1610362
parent-child	one-to-many
edit just to expand on the previous point - i m hoping to have subsonic convert my object model to a relational db dealing with all the parent-child and one-to-many relationships that are implied

1610563
interpreted-language	compiled-language
interpreted-language give programs certain extra flexibility over compiled-language

1610582
post	get
i m trying to come up with a way to effectively easily clean all post and get variables with a single function

1610622
inherited	subclassing

1610943
crypt	md5
either crypt md5 or sha1

1610946
post	get
unless i misunderstood the question it sounds like maybe you were thinking that forms have to get post to the same url that loaded the current page

1610947
min	max
unsigned max is 15 signed positive max is 7 signed negative min is -8 so abs -8 won t fit into a signed value

1610947
division	multiplication
sure you can represent it as -8 but then division and multiplication with the result don t work as expected

1610952
iboutlet	ibaction
if you want to keep a reference to it declare it the same way you would if you were using a nib without the iboutlet ibaction and use self when assigning it

1610959
post	get
if i get it done i ll post it here

1611037

1611146
icriteria	fluent
let s compare i have worked often with n hibernate icriteria queries which can be considered a fluent mapping to sql

1611172
width	height
a span is by default an inline element you cannot set the width height and other properties associated with blocks

1611172
width	height
on the other hand an element with the property inline-block will still flow with any surrounding text but you may set properties such as width height etc

1611186
ubuntu	linux
i have windows and linux ubuntu 9.04 in my machine and can program in both of them via gcc code blocks vim etc

1611186
boost	stl
sure it compiles but many issues will arise even with boost stl

1611187
put	get
you then select all the cells within this new column you can copy and paste into notepad or another text editor to save it as a plist file you may want to put some hardcoded text into a cell above and below your 200+ rows in order to get the required tags etc as well.

1611188
children	parent
make sure that the containing div is position relative to force it to become the offset parent which the position of the children are relative to edit in other words add the following rule

jar	war
so basically - i did jni project for the client where i will use such jar packaged within the war

1611370
cfstring	nsstring
the simple answer for why it s not simple is because nsstring and cfstring deal with all the complicated details of dealing with multiple character sets unicode etc etc while presenting a simple uniform api for manipulating strings

1611370
cfstring	nsstring
most of nsstring is actually implemented in with corefoundation cfstring so there s obviously a path from a cfstringref - -utf8string

1611370
cfstring	nsstring
but just because a cfstring says it s macroman cfstring encoding value of kcfstringencodingmacroman nsstring encoding value of nsmacosromanstringencoding doesn t mean that it has characters 128 in it

1611390
hide	show
instead of using offsets you can hide show the tabs with the display property

1611406
httpresponse	request
to try head you have to use the lower-level module httplib make a connection to the server call its request head url method call its getresponse to get an httpresponse object call the getheader method on the latter to get the content length header.

post	get
so for instance if i wanted to get the standard show route for post in my spec i had to change

1611602
min	max
i had defined my own min and max macros in my completely unrelated vector math files

1611602
min	max
the solution was to remove my macros and put std in front of the min and max calls

1611630
inline	inlining
no inlining for functions with loops is probably a bit of some inline heuristic from some particular compiler

1611661
for-loop	loops
it looks like the prompt is inside the while loops but outside the outermost for-loop

1611687
firefox	safari
i ve tested it on mac firefox and safari and windows ie firefox with the same results so i don t think it s the browser and the fields post fine if i disable the dialog box

1611776
multicastdelegate	delegation
how do you know that the delegation implements somemethod when delegation is a plain multicastdelegate

1611781
free	realloc
what will happen is if there isn t enough room for the expanded object the old object is still valid and isn t free but realloc returns null

1611828
pop-up	dialog
every time i try to run a wizard in access 2007 a dialog box pop-up saying the following

free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
for objects allocated with malloc or calloc you must use free

1612131
dlsym	dlopen
and instead of the windows loadlibrary getprocaddress and freelibrary there are dlopen dlsym and dlclose

1612135
g++	gcc
how do your makefiles access the compiler gcc g++ cc c++

1612154
free	malloc
for this reason it is wise to think of new delete malloc free etc

1612157
free	malloc
although it might seem in some logic way that you can mix new and free or delete instead of delete this is under the assumption about the compiler being a fairly simplistic that it will always use malloc to implement the memory allocation for new

1612185
int	chars
for primitive types such as chars int is there any difference between ..

1612222
getter	setter
all getter and setter are synchronized methods so i really shouldn t have any concurrency issues

1612251

also if your site needs the user to log in it s advisable to use https ssl

1612308
opera	safari
about safari and opera

opera	safari
i m not sure but safari 4 worked for me and opera 10 too

1612308

firefox 2.0 or 3.0 older safari or opera versions or google-chrome

1612312
jlabel	jseparator
instead you could use a jlabel with a jseparator there are examples in designgridlayout but this works with any other layoutmanager

1612335
jruby	mri

ubuntu	linux
right now i only need a solution for linux ubuntu but the system also has to run on windows

1612376

1612393
post	get
it seems that in order to get the validationsummary and validationmessage helpers to work i need the post action to be called the same as the get action index in this case

arch linux sets the documentroot to src http for both apache and lighttpd fyi

1612591
getter	setter
you can even use public attributes without getter and setter

getter	setter
the java-beanness of a pojo is that it s private attributes are all accessed via public getter and setter that conform to the javabeans conventions

1612614
button	checkbox
also note that radio button by default might look like checkbox square or circular but there should be a property attribute that you can adjust to make them look like button with pressed states

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in ib when using uitabbarcontroller which has multiple uiviewcontroller which all separately have their own nib file assigned there are two places where you need to set your uiviewcontroller class file

1612879
hide	show
or even include all of them in the application as mxml tags and use the visible property to show hide them

1612899
getter	setter
i think there is no need for the setter in the total property however the getter simply recalculate the sum for every call

1612920
ant	maven
finally another option would be to use maven instead of ant which has a built-in version management feature as pointed out by cetnar

1612935
jlist	jtable
if you want the jlist and the jtable to be displayed next to each other you have to addthem both to a jpanel before adding that to the scrollpane

1612968
hide	show
if you want to show the next div just after you finish hiding the previous one jquery gives you a callback in the hide method to do exactly that

1612968
hide	show
also your original show hide functions seem to think string.concat behaves like a java stringbuffer

1613006
free	malloc
memory on the heap which is obtained using malloc new will stay around until you delete it using free delete

1613031

our problem is we receive monthly updates to the core xml files and we re supposed to put them in place and upgrade our custom documents to line up with the new versioning of the base documents

1613077
post	get
i don t think that is your problem since you seems to post a windows message wm_paint from your thread what i wasn t doing in my case which should wake up the gui thread but maybe this can help you get in the right direction to solve your problem

1613131
folder	directory
it s possible the file retrieval may be fine but if you need to do any maintenance on the folder it would be a huge headache as processes attempt ot enumerate the directory listings

1613131
folder	directory
what would improve the situation would be a number of sub directory under the images folder or two levels depending on how many images you re looking at storing so you have a hierarchy like this

1613237
opera	safari
haven t tried opera or safari i ve found that asp renders the site without any javascript code for the validators nor does it render the site with any javascript code for the ajax methods that i call

1613271
maven	pom.xml
you can use maven for vesion and read it from pom.xml

1613278
ienumerable	ienumerator
correct me if i m wrong but the only difference is the difference between ienumerable and ienumerator and since you specifically said you re not asking the difference both are a good.

1613283
width	height
as stated in the discussion here you need to create another swf call it a that loads the swf you want to embed call it b and read the dimension of b using a s loader s contentloaderinfo to get the width and height of b

1613327
move	drag
this also meant looking at how far the mouse move before starting a drag - because clicking on a selected item to unselect it could sometimes result in it getting selected again if mouse bounce started a little drag operation

1613334
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchescancelled	touchesended
for some view and events like uitableview select you need to forward the touchesbegan event to nextresponder keep track of your gesture forward touchesmoved events to the nextresponder until you detect your gesture and when it s triggered you send a touchescancelled to the nextresponder and hide all other events from the next responder touchesended and touchescancelled until you receive touchesended or touchescancelled yourself

it s possible if you change the max and min this can affect the number generated

1613427
nginx	lighttpd
ps i also considered switching to nginx but given the current performance i can get and the even smaller user base of nginx i decided i would keep lighttpd

1613473
mouse	keyboard
well guess what install service pack 1 for vs 2008 and it would go away and if you have wireless mouse and keyboard turn it off

1613584
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
the function must work at least in latest versions of firefox opera safari and ie

1613683
swt	swing
bu tof course using good old swing or the more os agnostic swt does the trick as well

1613686
ant	maven
self-deployable since all the plugins are registered xml files the application must be self-deployable independent of the build system - of course there is an ant task and a maven mojo which are the links with the ourside world but in the end it calls the application and instruct it to self-deploy itself at a specific location

1613697
integer	unsigned
u stays for unsigned integer

1613707

getter	setter
this includes setter and getter of public properties

1613707

1613867
implements	extends
the issue appears is when i have a class implements an interface and extends a class which implements an interface

1613882

1613886
rss	feed
i have been asked to make this into and rss feed

i m trying to get an md5 hash of a value in coldfusion

1614196
hash	md5

1614871
lisp	scheme
many people feel that structure and interpretation of computer programs which uses the scheme dialect of lisp is a book that should be on every programmers shelf

1614872
getter	setter
and you might take it even further by defining even smaller methods -- getter setter and so forth

1614882
lisp	scheme
i ll stick to common lisp here though scheme is also a superb language that has a lot to recommend it

1614890
hash	salt
adding something per user that won t change i use email as this is the username for my sites and add a hash salt is a short constant string i change per site increases resistance to attacks

1614896
puts	gets
i m kind of shooting in the dark here as i m not familiar with icc but the idea is to make sure the linker puts thr s path on the runtime linker s search path before the one on the ramdisk so that thr gets found there first

1614914
accessor	properties
most importantly if accessing the properties ever evolves beyond simply returning the reference of a field certain actions in the properties accessor then clearly you do not want to chase all instances in your code where you dereferenced the properties before passing it into various methods

1614918
base	fractions
in base 2 1 10 is the infinitely repeating fractions

cpus can do subtraction and multiplication in 1 op whereas memory lookups if they miss the cache can take a couple orders of magnitude longer

1614978
lisp	scheme
the general lisp idea is the same for common lisp or scheme or emacs lisp or clojure but the specifics will be different - so keep that in mind if reading graham s book which focuses mostly on common lisp with some mentions of scheme specifics. on lisp is probably not the best beginner book but it s worth going through it and just skimming over specifics you re not ready to follow in detail yet to see what is there particularly with regard to macros which on lisp really explores

1614986
children	parent
visually you were able to distinguish the parent group from the children item by giving the children padding

unfortunately nms does not have support at least not yet for the queuebrowser api available in jms from java

1615127
width	height
when i try to do the same with css the div collapses to the size of the content rather than then height width specified

1615141
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
add padding and margin otherwise the browser ignores the height and width

1615145
single-quotes	double-quotes
also did you try enclosing the statement in single-quotes instead of the double-quotes you are using now

1615158
cvs	rcs
cvs is a system that is layered ontop of rcs to extend the functionality to a bunch of files ie a project

1615247

1615585
width	height
do elements before they are part of the dom have the width and height set properly

1615585
width	height
ie if i create a div containing markup can i measure its intended width and height without appending it to the dom

1615629
superclass	subclassing
this class may be great but it is not the superclass of uiviewcontroller it is a subclassing

1615629
inherited	subclassing
yes your subclassing of this subclassing will inherited all of the methods and capabilities of superviewcontroller so there is nothing in the very little which you have shown which is incorrect as far as that goes

1616348
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i get the utility when used with nsmutablestring i just didn t see the utility with the nsstring class

1616352
children	parent
build up a list of nodes at the root level 0 iterate over each node in turn and look for direct children whose parent node is the node we are currently looking from level 1 when finished with level 0 move on to iterating level 1 and so on until you have no remaining unvisited nodes

1616367
children	parent
if you start at the root node and only visit the parent children of nodes you have already visited there is no way to traverse the tree such that you visit a node before visiting its ancestors

1616374
put	get
data structure alignment along with many of the other issues you put up for discussion are deeply buried in historical compiler science and are likely to get you awash in who knows what

1616374
pascal	delphi
pascal delphi and now java and php

1616375
children	parent
if you have links to all children and to the parent as well then non-recursive algorithm is rather trivial

1616375
children	parent
if you start from the root junction and move in any direction you ll walk the entire tree always visiting parent before children

1616406
cpu	processors
because the sleep is basically telling the processors to switch contexts and let some other programs get more cpu time

1617105
serializable	deserialization
i naã vely tried xstream to serializable a simple object created in jython and translated to java with pyobject s __tojava__ method but the result was expectedly pretty much gibberish because of xstream s heavy use of reflection it finds all jython s internals - and deserialization doesn t work maybe because of jython s dynamically loaded proxy classes or some other implementation details that i m really not familiar with.

1617126

quicksort	heapsort
by comparison comparing strings sorted using heapsort or quicksort would be o nlogn on average with o n space where n is the larger string s length

1617194
quicksort	heapsort
three if you include the short circuit associated with range reduction. so ultimately it boils down to whether a quicksort heapsort or a radix sort would be better

1617261
int	boolean
example joel s answers passes int 1 or 0 to the client where you d arguably expect bit boolean

1617265
hash	salt
of course since you d obviously be hashing the password with salt and storing just the hash you couldn t know the actual length anyway

now during your presentation loop you iterate through your array to get the blog post so functions such as count will also give you the number of blog entries and when you display each entry you just iterate through the comments element

1617930
width	height
like i said i doubt it will make any difference because i m sure that drawimage checks the width and height of the bitmap and if there s no resizing needed just calls this overload

i had to use javascript to hide the dropdownlist s and when the user hover out of the menu i ll show the dropdownlist s again

1617989
cpu	processors
i wonder if your fundamental problem is simply that your worker threads are very cpu intensive and hence rarely reach a point where they would naturally let go of the processors for example by doing some io or sleeping. if such is the case then you might include some calls to yield in those workers hence giving other threads more of a chance

1618019
vim	emacs
i don t know about emacs but i would recommend learning vim for a beginner in a heartbeat

1618025
cvs	svn	tortoisegit	svn
this is the first time im trying to use github and i just installed tortoisegit im used to svn and cvs where you could just take a folder you wanted to checkout but it seems git only got a .git file in the root folder so im not sure what to do

1618029
width	height
if you create an html element with a fixed width and height then yes - you can know the width and height

1618029

however if you don t specify them or they might not be obeyed then the width and height are always going to be calculated by the contextual position of the fragment in the dom

1618244
integer	unsigned
further originally had size_t an unsigned integer type being compared for values less than zero

1618274
jobs	cron
are not executed before cron jobs so a lot of environment variables that you normaly have in the command line will be missing

1618274
jobs	cron
regarding input and output there is obviously no user interaction for cron jobs so the programs should not expect input if they do provide it from an input file or directly in the script and any output should be redirected into a log file

1618276
postgresql	mysql
i don t believe that there s any silver bullet tool that would convert all of your queries from being mysql to postgresql compatible

1618290
public	protected
you will only have access to public and protected classes and methods however unit testing usually only tests public apis

1618562
min	max
the basic premise is that i m getting the duration of time between the first and last session of the target courseid and then i m subtracting the duration of any sessions that were not of the specified courseid but where the session request time fell within the min and max request times of the targeted courseid

1618571

1618597
versioning	upgrade
when they upgrade my application supports upgrade from any previous versioning

1618597
versioning	upgrade
so at versioning 5.1 the default was foo in 5.2 the default is bar and that is the only difference between the two versioning and the upgrade step is simply an update statement followed of course by the versioning metadata change ie

1618597
versioning	upgrade
to repro a customer complaint simply by running the upgrade sequence and stopping at the versioning i m interested in

1618597
versioning	upgrade
because the latest versioning of foo might have been upgrade 2 or 3 versioning ago and it wasn t changed since i need to look at the upgrade script for that versioning

1618599
trac	mantis
you can import your mantis bugs into trac with mantis2trac

1618621
udp	tcp
essentially you d have to build some overhead on top of udp to check what packets have been received tagging each packet with a unique id -- everybody who s tried to go this route will agree that more often than not you find yourself more or less duplicating the tcp streaming infrastructure on top of udp.

1618622
udp	tcp
once you ve decided which one to use you can write a server process the console application that listen to a specific port tcp or udp port depending on what you ve chosen that will serve your client process the asp.net application

mouse	keyboard
i m writing a 2d game in java and i have a problem with input events mouse keyboard not firing when they should

1619492
mouse	keyboard
there appears to be a delay up to several seconds occasionally between any mouse or keyboard event occurring and the jvm picking it up - initially i thought it may be the event dispatch thread not getting enough time despite the framerate sleep - i tested this by adding a custom event containing a frame token and waiting for it on frame end but it fires when expected - it should only do so after all other prior events have fired which suggests to me it s an x-windows-to-jdk problem as opposed to one internally within the jdk

1619502
hash	salt
adding something per user that won t change i use email as this is the username for my sites and add a hash salt is a short constant string i change per site increases resistance to attacks

1619530

png better compression ratios than gif some issues on some browsers like transparency on ie6

1619742
gif	png
of these gif is probably the least and png the most due to the compression algorithm with jpg in the middle

1619749
gif	png
if you have more than 256 colors then you will need png but if you are using less than that then why not just use gif and get the advantage of support across more browsers if that is an issue

if i include the source files where is the normal location for writing them on the users system for linux and osx i thought usr local src but on my ubuntu machine supposedly chock-full of open source apps this directory is empty

1620905
inherited	properties
if you begin thinking about classes as fulfilling roles rather than just being a bundle of methods and properties then you can begin assigning multiple roles to classes using interfaces - which is not possible using straight inherited in c# as you can only inherited from a single class

1620975
equals	gethashcode
when you implement you must implement gethashcode so that any two equals objects have the same hashcode

1620989
websphere	ibm
it was my impression that it was licensed only as part of another ibm product like websphere mq or one of the rational tools which would mean you would have to license the other product on the machine before installing the jre and you would use the installer for the other produce to get the jre onto the machine

1621108
hash	md5
the next step up from that is digest authentication which doesn t require ssl because the username password are sent using an md5 hash

i would like to capture stderr and stdout separately in tk tcl

1621222
maven	pom.xml

1621730
lxml	beautifulsoup
the most popular in python is beautifulsoup and indeed lxml comes with it -- with lxml 2.0.3 or later you can use beautifulsoup as the underlying parser then proceed just as if the document had parsed correctly -- but i find it simpler to use beautifulsoup directly

1621730
lxml	beautifulsoup
the logic in lxml or beautifulsoup in lxml clothing is not very different just the spelling and capitalization of the various navigational operations changes a bit

1621739
sproutcore	cappuccino

1622239
width	height
as this inherits from window you can set the height and width on this container

1622271
client-side	server-side
the client however only has the xsd xml schema file exposed by your service at its disposal - it will create a client-side class that has the same data signature on the wire - the same fields by the same name and type - but it cannot magically recreate any functions and or methods your server-side code has

1622291
gif	png
it may just be the tools i m using but gif files usually seem to be a bit smaller than a comparible png but using them just seems so 1987.

1622298

having read this question on generating getter and setter in visual studio and tried somewhat the techniques described i have failed miserably to graduate beyond the longhand way of writing getter and setter

rdf	owl
if these relationships are expressible as rdf and owl you can use a tool with a sparql endpoint such as jena or a reasoner such as pellet

1622500
javadb	hsqldb
in java for example you could use an in-memory database like hsqldb javadb and use the featuers of that

1622525
getter	setter
i realize this goes against the rule of thumb that data should be encapsulated privately with getter and setter so that if the design of the class changes users of the class are immune to the changes

1622578
soappy	suds
actually by just changing the library from suds to soappy everything started working with no other modifications

1622578

g++	gcc
the gnu compiler collection which includes gcc and g++ are a prime example of a portable cross compiler with hundreds of supported cpu types

1622650
x86	64bit
for example gcc can be configured in this manner so that i can run the compiler on a 32-bit x86 system but produce 64bit code for an x64 system and that s just the tip of the iceberg

1622651
serializable	deserialization
you need two steps - serializable deserialization which converts an object to a representation which can be stored on disk

well for mouse keyboard events on the page s dom or the window you can detect

1623156
super	abstract
working from collections s abstract classes as kaizer.se suggests is the appropriate solution in 2.6 not sure why you want to call super -- what functionality are you trying to delegate that can t best done by containment rather than inheritance

1623159
post	get
the problem was that my form tag had no way to know that it was supposed to be post so it always defaulted to get

1623185

1623398
queue	fifo
a and many other searching algorithms use a priority queue instead of a fifo queue

1623414

google-chrome	firefox
happens in google-chrome and firefox haven t tried ie but i expect the same

1623486

just as an alternative i d use closest and find instead of parent and children respectively i think it s more a matter of preference though

then declare getter and setter for your property

1624385
touchesbegan	touchesended
you can enable nstimer on touchesbegan withevent and disable it on touchesended withevent

1624420
public	protected
i don t know why it s protected but by extending the menubar class and make it public you should be able to use it

1624465
getter	setter
there is any way to define setter and getter for the same property on different hierarchy on interfaces

1624509
tcpdf	fpdf
gd and the various pdf libraries fpdf is quite well known and used ufpdf and tcpdf are alternatives to manage unicode chars are more like drawing libraries they don t handle html rendering you have to position the characters specify their style etc

1624545
dxcore	coderush
they talk about building on top of dxcore which is the base that coderush is built on

1624588
client-side	server-side
you can then parse the contents of that out and redirect to whatever is needed with server.transfer not response.redirect because you want a seamless server-side redirect and not a client-side redirect

1624602
floor	sqrt
the following computes floor sqrt n for n 0

1624602
floor	sqrt
to round to the nearest integer just compute t floor sqrt 4n using the algorithm above

1624627
rss	feed
the reason it seems to work is that ie has a builtin transform to html for rss feed as does safari so they convert the rss into something more human friendly

1624653
cells	tablecell
still having problem with tablecell i guess when using touch begin and end user may move his finger so that means user may have moved from one cells to another

1624663
int	double
of course fvalue may end up being a string an int a double etc

1624677
awt	swing
it has two standard ui toolkits out-of-box obsolete awt and more modern swing

1624678
vmware	virtualbox
can android os that is installed on actual devices be emulated in vmware or virtualbox

1624744
free	malloc
this means that lock contention can be reduced since while multiple threads may call malloc or free concurrently they ll only contend if they share the same arena

1624744
disk	ram
in addition jemalloc tries to optimise for cache locality since the act of fetching data from ram is much slower than using data already in the cpu caches no different in concept to the difference between fast fetching from ram versus slow fetching from disk

1624774
entity-relationship	diagram
the data analysis results in a conceptual model of the data often expressed in the form of an entity-relationship diagram and or model

1624819
rss	feed
imo this is an incredible tool - you take an rss feed and pipe it through some filters

1624895
onkeyup	onmouseup
except for onkeyup try handling onmouseup too

1624895
onfocus	onmouseup
edit apparently onmouseup only triggers if the mouse button was clicked in the input-box too but onfocus should trigger when the input-box receives focus when you re dropping the text

1624938
floating-point	integer
a 32-bit integer or a thousand-digit floating-point

1624954

how can i get firefox to follow the ie opera behaviour whereby if a new line is added the textarea automatically scrolls down so that it can be seen whether or not scrollbars are displayed

1624960
interbase	firebird
it comes with drivers for 11 different databases mysql ms sql firebird interbase ibm db2 oracle etc + you can get drivers for any database you want

1624965
firefox	safari
in ie8 firefox safari etc this is working fine but in ie7 at the moment specifically on windows xp can t really test on vista 7 at the moment the maps seem to steal the focus and scrolls the page down

1624998
dictionary	map
if you define your forms this way in templates you cannot map it to a dictionary directly

1625007

you forgot to add the unit to the width height value

1625028
post	get
i know get and post which used to get or post data to from the server

1625036
width	height
height and width properties require a unit either or px

1625045
getchar	fgetc
the problem is there are no standard library functions that detect individual keystrokes getchar and fgetc are buffered and require you to hit enter before they return

1625059
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest is a style of programmatic interaction which uses standard http methods such as get post and put

1625065
put	get
delete get put are some of the methods defined as part of the http spec

1625071
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest is not a valid http command those are limited to get post put options head and delete trace and connect at least in http 1.1

1625098
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
i ve tried to play with nscalendar nsdate and nsdatecomponents but it seems that i can t just check calendar s firstweekday as there might be weeks with days from previous next month

table1 box id height width length weight

1625134
firefox	safari
i am using this jquery function that works fine in win mac firefox 3.5 and safari

1625142
hide	show
if you don t have the information available at the outline scope to determine what links to hide and show then you ll have to find a way to fail gracefully when a file does not exist

1625154
post	get
then you could think about how those objects will interact with each other for example a post object may contain an array of comment objects and how they will handle the basic crud create read get update delete operations

1625189
folder	directory
i m assuming the following the jar file in your lib directory contains java sources has a gwt.xml file has a client folder next to the gwt.xml file and is for the client side of your project

1625198
firefox	safari
basically it wont work in ie in firefox and safari it works perfect

1625205
post	get
you want to use the jquery ajax functions either post or get to make a request to your server

1625222
int	chars
here a major flaw in php occurs since strings have offsets that can be accessed using the bracket notation in order to extract single chars php will silently convert count to an int

1625225
gif	png
you cannot create a graphics from an indexed image format png gif ...

1625263
filewriter	bufferedwriter
using a bufferedwriter is recommended for an expensive writer such as filewriter

1625263
printwriter	bufferedwriter
but the bufferedwriter and printwriter wrappers are not strictly necessary

1625267
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox has firebug but all other major browsers ie google-chrome safari also have debugging tools built-in that you should check

1625268
opera	google-chrome
opera has opera dragonfly and google-chrome also has something called developer tools shift+ctrl+j

1625290
width	margin
you need to put a div with a fixed with your desired page width and put its margin 0 auto

1625329
width	height
i m trying to make a fixed width fixed height box that mimics overflow scroll but the scroll bar is actually the widow scrollbar or a pseudo-window scrollbar

1625371
tortoisegit	svn
i know that each thing that will be inserted in the system contains the word svn so with tortoisegit that would be git

1625375
portrait	landscape
since the transition changes when the device changes orientation i presume there is a way to fool the device to use the landscape transition in portrait mode and vice versa

1625382
mousemove	mouseout	mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mousemove	keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown	keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown

1625382
mouseleave	mouseenter
currently not supported blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change submit

1625402
post	put
this is arguably more deescriptive than the post and should follow the http specification for put

1625416
collabnet	svn
slik svn is a nice build and doesn t require a registration like collabnet

1625431
jobs	cron
i think you could use cron jobs

1625443
folder	directory
do not use server.map path but the full name to the folder such as myserver sharename directory + filename

1625463
children	parent
i have a nested unsorted list and i want to place a click event on the parent checkbox so when it is check it checks all the children checkboxes and vice versa

1625504
slideup	slidedown
there s other effects you can use too like slideup slidedown so you may want to look into those too

1625542
imperative	declarative
they support both declarative and imperative models of defining dependencies and are quite good at what they do

1625550
try-catch	exception-handling
i guess i can always wrap that code in a try-catch block but when the exception-handling occurs i won t know if it is a legitimate exception-handling or one caused by this weird condition

1625607
hash	hmac
each object will contain a property called hmac that will contain a hash of the object s values itself but excluding the hmac field

1625662
bazaar	git
git subversion bazaar and mercurial are all supported

1625674
children	parent
as you pointed out you can use the pluginmanagement in the parent pom for the configuration of the plugin but if you really want to execute a plugin goal in children modules and not in the parent you might have good reasons to do this but most of time plugins won t have much effet on a module with a pom packaging that doesn t have any content you ll have to reference plugins in the plugins element in the children

1625691
button	checkbox
i m struggling to do multi-select for deletion not checkbox just the standard - delete button

1625805
firefox	safari
if it detects internet explorer it raises an error however it works fine in firefox and safari

1625813
width	height
and of course if you re using flash the application you can just click the stage and then go to the properties panel and set the width height and background color

1625818
button	checkbox
the only way to implement this properly is to have checkbox and a delete button in a toolbar like mail etc

1625869
int	double
the cast to result was enough for my needs int + double double + double double

1625876
public	protected
every public or protected method and property from class a is available in class b

1625974
decltype	auto
i d use the c++ 0x decltype and the new definition of auto

1625974
decltype	auto
in particular you can use decltype auto to deduce the correct return type instead of having to specify it explicitly

1625977
internationalization	globalization
if internationalization is not on the horizon turn off globalization rules

1626004
google-chrome	firefox
problem quick demo how it works in firefox and doesn t in ie and google-chrome

1626085
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but when i use other browser opera firefox safari google-chrome i get this

1626085
children	parent
this is not coolâ i want the parent #wrapper element s height to get the bigger height of the two children

1626122
width	margin
the ie box model actually works the way you would want once you declare the width of an element that s the width and then it subtracts from the inner width of the element the padding margin and border to give you the declared width

1626122
width	margin
all of the other browsers do the opposite they set the element width to the declared width and then add the margin padding and border

1626136
post	get
the form values will be available in either the _post variable or the _get variable depending on how you submitted the form whether the mode attribute of your html form tag was set to post or get

1626137
boost	stl
also i think stl and or boost has a foreach method

1626150
setinterval	settimeout
if the issue is that you don t know how to get the page to poll the server every x seconds you can do this with javascript using settimeout function milliseconds and setinterval function milliseconds

1626275
onfocus	onblur
to accomplish that you can use the two events onfocus and onblur

1626288
hash	salt
one simple approach would be to compute the sha-1 hash of the customer name plus some hard-coded salt

1626307
spaces	delimiter
both these productions are defined as containing multiple values of the appropriate type delimiter by spaces

1626309
int	chars
int coded chars

1626360
cvs	svn
i was wondering how databases are managed in open source projects which are usually hosted in repositories like cvs or svn

1626428
post	get
now if you don t need to use get in the result form just change the method to post and it will work fine

1626497
mouseleave	mouseenter
it might be that having something like mouseenter mouseleave events would solve this but they re not yet in a w3c recommendation

1626497
mouseleave	mouseenter
edit to be clear mouseenter and mouseleave are in the dom level 3 events working draft

1626532
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout instead of setinterval

1626605
post	get
additional steps may be needed to get nant to recognize the sdk please refer to this page brook s blog post

1626607
textblock	itemscontrol
since the ivalueconverter suggestion did not work due to the xpath engine doing a pre-coercion here s what i suggest you do instead of binding to a single textblock bind to an itemscontrol instead and define the itemtemplate for the itemscontrol to be as follows

1626724
int	chars
you can get the unicode values as int making up the string via string.codepointat or get the chars via charat followed by a getnumericvalue for each chars

1626738
width	height
since you re using a background image a for the button give the button a height and width otherwise it will display as a small gray blip because there are no words on the button

1626740
post	get
in the 2nd post of the thread he mentions registry entries that he deleted to get it to work msdn help corrupt or missing

1626770
put	get
if you put those two together you ll get something that s unique for the moment but is subject to change at any time

1626787
division	multiplication
at least multiplication and division of several rows would be easy

1626837
post	get
however it may be more flexible to initiate an execution via a post get a receipt a number id whatever and then perform a get using that 5 mins later and perhaps retry given that your procedure won t take exactly 5 mins every time

1626882
post	put	post	get	put	get
try loading the path inside of another page if you re using get put the variables into the string if you re using post try posting synchronously with a test form

1626911
post	get
here is a yahoo page that gives you code examples to do rest get post and so on in vb.net

1626930
children	parent
you can create a virtual method hook in the parent class which can later be overridden by children

1626940
post	get
if anyone decides to add the handling for generics and arrays please send me an updated copy so i can post it back on my blog and you ll get an honorable mention

1626954
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the easiest way would be to use a objectinputstream objectoutputstream on client server side and then the client trying a read from the stream

1626966
children	parent
so the methods that the children must have are declared in the parent but not implemented

1626969
outputstream	inputstream
send the data using the connections inputstream and outputstream

1626983
persistent	transient
but when i try to persistent the entity with this field s value null an undeclaredthrowableexception caused by invocationtargetexception caused by propertyvalueexception not-null property references a null or transient value exception is raised because system is trying to hit the database with null value on a non-nullable field

1626995
paredit	slime
as a newbie at emacs slime swank paredit clojure and clojure box i m not even sure where to start

1627047
awt	swing
the first thing you need to know is are you trying to create an applet using awt or swing components

1627047
awt	swing
you import the swing classes but are using awt components

1627072
antialiasing	transparent
the way i fixed it was to open up the png in gimp choose the fuzzy select tool set the threshold to 150 check antialiasing uncheck feather edges check select transparent areas

1627109
client-side	server-side
you can write server-side or client-side hooks with c#

1627147

i m trying to find make a good jquery drop-down menu with animation fadein fadeout or slidedown that activates on hover not click

1627206
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
obliterate all html tags using htmlspecialchars and only preserve newlines with nl2br

1627209
mouse	keyboard
some keyboard actions will dump you back to the main window then it s alt-tab or fiddle with the mouse to get back

1627212
antialiasing	transparent
note on my fuzzy select tool my gimp settings were check antialiasing uncheck feather edges check select transparent areas uncheck sample merged and select by composite

1627212
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
none of the other browsers -- opera safari firefox google-chrome -- have this issue

1627255
width	height
you have to resize your object tag as well i just had the same problem i had signed the onsizechanged event and changed the height and width of the container div however in ie6 that didn t worked so a co-worker told me that in ie6 you need to resize the object as well so place an id on your tag and use it on this

1627343
webrat	cucumber
i m just getting started with cucumber and webrat and am adding feature specifications to an existing rails application

1627343
webrat	cucumber
is there any way to specify one of these fields in webrat or should i just give up and try cucumber on a different project

1627349
getter	setter
in general i like to leave properties defined in the interface as properties rather than breaking them out into their getter and setter

1627350
put	get
when i put this into sql management studio and run it i get the following error message

1627372
opera	firefox
opera has another extension mechanism - userjs - which is javascript ran on every page similar to greasemonkey in firefox

1627389
children	parent
when i need to redraw the canvas i would like to sort the shapes to draw so that the parent appear before their children

1627435
folder	directory
there are two separate things the directory that are source folder and the versioning

1627435
folder	directory
there is the .classpath file in the project root that defines which directory are source folder

1627453
children	parent
create a single root representing the entire screen and give parent pointers to their children

1627453
children	parent
just add a my.root add pointers from parent to children and traverse

1627467
hide	show
i can use simple show hide script to get the paragraph from the first div to show and hide properly but once i add more image divs to the mix the code either opens only the first image s or all the at once

1627509
hide	show
since the jquery show hide functions alter the element.style and not

1627518
inherited	properties
as a workaround you can use the designer to create a none generic usercontrol with a public type properties and then create a generic class that inherited from it and passes t into the base classes type properties

1627521
setinterval	settimeout
what i intended with this method was to have a delay using setinterval or settimeout however that makes the whole script fail pretty badly

1627531
webstorm	aptana
if you re focussing on pure client code then i find webstorm to be an excellent javascript html ide - even better than aptana

1627582
post	get
get requests work fine post requests break immediately with the following log entry

1627624
fgets	fgetc	fgets	fread	fgetc	fread
i have done some research on file operations in c and it seems that i can read one character at the time with fgetc like i do in my code one line with fgets and one block with fread but no word as i guess would be perfect in my situation

1627637
g++	gcc
pass -wl -e to gcc or g++ to link the executable this will allow the executable to export symbols in reverse

1627643
cvs	svn
if i can get this going i can see a potential mass migration from svn cvs to git

1627653
int	chars	getchar	fgetc
remember fgetc getc getchar all return an int not a chars

1627653
int	chars
the int might be eof or a valid chars - but it returns one more value than the range supported by the chars type

1627653
knuth-morris-pratt	rabin-karp	boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt	boyer-moore	rabin-karp
this might be a modification of a search algorithm such as boyer-moore or knuth-morris-pratt added or rabin-karp which is designed for parallel searching for multiple strings

1627660
superclass	subclassing
i m trying to invoke a method that takes a superclass as a parameter with subclassing in the instance

1627689
spaces	delimiter
the key difference here is that the search term is just a fragment of the column content that need not be delimiter by any special characters or white spaces

1627689
spaces	delimiter
basically you just pass on which of the available indexes you want to query and the search terms fragments spaces delimiter

1627689
jtextfield	jtable
but the results are fantastic i currently have a sample data set of approximately 500.000 records with 8 columns indexed and my test application triggers a search across all 8 columns for the contents of a jtextfield on every keystroke while being edited and can update the results display jtable in real-time

1627692
onchange	onfocus	onchange	onblur	onfocus	onblur
or i need to do the onfocus save value onblur compare and possibly call onchange but only if onchange was not already called because the user just navigated away by clicking vs say a keyboard trigger

1627696
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
normally you won t have a uinavigationcontroller be part of your uiviewcontroller xib

1627719
jtextfield	jlabel
say i have a jpanel which contains a jlabel and a jtextfield

1627719
jtextfield	jlabel
i want jlabel to be drawn on the left-most side of jpanel and jtextfield to be drawn on the right-most side of jpanel

1627724
setinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	clearinterval	settimeout
yes you do need to use a settimeout or setinterval clearinterval

1627736
put	get
if you have a separate thread running that downloads the uiimage you can just tell your uiimageview s to observe that property and when your downloader class is finished downloading all the data and has put it into the property the views will get a notification and can then display the image

1627743
subnet	packets
given that these machines are on the same subnet there is no router in the way which could be dropping packets

1627754
hide	show
instead of using hide and show could you use the showintaskbar property of the form instead

1627754
hide	show
set it to false where you use hide and true where you currently use show and see if that makes any difference

1627764
nstimer	nsrunloop
i ve also thought about creating a separate thread nsrunloop to run a nstimer second-counter keeping it away from ui interactions

1627764
nstimer	nsrunloop
also i m not sure if this would work accurately in the event the cpu gets pegged by another application photoshop rendering a large image etc... causing my nsrunloop to be put on hold for long enough to mess up its nstimer

1627790
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this plugin works great in firefox google-chrome and safari

1627831
post	get
something you expected from a session could be set with a get post or a cookie variable

1627855
redmine	trac
do you know a good alternative to redmine or trac which allows such a feature

1627897
client-side	server-side
the tag will fire events 1 per file on both the client-side and server-side django signal to indicate when an incoming file has been received

1627904
int	chars
main int argc chars argv

1627919
folder	directory
a folder directory structure containing mostly media files that need to be presented in a silverlight app

1627933
hash	salt
hash it one of the sha algorithms preferably with some salt and store the hash

1627961
visualvm	jstat
in visualvm add new remote connection and specify remote as host and the port for jstat 1099 for default or what you specified with -p when running jstat

1627971
lisp	scheme
note that macros in clojure work very similar to common lisp macros a type-2 lisp and not quite-so-much-like scheme macros

1627994
post	get
quoting jeff atwood in the excellent get your database under version control post

1628018
multiplying	add
to go the other way do the reverse add the offset seconds to the time_t value then scale it multiplying by 10 000 000 to get ticks

1628031
profiling	benchmarking
is there a good methodology for logging benchmarking profiling a gwt application to identify bottlenecks

1628034
put	get
my problem is that when i put a number and i press the button for some reason that i dont understand i can get that number

1628061
trie	tree
we return a new tree with this bitword merged in along with true if we had to add subtrees at some point the bitword was not in the trie already and false otherwise

1628113
division	modulo	division	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
most calculations with infinity will yield infinity unless both operands are infinity when the operation division or modulo or with multiplication with zero there are some special rules to keep in mind

1628141
passenger	webrick
i have an application in rails+mysql and i want to run this with apache + passenger i have both installed but when i run . script server my app starts running with webrick how do i change it for work with passenger and apache

1628166
post	get
i am running iis7 and am trying to get my japanese blog going like it should and have domain.com ãƒ ã ¹ãƒˆ show just that one post when you visit that url

1628222
min	max
i am a python newbie and i am not sure why python implemented len obj max obj and min obj as a static like functions i am from the java language over obj.len obj.max and obj.min

1628230
post	get
if you have the ajax use get rather than post this is simpler then you can test the response by just viewing the page with the appropriate query string

1628241
mp3	wav
if you ask if a uncompressed wav which contains pcm data is better than mp3 then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data

1628257
g++	gcc
note compiled with g++ -c file.cpp gcc 4.2.4 luabind 0.7 and also 0.9 pre-release on linux

1628287
min	max
max and min are the oddbal exceptions

1628295
hash	salt
encrypting isn t a good idea - salt hash the password to do a one-way thing

1628318
min	max
on the other hand min and max do work on iterators which gives them a use apart from any particular object

1628318
min	max
if a container is sorted on the same key that you re searching min max are o 1 operations instead of o n and the only way to expose that is by a different inconsistent method

1628318
min	max
you can t do that with min max or len though since they re not methods of the object they operate on

1628360
rsa	dsa
it uses rsa but it should be quite simple to switch over to dsa

1628379
dictionary	map
given a dictionary of words calculate the numeric strings that would be generated and store this data into a map dictionary structure table 85 hi

1628408
uiview	subviews
so overriding drawrect in my container uiview will only draw below the subviews

1628408
uiview	subviews
note yes it would have been smarter to have the uiview be the subviews of the uiimageview but unfortunately i m committed to my mistake now.

inherited	subclassing
we have is-a extends derives subclassing and simply inherited

1628509
inherited	subclassing
i most often uses a subclassing b very direct or a inherited from b modestly more circumlocutory

1628509
inherited	subclassing
is-a is a relationship constraint that inherited must respect liskov s principle and holds between instances left side and classes right side -- so you can say x is-a foo when x is an instance of foo or any subclassing of foo but bar is-a foo where they re both classes seems wrong it would cause confusion in languages where classes are also instances of meta classes such as python

1628514
inherited	subclassing
i like to say derived because it strongly implies the class subclassing relationship but would be reasonably accurate in the more exotic cases like multiple inherited interface implementation and mixins

1628517
folder	directory
ideally reusable apps should be outside of your project directory anyway so consider creating a folder such as etc django lib to contain reusable apps and appending that to sys.path in your wsgi handler too

1628519
fiddler	pac
you should find that fiddler now registers as the system proxy using a simple pac script rather than manually specifying 127.0.0.1 8888

1628524
outputstream	inputstream
properties.store uses an outputstream and properties.load uses an inputstream which you could probably subclass to filter the unicode escapes but that seems an awful lot of work for what looks like dubious benefit

1628549
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i don t quite follow what navigation problem you re having but if there s no navigation bar when you need one i suspect you need to create and add a uinavigationcontroller somewhere that you re adding a uiviewcontroller subclass

1628551
tinyint	varchar
i think that varchar 1 and varchar 50 is the same memory size if value is a i thought it s the same with int and tinyint according to the answers i understand it s not is it

inherited	subclassing
a subclassing b - inherited isn t restricted to just classes

1628666

my preferred terminology is subclasses or extends for classes and implements for interfaces

1628680
post	get
since rest is the application of the same methods of the http protocol to the design of client-server architectures and php is already so good to handle http protocol requests such as get and post

1628680
post	get
edit replaced php is rest by default with since rest is the application of the same methods of the http protocol to the design of client-server architectures and php is already so good to handle http protocol requests such as get and post

git is decentralized where you can use any given copy of the project as a repository to push or pull commits

1629172
kde	gnome
i d like to use the most canonical way to find icons mime-type file type descriptions and associated applications on both kde and gnome and i d like to avoid any shelling out to the command line and low-level routines as well as avoiding re-inventing the wheel myself no parsing the mime-types file and such

1629172
kde	gnome
i don t care about qt in particular any more i m just looking for the most cannonical way to find the mime type via c++ c function calls on both kde and gnome especially gnome since that s where things confuse me most

1629172
kde	gnome
i want to be able show icons and descriptions matching nautilus in gnome and konquerer whatever on kde as well as opening files appropriately etc

realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
i m trying to implement my own version of a dynamic memory allocator with my own versions of malloc free and realloc ...there are four methods used to keep track of free blocks in a dynamic memory allocator the first one of these which i have here is an implicit list which uses a header

1629406
int	double
that is i want to make all calls to getglobal t where t is not an int or a double an error

1629414
realloc	malloc
a naive way of solving realloc would be to have realloc call you malloc function and just copy the data but i guess you re looking for a more sophisticated solution

1629469
kde	gnome
consider you can have a different icon in gnome in kde and in windows

1629480
accessor	properties
i would first consolidate to a single accessor for the properties

1629523
strlen	strcpy
you probably just need to include the header that contains the strcpy and strlen library functions

1629534
ssl	https
the ability to call https from your code hosted on iis doesn t involves iis ssl settings

1629582
udp	tcp
is it possible to determine whether google talk uses tcp or udp packets for transmission

1629582
udp	tcp
i know it uses the xmpp protocol at the application layer but does it run over tcp or udp

accessor	properties
any identifier that holds a reference to the global object can be used to the left of the square brackets to form a properties accessor that refers to a global variable

1629657
testcase	fixture
testcase class per fixture

1629679
implements	extends
the trick here is that you need to create a new authenicationtoken maybe extends usernameandpasswordauthenicationtoken and as emills says you need to then implements a new authenciationprocessingfilter to map the request values to the token and submit these to the authenicationmanager

1629681
domxpath	domdocument
you are much better off using simplexml or domdocument with domxpath

1629723
post	get
if not try to post what you have done so far and what errors you get

1629725
persistent	transient
the book xunit test patterns describe the term fixture which basically can be described as the entire context in which each test case executes including persistent and transient data

1629882
vb.net	vb6
vb.net might be easier to learn if you come from a pure vb6 background but i ve found most web developers with a bit of js experience can pick up the c# syntax easily enough

1629915
width	height
what i have to do is upload some images to a server which is ok but before uploading i must downsize this images by reducing their quality and width height

1629958
jar	war
ideally jar + war that can be dropped into the project and support everything off-the-shelf

1630038
hide	show
if this is about the scrollbars you mentioned that in your comment you can hide show them using stylesheets - try the following

1630095
allocator	stl
the stl allocator design makes it difficult to do this

1630095
allocator	stl
some stl containers have a constructor that lets you pass an instance of an allocator but not all containers support this

1630189
int	double
or does the compiler automatically convert the int literal to a double

1630228
int	double
the compiler will implicitly convert the int to a double

1630238
spoofing	traffic
otherwise anyone spoofing your service could use any certificate made out to an arbitrary domain machine name and get your traffic - not what you want

1630243
listview	gridview
i do google search asp.net offer gridview and listview but they all require a datasource which mean that table directly bind to the database

1630272
ironruby	ironpython
that said i routinely use ironpython and ironruby on production projects

1630290
versioning	upgrade
additionally the jet mdb database has the added feature of being very easy to later upgrade to a microsoft sql server - either their embedded free versioning or a full licensed server

it s working fine in firefox google-chrome safari ie8 almost

1630381
sml	prolog	lisp	prolog	lisp	sml	ocaml	prolog	ocaml	sml
production compilers are often written in c or c++ for performance reasons but languages such as ocaml sml prolog and lisp are arguably better for prototyping the language

1630381
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
there are ports for other languages such as ocamllex ocamlyacc and many other similar tools.

1630395
gridview	objectdatasource
my advice is to use a gridview with which you can use an objectdatasource which can take its underlying data from a class method that you specify

1630469
folder	dir
from outlook files are opened to a temp dir on your drive you could check to see if its in that folder vba source as follows

1630506
hide	show
put both levels in the same pane indenting the subordinate objects under each superordinate object and usually providing controls to hide and show the subordinate objects for each superordinate object

1630591
ilist	icollection
arrays of t are assignable to icollection of t as an array of t implements ilist of t

1630591
ilist	icollection
ilist of t itself extends icollection of t so you can simply assign an array to an icollection

1630620
width	height
try to set the width and height of dummy_tabs2 before dolayout

1630671
ant	maven
i have built a script to migrate ant builds to maven

1630677
post	get
anyway to get any useful help you have to post more of the function

1630684
feedback	review
in addition it can be tough to get feedback or to perform code review practices that i have found useful in my development experience

1630701
firefox	safari
our website www.phototulip.com displays fine in safari and firefox but not in ie7

1630705
getter	setter
well since no one mentioned it adding an underscore to member variable allows you to name your getter and setter with the conceptual name of the variable

1630737
error-handling	exception-handling
this is exactly what exception-handling were designed for to replace error codes with a more robust and structured error-handling mechanism

1630740
int	double
now for your problem actually as you noticed you will have to define both flavors of the operators int and double rather than using a generic template

1630740
int	double
but if you use boost.operators you only provide complex operator int and complex operator double and the stand-alone versions will be automatically deduced

1630768
kde	gnome
check the documentation if your desktop framework kde or gnome and where fedora configured the framework to put the shared files

1630810

the is required to make opera not show the broken image placeholder

1630859
opera	firefox
this worked for me in opera firefox and ie8

1630862
postgresql	mysql
as i ve been looking into the differences between postgresql and mysql it has struck me that if what i read is to be believed mysql should be disclaimer by reading the rest of this sentence you agree to read the next paragraph as well the laughingstock of the rmdb world it doesn t enforce acid by default the net is rife with stories of mysql-related data loss and by all accounts and the query optimizer is a joke

1630862
postgresql	mysql
it s not hard to tell that mysql has about a million times as much hype as postgresql it s la m p not lapp big installations of mysql are not unheard of lj

1630908
prepare	execute
both the prepare and execute statements will return false on error

1630939
post	get
in a traditional web application when everything was a post or get it s easy to handle errors and session expiration and present friendly messages to users

1630947
innodb	myisam
use innodb by default the only reason to use myisam is for full text search

1630949
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i imagine it like dropdownlistfor of items with checkbox

1630961
submit	submission
ie and firefox will both create different variables when submission from an image submit button

1630987
postgresql	mysql
explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql

1631097
post	get
if i change request metod from post to get the header is not generated

1631099
division	multiplication
you need to put parentheses around the multiplication like to make sure it s performed before the division takes place

1631118
int	double
but then again why do you have an int value a whole number in a double variable in the first place

1631139
put	get
the data repository can check for the existence of the data in the cache and return that or get the data from the ws or db put it in the cache and then return it

1631147
actionscript	mxml
you ll see here though that you still need to use a bit of mxml to init the actionscript class

1631157
ssl	https
this means that you must configure the server to force ssl usage by redirecting http requests to https or not accept unencrypted connections at all for that url

1631182
integer	fractions
return true if the bitwise-not of the bitwise_not of the value of the variable num which is num with any fractions component removed equivalent to math.floor num is exactly equal to the value of the variable num that is return true if num is an integer false otherwise

1631182
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
fwiw i ve got large amounts of svg both static and dynamically created working happily on firefox safari and opera and none of it has ever needed this kind of silliness

1631195
ant	pom.xml
you can have a look to ant2maven script that builds pom.xml from ant scripts

1631212
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is completely free and is a suitable replacement for mysql

1631330
ready	each
i also appreciate not having a commute even if i m only saving 20 minutes each way it s a huge load off of my back plus i don t have to dress to be in the office so i save time getting ready in the morning

1631353
udp	tcp
i have an application that needs as close to real-time processing as possible and i keep running into this unusual delay issue with both tcp and udp

1631353
udp	tcp
i am always using winsock in c++ compiled in vs 2008 pro but i have written several programs to send and receive in various ways using both tcp and udp

1631364

and any children of those windows must open on the same monitor as their parent

1631365
google-chrome	firefox
it didn t seem to be animating in google-chrome 4.x stream but it works in firefox

1631373
rss	feed
every blog server i know of supports an atom rss feed with extracts from the most recent posts

1631466
httprequest	httpresponse
work of all the classes have a tendency to be ones that tie you to things like io fileinfo directoryinfo or iis httpcontext httprequest httpresponse

1631477
client-side	server-side
as you can see the generated html is correct and has the semantic you want so this is not a server-side issue but a client-side one

1631483
x86	64bit
when i run the deployed application built for x86 on 64bit system i now get badimageformatexception immediately before the application even starts

1631483
x86	64bit
when i run the application directly from vs or not directly just a normal build not going via clickonce there is no problem on 64bit windows when using x86 target platform

1631491
int	chars
as you can see i calculate actual size of data struct with the code int actuallen sizeof chars + sizeof int

1631502
redmine	bugzilla
i ve used bugzilla for a while but redmine get my vote

1631571
serializable	deserialization
ixmlserializable will allow you to customize xml serializable deserialization

1631605
firefox	safari
parser errors are common i have often also had a case where firefox works fine but safari pukes on the same script because of missing extra commas

1631702
serializable	deserialization
it might be prudent to simply write an archival class that wraps your storage and provides methods for serializable and deserialization of primitives and then an open ended method that you can specialize as needed

1631873
stdout	stderr
i would like to copy stdout and stderr of my perl script to a file while retaining it also onscreen and preferrably using some trick inside the script itself

1631877
relaxng	schematron
however xml schema is far from being perfect just try to read the spec or a book on xml schema... and many alternatives have been developed since then schematron examplotron relaxng

1631878
int	chars
sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars float

1631900
rss	feed
i agree with craig to try using an rss feed reader perhaps a user control widget unless you need the blog fully integrated with the rest of your site

1631900
rss	feed
if the blog is a separate entity website though definitely just rip from the rss feed into your custom container

1631906
listview	gridview
in my wpf application i am using listview gridview and i implemented a functionality that is associated to mouse double click

1631916
cpython	ironpython
in practice it will be immediately closed in some versions of cpython but closed only when the garbage collector gets around to it in jython ironpython and probably some future version of cpython

1631967
onsubmit	onbeforeunload
perhaps you could handle onsubmit and set a flag that you later check in your onbeforeunload handler

1631987
width	height
i would like to get the absolute position of each of the text nodes within the svg document the svg documents have width 743.75 and height 1052.5

1632037
put	get
this is not an ideal situation but if you put things into a queue then browsers will begin to timeout after a while or users get impatient and click the submit button over and over as it is taking too long

1632045
strdup	malloc
fact is that npapi takes care of the allocated string from that point on and when tries to destroy it it cannot since strdup uses malloc and not npn_memalloc

1632058
getter	setter
i can t decide which approach is better for creating objects with a large number of fields 10+ all mandatory the constructor approach of the getter setter

1632069
ubuntu	linux
do you know how linux ubuntu handles the buffer for pipe s

1632071
hash	salt
instead store an irreversible hash of the password and a random salt

1632101

return different renderers at gettablecellrenderercomponent jtable table object value boolean isselected boolean hasfocus int row int column according to your business logic

1632119
unix	bsd
i could launch my beloved turbo c in dosbox an ubiquitous enough platform but i want to learn c such that i can develop something that compiles naturally on any bsd or unix platform

1632145
min	max
from c++ are min and max preferable over fmin and fmax

1632145
min	max
the c++ standard template library stl declares the min and max functions in the standard c++ algorithm header

1632158
getter	setter
if you use a var then you can create your own getter and setter and if the value is already set don t change it

1632163
min	max
i always use the min and max macros for ints

1632163
min	max
the big gotcha with min and max is that they re not functions even if they look like them

1632163
min	max
as such its best practice in my org to never call min or max with things that aren t a literal or variable

1632175
min	max
std min and std max are template functions defined in header which work on any type with a less-than operator so they can operate on any data type that allows such a comparison

1632178
min	max
i would prefer the c++ min max functions if you are using c++ because they are type-specific

1632178
min	max
also the c++ min max functions will work with user-defined types as long as you have defined operator for those types

1632190
min	max
std min and std max are templates

1632194
min	max
min and max are template functions that allow comparison of any types given a binary predicate

1632196
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has no commercial version and is much safer legally to use than mysql plus it very similar to oracle pl sql so the skills needed for it are almost the same as oracle and easy to find

1632201
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to compile the zpipe.c example in my linux ubuntu 8.04 with gcc but i m getting some errors take a look

1632222
min	max
you just use templated std min std max in c++ and use whatever is available in c

1632228
udp	tcp
it is not clear from the code you ve provided but my guess is that you are transmitting the data using tcp as opposed to udp

1632228
udp	tcp
if you want that behavior use udp instead of tcp

1632231
int	double
your 64-bit int will be converted to double which will at least usually have a significand that s smaller than 64-bits

1632267
integer	unsigned
fmin and fmax of fminl and fmaxl could be preferred when comparing signed and unsigned integers - you can take advantage of the fact that the entire range of signed and unsigned numbers and you don t have to worry about integer ranges and promotions

1632293
cassini	iis
i m trying to run a test version of a web using the file system the cassini web server built-in to visual studio 2005 rather than iis 5.1 on my win xp dev pc

1632297
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
to start with open a named pipe in readonly mode fileinputstream in process1 open it in write mode fileoutputstream in process2 so anything you write in process2 will be read in process1

1632303
listview	gridview
i m having issues using a gridview as a listview s view what i want to do is fire an event when a user makes a selection from a combobox within the gridview and pass the selected item within the event

1632313
getter	setter
it looks like you re trying to merge the getter and setter created by attr_accessor

1632313
getter	setter
the reason this isn t working is because you re overriding the getter with the setter when you call alias

1632314
getter	setter
if that s the case then you wouldn t use attr_accessor you d need to write the getter and setter yourself

1632336
getter	setter
if you want to use a single getter setter method beware of using nil since you may want to set your attribute to nil

1632390
google-chrome	firefox
the strange thing is on my local machine running ie8 it looks great even on the server using firefox google-chrome it looks great

1632391
bash	zsh
in zsh or bash

1632402
hide	show
i haven t tailored the dom selection for you but this code will show and hide each item in a set with a pause between

1632418
google-chrome	firefox
right firefox ie8 google-chrome

1632484
int	double
what s the default value of also c# defines that int double etc

1632499
voip	sip
i am writing a sip server and i have it taking calls and then connecting them to a voip phone the problem is when you hang up the voip phone there s something wrong with the forwarding of the bye message where my cell phone doesn t end the call

1632499
voip	sip
here is the sip message log i replaced my server s phone number with 1234 and my cell phone s phone number with 5678 my server s ip has been replaced with x s and my voip phone s ip has been replaced with y s -

1632541
equals	gethashcode
you need to override the equals and gethashcode methods for the contains method to be able to do comparisons as you expect

1632574
equals	gethashcode
you need to override equals and gethashcode for contains to do what you expect otherwise it is using equals which is just a reference comparison

1632574
equals	gethashcode
in this case you may find it easy to implement equals and gethashcode by just passing your implementation onto string s

1632591
int	double
this is because you will have to constantly convert between nsnumber and primitive types like int double long etc

or use fflush stdout

1632714
put	get
put this at the end of your bootstrap file or at the end of all your individual files and you can get a list of every file that s been included or required

1632768
equals	gethashcode
as you can see i have overridden equals and gethashcode

1632816
equals	gethashcode
you have not overridden equals and gethashcode

1632816
equals	gethashcode
the simplest fix would be to override gethashcode and equals directly rather than implementing a comparer comparers are generally only interesting when you need to supply multiple different comparison types case sensitive and case insensitive for example or when you need to be able to perform comparisons on a class which you don t control

1632817
eiffel	spec#
but if you want to do that take a look at jml spec# or eiffel

1632824
tostring	gethashcode
i overrode the tostring and the gethashcode methods and viola key lookup worked fine

1632836
firefox	safari
browsers to do this in safari or firefox preferably safari

1632842
awt	swing
i have a lot of experience with java programming gui programming with swing awt and non-gui c# programming

1632882
ssl	https
at this point you have a keystore that you can use to create the ssl socket to talk to the https web server

1632885
mouse	keyboard
if i have time to investigate and figure that out i ll repost but it might rank as a case where the return on investment isn t worth it customizing swing classes handling lower level mouse keyboard events directly etc

1632931
folder	directory
make sure that project1 is an application whose base folder is the project1 directory and that project2 is an application whose base folder is the project2 directory

1632950
inherited	properties
i have solved this problem in the past by creating a new control that inherited from radiobutton but adds a new groupname properties that is used to render the name of the control

1632957
free	malloc
if you re using low level malloc free routines zombies buy you nothing for those allocations

1632960
coalesce	isnull
i do not know about createcriteria but hibernate hql supports coalesce ifnull or isnull depending on your underlying database only in the where clause

1633017
int	boolean
the parse logic is a switch statement with some boilerplate for parsing int strings and boolean

1633020
try-catch	exception-handling
my general rule of thumb for exception-handling handling in guis is to have a try-catch block in all the event handlers that logs the exception-handling to a file and notifies the user of an error

1633024
public	protected
keywords public protected or

1633047
min	max
use std min and std max

1633077
move	drag
if you mean that you wish to extend the form in the designer to the left in order to make space for new controls i don t believe you can do it - you need to drag out the right side of the frame then select all the other controls just drag around them all with the selector tool and then drag them to the right you can also move them with right arrow key to ensure they stay at the same y position

1633112
tiff	png
did a quick google and found this link with info on saving png data instead of tiff data

1633117
submit	submission
the problem the form doesn t actually submit so i don t know how to track submission and the client wants to know the percentage of people clicking each button

1633117
post	get
i can t track actual submissions because obviously nothing gets post ed or get ed and i can t track google analytics clicks because ga only tracks clicks on links not on form buttons

1633119
gif	bmp
the icons are 28x28 16-color bmp files placed in the main resource file resources.resx the resx for the main form has the same problem and gif files don t work either

1633153

1633308
decimal	ieee
short answer types like double conform to ieee 754 which dictates data types which may have a decimal point anywhere floating

1633310
width	height
depending on your situation you may need to overide updatedisplaylist as well to properly set the actual height width positions of the children

1633363
inherited	properties
never use legacy classes any more they don t behave correctly with respect to properties and much else besides and for backwards compatibility they can t -- in python 3 legacy classes have finally been annihilated so every class is new-style without the requirement to explicitly inherited from object any more

1633471
extjs	mootools
compare the trends between jquery extjs and mootools

1633472
profiler	aqtime
aqtime s memory profiler works well for this

1633503
google-chrome	safari
i use firebug and the equivalents in safari google-chrome and ie 8 to see what s going on with the internals of a particular element on a page

1633522
width	height
height are dictated by the outer div and the height and width of the input control are 100

1633523
google-chrome	firefox
firebug is really good for getting to the bottom of wierd browser issues but generally i have ie google-chrome and firefox open when i m coding html css and i just make sure i hit the refresh button often enough in all three of them to make sure i don t get any nasty suprises after writing a pile of css

1633559
verilog	vhdl
since verilog and vhdl used for chip design fpgas and asics are similar to software development c and c++ it would appear to make sense

1633568
cells	tablecell
the same parameter can be used with tablerow and tablecell objects to format rows and cells

1633582
width	margin
an html-element s width is calculated i think as the defined width + borders + margin + padding

1633596
sudo	passwd
sudo requires a passwd which presents 2 problems

1633598
goto	break
its a label - the break statement supplies the label and this means it will be treated like a goto except that in java a break to label will take you to the end of the block declared after the label

1633608
versioning	upgrade
i had done an upgrade of the sitecore versioning and added the forms module among some other minor edits

1633666
folder	directory
because we have the externals and the directory folder structure set up this way you should in theory be able to checkout or export a solution to an empty directory and have it build successfully from scratch subject to all the necessary tools being installed and therefore teamcity or whatever your continuous integration server is should be able to also be build it from scratch

1633761
children	parent
i m having to explicitly deny access to all children in a tree when i only expect to deny access to one parent

1633804
versioning	upgrade
i have done this before with previous versioning by making an upgrade vs2010 branch and merging changes back and forth between it and the trunk vs2008

1633862
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in firefox but not in google-chrome ie8 ie7 or safari

1633894
postgresql	mysql
if i had to support a huge number users on a reasonably simple application and had the team to build a heavily partitioned and replicated database with eventual consistency i d pick mysql over postgresql for the low level data storage building block

1633905
google-chrome	firefox
i just saw that on firefox it works fine but in google-chrome it starts the cursor from start

1633935
folder	directory
the use case is that i have a folder which site administrators can create directory in and i want to force them to only create directory in that folder

1633959
mp3	wav
load an mp3 wav file

1633959
mp3	wav
overlay another mp3 wav file ontop of it

1633959
mp3	wav
render as a new mp3 wav file

1633994
google-chrome	safari
this did not happen in google-chrome safari ie8 ie8-compatibility or ie7

1633999
put	get
i have a very small utilty app written in c# that works fine on my local machine but if i put it on a network drive and try to run it from there i get the following securityexception

1634002
super	self
there must be a problem with super invitemanager self .get_query_set here but i don t know what to use

1634032
pylons	turbogears
this is what the pylons framework uses by the way and turbogears 2 which is built upon pylons also

1634049
jndi	jta
where appserver jndi path would need to be replaced with the jndi path of the jta transaction manager that comes with your application server although you can use a standalone jta transaction manager such as jotm as well

1634049
weblogic	resin	weblogic	oc4j	resin	oc4j

this technique is the same no matter whether you use mfc windows forms wpf qt gtk fltk or any other framework

1634071
hide	show
note that if javascript was disabled by user or if an unhandled error occured while loading you will unable to show hidden elements back and even request to enable javascript in case if you hide body

1634095
uitableview	nsindexpath
a category on nsindexpath similar nsindexpath uitableview that makes it easy to use index paths to address rows columns and optionally if you want to implement them sections

1634100
pull	push
i set up gitosis but even when i can clone pull and push to the gitosis-admin repo i can t create new ones

1634139
folder	directory
for example if email messages are stored as individual files and folder are represented as directory then moving an email to the spam folder would be done as a file rename move

1634142
post	get
a control which does this would also give some feedback to the user as the upload progressed which you wouldn t get with a simple http post

1634161
vim	notepad++
how do i use notepad++ or any other editor besides vim with msysgit

1634192
mp3	wav
it doesn t support mp3 for patent reasons but libsndfile is a very nice open-source lgpl library for loading and saving audio in a variety of other audio formats including wav

1634212
width	height
but i solved my particular problem by simply redefining the subview.view setframe 0 0 width height after returning from editing

1634229
postgresql	mysql
basically once postgresql started to hit the io-seek wall mysql was long dead and xapian kept blazing fast

1634234
switching	screens
this would always display two buttons at the bottom of the screens which the user could use at any point in time to switching between the two modes

1634234
switching	screens
it would automatically handle the switching of views a and b within the main part of the screens

1634247
google-chrome	firefox
..does what you want in firefox and google-chrome - wraps the lines but preserves whitespace

1634248
postgresql	mysql
after some consideration i settled on writing a web app in python ruby or php + postgresql mysql db

1634293
post	get
when data that has been entered into html forms is submitted the form field names and values are encoded and sent to the server in an http request message using method get or post or historically via email

1634345
udp	tcp
the general advice for most real-time action based games counter-strike left4dead quake iii is to use udp ip transport protocol sending messages as unreliable packets in favor of the guaranteed delivery of tcp because of issues with resend and latency issues you can t easily control

1634345
udp	tcp
the other advice is to build a reliable udp protocol that lets you optionally gurantee delivery of udp packets while still not being able to guarantee delivery order such as a tcp stream as long as your game can handle out of order packets

1634359
strstr	substr
i am trying to find a similar function to strstr that searches a substr starting from the end towards the beginning of the string

1634374
fixed-point	fractions
the only other possibility would be to use fixed-point vector components perhaps with very limited fractions parts

1634425
hash	md5
sig unhackable signature of this api call - md5 hash

1634439
uiview	subviews
the only thing i can think of is to have the mkmapview a subviews of some uiview and catch all of the user input in this parent view scale the images on zoom and relay to the subviews

1634484
jruby	mri
i am a little confused about the state of jruby and whether it is a viable alternative to switch to from the mri

1634484
jruby	mri
i am still weighing up a lot of options including mri on windows mri or jruby on opensolaris etc

1634518
rsa	dsa
a mac can be created and verified by anyone who shares the secret key the term signature is normally reserved for public key schemes like dsa or rsa

1634518
hash	md5
i m not sure if you missed it by accident or on purpose but a method that seems on the surface to be equivalent md5 k || msg is quite insecure because a quirk in how md5 and most other hash functions are designed means that if you know h m you can easily compute h m || m2 for any m2 - so if you were using md5 k || param1 5 someone could pull this off the wire and then create md5 k || param1 5 param2 666

1634518
hmac	md5
however while md5 k || msg is probably fine you are better off using something like hmac because it was actually designed as a mac

1634525
jruby	mri
yes because all the tutorials beginner docs and most of the devs who will normally be able to help you out are assuming mri so for each issue you have you must first eliminate a jruby related cause

1634536
jruby	mri
performance in jruby still isn t quite as good as ruby 1.9 but in a lot of cases it s comparable to mri 1.8

1634574
spaces	delimiter
as a side note when using q you always have the nuclear option of using spaces as the delimiter

1634603
hide	show
you should use display none to hide things and display block to show them again or display inline

1634642
firefox	safari
it s like this on all of their examples - tested in firefox and safari at least

1634649
firefox	safari
it works on firefox and safari but with displaying issues

1634666
postgresql	mysql
i d rather suggest postgresql as a first choice but mysql is a nice product too

1634666
postgresql	mysql
an argument that may influence your decision is the big difference in licensing between the two mysql is gpl or commercial licensed including the client library postgresql is licensed under a bsd licence

1634666
postgresql	mysql
this table contains some tech points of comparison between sqlserver mysql and postgresql

1634671
postgresql	mysql
the replication story is more coherent for mysql than postgresql

1634689
int	chars
the way you have it you re reading single chars instead of int and i think you didn t intend this

1634697
vim	textmate
i use netbeans textmate and vim but usually netbeans

1634697
jruby	mri
in theory choosing jruby or mri should be inconsequential but don t hold me to that

1634738
cpu	irq
if you send the pic s io port the proper sequence using the out instruction you can map the irq in such a way that it doesn t conflict with the cpu interrupt from a floating point exception

1634743
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stderr after stdout as in

1634766
min	max
what would be the best way to initialize the members to their type-specific min max values in the default constructor

1634778
min	max
each concrete type int32 float etc defines their own min and max values and they share no common interface for something like this

1634781
min	max
an alternative solution would be to redesign your class slightly add _isminspecified and _ismaxspecified boolean members and consult these in your contains method -- if neither a min nor a max had been specified you would always return true

1634786
min	max
there is no generic way to know the min and max value for a type

1634805
folder	directory
i ready in the book the definitive guide to windows installer phil wilson - chapter 14 - bootstrappers and temp folder that a bootstrapper should not run an msi from the temp directory because the temp folder can be removed all too easily

1634832
versioning	upgrade
i ve just received an assignment to upgrade an old delphi 3 project that i wrote in 1999 to a newer versioning and add features i previously discussed this in related questions here and here

1634852
gdk	cairo
it provides the widgets gets its message queue and internal communications from gobject relies on gdk to abstract and simplify its graphics and event communications with x11 and uses pango and cairo for text rendering and layout

1634956
queue	fifo
in the body of the handler you could use a linked list as a fifo queue to follow the order in which the rows are visited

1634968
post	get
that class will do the correct thing to send the data as either a post with parameters in entity body or as a get with parameters encoded as query string arguments

1634975
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
i guess the uinavigationbar displays the uinavigationitem s in a subview and you were adding your uiimageview on top of that subview

1635005
udp	tcp
are you using tcp or udp

1635005
udp	tcp
tcp is easy since it is a stream but if you re using udp keep in mind the maximum size of udp packets and thus how big your message can be

1635027
pop-up	dialog
i want the simplest possible way to pop-up simple dialog in python scripts

1635027
kde	gnome
work on windows os x gnome kde

1635027
pop-up	dialog
to pop-up a simple standard dialog should require only minimal code

1635027
pop-up	dialog
essentially you re just saying pop-up a standard dialog with this text or pop-up a dialog with question x and feed response into variable y

1635027
button	checkbox
i give it the text to put in the window and or button and or checkbox it returns what the user clicked on

1635047
kde	gnome
i read that zenity is gtk+ only but i tried it in gnome and kde and it looks native in both

1635113
post	put
in rest you create a resource ie add data either by using http post if the server assigns the resource name or http put if the client is assigning the resource name

1635130
int	chars
i m using strcmp to compare chars arrays in c++ but i get the following error for every occurrence of strcmp error invalid conversion from int to const chars followed by error initializing argument 2 of int strcmp const chars const chars

1635131
struts	wicket	wicket	seam
some contenders include java server faces wicket seam spring mvc and apache struts 2

1635139
jruby	mri
jruby is definately a good alternative to mri ruby but if you are following tutorials it may just add the level of wtf as you learn that may well be counter productive but if you do go to windows jruby is probably the best way to go

1635141
rss	feed
i would like to programmatically retrieve google reader s feed stats for my own site s rss feed

1635142
jboss	weblogic
liferay sun java system portal server weblogic portal server jboss portal server gatein and many more. you can run these locally on your development machine network - so your gadget can just run locally

1635161
inherited	properties
is there some inherited properties that i can set or something

1635192
np-hard	np-complete
matching regular expressions with backreferences is np-hard which is at least as hard as np-complete

1635194
ant	maven
as for how to do this in netbeans - not sure off the top of my head - i usually use intellij and or eclipse and usually build the jar through ant or maven anyway

1635299
16-bit	64bit
you could create a 64bit iv from say 48-bits of random data plus a 16-bit counter

1635310
versioning	upgrade
why upgrade to a versioning that is not the latest it just guarantees an earlier next upgrade

1635327
put	get
the out put i get is

1635413
onclick	onsubmit
the onsubmit event for example the default action of this event is send the form data to the server or an onclick event on an anchor element the default event action is to follow the anchor s href

1635444
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
on the whole svn s branch and merge is still pretty weak compared to the distributed vcs family git hg bazaar darcs etc but if you follow these guidelines it does the job

1635448
width	height
oh don t forget that your new tableview should has frame with x y width properties identical to your self.view s ones and tableview s height property should be a bit smaller

1635468
mockito	easymock
why don t you try easymock or mockito

1635469
junit	jmock
junit with jmock

1635492
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
anonymous types override gethashcode equals and tostring in reasonably obvious ways - the default equality comparer for each property type is used for hashing and equality

1635514
versioning	upgrade
at some point you will have to explain why you cannot upgrade to more nearly current versioning of the software

1635546
onclick	onmousedown
i ve figured out that i can solve the problem by tracking an onmousedown event rather than an onclick event

1635548
free	malloc
if additional memory is requested successfully and the received chunk is bigger that what the malloc caller asked for the block in chunk is divided - one part is marked as occupied and returned to the caller and the other one is added to the free store

1635578
junit	mockito
it seems that mockito runs quite well on java 1.4 and junit 3 as stated in this blog post

1635588
google-chrome	firefox
it is a .net version of the openoffice google-chrome and firefox spell checker hunspell and has all these features

1635612
versioning	upgrade
but if you have time and resources to upgrade to delphi 2010 it will be better options because sooner or later versioning from delphi 2009 and later will be the standard versioning

1635619
mockito	easymock
mockito originally based on easymock s code uses similar paradigms for mocking but automates several tasks such as switching mock object states namely record replay verify reset

1635619
easymock	jmock
since your requirement is jdk 1.4.2 support that unfortunately means you can choose an old version of easymock or really old version of jmock

1635706
innodb	myisam
sfussenegger is correct in that myisam doesn t support transactions use of the mysqldialect dialect doesn t exclude the use of transactions it only means that the hdm2ddl table generation will create innodb type tables

1635726
dictionary	map
you said dictionary you probably meant either a map or an ordered map

1635805
bibtex	latex
usually whatever is inside a bibtex file gets copied verbatim to the latex source code with some formatting maybe and case changings c. such as book titles authors c

1635805
bibtex	latex
so your bibtex file encoding has to match the one used by your latex file otherwise things get funny

1635813
getter	setter
but this only works with getter and setter methods am i right

1635840
debian	linux	put	get
but when i put it in production linux debian + apache passenger it only accepts .gif and i get the following error for .png and .jpg

1635846
folder	directory
i am making a software that needs to only be able allow people to select files and folder using the openfiledialog that are in the same directory as the program and that are in deeper folder

1635848
notepad++	scite
notepad++ is an open source programmer s text editor for windows based on scite

1635869
free	strdup	free	malloc	strdup	malloc
the reason i m using free is because i used strdup and malloc in creating the char pointers

1635869
strdup	malloc
the reason i m using malloc is because i used strdup to begin with in most code paths

1635871
ubuntu	linux
i am setting up a linux development machine ubuntu 9.0.x

1635884
free	malloc
no if you match calls properly free for memory allocated with malloc and delete for memory allocated with new it will work fine

1635885
postgresql	mysql
because i have built the app on mysql and need to start using postgresql for gis component of my app only

1635891
notepad++	gedit
if you are looking for a notepad++ like editor the default editor in gnome - gedit - might work well for you

1635892
mouse	keyboard
i d like to set up some thin clients -- ui heads old computer + mouse + keyboard connected to vms on a fast server

1635893
free	malloc
a class that has been new ed should be deallocated with delete but if it owns memory that was allocated with malloc either directly or indirectly then it should deallocate that memory with free

1635906
kate	gedit
kate is a pretty good editor i ve always preferred it over gedit

1635910
hash	salt
i am using salt hash algorithm to secure the password

1635932
notepad++	scite
i ve used notepad++ as well but my personal preference goes to scite

1635933
postgresql	mysql
or since you are planning on migrating to postgresql eventually you probably should do the opposite make the postgresql database default and change the connection for the mysql

1635950
free	strdup	free	malloc	strdup	malloc
you use free to release memory allocated with malloc or strdup and this is exactly what to do

1635986
maven	m2e
i have a multi-module maven project in a subversion repository with many developers working on it with eclipse + m2e

1635993
int	chars
int player_sdk_spec createplayer hwnd hwndparent rect rectplayer const chars szwndtitle

1636060
vim	emacs
vi vim and emacs xemacs can be very powerful take a look if you have time

1636074
ant	maven
to sum up i strongly recomend to look up ant seam an maven parametrization profiles

1636074
ant	maven
those solutions have another advantage ant or maven script can be run in ci server like hudson and let run test simultaneously all your profiles

1636100
width	height
i want in the background some liquid full width of stripes with the same height of some div of the design while my content is using a blueprint fixed-grid

1636145
pull	push
if you re up-to-speed with dvsc concepts i d push pull changes from office- usb- home

1636165
width	height
destination rectangle of the draw method is set to panel width and height

1636168
inherited	subclassing
your table structures are similar to what is used in joint table inherited but they certainly don t correspond to concrete table inherited where all fields of parent class are duplicated in the table of subclassing

1636182
squeak	visualworks
such are squeak and friends visualworks smalltalk x va smalltalk

1636222
hash	md5
obviously the theory is the same for an md5 method just take some sample data run it through a 3rd party md5 hash tool and then use the input output data pairs to validate that your method gives the correct output

1636258
ireport	subreports
to compile only the subreports using ireport

1636266
stdout	stderr
are you sending your stderr to the stdout stream as well

1636267
antialiasing	transparent
i ve tried to use antialiasing points to draw line but i don t know how to make it transparent

1636268
button	checkbox
i would like to know how i can control the enabled property of a button based on the checked value of a checkbox

1636268
button	checkbox
just to clarify when the checkbox is checked the button is enabled.

1636268
button	checkbox
when the checkbox is unchecked the button is disabled

1636277
stateless	stateful
i ve read some books on creating stateless websites i ve read some about stateful client applications but a lot of complexity comes along when you have to combine both

1636282
opera	firefox
what i want is that i want this portion of html code to be hidden from ie6 and ie7 but not firefox opera or ie8 but conditional comments not working properly on this portion....i am using separate css with conditional comments in the head section but conditional comments for opera are not working and also sometimes firefox shows strange behaviour

1636319
button	checkbox
in your situation however instead of changing the text of the checkbox find the button control on your page and change it s disabled property

1636361
width	height
if you re planning to use this for a favicon like the example you link to use 16 as the width the bash script will default height to the same

1636367
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
browsers that support queryselectorall safari firefox 3.5+ opera 10+ ie 8+ will return the elements in document order other browsers will currently return them in the order specified

1636434
width	height
try to give fixed width height to your checkbox whenever you fix the height width of your controls containers it becomes eaiser for layout manager to render them rather then keep on calculating and adjusting items

1636440
jython	pypy
for example google are working on optimizing python to improve performance relative to the main stream interpreter which has different performance characteristics to the iron python jython stackless and pypy implementations of python

1636442
qt-creator	kdevelop
do not even bother with eclipse or monodevelop for c++ try kdevelop or qt-creator

1636601
mvp	presenter
what is usually considered best-practices for presenter granularity using mvp and winforms

1636612
swt	nebula	swt	nattable	nebula	nattable
there are a couple of advanced table spreadsheet swt widgets out there nattable nebula grid but none of them support really large datasets

1636707
urllib	httplib
but to do that you need to drop down to httplib instead of the more general urllib

1636708
wan	lan
on a typical lan setup where the entire lan is connected to the internet via a router each computer on the lan would share a external wan ip assigned to the router but each of them would have a internal lan ip typically 192.168

1636708
wan	lan
in that scenario all external requests by any computer on that lan would appear to come from the same wan ip

1636708
wan	lan
the router alone would be aware of which computer on the lan the request belongs to so there would be no way for your php to detect the lan ip but only the wan ip via the _server remote_addr element

1636708
wan	lan
in short the server only knows the ip of the device that sent the request regardless of whether that ip belongs to a lan wan or any other sort of network

1636723
hide	show
using the above triggers just show hide that div when you want the default value to dis appear

1636737
folder	directory
it s nearly impossible or at least without extreme effort to create selfcontained modules instalable like copy this folder into your modules directory not sure about django but from what i head it s simplier there.

1636760
realloc	malloc
in the below code i am trying to allocate memory using malloc and realloc

1636770
realloc	malloc
you can call realloc only with addresses returned by malloc or realloc or null pointer

1636772

this way my-plugin-client will inherited all properties defined in the my-plugin pom.xml and also from java-base-pom project

1636895
put	get
this all works a treat until i get to the next stage of my learning which is to perhaps put 2 variables into dosomething

1637023
put	get
you can do this with the standard java 2d graphics libraries - create a bufferedimage from the image get its graphics and use drawstring to put the text on top

1637072
bionic	libc
android s c runtime library bionic is not binary compatible with the libc which most linux distributions use

1637173
client-side	server-side
i thought i d just add that these are php debuggers and since php is a server-side language it s not going to help you debug client-side actions such as clicking a link

1637192
ubuntu	linux
i m a linux noop and i was trying to get monodevelop up and running on my ubuntu 7.1 box

1637209
rss	feed
you could use rssa.at - just put in your url and it ll create a rss feed for you

1637238
put	get
all testing will have to take place on a more modern machine. you now have to get all of the libraries and headers for cocoa foundation appkit libc etc from your target machine a ppc or x86 mac and put them somewhere that the gcc on your 68k can find

1637240
expression-blend	silverlight
i m trying to learn expression-blend and silverlight

1637271
persistent	transient
but don t confuse persistent state with transient session

1637326
sudo	passwd
it would be possible for you to execute another script with root rights through sudo but that would also require storing your user s passwd in the script to pass in to sudo which is a terrible idea from a security standpoint

1637326
chown	chmod
there are also alternate chown chmod methods in the os package you should look at

1637387
post	get
one possible solution could be simple http get or post request but that wouldn t be secure

1637466
hex	binary
you can also change your fieldpackager to a binary type see if binary and use an hex representation

1637679
rss	feed
i have an iphone application that reads rss feed from a youtube channel

1637679
rss	feed
how do i make the rss feed load only several items at a time instead of all at one go

1637689
button	checkbox
where how would i apply the appropriate decoraters to the checkbox and radio button to have a form structure like above

1637724

you should really just have a method or writeonly property like you do that takes a possible ilist or ienumerable of your custom object and binds it directly to your datalist

1637724
gridview	datalist	gridview	repeater	datalist	repeater
if you change it from a datalist to a repeater or a gridview you have to change it everywhere you bind to your user control

1637734
automake	autotools
see man automake or google for autotools

1637769
put	get
you could also compute the relative path when copying the script and put an include in there with the proper number of .. to get out .. .. template template.php

1637850
versioning	upgrade
with my database upgrade scripts i typically just have one long script that makes the necessary changes for that database versioning

1637889
post	get
you d have to fetch it from the datastore in your get handler although without setting a session id in a cookie or something this isn t going to implement sessions at all but rather allow anyone getting to use whatever value was send with a post request whether it was sent by them or someone else

1637889
post	get
responding to a post request should be done in the post method not through a redirect to a get method

1637900
serializable	deserialization
if you have to have explicit control over the order of your objects serializable and deserialization i suggest you implement the iserializable interface for a

setinterval	settimeout
note that the function you pass to settimeout or setinterval will be passed lateness the number of milliseconds late the timer actually fired as the first argument

1638263
free	malloc
as you can see it allocates new structures using malloc but it never free s them

1638266

1638269
button	checkbox
11 fields below the button find clob and click the checkbox to enable long text retrieval clob

1638319

jhat	hprof
jhat - sun tool that analyzes hprof file starts up an embedded web server so you can analyze the heap thru a web browser view reports

1638330

1638379
put	get
but the problem is when i put it to debug and run it i get a message

1638394
getter	setter
furthermore while i agree that the functions can do what they need to do with the public interface of a in my opinion that s largely the result of people writing classes that have getter and setter for every data member of class a

1638413
portrait	landscape
this link monotouch rotate view in portrait landscape say to use

1638442
getter	setter
you have one property that can have some combination of a getter and a setter

1638460
accessor	properties
making a properties with get and set accessor allows you to make functions that behave like a variable

1638460
accessor	properties
if you make a labeltext properties wh ith get and set accessor instead of getlabeltext and setlabeltext they could simply write

1638460
accessor	properties
when you write a properties you write the get and set accessor like regular functions

wicket	uibinder
looking at gwt 2.0 uibinder today reminded me how annoying it was in wicket to have to match the xml component tree with the one created in java

1638493
post	get
the problem is that the return url in redirect is executed only ad an http get not http post as i wanted

1638493
post	get
i d like to authenticate and then redirect to the submit page post but it tries to execute a get on the same url

1638504
getter	setter
of course if they deal with an object s state by means of getter setter to private data then that s more than questionable

1638504
getter	setter
in fact i find getter setter questionable anyway

1638563
getter	setter
hence inorder to provide consistency in the data of an object while either reading setting we have getter and setter resp

1638586
websphere	ibm
at a minimum i need to declare a resource-ref for the remote connectionfactory in my case ibm websphere mq in order to enlist its connections in the jta transaction

1638596
gridview	datalist
it is really useful to make controls such as gridview datalist even login control look really appealing

that way when one developer changes her pom.xml the local files get updated using m2e all of them get committed together and other developers will see all changes

1638667
bazaar	git
i use git myself but am familiar with hg bazaar etc

1638792
decoder	encoder
no you need an encoder decoder

1638813
toolbar	docking
gradually mfc started to get external control library support particularly docking toolbar libraries so my tools like 3d model viewers and level editors all looked pretty sweet

pop-up	dialog
now when the user clicks on the icon they re also clicking on the invisible input which pop-up your dialog

1638916
ienumerable	ienumerator
since ienumerable has a single function which returns an ienumerator it can be used to iterate the collection multiple times multiple passes

1638929
onmouseover	mouseenter
secondly both onmouseenter and onmouseover fire when the mouseenter the boundary of an element

1638965
folder	directory
in my head i envisaged having each skin in a directory under the views directory in the folder structure then maintaining a data structure which maps hostnames to skin directory

1639022
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
we had this problem and it was very much firefox specific -- could only repro in that browser safari ie8 google-chrome etc were all fine

1639054
put	get
you can also put some condition-wait pthread_cond_wait instead of just some nanosleep which will get signaled when intended when a new file gets fopened

1639095
free	malloc
does this mean that malloc tried to allocate memory that was not free to allocate

1639228
versioning	upgrade
set of upgrade versioning of dual

in addition to the modules in vanilla perl strawberry will also include the entire dependency tree for bundle cpan as well as an additional set of upgrade versioning of dual cpan core modules that have win32-specific fixes

1639263
background-color	transparency
my solution was to set the background-color to a default color then tile a square grey image with a transparency corner knocked out over the top - so it shows the background through it

1639274
versioning	upgrade
this is also useful if you want to be able to at runtime upgrade a type to a new versioning ie load a remote assembly and reload it later

1639328
scheme	racket
update plt scheme is now known as racket which also has opengl bindings

1639335
datediff	difference
the datediff function in mysql gets the difference in days

1639467
ironruby	ironpython
basically if you want to port your own dynamic language to .net like ironpython and ironruby did you will have to use expression trees

1639483
nunit	mstest
you could either use mstest or nunit as the test runner however a good rule of thumb would be to separate these tests out into their own respective assembly or category so they are not ran every time your fast unit tests are ran

1639548
put	get
and if you still need java to play with that data put it in a place where java can get to it

1639552
uilabel	uitextview
if you need scrolling which is probably why you used a uitextview and not a uilabel then you need to do more work

1639571
post	get
better you call your post data get function from function data method

1639598
put	get
there is no need to put this in + void initialize for a singleton since it will only get called when you first attempt to use the class

1639660
.htaccess	httpd.conf
try adding to your .htaccess or preferably your httpd.conf and restart

1639680
getter	setter
without compiling it i already see a problem with properties that the code has to check whether interface defines getter and or setter and verify the right method s instead of blindly assuming the getter

1639743
webclient	httpwebrequest
i tried both httpwebrequest and webclient and both of them throw exception

1639753
public	protected
visibility public package protected private is important too because it defines who can access the actual method

1639781
folder	directory
check the permissions on the files and directory in the projects build folder

1639868
put	get
to get it to map on startup you can put this in a batch file

1639871
put	get
if there is too much finish put on your mock up you will get hung up on the big blue button syndrome where people are more concerned with how a button looks and less concerned with what it does

1639964
128bit	64bit
altivec operations despite being 128bit are treated as if they were 64bit

1639982
r-tree	quadtree
if you roll your own you can do a lot worse than picking the r-tree or quadtree algorithms

1640069
gridview	repeater
have you considered using a repeater instead of a gridview

1640100
switching	screens
if these are two separate textures in memory and i draw a grass tile then a gravel tile then a grass tile to the screens the gpu will load the grass texture then switching it out to load the gravel texture then switching the grass texture back in to draw another grass tile

1640100
put	get
the easiest way to get around this is to have a spritesheet where you put your grass and gravel tiles into one texture and just tell spritebatch to draw from a different area on the same texture each time

1640106
uilabel	uitextview
it sounds like what you actually want is a giant uilabel inside a uiscrollview and not a uitextview

1640152
next	except
next for your your itemtemplate you use a just like you normally would except now when you add columndefinition s you set the sharedsizegroup attribute to a name that is unique for each column

1640182
try-catch	exception-handling
i had been using a try-catch to capture the exception-handling and log it to the list as well

1640221
put	get
if you think of this as like a state monad executing one instruction followed by the next then a put will send the state value backwards in time to any preceeding get

1640244
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
i like the monodevelop ide even better than sharpdevelop but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language features

1640248
postgresql	mysql
i need to move a database with a django schema from postgresql to mysql running on amazon s rdf

1640275
mouseout	mouseleave
and because this is mouseleave rather than mouseout it will work when mouseleaving both the li and it s child submenu..

1640277
mouse	keyboard
i wanted keyboard users to be able to have the same experience as mouse users so i m duplicating the functionality found in my hover event handler in my focus and blur event handlers

1640315
postgresql	mysql
if you backup your postgresql database and choose the insert commands option you will end up with a text file of sql insert statements that in theory you can run against a different sql database in this case mysql

1640315
postgresql	mysql
in practice it s going to depend on the database types that you are using since not all postgresql and mysql data types map directly to each other

1640360
google-chrome	safari
i ve found how-to s on using a custom build of the webkit safari google-chrome etc engine to generate png screens

1640477
decoder	encoder
free working library implementation encoder decoder and source-code examples available under a bsd-style license

1640479
hash	md5
you d only have to make sure that the digital signature stays private just like the md5 hash

1640514
accessor	properties
another bonus would be that it can serialize objects that have read-only properties or atleast with the get accessor marked internal

1640527
rss	feed
you can find a basic usage example in the aggregator_refresh function in the aggregator module from drupal core where it is used to fetch rss feed

1640535
nsobject	ivar	ivar	subclassing
should i be subclassing uiview or subclassing nsobject and have an ivar of uiview

it also has greater flexibility in inherited mapping better integration with stored procs database functions custom sql triggers support for formula properties and so on

1640848
getter	setter
i am currently using xcode for some c++ development i need to generate getter setter

1640848
getter	setter
the only way i know is generating getter setter in objective c style

1640857
width	height
now as far as width and height i am pretty sure there are some cross-browser compatibility issues with how browsers handle a defined width but an undefined height when you swap out the images

1640871
ubuntu	linux
i was thinking in start to develop ipod applications the thing is that i use linux ubuntu hardy and i don t know if i can develop on it then i m here asking for some resources and tutorials to begin

1640882
width	height
you might be able to speed this up by setting the image height and width because the dom will not know where everything is placed until the image size is known

1640884
profiling	debugging
the first one generates profiling information for gprof you may need it and the second one includes debugging information in executables

1640896
getter	setter
it sounds like you re just looking for a way to reduce the hassle of writing getter setter property synthesize statements all the time right

1640922
width	height
when the user uses the normal height width properties however or drags the corner i don t know how to tie them to the default height and width

1640922
min	max
i intercepted oncanresize and created an event handler and tried to confirm that the new size is within the min max

1640922
min	max
if it s not set to the min or max as required but if within the boundaries then update

1640924
put	get
get the mysql connector-j jar put it in your classpath and read the docs

1640940
hide	show
in my program i toggle the registry value of hidden files to tell explorer whether to hide or show them

1640959
ssl	https
the only added info i can supply we are using apache mod_proxy_balancer along with https in front of our mongrels however this problem was occuring before we turned on ssl

1640970
vb.net	vb6
i realize that vb.net and asp.net are the successors of their seemingly obsolete classic counterparts but i have noticed that some job descriptions still list vb6 and classic asp as requirements

1640981
vb.net	vb6
whether you should learn vb6 or vb.net depends on your goal

1640994
multiplying	add
if i have another character i have to multiplying the first by 10 and then add the latest character

1641050
equals	gethashcode
it would be possible to do with reflection the mbunit test framework does something along these lines but with a heavy performance penalty and a good chance that it wouldn t do quite what you expected anyway and you should implement or equals and gethashcode by hand

1641091
free	malloc
you also have to ensure that you do not destroy free the old block if the malloc fails - you just return 0

1641130
free	realloc
the point of realloc is that it tries to merge the block of memory with a free one behind that if possible

1641170
free	realloc
ideally a realloc would simply see if there s enough free memory beyond the current block and if so just adjust the arena data structures to expand the current block in-place

1641170
free	malloc
by doing a malloc free if you have 100k in the arena with a single 60k block allocated calling your mm_realloc to adjust the size to 50k will fail

1641189
versioning	upgrade
relying on this or that method of some other object being atomic in a given implementation and versioning typically leaves you at the mercy of this atomicity not being a strong guarantee just an implementation artifact for the specific point release c you re using and therefore subtle very hard-to-debug race conditions being introduced with any upgrade or port to other python implementations

1641189
queue	fifo
if your profiling tells you that queue s strong and general guarantees are being a bottleneck for your specific producer-consumer use case make your own simpler guaranteed-to-be-threadsafe fifo queue stream

1641219
public	protected
in java we have been taught about public private protected variables

1641269
groupbox	panel
tabpage groupbox and sometimes panel in the case of radiobuttons

1641295
post	get
or the service you defined expects http get rather than http post

1641305
public	protected
in java we have been taught about public private protected variables

1641396
uiview	subviews
i have a graphics app i am writing that has a uiview that has several uiimageviews as subviews added to it over time

1641398
next	except
except importerror #no test jobs for this module continue to next one

1641398
put	get
this allowed me to put per-module tests in their own test.py file so they didn t get mixed up with the rest of my application code

1641472
subclass	accessor
and then you can simply map the value accessor to one of those fields in each subclass

1641482
twitter	myspace
in this case it might make sense to create a generic extractor interface class and then have subclasses for twitter myspace facebook etc but this really depends on how site-specific the extraction is

1641592
pop-up	dialog
if i understand you re question properly you have a pop-up window or dialog or some such and you need to retrieve information from it after it has been closed or some command is issued

1641611
inherited	subclassing
specifically how do you define a class with a few fields then a bunch of subclassing that inherited from it and each add their own new fields and be able to pass them around interchangeably as function arguments

1641631
cpu	processors
i m looking for a windows utility to consume cpu at a specified percentage so that i can test my app under conditions of restricted processors resources

1641675
getter	setter
on an unrelated note you should have any non-boilerplate implementation in your dp getter and setter

1641675
getter	setter
remember that the binding and styling system will bypass the getter and setter and talk directly to the underlying storage

1641688
gtk	gdk
if you want a good reference on how this stuff works take a look at the glib gdk gtk open source libraries

1641702
getter	setter
you can simulate an object by writing constructors setter getter and destructors with the hidden this pointer called out explicitly

1641732
aggregate-functions	sum
group by will be more helpful if you want to use some aggregate-functions like count or sum

1641751
getter	setter
no exposing non-api methods or allowing unfettered access to public variables - everything should be done with setter and getter

1641794
jar	war
the -0 option tells the jar command to not compress the member files when creating the war file

1641794
jar	war
edit depending on how the war file is structured it may also be necessary to use jar -0 .

1641829
int	double
the following is thanks to dribeas the compiler is not allowed to make implicit type conversions during template deduction so by passing a complex with t being double and then another t being int when trying to match the function treating t as double causes the second argument to mis-match and vice-versa

1641846
filtering	grouping
then when you go to display a list of records to a user you filtering based on the conjunction of the two grouping

1641847
profiling	instrumentation
don t add instrumentation code yourself - use a profiling to do this for you

1641853
int	double
the route from an int via a double to a is just marginally too contorted convoluted for the c++ language to follow it according to the standard and with the huge complications already arising from free-wheeling conversions and cohercions it s hard to criticize that aspect of the standard

1641853
int	double
i guess the super-special case of allowing uncasted int s as operands to its operators was just not deemed frequent and important enough to warrant specifying template specializations for that extremely individual case considering how trivially easy it is for the programmer to cast the int to double when that s what they actually want

1641915
getter	setter
is the only possibility to work with getter setter or alternatively implement the class as an normal inner class that is not direclty implemented

1641916
client-side	server-side
if you control both sides of the wire the server-side service and the client-side then you could do the following

1641916
client-side	server-side
if you d use add service reference then visual studio will inspect the service based on its metadata and create a new set of client-side objects which look the same in terms of their fields and all but they re a separate distinct type and thus you wouldn t be able to use your shared validation on both the server-side and the client-side objects

1641922
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is when i opened the report inside mozilla firefox 3.5.4 and google-chrome 4.0.233 it showed me the binary string content of the pdf file instead of triggering the adobe acrobat plugin

1641922
google-chrome	firefox
i have checked this by putting a pdf file in the htdoc folder and call it from firefox and google-chrome it worked just fine

1641945
put	get
but what if i want to get the name of the hotel with an id of 1 and put it in the url and replace spaces with hyphens

1641950
hide	show
for state a hide this field in this control for state b show this icon etc

1641959
openfire	ejabberd
may i know what integration technique that you folks use to implement external component to an existing xmpp server ejabberd or openfire

1641978
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu 9.04 linux

1642117
strcpy	strncpy
and it is safer to use strncpy than strcpy in void test setname

1642156
inherited	properties	children	parent
because that an fd number is a per process and might its children properties so only when a parent process had own an fd of an openning file a child forked in general could accept the inherited fd number as command parameter and use it

1642156
stdout	stderr
otherwise no way unless using well-known stdout or stderr etc

1642177
qapplication	qcoreapplication
the event system you re looking for is probably the main event loop provided by the qcoreapplication or the qapplication classes

1642200
qstring	qfile
if it s the former you should convert byte strings to qstring for file processing using qfile decodename

1642203
accessor	properties
the way i recommend is to bind the array controller then implement kvc-compliant array accessor methods for your properties and use those everywhere in your app except in the class s init and dealloc methods

1642395
formview	detailsview
first thing i would suggest you use formview to replace your detailsview you will have more control on gui

1642470
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in google-chrome firefox and internet explorer all of them cleared the textarea correctly

1642487
int	chars
one is declared to point to a function accepting an int the other one - to a function accepting a chars

1642489
int	chars
you ve declared g to be a function taking one argument of type int and returning an int and h to be a function taking one argument of type chars and returning an int result

1642491
int	chars
g is a pointer to a function which takes an int and returns an int whereas h is a pointer to a function which takes a chars and returns an int

1642492
int	chars
the function pointers both return an int while g accepts an int as input and h accepts a chars as input parameters

1642492
int	chars
although you can sometimes mix int and chars you are mixing function pointers so the compiler correctly gives you a warning that you might be doing something wrong

1642506
int	chars
one function pointer takes a signed int as an argument the other chars signedness depends on your system

1642528
implements	extends
note that the interface itself doesn t extends idictionary - it s just that the implementation also implements idictionary

1642541
udp	tcp
i am getting confused between tcp being connection oriented and udp being connectionless so please somebody clarify this

1642541
udp	tcp
every communication between two computers whether its tcp or udp is via packets

1642541
udp	tcp
there is no hard wire connection between two peers whether its tcp or udp

1642553
ubuntu	debian
and for ubuntu that s a debian package right

1642586
installation	upgrade
my snow leopard installation is an upgrade and not a fresh installation

1642588
udp	tcp
the connection is a tcp logical concept which adds the reliability of packet delivery that udp lacks

1642588
udp	tcp
however routers are only interested in ip the tcp udp whatever else are layers on top of ip

1642602
trac	bugzilla
you cannot use it for example in bugzilla or trac

1642606
super	extends
it seems that the inner class loaderimpl by extends the classloader class and by not calling an explicit super constructor should reference as its parent class loader the system class loader

1642614
ceil	floor
i need to mimic the exact functionality of the ceil floor and round functions on bcmath numbers i ve already found a very similar question but unfortunately the answer provided isn t good enough for me since it lacks support for negative numbers and the precision argument for the round function is missing

1642672
xsl-fo	xslt
then use an xslt to convert that xml to xsl-fo

1642674
inherited	properties
this properties is inherited from cim_printer

1642683
post	put	post	get	put	get
anyways we put the logic of submitting data from out site to the legacy site into a jquery plugin which handles any form elements in the form by escaping each value before posting the form - actually the landing old page requires the data in get format so we just end up setting window.location to the resulting querystring - but i guess we might as well have submitted the form with a normal post if we wanted to

1642689
rss	feed
subscribe to an rss feed of guidance

1642793
submit	submission
this one gets called right when the user submit the form you can then do anything you want in js like submission the form values via ajax and if you return true when you handled the form successfully in js the true gets inverted to false and the form will not submit via browser

1642793
put	get
the advantage of this is that you can get the desired form html via ajax generated by php and you can put the exact same html inside tags for those with deactivated js by calling the same php function to get the html

1642799
udp	tcp
i don t think i can improve on those definitions but let me attempt to explain it from socket programming perspective understanding that socket is the programming interface for tcp udp

1642799
udp	tcp
specifically if you program server sockets say in java you would notice how this connection-oriented and connection-less nature of tcp and udp respectively affects the programming model

1642799
ready	each
notice that there is also no serversocket#accept step necessary. in other words each client and server can just send datagrams around without having to care whether the other end-point is ready to receive the datagrams or not

1642815
google-chrome	firefox
it s working in ie and google-chrome but not working in firefox is this a normal behavior of firefox or there s something am missing here

1642911
pdcurses	ncurses
ncurses unix-only i think or pdcurses portable is the way to go

1642921
folder	directory
it is supposed to ignore all pdfs that are at an arbitrary depth under multiple datasheet directory under the current root folder

1643002
decoder	encoder
however these bugs are usually very easy to fix once you ve figured out where in the encoder decoder classes the problems lie because it s almost always those two classes

1643007
iboutlet	ibaction
what is the purpose of using ibaction and iboutlet in objective-c coding for the iphone does it make any difference if i don t use them

1643009
division	multiplication
the tostring should be slower than parse since division is generally slower than multiplication

1643019
ubuntu	debian
but for ubuntu creating a debian package should suffice your needs here

1643021
iboutlet	ibaction
you need to use iboutlet and ibaction if you are using interface builder hence the ib prefix for your gui components

1643021
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet is needed to associate properties in your application with components in ib and ibaction is used to allow your methods to be associated with actions in ib

1643021
iboutlet	ibaction
you need ibaction and iboutlet for these connections to exist in ib

1643029
iboutlet	ibaction
ibaction and iboutlet are used to hook up your interface made in interface builder with your controller

1643029
iboutlet	ibaction
but in reality most of us use interface builder once you want to get some interactivity going in your interface you will have to use ibaction and iboutlet

1643039
iboutlet	ibaction
ibaction and iboutlet are macros defined to denote variables and methods that can be referred to in interface builder

1643039
iboutlet	ibaction
ibaction resolves to void and iboutlet resolves to nothing but they signify to xcode and interface builder that these variables and methods can be used in interface builder to link ui elements to your code

1643039
iboutlet	ibaction
if you re not going to be using interface builder at all then you don t need them in your code but if you are going to use it then you need to specify ibaction for methods that will be used in ib and iboutlet for objects that will be used in ib

1643064
aggregate-functions	sum
i have group by clause everywhere where i use aggregate-functions sum

1643077
ienumerable	idictionary	ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection	idictionary	icollection	idictionary	ilist
in my mind it is good to be aware of anything that implements icollection idictionary ienumerable and ilist

1643094
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet and ibaction are purely there as markers that interface builder looks for when it parses your code at design time they don t have any affect on the code generated by the compiler

1643095
hide	show
this coupled with conditional statements to show or hide data controls or the asp .net loginview control should allow you to do what you want

1643112
docx	xlsx
apache poi 3.5 have added support to all the ooxml docx xlsx etc.

1643117
jquery	scriptaculous
i think this can be done by any javascript framework jquery scriptaculous mootools dojo as vrinek says

1643140
try-catch	exception-handling
the simplest way would be to wrap the call in a try-catch block and log the exception-handling

1643184
int	double
default t will be null for reference and nullable types 0 for numeric types byte int double etc and new t for structures which cannot be null

1643198
post	get
i was under the impression that the validation is supposed to get triggered by the model binding during a post

1643248
hide	show
choose one to show then hide them all filter by the class you want to show and display it

1643289
google-chrome	firefox
this worked for me in firefox and google-chrome when i added it ad the very end of my document before body

1643299
tinyint	varchar
i d go with the massive overhead of a varchar 5 field with a tinyint pk

1643307
super	self
super newuserfullform self .clean to ensure that the inherited fields are cleaned as well

1643395
put	get
but if the features are unrelated i d commit everything to dev rebase -i to put the uncompleted feature on top of everything and then get the id of the last completed commit

1643440
imperative	declarative
another problem of the declarative language is that some problems are easier to solve in a imperative manner

1643446
rss	feed
i like giving my users the full text rss feed but i also have a few sites which pull the rss feed and link to us from it

1643460
vb.net	vb6
i m a small developer in vb6 and vb.net and use for bugtracking a simple excel

1643471
filtering	grouping
the having clause indicates that we want to filtering after the grouping to only show the grouping which have more than one entry

1643482
ggplot2	lattice
have a look at the graphics view on cran and this series of posts on the learnr blog about lattice and ggplot2

1643537
debian	linux
gcc debian 4.3.2-1.1 4.3.2 on a 64bit gnu linux os hardware

1643537
int	chars
one possible solution is to just use int s instead of chars s right

1643537
int	chars
i assumed the version using chars variables would run slower than that using int s due to the conversions but on my 64bit dual core ii system the int version is slower

1643542
lua	scheme
javascript is more like scheme than it is like smalltalk which supports method not defined or lua

1643543
dreamweaver	fireworks
we are looking to upgrade our microsoft visual studio office iis7 etc and adobe macromedia fireworks dreamweaver flash products

1643721
punctuation	words
during the tokenization words parsing in this case process look for patterns that may define expression boundaries such as punctuation particularly periods and also multiple lf cr separation use these

1643744
keydown	keyup
many people experience issues with the keyup and keydown calls being dismissed or dropped and alot of people have resolved their problems by placing a small buffer amount of time between the two to assure that all commands are transfered

1643775
children	parent
attach the list of children to the parent entity

1643818
gmail	hotmail
i can prove that i own yahoo hotmail gmail and many others with your proposed verification technique

1643887
postgresql	mysql
quick write me sql to paginate a dataset that works in mysql oracle mssql postgresql and db2

1643901
width	height
did the old image have a width and height set to it

1643901
width	height
if you use image .width it should reset the width back to what it was before you applied any width changes to it similarly for height

1643904
fast-forward	merge
checkout master branch and merge in dev branch this should result in fast-forward

1643923
subtract	add
in the arithmentic operator overloads add a validation that the two vectors being added or subtract have the same dimension

1643953
hide	show
i ve had success using jquery show hide code to create the effect in a stand-alone panel but i can t get it to work properly on multiple panels it either opens all hidden at one time or noe at all nor can have i been able to integrate the effect into the step carousel viewer s onpanelclick function target parameter

1644071
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i ve used this in ff2 ff3 ff3.5 safari 4 win opera 9+ google-chrome 2 google-chrome 3 and they all work

1644092
min	max
because it is doing the min and max comparisons before the join test is a valid user entered value in the jobquestion table but should not be returned when jobquestion is joined to price

1644134
updatepanel	ascx
assuming you have an updatepanel around your custom ascx

1644150
inherited	properties
there are maybe a few solutions i could think of - make dataseries inherited series instead of have one - then likely i could new the points properties if the error still persists

1644223
spaces	delimiter
these are followed immediately no spaces is allowed to prevent ambiguity with the left-shift operator by an identifier or string that specifies the ending delimiter

1644223
spaces	delimiter
doing this also allows you to use spaces in your delimiter

1644223
spaces	delimiter
this is the same as using a single identifier except that it allows spaces within the delimiter

1644247
put	get
if you want to get those effects put a inside the table cell and apply the effects to the

1644329
png	tga
since the images are all stored as targa tga files i have to preprocess them into png files

1644374
inherited	subclassing
think about what it would mean to force all subclassing to have an inherited constructor

1644410
superclass	subclassing
the parameters needed to construct a subclassing are often different from those required by the superclass

1644416
filesystems	fat
i have a fat filesystems mounted in linux with the vfat driver

1644450
post	get
from the php manual an associative array of variables passed to the current script via the http post or get method.

1644453
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
i answered like inotifypropertychanged icommand ivalue convertor

1644462
disk	ram
however in almost all cases the difference is 20 - unless the 64 bit application does not have enough memory causing the os to start paging ram to disk

1644474
superclass	subclassing
because constructing your subclassing object may be done in a different way from how your superclass is constructed

1644474
superclass	subclassing
you may not want clients of the subclassing to be able to call certain constructors available in the superclass

1644478
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
baked in support for icommand and inotifypropertychanged are the two biggest benefits

1644510
hide	show
since you re using hide and show it does something different then what your intended css wants it to do

1644530
xpages	lotus
with lotus domino 8.5.1 one can use standard java classes into server side javascript embedded into an xpages or java classes available in the web-inf lib folder

1644577
put	get
wpf is probably not finished yet with sizing and placing the child controls in memory because when i put my code in the onloaded event handler of my control i do get correct locations for my child controls

1644579
put	get
when you build up a string with internal quotes you need to use eval to get the shell to put the quotes back together

1644585
versioning	upgrade
if the your versioning is equal or higher the backup can be restored and and upgrade with a limit not all past versioning are supported

1644595
int	double
stores an int not a double

1644621
rss	feed
in drupal core the default rss feed is at rss.xml

1644621
rss	feed
every taxonomy listing page also has an rss feed associated with it

1644621
rss	feed
to expand further on those options make use of the rss feed display in views the views datasource module to add even greater varieties of data json output for example and even the rdf projects if you want to be on the cutting edge

1644622
google-chrome	firefox
ie firefox and google-chrome happily load content as long as i add the ca to the trusted root cas

1644681
filesystems	fat
fat s dos attributes do not map well to the unix filesystems model so linux s vfat driver does not reflect them

i leave out the visual studio solution user options file .suo and the binaries directory as they get recompiled everytime you build your solution the bin and obj folder

1644702
selecteditem	selectedindex
use the selecteditem or selectedindex property of the listbox control

1644724
int	double
unboxing requires the same type you can t convert directly from a boxed int to a double

1644724
int	double
by first unboxing to an int and only then casting to double

1644736
ssl	https
if you use transport security you ll be using https addresses and ssl must be enabled on your network but on the other hand you don t need to identify the service with a certificate

1645050
cout	cin
std cin and std cout globals

1645112
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
your core graphics surface should be cleared to all zeroes before you render to it so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc

1645130
children	parent
then jquery can find the parent .collapsiblepanel but is unable to traverse the children

1645181

i can get the raw data by doing the following cp dev fb0 screen.raw but i am stumped on how to convert the image into a gif or png format

1645183
hash	salt
this is because the salt is added to the password before it is hash so it effectively adds to the total number of entries the rainbow table must contain to have a list of all possible values for a password field

1645186
put	get
update i put a bounty on this question because i still cannot get it to work

1645190
hash	salt
a salt is a random set of bytes of a fixed length that is added to the input of a hash algorithm

1645190
hash	salt
adding a random salt to a hash ensures that the same password will produce many different hash

1645190
hash	salt
the salt is usually stored in the database together with the result of the hash function

1645190
hash	salt
this is only true if the salt is stored separate from the hash

1645190
hash	salt
8 character case-sensitive alpha-numeric passwords with 16 bit salt hash to a 128 bit value would take up just under 200 exabytes without rainbow reduction

1645190
hash	salt
a salt is not a secret key instead a salt works by making the hash function specific to each instance

1645190
hash	salt
with salt hash there is not one hash function but one for every possible salt value

1645190
hash	salt
a secret salt is not a salt it is called a key and it means that you are no longer computing a hash but a message authentication code mac

1645190
hash	salt
this ensures that an attacker has to attack every salt hash separately

1645190
hash	salt
the point of the salt is to be distinct for each hash password

1645190
prng	random
using a random salt obtained from a cryptographically secure unpredictable prng may be some kind of overkill but at least it provably protects you against all those hazards

1645190
hash	salt
store the salt along with the hash password

1645190
hash	salt
stackoverflow.com non-random salt for password hash

1645190
crypt	salt
usenix.org unix crypt used salt since 1976

1645234
google-chrome	firefox
innertext works in ie and textcontent works in firefox google-chrome etc

1645235
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
pull this trace into a table and do some filtering sorting grouping focusing on duration and reads

1645247
gridview	detailsview
i can bind it to a gridview or detailsview but not the accordion

1645259
children	parent
by watching the children s onrender you re implicitly saying that you want to start drawing after measure and arrange have occurred but before the parent starts drawing itself

1645259
children	parent
this can be made equivalent to the parent s onrender - which wraps the children s onrenders

1645259
children	parent
you might also be able to do this in the parent s arrangeoverride which wraps the children s arrange pass which is where iirc the values visualtreehelper.getoffset accesses actually get set

1645260
hash	md5
i m trying to represent the result of an md5 hash in the shortest possible string

1645260
hash	md5
one idea i have had is getting the md5 hash of my input as an array of bytes and constructing a bigint with it

1645264
g++	gcc
i m using g++ instead of gcc and it should work i found similar examples over the web but it seems that ast_node is not known when defining yystype because i get this error

1645295
folder	directory
in which case all classes from myjar1.jar myjar2 jar and some classes folder directory will be available to you

1645309
unsigned	short
is this a reference to void cast as an unsigned short pointer and then offset by 3 mesh etc... + batchnum

1645328
identifier	ambiguous
in some contexts an identifier that starts with one of these would lead to ambiguous code

1645333
onclick	onchange
which mirrors the onclick event which is currently implemented and i m trying to convert to the onchange

1645353
boost	stl
you can easily build such a queue on top of stl and boost though - just wrap std queue and boost mutex in your custom class

1645354
bazaar	git
mercurial git and bazaar all just put a single directory at the root of the project

1645432
folder	directory
instead of adding your bin directory to source control which just seems wrong why don t you put the dll in a folder called third parties within your project and reference it from there

1645446
unsigned	short
this is casting 0 to an unsigned short pointer

1645446
unsigned	short
this will be used for computing a memory offset computed in terms of the size of an unsigned short

1645453
interpreted-language	compiled-language
in interpreted-language you deploy the source while you deploy the compiled binary for compiled-language

1645466
spaces	linefeed
you need a few more spaces or linefeed printf d d n printf d n

1645471
inherited	properties
if gives you the properties behaviors and inherited and composition chains between types

1645489
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work on google-chrome haven t tested on ie however when i run the app on firefox with multiple tabs activated if i close the browser and open again im still authenticated and the cookie is still there

1645502
profiling	instrumentation
if it s still slow after that hook up instrumentation and profiling it

1645578
post	put	post	get	put	get
it works over http and you use the standard http commands of get put post delete to manipulate data you can query using browsers and clients are simple http clients

1645591
post	put
form_for will then look to use the account_feeds_path with post when feed is a new record and account_feed_path feed with put when feed is not a new record

1645652
dlsym	dlopen
not for the feint of heart but you can use dlopen and dlsym to get the address of globally declared variables

1645672
bazaar	svn
bazaar seems much more like svn with branches just being separate directories so maybe not

1645674
put	get
when you are sure your script is perfectly working you can get rid of warning and notices like this put this line at the beginning of your php script

1645707
integer	unsigned
t specifies that a following d i o u x or x conversion specifier applies to a ptrdiff_t or the corresponding unsigned integer type argument

1645799
postgresql	mysql
it s certainly not a drop-in replacement for oracle postgresql db2 mysql what have you

1645811
bazaar	git
bazaar differs from git in that you can t switch the branch represented by the working directory

1645853
disk	ram
seems it stores on the disk cookies suposed to be stored on ram to recover the tabs when you open the browser again

1645961
octal	decimal	octal	binary
i know of several general formulas for converting between binary decimal and octal but i was wondering if java has any built-in methods or classes that convert between the three

1645961
octal	decimal	octal	binary
in particular i am looking for methods to convert from octal and binary to decimal and between octal and binary

1645979
hide	show
specifically when we have a child control on a page and the child control itself hosts a report viewer and the report has a document map the postback on the show hide document map button seems to be lost so the document map never disappears

1646010
hex	binary
so to turn f hex into 1111 binary

1646041
equals	gethashcode
the problem here is that does not in fact declare gethashcode so it s much easier to forget to implement that method properly contrasted with the equals method that it does declare

1646041
equals	gethashcode
provide a proper implementation that implements both equals and gethashcode

1646056
french	turkish
at present these support danish dutch english finnish french german hungarian italian norwegian portuguese romanian russian spanish swedish and turkish

1646093
passenger	thin
i m suspicious of nginx passenger because i just switched to that last week from nginx thin and now these are happening

1646116
getter	setter
then synthesize the getter setter like this

1646155
twitter	myspace
xml and xslt - send them facebook friend requests - join their myspace page - follow them on twitter - take them out for cocktails - get them liquored up and laid on the hottest silicon you can get your hands on

1646157
jobs	cron
my standard advice for running cron jobs is always to run a shell script which sets the environment if necessary before running the real task

1646186
changeset	cherry-pick
then merged via carefully cherry-pick just the desired changeset back around the tree or via a baseless merge

1646232
nhibernate	automapper
soon after i posted my question i found gabriel schenker s 3 part series your very first nhibernate application while browsing some of the other so questions with automapper tags

1646290
google-chrome	firefox
we have an app that is being developed that renders fine in firefox and google-chrome but is suffering greatly under ie

1646326
versioning	upgrade
and i fear that if python is installed before and i upgrade to a new versioning this could break something else.

1646326
stdout	stderr
i execute the plug-ins from command line and read the stdout and stderr output

1646368
solaris	aix
if you don t have an aix machine to test it on the install works the same way on solaris or linux so you could write your documentation based on that

1646368
folder	directory
basically you ungzip the tarball file use tar to unpack the archive change directory to the unpacked folder run a shell script to install it tell the shell script what directory to place it in and wait

1646414
internationalization	translation
i haven t used the internationalization features of django so i can t really help with the translation

1646492
draggable	droppable
i have a droppable container with 1 draggable in it

1646565
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so far this works great in all the browsers i ve tested ie8 firefox google-chrome safari except ie6

1646568
keydown	keyup
note that this code is only applicable to previewkeydown keydown previewkeyup and keyup events

1646614
put	get
make sure you cast your uint64 s to int64 s before you put them into the database or you ll get an argumentexception

1646650
folder	directory
i have an ant build script that deploys a war folder into my jboss deploy directory

1646650
jar	war
can i convert that into an executable war jar file and run it as well

1646654
hash	md5
rather than convert the above subroutine to php here is a subroutine to convert a string to its md5 hash in vb.net

1646713
implements	modifiers
in your code you have implements the interface explicitly without making the access modifiers public therefore loginuser method is visible only when the variable s declaring type is the specific interface

1646734
rss	feed
that example will help you setup a php script that will generate an rss feed to subscibe with errors from your server logs

1646741
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
when you convert this page to asp.net-mvc then replace the hyperlink with a html.actionlink or url.action call and pull the raisepostbackevent logic into your controller

1646761
post	get
all a user has to do is click a button on the page and it post all the info to get them to authnet s hosted payment form

1646761
post	put
i m ok with jquery and can send the post request via an ajax call but that doesn t exactly put the user on the authorize.net page

1646807
division	multiplication
simple numeric operations like multiplication division with overflow checking or wrapping around

1646812
post	get
i m following the post redirect get pattern so i don t have a problem if f5 is pushed but the back button still provides the opportunity to resubmit the form

1646818
tostring	compareto
i would recommend not to use tostring so frequently when you need to switch between types the better way is to use custom object to at least specialized versions of methods for comparison like compareto

1646871
calloc	malloc
if you want to simulate limited memory calloc not malloc a gigabyte or two of memory in bogdown.exe

1646885
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

1646901
int	chars
over and above the other answers it looks to me as though the argument to function_points should be int points rather than chars lettergrade so that you are not using an uninitialized variable in the function

1646913
implements	extends
it s also easy to remember easy to implements and easy to extends to any number of fields

1646928
jar	war
you can also create an archive that is both an executable jar file and deployable war file at the same time

1646991
int	chars
your function should return a chars and take in an int

1646991
int	chars
in the function header chars is the return type pointstolettergrade is the function name and unsigned int points is the data that the function takes in

1647023
innodb	myisam
i had to list some advantages of myisam over innodb and why it s still being widely used

1647037
innodb	myisam
innodb supports row level locking whereas myisam only supports table-level locking

1647067
accessor	properties
you can change the name of that accessor by setting the related name properties of the foreignkey

1647078
innodb	myisam
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

1647078
innodb	myisam
personally i still believe that the advantages of innodb triumphs myisam and myisam also has problems with data integrity from my experience

1647114
innodb	myisam
i had to list some advantages of myisam over innodb

1647114
innodb	myisam
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

1647172
gwt	dwr
technologically java is quite good for non-standard web things - like heavy use of ajax gwt dwr comet spring to mind mobile where you generally need lots of session data and less front-end bling really simple things that are going to be put under immense load it will definitely trounce apache mod_xxx every time the only thing faster in wide-spread use is native code

1647173
post	get
after searching around for quite a bit i found a blog post which stated that you can get 64-bit eclipse for windows at eclipse downloads

1647182
apache	cherokee
this seems to me to be a pretty basic thing but even with the excellent apache documentation i m at a bit of a loss been using cherokee too much lately

1647190
affinity	processors
basically i iterate through each processors visible to windows set thread affinity to that thread and then make a sequence of cpuid calls

1647192
post	get
but what about a variation on post redirect get where the final get is not actually the final get

1647306
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if currentsummary is already a nsmutablestring you shouldn t attempt to assign a regular nsstring the result of stringbyreplacingoccurrencesofstring withstring to it

1647327
typedef	typename
note that if i change const typename container pointer to simply typename container const_pointer it compiles fine however as far as i can tell the const_pointer typedef is an extension i don t see it mentioned in the c++ standard container requirements 23.5 table 65 and so therefore i don t want to use it

1647343
hash	md5
well here hash is what we call a one-way function like md5 sha1 etc

1647367
jar	war
you can deploy the web application and the web service in the same war but this is just a deployment choice you could package the business logic in a jar and use it in several wars

1647391
folder	directory
i want to add a folder projects scripts so i can use require script where script is a ruby file in this directory

1647396
getter	setter
just plain getter and setter

1647402

1647412
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
however i ve heard many warnings about staying away from using any of the built in controls objectdatasource and sqldatasource

1647412
sorting	filtering
i haven t really dabbled in sql but with a bit of reading i m sure i could create my own custom server side paging filtering sorting

1647412
gridview	objectdatasource
would it be efficient if i created a stored procedure for each of these functions and called them from an objectdatasource or should i call the sp using linq to sql in my dal and then display that information directly to the gridview

1647413
rss	feed
i have a youtube rss feed set up to show youtube videos in a tableview

1647485
strlen	substr
i believe the argument against mbstring.func_overload is that if you use any 3rd party libraries code whatsoever that code may be relying on the normal functionality of the functions in question -- it may be calling substr to truncate a string containing binary data at an exact byte boundary or using strlen to get length in bytes rather than length in utf-8 characters

1647526
put	get
i put my selectors at the edge of the code so i can get to them quickly and step through them under the debugger

1647568
pycrypto	keyczar
i m using pycrypto keyczar and i ve figured out how to import export rsa keys in pkcs8 format but i really need it in pkcs12

1647578

graphaã l currently supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+

1647582
nhibernate	automapper
i m using fluent nhibernate automapper and at the same time use asp.net membership but how do i reference aspnet_users table

1647602
single-sign-on	shibboleth
if you are looking at a secure single-sign-on solution something like shibboleth will come to mind

1647634
implements	extends
i was wondering whether or not i can extends the enum type in c# to implements my custom enum.getvalues type and call it like enum.getmycustomvalues type

1647658
children	parent
i ve taken a look at addhierarchychangelistener but it seems to only detect changes in parent not children

1647672
vim	emacs
pick a cross platform editor that is powerful enough like vim or emacs learn to really use it and use it everywhere

1647747
google-chrome	firefox
i turns out that google-chrome and firefox really don t like the response.clearheaders call for some reason ie was ok with this once i removed it the downloads functioned as expected again.

1647753
filtering	grouping
if what you really want is to express filtering over your grouping data take a look at the having clause

1647754
qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel
create a subclass of qabstractitemmodel or qstandarditemmodel depending on how much coding you will want to do override the flags method to return the appropriate flags including qt itemisusercheckable in the columncount method add an extra column to include the checkbox and in the data method for the column where you want your checkbox to appear return the checked state qt checked qt unchecked for the qt checkstaterole

1647766
pull	push
much of this stuff doesn t need to be run every single time you push pull in particular i usually wouldn t want to dump a new data fixture that frequently

1647792
client-side	server-side
ria services simplifies the client-side programming model so that it matches very closely with your server-side domainservice and entities

1647795
background-color	font-size
also note that the css properties that contain dashes like background-color or font-size are accessed removing the dash and capitalizing the next word

1647796
apache	nginx
after putting nginx in front of apache i noticed that the ip in the apache logs was always 127.0.0.1

1647847
inherited	properties
the most effective way to do this is to inherited from vb.net s windowsformsapplicationbase class which can also be used in c# and set the issingleinstance properties to true

1647914
folder	directory
i have been working on a branch for a while and deleted a directory folder that i do not need

1647945
apache	nginx
i know when it happens as an apache module it gives a blank screen--wouldn t be surprised if a 502 error happened under nginx and the fastcgi interface

1648031
win64	windows
win64 is defined by the windows platform sdk or whatever they re calling it this year when targeting a 64-bit platform

1648087
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
if it s not possible in general then are there any safari opera firefox ie etc

1648144
post	get
i have seen the examples of net openid consumer lite on cpan but i was hoping to get a single script that uses post method

1648144
post	get
if nobody has this than i will post my solution back here once i get it working

1648161
post	get	rss	feed
to get the entrants i have to parse the rss feed of the contest seems to only list the last few post so i would probably have to interact with the twitter api in order to get all messages

1648216
jobs	cron
would you have any cron jobs that might be competing for disk or memory

1648363
superclass	subclassing
if subclassing in objective-c wants to override a superclass s method does it have to match the return type too

1648418
dictionary	map
s key uses a dictionary of 2048 words to map 64 bit numbers to a sequence of 6 predefined words syllables

1648440
post	get
validate every input don t assume users can t change your javascript post get s

1648464
hash	salt
my understanding is that a salt is not intended to be secret it is merely intended to be different from any centralized standard so that you can t develop a rainbow table or similar attack to break all hash that use the algorithm since the salt breaks the rainbow table

1648464
hash	salt
in a widely-used piece of open-source software the salt would be widely known and this opens you up to attacks because now they can simply attack the salt version of your hash and create rainbow tables that include the salt data

1648464
hash	salt
the first is to change the salt with every new version of the software but this is no good because new versions of the software would no longer be able to test against old password hash

1648464
hash	salt
the downside is that the salt have to be associated with the password hash in some way probably just by sticking them right next to the password in the database

1648464
hash	salt
is there any extra risk associated with storing the salt directly with the password it hash

1648516
hash	salt
unix systems traditionally even store the hash in the same field as the password the salt is a fixed-length prefix of the password

1648532
hash	salt
these take care of generating a per-password salt and they use a proper hashing algorithm its not enough to just use a cryptographic hash such as sha1

1648532
hash	salt
the salt strengthens a password by making the hash value incomparable to the same password in the same or other database and invalidating large pre-generated lists of common password to hash lookups rainbow tables

1648532
hash	salt
if the system uses a single random salt for all users in the same system then two users who by chance have the same password would have the same hash and guessing one user s password would trivially compromise the other

1648539
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup is more suitable for html parsing than lxml

1648554
hash	salt
for example if you simply add and a lot of salt to the end of each password before hashing an attacker could construct a table of hash values generated by lots of strings all those strings ending with and a lot of salt

1648582
opera	google-chrome
i m interested in internet explorer opera and google-chrome

1648582
google-chrome	firefox
my default browser is google-chrome on windows and linux but if i do something in javascript i end up having to switch to firefox to get the error messages from the error console

1648594
firefox	safari
this code works in ie firefox and safari

1648594
opera	google-chrome
but don t work in google-chrome and opera

1648594
google-chrome	safari
i tried to use this topic how do i print an iframe from javascript in safari google-chrome

1648619
nexus	artifactory
for the record i m using both nexus and artifactory

1648619
nexus	artifactory
i can clearly state that while nexus is very simple and operative though i sometimes have problems with the installation process on ubuntu its free version cannot compete with artifactory s community free edition

1648619
nexus	artifactory
excluding artifactory s awesome web 2 ui its main features such as security management periodic backups and accessibility issues are way beyond those of nexus

1648632
hash	salt
the problem with this though is that your application has to know the salt to be able to do the one-way and compare the resulting hash

1648720
emacs	aquamacs
i just used aquamacs emacs to load a diff file and it provided some highlighting

1648741
sorting	grouping
however finding all products that have one attribute would be at least lousy in case you have attributes as comma-separated you need to use like and in case you store attributes as serialized arrays they are completely unusable for any kind of sorting or grouping using sql queries

1648741
sorting	grouping
using separate table for multiple relations between products and attributes is far better if they are of any importance for selecting grouping sorting other data

1648773
macvim	textmate
if you d rather go graphical use macvim which is free or textmate not free

1648779
hash	salt
context dependent but you could just store the hash of the key plus a salt constant string easy to obscure

1648779
hash	salt
then when if the user enters the key you add the salt calculate the hash and compare

1648779
hash	salt
the salt is probably unnecessary in this case it stops a brute-force dictionary attack if the hash can be isolated a google search has also been know to work

1648854
addeventlistener	preventdefault
if you instead set an event via an event handler property on the dom element or using addeventlistener attachevent then just returning false from that function does not work in every browser and you need to do the returnvalue and preventdefault stuff from my other answer

1648868
public	protected
it should be ideally protected but it can be public

1648875
tcpdf	fpdf
personally i d rather go with tcpdf which is an ehnanced and mantained version of fpdf

1648901
button	checkbox
i have three radio button with same name and different values.when i click the third radio button the checkbox and textbox going to be disabled.but when i choose other two radio button it must be show.i need the help in jquery.thanks in advance..

1648931
hash	salt
when i had to do this i did put some innocent looking string into the code a copyright notice for example or some faked user prompt or anything else that won t be changed by someone fixing unrelated code encrypted that using itself as a key hash that adding some salt and used the result as a key to encrypt what i actually wanted to encrypt

1648994
button	checkbox
i m guessing you probably want to bind a click event to a number of radio button read the value of the clicked radiobutton and depending on the value disable enable a checkbox and or textbox

1649060
ubuntu	debian
avoid obscure distros that may miss packages go for debian or ubuntu or fedora or one of the biggest ones and you ll be fine

1649070
getter	setter
no virtual methods all data members are private no protected getter setter helpers

1649131

with four grails projects under my belt preceded by two tapestry projects and one wicket project i m seriously looking at play next

1649131
groovy	gsp
one of the things i thought was cool about grails is that everything s groovy. that is you use groovy to write everything except the html and the css -- domains controllers services page templates gsp tag libraries hibernate api gorm unit tests gunit and build scripts gant

1649152
spaces	delimiter
of course this only works if spaces are genuinely a delimiter between fields

1649191

the blog post suggested by matt is the best source of information you can get

1649281
dropbox	skydrive
i have some confidential data i might need on the road mostly usernames passwords stored in a truecrypt volume located in my dropbox with a copy on my skydrive

1649359
actionscript	mxml
this is also why actionscript classes and mxml components interoperate very horribly you might have noticed mxml doesn t have the concept of interfaces execution flow and thus time whereas as3 doesn t have the concepts of events or bindings which are native in mxml but are built on top of as3 using some metadata and the flash.events package looking very nice in mxml but being an impressive number of calls and instantiations in as3 .

i think you have to delete all the children before you delete the parent

1649436
put	get
i hope this will become a good experience all in the end but to make it good we have to put more efforts and build attitude to get through this

1649488
children	parent
all its children call their parent constructor

1649586
webclient	httpwebrequest
in the scenario given you should be able to use the async nature of things like httpwebrequest webclient which will support all this already using completion-ports rather than just threads

1649614
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
we can do this fine and works perfectly under jdk1.6 however we need it to work under jdk1.5

1649614
wsimport	jdk1.5	wsimport	jaxws-maven-plugin
we re using jaxws-maven-plugin to generate the source code however it depends on the wsimport binary being available this is not available in jdk1.5

1649614
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the versioning number to 2.1-1 and now when we build the project to generate the source code we get the following error

1649651
put	get
to get user management let subversion listen to localhost 127 1 and put an apache web server in front

1649693
many-to-one	one-to-many
i have the following mapping the many-to-one property message has a corresponding one-to-many association in the rootmessage class

1649711
stdout	stderr
i have to call an external program from my ruby script and this program sends a lot of useful but cryptic info to stdout and stderr

1649711
stdout	stderr
while the program is running i d like to parse the lines it sends to stdout and stderr and

1649711
stdout	stderr
etc. but i can only retrieve stdout stderr after the program is executed not during its execution

1649715
versioning	upgrade
smooth upgrade to new versioning

1649749
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i would start by looking inside the view lifecycle methods - viewwillappear viewdidappear etc

1649815
post	get
just take all the post data from the previous page that you care about and get them into the current page s form

1649824
mouse	keyboard
scrolling through or filtering 3000 rows would be very annoying on a quad-core desktop with 4gb of ram continuous ac power a 19 lcd a full-size keyboard and a standard mouse

1649829
firefox	safari
works fine in firefox and safari but i get nothing in ie7 it doesnt swap the first class on document ready nor does it swap anything on click

1649852
wordpress	joomla
perhaps take a selection of projects again i m thinking web based because web usability is more defined in my mind - cms blogging software drupal joomla wordpress

1649884
icmp	tcp
ping is an icmp packet and doesn t create a tcp connection hence you won t see it in netstat

1649885
client-side	server-side
the second is just wrong as mvc apps can leverage traditional server-side controls if they wish as well as make use of the rich library of client-side controls and libraries

1649919
elgg	moodle
i like elgg only because it is being used by a growing number of online education sites and i think it integrates very nice with moodle

1650014
folder	directory
set the working directory to the original build output folder so that file names are still valid in the temporary test folder

1650089
children	parent
you could look into using the parent and children functions

1650091
int	double
so the question what s the best way to compare double and int

1650123
int	double
if you want your comparison to return true if and only if the double precisely matches the int value has no fractions component you should cast your int to a double to do the comparison

1650123
int	double
if something like 1.1 would be considered equal to 1 you can either cast the double to an int if you want to ignore the fractional component altogether or round the double if you want say 1.9 to equal 2

1650129
post	get
in the log looks like typically on a save there s a post request that returns a 302 status followed by a get returning a lovely 200

1650129
post	get
on ie8 looks like sometimes post works but get doesn t

1650150
apache	nginx
if you were to then use nginx as a front-end for apache put apache on 8080 and nginx on 80 you could do this in your nginx config

1650150
apache	nginx
so if nginx discovers a cache entry with that key it will serve it directly from memory and you never have to touch php or apache

1650201
memcached	apc
since you already have apc installed it can be used similar to the memcached recommendations to store objects

1650211
vim	emacs
i have noticed that when i access the repository with a browser sometimes the pdf files in the repository show up as plain text as if you viewed the pdf with a text editor like emacs vim or notepad instead of being downloaded or opened with some pdf reader

1650224
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
is there a way to do this using linqdatasource or objectdatasource

1650225
background-color	transparency
have you tried explicitly giving the elements a background-color transparency

1650236
post	get
even if i echo the value of variable after post i get 12 ãƒâ 5

1650269
hash	md5
you could probably generate a md5 hash of the current datetime random number and truncate it to the length you need 5-8 characters and store it as the id field

1650349
gtk	clutter
the gtk docs usually don t contain examples for every single function because that would clutter them up and the documentation of functions like gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file is usually pretty straightforward

1650356
put	get
but if the element i want to have contain cdata is only one on the page how do i get it to not put cdata in all the other elements

1650357
richtextbox	linklabel
i am sure using a child linklabel or richtextbox to render my control s text will solve this but i don t like the idea of using a child control just to underline a few words

1650365
button	checkbox
based on this type i want to render the question to html in a specific way multiple choice radio button multiple answer checkbox etc...

1650376
implements	extends
if you needed more functionality than the library provides you could implements a partial class in your project and extends the library in that way

1650383
multiplying	add
for example a simple algorithm would be take the next sequence number multiplying by 12345678 generate a random number from 0 to 12345678-1 and add the two together

1650414
qevent	qobject
first thing i d try would be to install an event filter on the child widget see qobject installeeventfilter then in the parent widget grap the qevent paint event and do the painting there

1650414
qevent	qobject
bool draw eventfilter qobject watched qevent event

1650436
int	double
using double for testing 32-bit int you should be fine though

1650516
post	get
i have set method type as post but in save.php i just get values either in or but not in

1650519
hide	show
as i m using jquery s show and hide methods it means it ll often be in this state

1650523
min	max
java s double class has members containing the min and max value for the type

1650526
autofac	castle-windsor
this doesn t come out of the box with asp.net-mvc but you can find a number of options that will do the trick like castle-windsor or autofac

1650533
hash	salt
since unix became popular the right way to store a password has been to append a random value the salt and hash it

1650533
hash	salt
in that case all you re doing is complicating the hash and not functionally adding any salt

1650573
spaces	delimiter
any sequence of spaces tab newline is used as delimiter for splitting

1650574
profiler	yourkit
why don t you use something like yourkit or insert another profiler to see just how expensive this part of the loop is

1650660
int	boolean
don t be queasy about summing boolean python boolean are sharply defined as a subclass of int with exactly two instances which have peculiar str repr but otherwise behave exactly like the plain int 0 and 1

1650689
floating-point	integer
binary floating-point numbers have interesting precision characteristics since the value is stored as a binary integer raised to a binary power

1650703
for-loop	loops
your for-loop loops only once there is only one element to loops on which is the string

1650718
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events

1650748
hide	show
you can fine-tune your grant options and hide the data you don t want to show

1650754
width	height
it didn t work for me until i gave the rectangle a width and height

1650780
elgg	moodle
i have been experimenting with a lot of web development apps like drupal moodle efront and elgg lately

opera	google-chrome
then i cue up another browser instance - opera google-chrome whatever and enter the details page for that person

1650810
google-chrome	firefox
if i change it to google-chrome or firefox this doesn t happen

1650855
groovy	gsp
one other possibility is to view the source of the groovy code generated for your gsp

1650866
puts	gets
it gets my name right but then it s puts my day job in as the company at the top of each page

1650893
put	get
it seems anonymous types get a debuggerdisplayattribute put on them where

1650910
put	get
timestamp fields are unable to handle this data accurately for reasons i ll explain if your system is set to a dst timezone then what you put into timestamp may not be what you get back out

1650945
int	chars
with pack you can get the resulting int as a string base64_encode makes it a readable string of up to 6 significant chars 6 bits per byte so this could be your function

1650980
disk	ram
when you start the second instance the memory allocated by the first instance is paged out to disk making room in ram for the second instance

1650989
fitnesse	jbehave
technologies like fit fitnesse jbehave cucumber .

1650995
int	double	int	chars	int	boolean
another example of types that are not classes are the primitive types boolean byte chars short int long float and double are types but they are not classes

1651012
post	get
eg php with magic quotes on will escape the values in post and get before your script begins executing and if you then call mysql_escape_string as well... well it would be a mess

1651105
put	get
almost like it cached the request and its saying i did this already let me just return what i got before when i copy the url and put it in my browser i get the expected behavior why is this happening when i am making the requests through the silverlight app

1651130
put	get
just don t let them save strings and send to other people -- also don t put the values in the url via a get so that it can be emailed

1651166
postgresql	mysql
the hosting company does not support mysql or postgresql

1651171
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if you re using interface builder make sure the class for the viewcontroller your expecting to reload is defined select the viewcontroller in ib then cmd-4 make sure class is defined to be the class you want viewwillappear and viewdidappear to be called in

1651222
width	height
just use a single-dimensional dynamic array of width x height elements and calculate 1d indices from 2d coordinates as yourself

1651225
min	max
my question is how to choose the min and max values and the difference between the two should max-min be small or big

1651241
width	height
when i drop an html image onto my page vs2005 the height and width attributes are not specified

1651260
opera	firefox
i think the best bet is to wait as in late 2007 there was blogs for firefox and opera to have 3d support in canvas

1651278
google-chrome	firefox
note that google-chrome and firefox both render the same webpage just fine through cassini and iis7

1651318
children	parent
i have been tasked with trying to make a contact list that involves displaying the names of each of the children that attend this school along with their parent and contact information

1651318
children	parent
i have gotten to a point where i am able to show the children under each parent but now i have to find a way to merge these together

1651322
profiling	debugging
you know how vbulletin has a sql profiling when in debugging mode

1651323
nsstring	nsdata
if the receiverâ s contents are all property list objects nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary objects the file written by this method can be used to initialize a new array with the class method arraywithcontentsoffile or the instance method initwithcontentsoffile

1651346
superclass	subclassing
the problem was that uipickerview already has a delegate member variable and you were declaring another one in a subclassing which was what was being set while the superclass s delegate variable remained nil and therefore any delegate methods would not be called on the class you expect it to be called on

1651346
implements	extends
if you need to extends the given protocol do so have a class implements that then just set the class as the uipickerview s delegate

1651352
put	get
are you expecting the script to get executed when the option is chosen just because you ve put it in the value

1651361
min	max
just to answer the min and max value part i always use the same values for better startup performances and better reproducibility

1651362
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
a jmenuitem belongs to one and only one jpopupmenu or any other menu

1651369
many-to-many	one-to-many
one pair is a one-to-many relationship shape.containedby - shape.contains and the another is a many-to-many relationship shape.nextshapes - shape.previousshapes

1651378
children	parent
they are block of text with siblings parent and children

1651387
stdout	stderr
these communicate over inboxes and outboxes - as many as you like of each rather than just stdin stdout stderr

1651417
versioning	upgrade
you ll have access to essentially all of python 2.5 functionality not sure when ironpython will upgrade to a 2.6 versioning of python but 2.5 is already quite usable plus all the .net libraries and assemblies you know and love and tools such as visual studio add-ins

1651417
cpython	ironpython
the differences between cpython and ironpython and jython for that matter which applies the same concept as ironpython to the jvm -- jim hugunin was the originator of jython long before he moved to microsoft where he originated ironpython both projects now thrive are chiefly in garbage collection and threading ironpython and jython rely on their underlying platforms so you get mark-and-sweep garbage collection and free threading cpython rolls its own so it s mostly reference-count gc with mark-and-sweep once in a while to resolve reference loops and threading hampered by a global interpreter lock

1651468
for-loop	loops
and not to be nitpicky or anything but your first while loops would probably suit your needs better as a for-loop since you need a counter anyways

1651469
mouseover	mouseout
if i mouseover the navigation the drop_down div slides down and if i mouseout it slides up

1651473
post	put	post	get	put	get
it will allow you to specify the action verb get post put delete etc as well as request contents

1651488
gridview	sqldatasource
i d have to say plain old asp.net gridview bound to a sqldatasource

1651503
abc	subclassing
with your code an instance of d is an instance of c and consequently must accept any subclassing of a as an argument to its abc method

1651525
folder	directory
i am sure i have the right symbol file directory set and source folder are set as well

1651559
mouseleave	mouseenter
use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead new in prototype 1.6.1 but not new in ie

1651559
mouseover	mouseout
unlike mouseover and mouseout these events do not bubble from child elements

1651599
cvs	svn
i have no problems with it or it s support for version control systems such as svn cvs and clearcase

1651618
post	get
in the second inner .ajax call i need access to the record_id variable that i ve defined just inside the for-loop in order to update the correct record in the database however i can t seem to get access to that record_id variable inside the success function of the inner ajax post

1651624
post	get
i suppose you can use the example blog post above in order to get your user object to your controller method in order to pass it to your service layer

1651719
wsimport	jdk1.5	wsimport	jaxws-maven-plugin
we re using jaxws-maven-plugin to generate the source code however it depends on the wsimport binary being available this is not available in jdk1.5

1651826
cvs	svn
git can be setup in such a way that svn git and cvs clients can all connect

1651834
queue	fifo
the point of a queue is to provide a fifo fifo interface abstraction

1651862
x86	64bit
on x86 the fastest way to atomically write an aligned 64bit value is to use fistp

1651870
disk	ram
also since the clustering key is being added to each and every field of each and every non-clustered index on your table you re wasting a lot of space - both on disk as well as in server ram - when using 16-byte guid vs

1651871
hide	show
for example if a user hide the sports news container it won t be show on users next visit

1651893
filtering	grouping
then run the results through a filtering in the calling script to grouping them together

1651936
std	ostream
right now passing std endl into a ostream generates the cr character only for newlines

1651951
cassini	iis
my assumption as mentioned in my comment earlier was that ie is working in a different rendering mode depending on whether you are using iis or cassini and this is causing the layout differences

1651985
installation	upgrade
for some context i just upgrade ubuntu which broke my existing gitosis installation see here bug #368895 and have just reinstalled gitosis from packages

1652045
postgresql	mysql
and i also want to know whether i should start with postgresql or mysql

1652076
camping	ruby-on-rails	ramaze	camping
you can use the ruby-on-rails ramaze sinatra or camping frameworks

postgresql	mysql
their system defaults to postgresql but if you use mysql or sqlite on your development machine heroku will automatically import it and convert to postgresql when you push to it

1652121
pivot-table	crosstab
if you are familiar with pivot-table crosstab reports then this should be fairly straightforward

1652123
public	protected
in c# set access modifier public private or protected before the method getmyinfo generates the following error the modifier private is not valid for this item

int	chars
what s the difference between int somefunction const chars sm const ... and this int somefunction const chars sm ...

1652212
gif	png	tiff	png
optionally we may want to allow jpeg tiff gif png - any components to check these file types

1652225
ncover	testdriven.net
all but one of these test suites runs perfectly in the version of ncover that comes with testdriven.net 1.5.8

1652235
merb	ruby-on-rails	ramaze	merb
there are other frameworks like merb which is merging with ruby-on-rails sinatra and ramaze

1652244
gridview	rowdatabound
there is an event for the gridview called rowdatabound

1652249
my.cnf	mysql.sock
i m thinking maybe i missed something in the install process since i can t find the my.cnf or mysql.sock file on the system

1652255
getter	setter
how should i write my getter or setter in this case

1652286
getter	setter
if you want a mirror set_n instead of something which manipulates the data then you should probably drop the getter setter as you d be using them incorrectly and make the data member public

1652288
inherited	subclassing
note that twitternotification is a subclassing of notification implemented using single table inherited

1652330
kerberos	ntlm
finally this is perhaps splitting hairs but it should be kerberos authentication not ntlm because ntlm does not allow for constrained delegation and your normal application will need to be enabled for delegation if it accesses anything outside the local iis host

1652457
wordpress	joomla
cmss like wordpress drupal or joomla are widely used which keep all the data organized and do all the work of generating the page for you

1652519
onkeyup	onkeydown
try binding to one of the following events onkeydown onkeypress or onkeyup

1652561
puts	gets
with this it should be quite easy to write a category on nsobject with a method that gets the list of properties and puts them into a dictionary

1652575
rss	feed
i m trying to create a gadget for win 7 that retrieves the rss feed from a site

1652583
pascal	delphi
pascal and by extension delphi uses name equivalence rather than structural equivalence for array types including dynamic arrays

1652614
inherited	properties
the os already defines the tap on the status bar gesture to mean scroll to the top of the current view. uiscrollview has a properties scrollstotop that controls this behavior and uitableview inherited it

1652657
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also found that some browsers won t work with clickonce firefox without a plugin and google-chrome requires the setup.exe file to be download and started but the machine in question is using internet explorer though i m not 100 on the version

1652682
int	boolean
assuming i have a large number of int and boolean

1652683
versioning	upgrade
you can have the user go to and it will say what versioning of the framework he she has and how to upgrade to the latest versioning

1652695
apache-poi	docx4j
the java equivalents to the openxml sdk are docx4j my project and apache-poi

1652703
mouseover	mouseout
i am not looking for the typical mouseover mouseout combination

1652722
accessor	properties
you can t use arbitrary names with the dot-syntax â it had to be a known properties or accessor of the first operand

1652731
config	ini
i like nini which simplifies using xml for config files but you can also use it for ini files

1652734
config	ini
i usually use ini files for simple config

1652750
disk	ram
you could investigate the cpu disk ram usage of the two while you ve got process explorer running

1652775
put	get
i put the image on after i put the web browser on the form and i cant get it to be behind the browser

1652833
opera	firefox
i have checked ie8 firefox 3.5 opera 9 none of them have support for proxy authentication for socks5 proxy server

1652847
gtk	wnck
a solution given follow the thread involves using wnck which in python is a part of the gtk bindings

1652862
int	chars
for instance you may have an int located at and a chars array stretching from to

1652881
accessor	properties
of course you then get into the argument about whether its legal advisable to use properties accessor in initialise dealloc methods - some say yes some say no apple seem to be on the side of no but haven t ever really given a good reason that i can see

1652903
width	height
i was wondering if it s possible to verify a div s width and height on server side php without running any browser

it s much better to implement equals and gethashcode manually so that you get the results you expect

1652932
profiling	debugging
build your project in debugging mode with the new provisioning profiling

1652949
post	get
the 302 post pushes to browser to the 200 get but if the browser never processes the 302 then the django or the server will not log a 200 get because the browser never opened the page the server can only log what is accessed ergo the browser is not making the call

1652997
next	except
inside the brackets means it ll match everything except the next char

1653011
google-chrome	firefox
this works for me in firefox google-chrome and ie8.

1653030
16-bit	64bit
actual hardware doesn t use 32 bits to add 16-bit at a time only one extra bit of carry is ever needed for addition and almost all cpu s have a carry status flag for when an addition operation overflowed so if you are using a 32 bit cpu you can add 64bit operands in two 32 bit operations

1653050
spaces	delimiter
spaces are the delimiter for that config file

1653057
g++	gcc
alternatively if you re using g++ as a better c you may be able to use gcc for your final link step which will include libc automatically

this returned a bunch of methods including sort min max etc

1653318
post	get
i have its httprequest as a get but when i finally do load up the store with parameters it automatically changes to a post request

1653353
post	get
you probably would have to change your view to call your getloja regardless if the request is a post or get

1653359
inherited	subclassing
if i use inherited and later realize that a single subclassing needs a method or field that is not available should i declare that in the base class and not have it implemented in the other subclassing or should i declare it in that single subclassing

1653381
superclass	subclassing
however if you need to use it polymorphically then think about what that function would mean for other subclassing of the superclass

1653412

1653433
swt	swing
i now use java with both swing and swt

1653436
wxpython	pyqt
if i had a chance to start again i d probably go with pyqt based on advice from friends but wxpython will get the job done

1653449
post	get
your repository can then use getdatacontext as outlined in that blog post to get the context instance

1653512
put	get
get the data as a byte array then you can put it in a session variable save it as a file and send it as a response

1653522
postgresql	mysql
any decent dbms postgresql mysql if you re using the proper storage back-ends can give you acid guarantees and transactional support

1653535

hide	show
i have a sprite which i draw a white rectangle on below and want to use tweenlite to fade the sprite in and out but it either show or hide the the sprite

1653606

if you were dealing with non-objects like int or c strings or boolean then you will have to use nsnumber ... to turn those into objects and then object ... to turn them back into non-ojects to begin with

1653645
try-catch	exception-handling

bcoz this method calls when view rotates and at that time i want to set autoresizingmask method for that view so that when my subview rotates from portrait to landscape mode it s view resizes automatically

1654239
int	chars
as mentioned in other posts senderid and sequencenumber are both of type int which is likely to be larger than chars so these values will be truncated

hash	hmac
you could use cipher-based message authentication code cmac or maybe an hmac hash-based message authentication code if you have a hash function available

1654277

1654670
junit	testng
the recommendation to create junit or better yet testng tests is spot on

1654675
division	multiplication
another approach might be useful in contexts where integer multiplication and division is considered too costly which should be getting pretty rare these days

1654684
vb.net	vb6
unfortunately i can only suggest a workaround not a solution if you do not find a suitable activex control for your vb6 application you might consider migrating the communication part of your application to vb.net

width	height
doesn t the sprite always adapt itself to its contents to set its height and width

1655023
ironruby	ironpython
you should probably take a look at the ironruby and ironpython projects since they will provide the best overall integration with .net applications since they are themselves implementations of the ruby and python scripting languages on the .net platform

bazaar	git
the big three of distributed version control git bazaar and mercurial each treat branching fairly differently

1655235
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
in my mind bazaar s approach of one branch one repo makes branching more of a pain than git s approach to use a branch in bazaar i have to first create the branch then cd out of my current working copy then check out the new branch like i would in svn

hence i tried reinstalling eclipse by copying from inside the .zip directory of the installation folder and pasting it inside the eclipse program directory

1656334
hash	md5
one of the points that i go over in my paper is md5 being only one-way and the only way to crack an md5 hash is to continuously make strings and use an md5 function then compare it with the hash you want to crack

1656360
hash	md5
it is not true that the only way to crack an md5 hash is to generate every possible string and look for collisions

1656373
ant	maven
to glue it all together use maven my choice ant or groovy

i have this script to generate an xml file for an rss feed

1656584
datamapper	activerecord
i also had another look at my copy of patterns of enterprise application architecture and while it seems that the activerecord pattern is intended for a direct mapping of class to database table if you chose not to follow the repository approach from ddd then datamapper would be suitable for a composite mapping

1656626

1657026

1657438
integer	fractions
multiplying by an integer 1000 preserves the fractions number perfectly and may be a little faster too

1657454

what i don t understand is how to get back html that will display a form that allows you to edit the details of a user and ultimately send a put back to update the user.

1657472

browsers typically only support post and get for form actions - but doing a post to a resource that already exists isn t restful

1657512
min	max
it s definitely worth understanding the key-extraction approach even if you think you ve just solved your problem with a custom-comparison approach instead not just for performance but for future-proofness python 3 and for generality the approach also applies to min max itertools.groupby .

1657512
put	get
as you see once you get the reverser and key extraction concepts you pay essentially no price for using key extraction instead of custom comparison the code i suggest is 4 statements for the reverser class which you can write once and put into your goodies bag module somewhere three for the key extraction function and of course one for the sort or sorted call -- a total of eight vs the 4 + 1 5 of the custom comparison approach in the most compact form the one using either cmp with a sign change or cmp with swapped arguments

substance	jide
this is a technique i ve used successfully to wrap swing laf substance alloy jide as osgi bundles

0 is a chars which has a decimal value of 48 when coerced to an int

1658041
int	chars
c is a chars which can be converted to an int using a widening conversion 8 bits to however many bits an int has on your platform

1658041

innovative technologies spring hibernate wicket jsf ws rest ... - not sure the mentioned technologies are innovative but yes to spring hibernate ws

1658166
equals	gethashcode
but if you try to do something like implement iequatable all by itself then your equals method will never get called this seems to be due to gethashcode not being implemented properly

1658181
width	height
i know i would first need to find out the width and height of this flattened earth in kms calculate the number of regions and then somehow assign the long lats to each intersection of vertical horizontal line

1658183
getter	setter
if it really is something that needs to be encapsulated then you may want to make them private but provide getter and setter either make them private to base with getter and setter defined there or private to the derived classes with pure virtual getter and setter in base

1658191
getter	setter
if your derived classes would need access to these members provide setter and getter

1658199
folder	directory
replace old war in the server deploy directory with new one from temporary folder

1658238
inherited	properties
i define all of my settings in properties sheets and then individual projects only need to define which properties sheets they inherited

1658266
hex	binary
1111 in binary is f in hex which brings all the f s you see

1658297
hash	md5
if you don t need 256 bits of the hash truncate it to 128 you will have a much more secure alternative for md5

1658332
many-to-one	one-to-many
once your table is normalized as i said earlier nhibernate mapping is as simple as many-to-one on entitya or one-to-many set mapping on entityb depending upon direction of relationship between those two entity in domain

1658356
min	max
what i think you should do is increasing the min max

1658418
mp3	wav
i ve got this function which converts wav files to mp3

1658432
debian	linux
i ve managed to make it work on both windows and linux on debian it was a lot easier

1658439
width	height
and it is the same height and width as the external swf i am calling - i have replaced the frame to play to go to frame 1 because that is where a load of my code starts from in the external fla

1658454
int	double
also at least in my opinion a counter is almost never a double you should use an int type such as plain old int

1658492
printf	fgets
if you have a you can use functions like fscanf printf and fgets etc

1658544
superclass	subclassing
the idea is that you pass an instance of a factory class as an argument to some function or method or constructor which is then used to produce new object instances typically these are instances of some specific subclassing of a superclass that is known in advance

1658548
atoi	strtok
2 you can read the whole array at once and using strtok to divide the number and after that convert with atoi

1658556
jsf	wicket
innovative technologies spring hibernate wicket jsf ws rest ... from my pov those technologies are not innovative any more

gif	png
just to confirm it s working 100 with jpg gif png files and i have imagemagick installed and working this error only occurs with .tga files

1658581
width	height
the identify command is run on the tempfile to get the width height of the image

1658581
gif	png
with jpg png gif files identify can run on file without needing a valid extension eg .jpg to be able to recognise the file type

1658598
entity-relationship	diagram
my project is about drawing entity-relationship diagram for this i am using gwt

1658613
folder	directory
you have to add the zendx folder to your library directory - the one which also has your zend directory

1658626
width	height
when you load an image the image is decompressed and requires much more memory usually 4 width height bytes for a colour image than the size of the compressed file

1658632
google-chrome	firefox
but in non-ie browsers like firefox and google-chrome this iframe is again executing its javascript before the dialog is visible but then apparently re -executes it when the dialog is shown

1658649
postgresql	mysql
if not i d pick up mysql or postgresql from your list they both are good choices

1658649
postgresql	mysql
if you are interested by a comparison between mysql and postgresql check mysql vs postgresql from wikivs the open comparison website

1658665
postgresql	mysql
i would recommend postgresql over mysql

1658679
hide	show
which toggles the visibility show hide of some panels div s

1658693
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
i ve tried basichttpbinding wshttpbinding nettcpbinding with the net.tcp service running on both machines

1658749
icomparable	compareto
stupidstupidstupid the custom type has to implement icomparable as well as it seems the sortdescription uses the old fashioned non-generic version of compareto

1658751
uiview	calayer
i m able to composite my colors using quartz to draw an uiview but i want to separate each component into calayer uiview consume more resources

1658755
min	max
iinfo only offers min and max but finfo also offers useful values such as eps the smallest number 0 representable and resolution the approximate decimal number resolution of the type of arg

1658760
width	height
so i have approx 10 subviews uiimageview uilabel and i need to place them programatically considering their unpredictable contents different height width for the uilabel s depending on the text property

1658762
put	get
the best approach to get the visibility you ask about is to put this def statement in a module say fit.py import fit from any other module that needs access to items defined in this one and use fit.fitnesscompare in any of those modules as needed

1658769
opera	firefox
just to add to my question there is no trace of this problem in firefox or opera

1658792
qdialog	qwidget
also is the change from qwidget to qdialog on purpose

1658816
pull	push
once you think it s time for a release you tag your stuff probably as beta push it to origin go to your beta server and pull that tag from there for public testing

1658816
pull	push
the solution is simple though a has to pull from origin merging all changes introduced by b into a and then it can push .

1658896
width	height
i read all the php docs but there s nothing good to do this even imagegrabwindow sucks because of its high load browser limitations and also no x y or width height control

1658914
tostring	string.format
code often mixes concatenation + stringbuilder.append string.format tostring and other string operations using stringbuilder in such cases is hardly ever effective

1658934
width	height
one thing that make my div s bad is the float height and width - when you forget one of these in another div your problem -div maybe is wrong because of that

1658961
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
certain browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari are pretty close to being standard compliant

1658972
webkit	gecko
for example we have webkit in safari and gecko in mozilla

1658984
int	boolean
or you can just use the read annoteted property of each instance which being an int will obviously evaluate to the correct boolean value for unread books

1659038
post	put
but it s shows 2 dialogs and not until the page has come back from the server which makes sense as that s the way i ve got it coded do a post then take the result and put it in a dialog

1659038
post	put
how do i open the dialog do the post and put the resulting page in it

1659041
pop-up	dialog
after you pop-up the modal dialog use a settimeout to call your processor-intensive code

1659044
for-loop	arrays
in my opinion the arrays is overkill but you could have just as easily used it to get refernce to each clip as you added each circle reference in the same linear order they get added to the display list the same for-loop but ran against the arrays length instead of the container clips numchildren

1659051
post	get
scenario ii get post based input handling

1659051
post	get
otherwise if you want to display on the basis of get or post input you can place something default value as

1659079
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
it would be nice if the tool could handle as many as possible of ogg mp3 and wav files

1659085
put	get
you just need to get an imgur developer key and put it in linup_control.py

1659092
implements	extends
the sortedlist extends a collection by implements icomparer to provide the sort functionality

1659115
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this does not include internet explorer so you will probably want to use safari firefox or opera

1659223
int	double
my best thesis unsupported by the data above is that somehow you have not got the conversion from int to double taking place in the calls to the constructor but i confess i don t understand how that could happen

1659287
post	get
this nice setting up sun s visualvm on mac osx blog post explains how to get it working on mac osx

1659292
int	chars
maybe use the streamwriter.write chars buffer int index int count overload

1659297
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
in a complex number the real and imaginary parts behave like real numbers so all of the operations + - sqrt sin cos etc can be inherited form the class of objects called real instead of having to be written in code

1659322
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
your complex class would need to handle the extra logic needed around how to add subtract multiplying divide etc two complex numbers together

1659344
visualvm	yourkit
visualvm and yourkit as pointed out by the others here are both good as well

1659347
width	height
are you trying to set the max width height and add scroll bars if the the table ends up being bigger

1659371
keydown	keyup
your best be would probably to use timeouts with keyup or keydown events -- restart the timeout timer every time the event is fired

1659371
keydown	keyup
you will need js handlers to handle the keydown keyup events

1659377
rss	feed
i ve been thinking i could use xslt to translate the rss feed into html and display it within the page but that would leave out any commenting functionality

1659400
int	double
it might be getting confused when trying to do the translation from int to double

1659401
terminate	timeout
but it seems barring any bugs in the code of the two that if your java connection client has a timeout set lower than the default heartbeat for couchdb continuous changes then the connection could get terminate by the java client

1659421
int	chars
now in the datatype world of common languages like c and java you ll never find a complex type given for primitive type int chars etc

1659447
yacc	bison
software for doing this includes antlr yacc bison scala s cala.util.parsing.combinator.syntactical library and plenty of others

1659452
nginx	lighttpd
you can direct the subdomain to a different server that is running a lighter weight web daemon such as nginx or lighttpd

1659471
addclass	removeclass
also i think what you are looking for instead of a delayed switchclass that might not trigger the live event handler try using instead with the above addclass removeclass

1659478
for-loop	arrays
yet the conditional on the for-loop which michael showed to be your problem subtracts another 1 from questioncount which means that your for-loop will never reach the last element in the arrays

1659617
bash	zsh
if you mean i m going to be extensively typing it in at a shell prompt i want the mysterious but utter conciseness of bash or zsh

1659617
bash	zsh
- -- in which case very different considerations apply wrt real scripting languages such as bash or zsh or lua or tcl for a different definition of scripting language

1659646
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop assumes you ll access the objects by their index but then after each iteration you re deleting something out of the arrays which shifts all the indexes after that point

1659651
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
use fileinputstream and fileoutputstream to specify the file to save it into

1659663
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you could use a very simple approach based on the java.util.properties class which has indeed a load and store methods that you can use in conjunction with a fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

1659698
inherited	properties
server is properties of the page class that your page inherited from it not a

1659714
pop-up	dialog
i want to pop-up a dialog box that says saving... and once the operation is completed it simply disappears

1660276
int	chars
chars fgets chars restrict s int n

1660276
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

1660301
width	height
the problem is that the canvas and its contents should autoresize when the grid resizes width and height

1660323
mouse	keyboard
my guess is that one qapplication would accept the mouse event or keyboard event and therefore the other would not get it

1660334
free	malloc
i imagine it s something to do with malloc free but i don t know which one

1660358
free	malloc
it is not really malloc free which causes the exception it is new which is definitely in c++ part of your application

1660417
int	boolean
now whenever my efficientadapter gets a data object which is a separator it returns false for public boolean isenabled int position and public view getview int position view convertview viewgroup parent inflates two different layouts depending on if the current data object consists of real data or is just a separator dummy

1660421
disk	ram
we also got one gigabyte i-ram google it for information which is basically a ram hard disk with battery backup

1660628
google-chrome	firefox
works for firefox and google-chrome and does not for ie while using

1660639
put	get
actually you tend to get the first row in mysql storage order which a lot of the time will be the first one you put in the database which is a bit of a trap because sometimes that s what you want so it looks like it s working until the order changes for some reason and everything goes wrong

1660671
children	parent
if you use xsl variable without the select attribute you always create an implicit parent with the variable and the contents of the variable are the children underneath it

1660687
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe

tcplistener	tcpclient
use the standard .net tcpclient and tcplistener classes -- they are trivial to use and do what you want

1660838
cpu	processors
as adathedev says if it s using 100 cpu then the issue is with your algorithm not how windows is allocating processors time to the thread

1660901
translation	localization
you could use localization libraries such as gettext to manage translation

1660903
yacc	bison
there are other other tools like parser generators yacc or bison that are designed for such structures and can handle them well

1660915
jstl	taglib
jsp is a view technology which provides a template to write plain vanilla html css js in and enables interaction with backend java code with help of taglib like jstl and expression language el those things

1661055
outputstream	inputstream	outputstream	bufferedinputstream	bufferedoutputstream	inputstream	bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
have the huge data somewhere in a database or on the disk file system and obtain it as an inputstream the default way from db by resultset#getbinarystream or from disk by fileinputstream and write it to the outputstream through a bytebuffer and or bufferedinputstream bufferedoutputstream

1661060
getter	setter
this is my getter setter

1661061
uisearchbar	uisegmentedcontrol
has anyone managed to color the scopebar portion of a uisearchbar it has a tintcolor property but setting it does not affect the attached scopebar uisegmentedcontrol

1661089
getter	setter
just another thought when you create a full sized array in the getter why do you need a setter anymore

1661108
expression-blend	silverlight
for wpf itself a gui api there s expression-blend which is a tool afaik written in .net that focuses on graphical design for wpf and silverlight applications

1661117
ubuntu	linux
for example i use ubuntu linux and perl is a component of the system

1661117
ubuntu	debian
but the ubuntu system perl interpreter is not in good shape due to some dubious setup decisions by the debian people so installing things like cpan modules is tricky

squeak	visualworks
in particular swazoo runs in gnu smalltalk visualworks squeak pharo gemstone and dolphin

1661265
post	get
so your gadget can only post delta s and get notified on updates but could by definition not participate in conflict resolution and the like

1661293
hide	show
even though i declare the item s root layout to wrap_content and each component in the item to fill_parent the view i hide show which is supposed to change the item s height is simply cut off at the bottom instead of its parent the item layout growing in height to fully display it

1661296
floating-point	fractions
floating-point numbers are imprecise especially since they work in binary fractions 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 1 32 ... instead of decimal fractions 1 10 1 100 1 1000 ...

1661316
floating-point	integer	16-bit	64bit
however big arrays provide more space-efficient storage of integer and floating-point elements in particular because they support â œsmallâ types such as single-precision floats and 8 and 16-bit integers in addition to the standard caml types of double-precision floats and 32 and 64bit integers

1661318
width	height
have a silverlight page use 100 width height of the html page

1661341
mp3	wav
i am developing one j2me application to play wav mp3 file

1661383
octal	decimal
in this case it doesn t matter because a single digit octal constant has the same value as the equivalent decimal constant but in c

1661383
octal	decimal
whether an integer literal is expressed in octal decimal or hexadecimal once it is parsed by the compiler it is just treated as a value

1661385
octal	hex	octal	decimal
octal is a numbering system based on 8 instead of 10 for decimal or 16 for hex

1661392
octal	decimal
for 005 both the octal and decimal representations are the same and should not bother you but still it s asking for trouble unless you specifically meant the octal representation

1661392
int	chars
in general x d will print an int x chars wide and will pad with leading spaces

1661433
vb.net	vb6
i am having trouble converting some code from vb6 to vb.net i don t have as much experience with .net

1661443
jhat	jvisualvm
a heap dump might be able to tell you what lingers where jmap and jhat are included in the jdk or you can use jvisualvm if you want a gui

1661503
ant	maven
a build tool like ant or maven

1661523
hide	show
basically i have simple animations that show hide div layers and also that move top down - left right some of the div layers

1661567
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works as expected in ie firefox google-chrome and opens the links on the opener howeve safari opens all links in a new window and not the opener

1661587
superclass	subclassing
originally i had a design problem where i needed five subclassing of a superclass where all but two would use the same generic method of doing things and the other two classes would need special handling

1661587
superclass	subclassing
i could of course make an abstract dosometing method in the superclass and make each subclassing implement its own version but that would duplicate code in three of the classes

1661597
submit	submission
if i prevent the redirect then i see the output but that s not a typical workflow for form submission - i submit to the same action validate and process and then redirect where i want the user to end up. this is an established web app

1661686
floating-point	integer
on a philosophical note i wonder most computer cpus today have built-in support for integer arithmetic and floating-point arithmetic but no support for decimal arithmetic

1661713
dia	argouml
without i know dia and argouml

1661722
width	height
if it still is no the case then check that your timeaxis has not a fixed width or height or a defined horizontal verticalalignment

1661753
hide	show
i need to show or hide some of the buttons when the mouse enters the toolstrip

1661753
mouseleave	mouseenter
the toolstrip s mouseenter event fires when the mouseenter but mouseleave does not always fire when the mouseleave

is there any way to hide a column in a jqgrid table but have it show as read-only when the row is edited in the form editor modal dialog

1661823
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m having trouble popping a uiviewcontroller off of a uinavigationcontroller even though the reference to the nav seems to be correct and a count on viewcontrollers shows the right number

1661846
udp	tcp
i am aware that i probably know only about a drop in the oceans worth when it comes to udp and even tcp

1661846
peer	p2p
could and should i consider p2p peer to peer for multiplayer

1661855
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
why aren t you just accessing the navigationcontroller property of your view controller rather than casting its parentviewcontroller as a uinavigationcontroller which is a bad idea regardless

1661881
matplotlib	scipy
also i ve gotten away with using python numpy scipy and some plotting like matplotlib libraries in the past which gives you some more options in terms of libraries

1661889
maven	m2e
i use m2e to import maven java projects in eclipse

1661889
folder	directory
this directory isn t in the list of sources folder while src main java or src main resources do

1661956

1667317
getter	setter
the synthesize directive relies on this to generate the setter and getter

1667331
prepare	execute
i believe that the same thing happens with the parameterised prepare query this is called parameter sniffing - the execution plan is optimised for the parameters used the first time that the prepare statement is execute however this definitely doesn t happen when you declare the parameter and use it in the query

1667740
fasta	biopython
my suggestion is use biopython to perform the parsing of the fasta file

outputstream	inputstream
in that case simply provide an inputstream reader from which to read your data or accept an outputstream writer to which you write your data

1667843
outputstream	inputstream
the inputstream reader outputstream writer idea is basically the same concept applied to the java api

1667850
outputstream	inputstream
without more information it s impossible to give you a better solution but i d say that one common abstraction for writing data to multiple locations is to use the java.io classes inputstream outputstream or reader writer

1667862
outputstream	inputstream
in fact inputstream reader stdin and outputstream writer stdout provide just that

1667872

unfortunately there s absolutely no way to do that currently as get and set prefixes are hard-coded in generate getter setter wizard code

1668537
jobs	cron
how about using cron jobs you can call urls with cron job which can be your servlet that handle the logic

1668548
hash	salt
the formula should not be heavily weighted toward the first 6 digits of the card bin number though and no trace of the formula should be stored in the same location as either the salt or the final hash

1668548
hash	md5
i don t have any benchmarks handy but i m pretty sure 1 million hash operations per minute is not unreasonable for md5 or any flavor of sha on a suitably powerful machine

1668552

- he s right it s distinct union of sets otherwise you d get repeat employees wherever an employee belongs to more than one department

1668582

1668761
folder	directory
none of the other folder in this directory have underscores and it looks stupid

1668800
decimal	ieee
if you put a float in the arguments where printf is told to expect an integer the output will be a decimal representation of the ieee floating point bytes -- probably not what you intended and not what a true cast would have done

1668834
disk	ram
the dlls and executables are loaded using memory-mapped-files so they re not actually copied to ram they are still on disk just having their bytes mapped to process virtual address space

and i want to convert it to a while loops mostly because i want to play with the value of i inside loops to go backwards and forwards and my co-worker thinks that doing this in a for-loop is prone to problems

1668914
for-loop	loops
and i want to convert it to a while loops mostly because i want to play with the value of i inside loops to go backwards and forwards and my co-worker thinks that doing this in a for-loop is prone to problems

1668917
for-loop	loops
it s not going to matter if it s a for-loop or a while loops the point is will the indexer eventually lead you to make a decision of loops termination

min	max
will set min and max in one pass if the array has any elements

1669234
division	multiplication	getter	setter
you could attempt to obfuscate your score values in memory to make them harder to find with cheatengine for example storing them as a multiplied value then in your getter and setter for the score value include a multiplication division of the values to get set the proper score for your views and score submission widgets

1669243
setinterval	settimeout
you can either use setinterval or settimeout depending on how you want to do things

1669266
implements	extends
of course you would have to implements the queryinterface _addref and _release methods and extends the interface to do something more useful

1669347
children	parent
if you want a parent to have 1 or more children use a parent attribute on each record and have root nodes have a parent of id 0 or some other meaningful value

if you want nodes may have multiple parent and children use a separate table to store the relationships

1669362

1670067
int	chars
i once participated in the clean up of a large codebase where the previous authors had thrown int hresults std string chars random classes.

1670151
clang	llvm
for example you could write a self-modification core in c++ to interface with clang and llvm and the rest of the program in c

i ve successfully converted a mysql database to postgresql with it --it should support sqlite

1670441
min	max
we know the ints are bounded by a min and a max

1670475
folder	directory
i am trying to hide files in a directory on a webserver by using random folder names

this way when you change your selected class to unselected or vice-versa the live event will update note hover is not supported with the current version of jquery so you d have to use mouseover and mouseout

1670617

try this it works in ff3 and ie7 and i assume safari and google-chrome

1670640

i d strongly recommend going with either ironpython or ironruby over creating your own custom language.

1670665

the primitive types are defined to be the same on all machines and in all implementations and are various sizes of two s-complement int single- and double-precision ieee 754 standard floating-point numbers a boolean type and a unicode chars chars type

1670698
put	get
i also agree with the suggestion to use a synchronized wrapper if you only need to synchronize the get put calls and don t have any bigger synchronized blocks

1670773
put	get
i have even put a break point on the getter in the dependancy property and it does not get hit

1670799
folder	directory
i used this to copy required libraries into my lib folder compile the flex sources using the ide build which has eclipse-integration with error messages which a pure ant-based commandline build would miss and copy the result to a common deploy directory renaming the wrapper html file in this process

1670801

ssl through https then it ll request

1670811
superclass	subclassing
at runtime you can substitute a subclassing of superclass this is the liskov substitution principle

1670818
stdout	stderr
additionally you need to consume stdout and stderr concurrently in order to avoid blocking and a possible process hang

1670837
post	get
make the form submission use post and then after saving have it send a 303 header and send them to the post-submit url via a location header which will be fetched via get and a refresh will not be re-posting data

1670866
cpu	processors
as gman points out this code obscures your intent from the compiler and the processors so the performance may be worse than using a temp variable especially on a modern cpu

1670884
getter	setter
yes this is acceptable private fields should be used to enforce encapsulation by controllingb access to these field through getter setter methods if required

1670892
getter	setter
breakpoints in dependency properties don t actually work - wpf bypasses the getter and setter once the binding is established

1670910
stdout	fflush
automatically fflush stdout without printing a newline

1670915
width	height
the first button is in the upper right corner with width 62 and height 35 and initial title 0.99

1670918
hex	binary
if you want to count the bits it would be simpler to set up an array that tells you how many bits are set in each hex digit indexed by character code and then add things up without explicitly converting to binary

1670926
public	protected
this is generally be a good principle to start with as protected and public member variables should only be used when you have a good reason to do so

1670928
ant	maven
this is a system built with ruby rubygems and rake that provides many of the features found in maven and ant but with a much cleaner syntax and simpler build scripts

1670941
post	get
so when you build your link you control the state of the _request variable using the query parameters get or post and the hidden parameters cookies

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am working on linux mint ubuntu btw

1671141
fadein	fadeout
fadein operates on an existing element s and animates the opacity of the element just like fadeout

1671157
pull	push
the opposite of ienumerable pull can be expressed as it s dual in iobservable push

1671179
versioning	upgrade
if the versioning is different upgrade is send back to the utility other wise good

1671179
versioning	upgrade
if the utility receives upgrade it sends the users to a predetermined url to download the newest versioning of the utility

1671214
implements	extends
if you need to implements the iterator yourself it may help to extends abstractiterator in that same package

1671265

if you modify any of the following properties of a movieclip object that contains a motion tween flash player stops the playhead in that movieclip object alpha blendmode filters height opaquebackground rotation scalex scaley scale9grid scrollrect transform visible width x or y

1671267
intersect	contains
if you take the intersect of two lists as it looks like you re doing the result will be a single list that contains all of the elements that are in both of the lists

1671272
width	height
then set positon to 0 0 and width and height to 100

1671328
filtering	grouping
in ms sql we currently grouping sum filtering about 30gb of data in 4 minutes somewhere around 17 million records i think

1671396
pellet	jess
can someone explain the differences between a dl reasoner like pellet deafult owl reasoner and a rule engine like jess

for a relational database that represents the current term enrollment at a large university what is the entity-relationship diagram for a schema that takes into account all the assertions given

1671626
folder	directory
the vod directory in applications inside of your fms installation folder is a good place to start

1671629
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
the actual counts 100 200 800 should be irrelevant on the final entity-relationship diagram but they should give you a good clue as to the types of relationships 1 to n n to 1 n to m that the entities have with each other

1671639
width	height
animate height width work - i m just trying to simplify the function

1671679
pull	push
a push or a pull moves all the changesets from one repo to another that aren t already in that repo

1671679
changeset	cherry-pick
however the drawback to using import export transplant and cherry-pick in general is that you can t really move over g without its ancestors because in mercurial a changeset s name is its hashid which includes the hashids of its parents

1671686
magento	oscommerce
there is also a tool from magento which allows you to migrate from oscommerce to magentocommerce

1671690

1671736
hide	show
you can load the data all at once when the page loads then just show hide as needed

1671736
hide	show
using javascript jquery recommended when a tab is clicked hide all content and then show that tabs content

1671752
post	get
so for example if you don t own a certain post say #3 yet you try to drop its id in post destroy 3 you will get shut out

1671753
mbunit	nunit	nunit	moq
i have had success with both mbunit and nunit along with something like rhino.mocks or moq so that you can create mock objects within your tests

1671771
width	height
to achive the hoverpulse effect i think you need to change the height and width of the element but also it s position to make it looks like a zoom instead of a resize

1671771
width	height
after you calculate the new height width top and left attributes if the element is absolutely positioned you can use animate like this

1671807
min	max
as explained by alex m on this page all the column names referenced in the select list and which are not used in the context of an aggregate function max min avg count and the like must be included in the order by clause

1671808
versioning	upgrade
see versioning and edition upgrade

1671836
inherited	properties
make sure the inherited properties in the aspx page matches the class definition in the .cs file

1671836
inherited	properties	classname	inherited
in the example above it is testapp.test in the inherited properties and the class must have the same namespace and classname testapp and test

1671844
pop-up	dialog
every time dialog pop-up a huge div is being created on the background and ie keeps changing vertical scroll bar s thumb size and if there was a huge page downloading in the background

1671853
put	get
if you put it in the body then you get to be lazy and not worry about ever doing it again but your going to lose control because everything on the page will have the line-height set to 1.5

1671969
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is in the ie 7 screen shot the area shown with the red crossed box should be black like it is in the firefox screen shot and how it is in google-chrome

1671999
profiling	benchmarking
just start the profiling run the old code stop it and note your benchmarking

1672027
filtering	grouping
if you want to filtering out records before the grouping the condition goes in the where clause and if you want to filtering out grouping records the condition goes in the having clause

1672035
width	height
then from excel or access it is important to do some adjustments adjust columns width and rows height modify titles so on to make it easy to print

1672082
stdio	fflush
you haven t fflush the stdio buffer to the operating system and you haven t asked the operating system to fflush its buffers to physical storage

1672083
int	boolean
also why can t it be an int or boolean

1672088
src	attr
css3 attr eg src content attr src url

1672093
int	boolean
if you want to treat the string command line parameters as int or boolean you are expected to do the conversion yourself

1672095
int	boolean
you could have designed it to take int or boolean but that would have added more work to the java runtime for potentially little benefit

1672095
int	boolean
strings can be used to transmit any sort of information into the main program including int and boolean

1672104
int	boolean
if you want to convert that text into int or boolean you have to do that yourself - how would the operating system or java bootstrapper know exactly how you wanted everything to be parsed

1672113
integer	unsigned
in the documentation i found for the screensaver sessionidletime it returns a unsigned integer

1672134
hide	show
at certain cases i want to show all three tab bar items and some cases i want to hide the 3rd tab bar item from the tabbar

1672142
put	get	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter
the same thing happens if i put the handler on document or document.body except that surprisingly document.body does not get mouseover mouseout events when the mouseenter or leaves an empty part of the window such as the empty vertical space created by absolutely positioning an element with bottom 0

1672142
mouseover	mouseout
for that space document and window will get mouseover mouseout events with the target being html but document.body will not.

1672142
mouseover	mouseout
also register a mouseover handler and detect cases where mouseout is not proceeded by or followed shortly by a a mouseover

1672149
int	chars
so in your example r is a pointer to a pointer to an int and it s value is the address of p a pointer to a chars

1672155
scons	qmake
i think the easiest way would be to use cmake qmake or scons to generate your xcode project for you

1672168
nunit	moq
i suggest you combine nunit and moq for object mocking

1672221
stringbuilder	stringwriter
the underlying reason is that when you call xmlwriter.create with a stringbuilder it creates a new stringwriter instance which always has an encoding of utf-16 and creates an xmlwriter around that stringwriter

1672239
opensuse	linux
i know that it is possible to read out vendor id and firmware version of the cf card somehow i saw it on an embedded system but i don t know how to achieve that on my linux box opensuse 10.3 and a usb cf card writer

1672242
integer	unsigned
or are you trying to have an unsigned 32 bit integer variable

1672250
mouseover	mouseout
perhaps you can set a listener for mouseover and mouseout document body or some other element that wraps the entire document and use that by saving that it happened as a trigger to determine whether it is a valid mouseout on window

1672250
width	height
if it is anything farther than height width of the window you left the actual window

1672250
width	height
and possibly if it is exactly the height width or exactly top 0 or left 0 then you left the window

1672260
hash	md5
the md5 algorithm is a broken however your mac is immune to the prefixing attack to generate hash collisions because the beginning of the your secret

google-chrome	firefox
the major browsers that i ve tested apps on ie firefox and google-chrome all default to using the same collection of cookies regardless of whether you are opening a duplicate web page in a new tab or a new browser instance

1672424
mouseout	mouseleave
on ie you could instead use mouseleave which is a non-bubbling version of mouseout

1672424
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
ie has events called mouseenter and mouseleave that are non-bubbling versions of mouseover and mouseout

1672424
mouseleave	mouseenter
this makes it possible to implement mouseenter and mouseleave in other browsers

1672446
google-chrome	firefox
if you the click back again here s where i get differing results in ie6 7 and firefox google-chrome ie8

1672446

1672537
int	chars
x can be enums strings int chars you get the picture

1672546
hide	show
you could take a screenshot of your current view save it in memory as a texture hide the old view and simultaneously show an opengl view

1672571
post	get
you could write a simple php page that takes a user input via post or get that calls a server side executable and then once the executable has done its thing returns the results to the user as a http response

1672672
children	parent
each item in my list can have multiple parent and multiple children where the starting item has no parent which defines it as a start element

1672672
children	parent
now all i need to do is get the co-ordinates for each element so that everything is positioned correctly with the parent above the children in a centered position

1672672
children	parent
if an element has only 1 child then the child is placed below the parent on the same x co-ordinate if the parent has more than one child then the children are placed with equal spaces apart and the parent needs to be in the middle above the children to two equal length lines join to both the children from the parent

1672673
.htaccess	httpd.conf
after a lot of cursing i also found out that it depends on whether the rewriterules are inside a directory directive or .htaccess on the one hand or in your virtualhost directive or just in the main body of an httpd.conf on the other hand

xsl-fo	xslt
the problem with pdf - if going down the xslt route is that you need something to convert xsl-fo into a pdf document not only that it will introduce more complexity and - in terms of a quick win - quite a bit more to learn

post	get
get post instead of soap where does

1674882
post	get
if you re using get post with .net web services soap doesn t come in to the picture at all

1674882
post	get
you ll also notice that as your service gets more complex you lose the ability to call the service through get post because the complexity of soap is needed to wrap the data

1674889
rational-numbers	base
a rational-numbers p q with can be expressed a finite representation in base b if and only if every prime factor of q divides b

1675128
bitwise-and	bitwise-xor
scheme has a function called bitwise-and ... which is equivalent to the operator in c there is also bitwise-xor ... bitwise-not .. etc. which do the expected thing

1675151
children	parent
and if a child is unticked then if all the other children are unticked then the parent needs to be unticked

1675151
children	parent
i m doing this with event handlers on the checkboxes but i ve come against the problem where checking a child with the cursor then programmatically checks the parent which then programmatically checks all it s children

switch to firebug console without moving a mouse using keyboard shortcuts maybe

1675443
post	get
if post satisfies the semantics of your resource and how you intend to manipulate it switching to get just to use jsonp feels ugly to me

1675446
typedef	struct
you can define a function with the same name of the struct as the identifiers are kept in different spaces but you cannot define a function with the same name as a typedef as those identifiers collide

1675455

put	get
and don t forget to close the registrykey object when you are done with it or put the statement to get the value into a using block

1675964
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
in order to be optimal you should use manualresetevent or autoresetevent so that your thread is resumed as soon as the dependent operation finishes

1675988
width	height
it looks like in the demo the div that the picture sits in is a set height and width

1675988
width	height
the pictures that are displayed are all the same set width and height the same width and height as the containing div

1675988
width	height
in order for you to have the same look as the demo you will have to make your images and thumbnails a uniform height and width

1675997
mxmlc	compc
is there a parameter to compc or mxmlc that i m missing

1676030
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
out of curiosity why manualresetevent and not autoresetevent

1676030
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if it s i need to wait until the other thread finishes for reasons other than resource access then use an autoresetevent or manualresetevent

1676056
folder	directory
i wanted to check-out the tag revision from the repo of fluent nhibernate from which 1.0rtm was created.but even after looking through the directory structure i couldn t figure out which one was that. its pretty simple for nhibernate though since they have a tags folder with the periodically released tags

1676197

1676464
int	chars
3 chars s 3 bytes 2 int 2 4 bytes so 3 + 8

1676464
int	chars
this is because you cannot fit three chars s and an int into that 4 byte word and so there s one byte of padded space there which pushes the int into it s own word

1676492
google-chrome	firefox
everything is fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie 6 7 the sifr titles do not appear in any divs apart from the first in the cycle

1676501
junit	testng
junit and testng are initially unit testing frameworks but can be used for integration testing as well

1676512
rdf	owl
i guess my question is also is sparql rdf owl ready for serving large real-world data warehouses for an enterprise

1676516
httphandler	httpcontext	httphandler	httpmodule	httpcontext	httpmodule
well for starters page.response implies that you have a current valid page object httpcontext is static and can be called at any time - like in your global.asax or and httpmodule httphandler

1676530
freebsd	linux
in your case if you re sure your .bashrc is going to be used only on gnu linux and on a bsd system you can check for switches that exist in one of the ls but not in the other for example -d doesn t seem to be an accepted switch by ls on my bsd machines freebsd and mac os x whereas it is for gnu ls

you can copy the exe over yourself go to the bin folder in the directory your source code is in and copy it there

1676679
hash	salt
transactions and otherwise sensitive material could easily be hidden with a salt + hash string and stored in another column in your database if you wanted to but if you re still not validating user input which in web programming clearly could be navigating through the uri you re missing the point

1676690
ubuntu	debian
for the stripped-down version of vim shipped with debian ubuntu by default type s # in the third step instead

1676749
xsl-fo	xslt
advantages if you understand html and xslt creating output with xsl-fo is not a lot harder than creating html with xslt software is open source

1676829
width	height
width of all images and on sum of all image height

1676916
subtract	add
so i would already know what the numbers were for a year a given month a given week and a given day for a store and if they ask for a particular range i use the various scales to quickly add up something that gives the right results but i don t have to necessarily reprocess the full data set i just retrieve four or five records and add or subtract them

1676920
move	drag
i want the user to be able to touch drag on the screen inside or outside of the large circle and it will move the smaller circle in that direction

1676931
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems stores times as local times which means that it s just completely screwed

1676966
interpolation	splines
the converse would apply at higher levels of zoom - to the point where you would need to use interpolation like linear polynomial splines etc on the data to estimate at the values between your data points

1676987
jrebel	hotswap
i m wondering if there is something like hotswap hotdelpoy jrebel known from java world in .net desktop applications no stateless webapps

1677036
rss	feed
i m using a third-party ajax slideshow for a website that takes an rss feed as its picture source

1677036
rss	feed
i would like to randomize the order of the pictures but that s not a feature of the slideshow or the rss feed i m pulling from

1677036
rss	feed
surely it shouldn t be difficult to write a short function in php that takes an external rss feed randomizes the items and re-publishes the same feed out of order

1677072
width	height
essentially i want to have a fixed height on the field and stretch it horizontally across the width

1677092
folder	directory
your webserver should be setup with a virtual directory pointing to the published folder and it would be a good idea to have a default.aspx page in the folder since the webserver looks for this page as it s starting point

1677114
inherited	properties
interfaces do not define implementations thus ilocation doesn t inherited the properties of ilocationsource

1677143
button	checkbox
you can add image and even controls like button and checkbox to tricheditwb

1677186
int	double
actually i see you using a function outvalue.aslong which i would expect to return a long value which is an int instead of a double value which is floating point and it ll be more convenient to deal with an int in this case

1677186
put	get
we get the value into long_value and then use the sprintf function to put the value into string_value

1677208
ant	maven
another approach i ve seen in java is a build-time approach where you use ant token substitution or maven build profiles to build environment-specific packages

1677232
stringbuilder	bufferedwriter
since you re ultimately writing to a file a better approach would be to write to the bufferedwriter more often instead of creating a huge stringbuilder in-memory and writing everything at the end depending on your use-case you might even be able to eliminate the stringbuilder entirely

1677276
mouse	trackpad
how does what is happening in multitouchsupport.framework differ between the magic mouse and a glass trackpad

1677276
mouse	trackpad
if it is based on iokit device properties i suspect you will need a kext that emulates a trackpad but actually communicates with the mouse

1677285
northwind	adventureworks
how about microsoft s northwind or adventureworks sample databases

1677291
stringbuilder	bufferedwriter
if possible use bufferedwriter from the beginning on instead of stringbuilder to save memory

1677299
submit	submission
i know how to submit through code and have it submission to the sharepoint site the default connection but how do i submit to a specific connection

1677306

note i can set the fields just fine without the form being submitted using perl vbscript python autoit etc

1677421
pop-up	dialog
what kind of pop-up dialog are you talking about

1677421
width	height
just compute the center of the jframe and subtract half the width height of the jdialog to get your dialog s upper left corner

1677422
rss	feed
rss utilities by rodrigo oliveira will make it dead easy to parse rss feed it wont handle subscriptions etc you d have to do that

1677464

1677482
x86	mips
it s the case in x86 powerpc mips sparc ee and the cell spus

1677543
versioning	upgrade
but there may be downsides such as having to stick with the versioning of castle that nhibernate is compiled against rather than being able to upgrade the ioc container when i choose

1677553
tax	shipping
else a diversified approach could potentially reduce shipping bank or even tax overheads

1677579
firefox	safari
edit strike that it works both ways in my test case under safari 4.0.3 and firefox 3.5

1677584

1677692
udp	tcp
lccs sounds like a fuller solution for offering p2p gaming as well as standard client server udp or tcp based gaming

1677692
udp	tcp
it attempts p2p udp if that fails it can fall back to client dedicated server tcp or udp communication

1677735
int	chars
because on your machine an int is four bytes but a chars is 1

1677743
int	chars
on most modern architectures an int will be exactly the length of 4 chars s.

1677745
int	chars
you are using a chars size pointer to write into an int size memory space

1677745
int	chars
-1 happens to be 0xff for a chars and 0xffffffff for a int so after writing four 0xff you get one int sized -1

1677768

the main differences differences between memcmp and strcmp are

1677768

containers like hashset rely on the hash function to determine where to put it and where to get it from when asked for it

1678256
put	get
if you put a in with value v and look up b you should expect to get v back since you ve said a.equals b

i think a better approach would be to post back using jquery get your result set from whatever database you are using and return that back to the view as apartial view

1678341
int	chars
you can have null pointers and null empty strings and there s the null chars 0 equal to 0 when converted to an int

so this will prevent you to lose history try a git pull first resolve potential conflicts and git push the result

1678433

put	get
i have an extension method to get the root domain of a uri and another to determine whether it s my domain but can t put them in a lambda here because they have no supported translation to sql

1678582
range	infinity
the limit of that as n tends to infinity is in the range to operations for some constants c1 and c2

1678602
int	double
yes i know that s a contrived example but we don t know the intent of the coder from just the type on the left especially if it s not being assigned to a variable at all such as being passed as an argument to an overloaded function that can take one of int float double decimal et al

1678613
haskell	ocaml
f# caml ocaml haskell and boo have type inference that generally behaves like what you are describing

1678680
put	get
i cant seen to get the php sessions to work im trying to create a form that saves the data then put its against regular expressions to verify its legit information

1678683
post	get
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post

1678688
post	get
what is wrong is to post some form as get like it make long url the user can bookmark it and that a bad move

1678688
post	get
also has good form policy i advice you to take a look at the post redirect get policy

1678697
post	get
the practical problem with get requests that modify data is that they might get followed by mistake - think bookmarks back forward buttons many browsers display a warning if you try and re-submit a post request this way search engines following links etc

1678727
post	get
when post is better than get

1678727
post	get
when get is better than post

1678727
post	get
if you decide to get uber-strict on page expiration no-cache and the whole business when users click back on their browser pages generated with post data will not resend the post data to create the page where as the get request will remain the same as it was originally

1678741

1678763
post	get
i always use the post redirect get method on my forms

1678785
disk	ram
putting an index on whatever you search for could well help but it could also be an issue related to sql having to get the image off the disk into ram and them sending it out across the network

1678791
post	get
afterwards otherwise you will still get the post warning on a refresh

1678791

1679164
width	height
is there any way i can get my page to stretch to maximum width and height with javascript and only get scrollbars when needed

width	height
if width height

1679191
width	height
elseif width height

1679191
width	height
else width height

1679212
width	height
but once it has been refreshed once the get height and width function no longer works

1679219
int	chars
nb if you use something like chars buffer len to custom format the printed string change it from void to unsigned int have it return the number of bytes that vsnprintf could not print that might be useful to the caller

1679253
inherited	subclassing
inherited from pageableresults to make a closed generic subclassing in your case pageablecontentitem or something like that and use that as return type

1679271
put	get
for a production app i would want to put some more error checking and validation in it but this should get you started

1679296
hash	md5
up to now passwords are stored in a 1-way md5 hash meaning people must be given a new generated password if they lose the old one

1679316
hash	md5
since asp classic doesn t have native hash functions you ll probably need to port your md5 vbscript code to your .net language or to use a common cryptography component due some error on your legacy code

1679360
profiler	aqtime
i was trying to speed up a certain routine in an application and my profiler aqtime identified one method in particular as a bottleneck

don t be put off it is sophisticated but it s not complicated - it s very easy to get working

1679391
datatrigger	eventtrigger
i think i need to combine an eventtrigger and a datatrigger to achieve what i m after

1679499
kerberos	ntlm
so if the server says negotiate the client can send either an ntlm token or a kerberos token..

1679499
kerberos	ntlm
if you are writing a client simply send which ever token you want ntlm or kerberos and the server will tell you what to do next if anything server may accept

1679531
implements	extends
this class uses extension methods to extends other types that implements ienumerable

1679543

it also allows you to keep the outline in a leo file but use either vim or emacs for the actual text editing of the nodes

1679615
inherited	properties
i m trying to make a ruby class that is very flexible as to its type and hopefully can inherited properties from a number of other classes depending on the values its initialized with

linux ubuntu with xfce if there s nothing more general.

1679803
public	protected
public protected and private do not affect the virtual nature of functions

1679906
addclass	removeclass
or if you want to be less obtrusive which is better setting and removing classes using jquery s addclass and removeclass and then defining the classes style in css

1679926

basically measurespecs are about size and layoutparams helps parent view to distribute available size between its children

1679927

however when i instruct teamcity to build my nant build file and instruct it to process the test targets i get no test output to teamcity

1680049
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i ve spent some time wading through the zip spec and actually i wrote dotnetzip which is a zip library for .net unrelated to sharpziplib

1680049
zipoutputstream	zipfile
just for the curious in dotnetzip you will get bit 3 set if you use the zipfile class and save it to a nonseekable stream like aspnet s response.outputstream or if you use the zipoutputstream class in dotnetzip which always writes forward only no seeking back

1680055
firefox	safari	width	height
i had the same problem and i ve solved only for firefox and safari by fixing the width but not the height and playing with the values padding top and bottom line-height and if needed setting the vertical-align to middle

1680069
postgresql	mysql
it looks like you might be trying to load data into mysql with the postgresql client tool

1680101
getter	setter
now the name property is readonly external to the class but can be changed by the class through property syntax or setter getter syntax

1680189
accessor	properties
the java bean specification says that the names of accessor should be getx or isx but since the fields are final there is no setter and the fields are more like attributes than properties

1680196
getter	setter
also worth mentioning that plain java beans in many frameworks depend on the fact that getter setter are conveniently named getx and setx

1680209
put	get
however when i try to get the information from the tracker i either timeout the tracker is working or get empty data depending on what form i put the url in

1680214
windows	wow64
edit 2 clarified that on 64-bit windows you need both folders not just the wow64 one

1680313
integer	fractions
my integer parts are pretty small 1-10000 and fractions part big

1680343
mbunit	nunit
i am looking at moving from nunit to mbunit for my unit testing framework as it has a couple of features that i like one of them being the parallelizable attribute

1680343
mbunit	nunit
reason for asking the first question is that i have as a test simply swapped the nunit framework for th mbunit framework and in a particular test class sets of tests tend to fail when run in parallel and pass when run sequentially

1680352
instances	transient
ec2 instances are transient

1680408
post	put
create edit delete is straight forward just need to do the put post delete in the good database

1680409
hide	show
i ve been having nothing but problems with this script for a simple hide show gallery of testimonials

1680409
firefox	safari
as a side note this is working fine in firefox and safari

1680441
for-loop	loops
1 not equal to one then the for-loop returns true and loops and method are exited

folder	directory
creating a branches task version1.0 directory create folder on task

1680565
iprincipal	iidentity
i have defined a custom iprincipal and custom iidentity based on a website that defines both valid identities and their permissions

1680565
iprincipal	iidentity
the question is when using the declarative principalpermission attribute on top of my assembly classes how to enforce that my custom iprincipal and iidentity classes are in use and not some other iprincipal iidentity that might be authenticated

1680625
firefox	safari
a click event on a disabled form field does not fire events in firefox and safari

1680625
mouseup	mousedown
opera fires the mousedown and mouseup events but not the click event

1680625
mouseup	mousedown
ie fires mousedown and mouseup but not click on the form

1680633
integer	unsigned
all document ids must be unique unsigned non-zero integer numbers

1680634
iprincipal	iidentity
security-aware code is split into two parts the identifying party ip which authenticates users and generates iidentity and iprincipal objects and the relying party rp which makes use of them

1680634
iprincipal	iidentity
that way you ensure that you only ever generate your custom iidentity and iprincipal objects

1680640
width	height
rectangle explicitly compares each field x y width height

1680641
public	protected
iâ m trying to test if a protected method is called in a public interface

1680755
move	drag
there is just one way to make the window manager move the window add a drag bar

1680755
move	drag
if there is no drag bar then your app must move the window itself by setting the new position you must handle the mouse click+move events yourself

1680775
mouse	keyboard
--open the keyboard mouse pane

1680775
mouse	keyboard
display dialog sorry an error occured while altering keyboard and mouse settings return theerror buttons ok default button ok

hi i want to upgrade the versioning of compact framework in my htc touch phone

1680934

but when i try to run the application it just shows the message to quit the application and upgrade the framework versioning

1680952
put	get
to get scrolling support you should put your vbox in a gtkscrolledwindow

1680956
int	double
if you marked every decimal on the number line in blue and every double in red except for the int there would be very few places where the same value was marked in both colors

1680959
public	protected
get_class_methods will pick out only the public methods not the protected or private ones

1680995
inherited	properties
implement iserializable and do serialization manually or do what the exception message says - rename the properties in inherited type in your serialization stream

1680997
children	parent
each class has a static contructor that registers with its parent so the parent knows about its direct children this was c++ i think this step is not needed in languages with good reflection support

1680997
children	parent
when a packet came in i ve simply passed it to static constructor method of the main parent class called packet which in turn checked all of its children if it s their responsibility to handle that packet and this went recursively until one class at the bottom of the hierarchy returned the instantiated class back

1681035
pop-up	dialog
i then try checking in something to that project and a little dialog pop-up saying

1681070
int	double
from my tests it appears to be any basic scalar type int long decimal double etc plus any struct that doesn t have a .equals override and contains only simple types recursively

1681089
ant	maven
you can try to use the maven tomcat plugin or if it does not give you everything you need you can always use an ant task here is a reference on the task

1681129
memcpy	strncpy
remember that strncpy will not zero-terminate the result in this case so you ll have to do it yourself which btw means that it makes more sense to use memcpy instead of the virtually useless strncpy

1681154
wsdualhttpbinding	basichttpbinding
now callback contracts require two way duplex communication so if you re just using basichttpbinding now you would need to switch to use wsdualhttpbinding or some non-http binding altogether which blows interop for this service out of the water

1681225
octal	decimal	octal	binary
but woe betide the programmer who tries to assign decimal 3735928559 or octal 33653337357 or worst of all binary 11011110101011011011111011101111

1681243
pop-up	dialog
when we try testing this code in our winforms shell the appropriate dialog the one hosted in the active mdichild pop-up when all 3 controls exist but in the vb6 host the wrong dialog usually appears it seems to always be the dialog for the first control which was created

1681263
getter	setter
as recommended in the tutorials i wrap the message builder in a class of my own that implements getter and setter methods to access the message s properties

1681270
rss	feed
you could cronjob rss feed to gmail messages

1681413
udp	tcp

1681461
nant	cruisecontrol
i used cruisecontrol with nant extensively but not msbuild

1681493
int	chars
it supplied the types int and chars arrays of them and pointers to them declared in a style typified by

1681493
int	chars
the semantics of arrays remained exactly as in b and bcpl the declarations of iarray and carray create cells dynamically initialized with a value pointing to the first of a sequence of 10 int and chars respectively

1681498
put	get
i tried using registery key in which i stored the path of the folder in a registery key and get that path and put it in place of utility.dll but this did not work..

1681516
folder	dir
go to install dir of xampp htdocs create a new folder mydir then create an index.php and write in it

1681606
opera	firefox
it looks perfect in firefox and opera but it is absolutely horrible in ie

1681613
post	get
it inserts tracepoints into the kernel and has some post processing to get some of the kind of statistics you re asking about

1681625
accessor	properties
it is a factory properties that is used to return an instance of an object singleton accessor properties come to mind

1681625
accessor	properties
singleton accessor properties

1681637
mouse	keyboard
this is not usual because normally to close a dialog the user have to use the mouse or the keyboard and then the drag drop operation is automatically canceled

1681641
post	get
post part of the crash report on pastebin or the like maybe some can get some info out of that

1681667
int	boolean
in this case matrixes of boolean but i can easily pack them into 64 bit int

1681695
ironruby	ironpython
the dynamic language runtime is part of .net 4 ironpython and ironruby and is also available standalone

1681695
ironruby	ironpython
john lam the lead developer of ironruby created a little library called repl-lib which implements a simple editor repl hybrid for ironruby and ironpython which you can just drop into your application

1681756
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so i have to create a uitabbarcontroller and the items instead of being the direct views are the uinavigationcontroller s with a default view inside

1681803
config	ini
your options include a use an ini xml config file in a location that doesn t require admin rights to access or b modify the security on your own subkey in hklm using a tool like setacl public domain

1681820
ramaze	merb
based on the feedback i d like to clarify when you start a new web app - no matter how small - you are going to use ruby or merb or ramaze or what have you

1681820
csv	tsv
you could potentially argue that i just have one view - console or that i even have multiple - let s say my script needs to run daily and update some .xls file on a share but also output it as csv and maybe tsv file and be able to do xml for consumption by a client service

1681826
google-chrome	firefox
on windows regardless of the browser ie firefox google-chrome this increase the form submit button and give the button spacing padding of 6px

1681838
nsstring	nsdata
your static method newdata is a perfectly ok practice and you can see similar methods throughout the cocoa api just for example nsstring string and nsdata data

1681854
button	checkbox
safari will not style button or checkbox or drop down menus etc

1681855
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller represents its sub-tabs as an array of uiviewcontroller s not an array of uinavigationcontroller s

1681855
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
therefore your approach is exactly right use uinavigationcontroller s subclass of uiviewcontroller in place of standard view controllers when you want to achieve navigation within a given tab

1681898
children	parent
a parent div should naturally expand to fit its containing elements if they aren t it s usually an indication that something else has gone wrong - in your case when you mention clearfix it suggests you re using floats inside the parent and it s not extending past its children anymore

1682007
formview	detailsview
i d stay away from any of the built in controls detailsview formview for anything other than simple crud forms as it s not much more effort to manually create your own data-entry forms

1682014
post	get
pass in request - get post etc

1682022
tiff	png
look at png or tiff

1682051
profiling	debugging
you can try to attach a profiling to the database honestly i have only done that for sqlserver and run the procedure since the profiling will show any query made to the db you will be able to pick it up there and do the necessary debugging

1682075
hide	show
jquery provides the show and hide effects that allow you to easily toggle the visibility of an element or elements

1682083
jobs	cron
i have seen some libraries like cronedit which let you run cron jobs using ruby

1682091
mp3	wav
as the title says i need to be able to create a wav or mp3 file using sapi on windows xp

1682092
width	height
i think your better off having the rootviewcontroller have it s own uitableview which is set to a dynamic height and width using the uiview autoresizingmask property

1682135
int	boolean
the open table approach makes it difficult to model with ar since you have to worry about the types of the data boolean int string etc

1682142
children	parent
the children of the class with frinedship need to ask there parent to do the access for them

1682144
width	height
however when i place an instance in the designer the auto value for the width and height fields is no longer available as it is with the default treeview

1682158
bash	zsh
i defined a function zsh minor changes - bash

1682193
folder	directory
by calling some stylesheets images scripts or even entire directory can be put into a web-visible folder

1682199
slideup	slidedown
delete the slideup slidedown functions from jrails and presto

1682207
ilist	icollection
edit also note that the c5 collections implement the system.collections.generic icollection and ilist interfaces where appropriate so can be used as the implementation even in systems that expect those interfaces

1682233
ostringstream	std
there is a bug in visual c++ with std ostringstream when _has_iterator_debugging is disabled

1682243
post	get
also you say it works for the get but not for the post

is there any difference in declaring a public constructor instead of a protected one in an abstract class

1682284

1684182
next	except
i asked martin buchholz since he happens to be sitting right next to me and he said there wasn t a really particularly great reason except that at the time things were still half-baked -- too few jdk apis had been retrofitted to accept charset and of the ones that were the charset overloads usually performed slightly worse

you can put your contentplaceholder control onto an updatepanel in the master page

1686112
hide	show
after all if you were planning to use form1 instances through the forminterface class you would have had no access to the form members other than show and hide

1686135
cpu	processors
processors genuine intel r cpu t2300 1.66ghz 2 cpus

1686135
cpu	processors
processors intel r core tm 2 duo cpu e8400 3.00ghz 2 cpus 3.0ghz

1686225
post	get
check out the blog post i pointed you to and you should get a thorough understanding of when to use each and why you would use them

1686268
width	height
instead of image maps you can use div s by positioning them as absolute and adjusting the top and left co-ordinates and width and height

1686288
width	height
i am not able to retrieve x y height width of button widget.

1686391
rss	feed
i m building an automated rss feed in asp.net and occurrences of apostrophes and hyphens are rendering very strangely

1686434
lseek	fseek
the question is the parameters of the functions like lseek or fseek are all 4 bytes

1686441
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
see for example firebug s net panel in firefox or web inspector s resources panel in google-chrome or safari

1686479
spweb	spsite
try creating new spsite and spweb objects before getting items and get them from new webs

1686486
prng	random
it s unlikely your prng has enough bits of state to express every possible shuffle however so the real question is if your prng is random enough with regards to the set of shuffles it will actually produce and whether your seeding strategy is secure enough

1686494
integer	unsigned
a 4 byte unsigned integer can represent a value up to 4294967295 which means if you want to move more than 4g you need to use lseek64

1686540
httphandler	httpcontext
i m trying to send a file in chunks to an httphandler but when i receive the request in the httpcontext the inputstream is empty

1686557
min	max
of course you will do all this in binary so you will not be checking to make sure the address is between a min and a max value instead you will use the subnet mask to get the prefix of your address and the destination address then check that they are equal

1686587
gridview	datalist
scottgu has a detailed blog post here using a datalist but this is equally applicable to gridview

1686613
for-loop	arrays
...if you re interested in just the first three elements of a large arrays why don t you use a for-loop instead of a foreach

1686705
range	max	range	min	min	max
and a point x y find users where the point is within the min and max latitude and longitude range of users where min and max long and lat current position minus or plus radius

1686727
sorting	filtering
personally i d change the web-service to do this filtering and sorting at the server to reduce bandwidth needs probably returning a simple data-type or custom class not datatable or anything similar

1686752
cobertura	emma
cobertura and emma will perform code coverage analysis

1686763
profiler	yourkit
i ve found yourkit to be a pretty amazing profiler for java

1686807
hide	show
hide show the div which contains th table when you click the header

1686825
vsto	add-in
i m developing a vsto add-in for outlook

1686832
background-repeat	background-position	background-repeat	background-image	background-image	background-position
you can try nested divs with background-image background-repeat and background-position set

1686832
width	height
remember to setup the width and height on the outermost div

1686834
junit	testng
junit is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java testng has more features but maybe is more complex

1686852
ubuntu	linux
but in ubuntu linux 8.04 it doesn t show up and looks like below

1686861
versioning	upgrade
try to upgrade to a newer versioning

1686863
jobs	cron
cron jobs are configured in quartz using the crontrigger class

1686943
width	height
in my web application i have a button when i click i want to open a new page the page should width 220 height 300 like this please help me thank you

1686977
getter	setter
i actually happily design and develop java ee applications for quite 9 years but i realized recently that as time goes by i feel more and more fed up of dragging all these ugly bean classes with their bunch of getter and setter

1686977
getter	setter
it would still be possible to mix annotation and written down getter or setter to cover cases when it should do non-trivial sets and gets

1686977
getter	setter
in other words annotation would auto-generate the getter setter code piece except when a literate one is provided

1687024
disk	ram
ram 350+ gb hdd usable hard disk

1687028
onclick	onsubmit
trapping onclick for every link on the page plus onsubmit on every form is slightly more reliable but can still be fooled due to the delay

1687030
getter	setter
project lombok partially fills this hole it handles the generation of getter and setter and other stuff

1687030
getter	setter
but using the field-access syntax to access getter and setter isn t possible this way

1687139
equals	gethashcode
if you implement iequatable you should also override the base class implementations of object equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the iequatable equals method

1687161
firefox	safari
firefox and safari ask me if i want to resend my form data

1687209
accessor	properties
you either just expose the structure as a properties in which case you have to set get the whole thing or you write custom accessor that walk into the fields of the strucutre

1687261
prepare	execute
i prepare a statement using placeholders then execute the query

1687310
min	max
in one dimension if min 0 then x must fall between 0 and max or x must fall between min + 360 and 360

1687310
min	max
similarly if min 0 then x must fall between min and max or it must fall between 0 and max - 360

1687310
subtraction	addition
if you move the addition and subtraction of 360 to the x and y parameters the comparisons become constant and probably speed the query dramatically

1687313
getter	setter
or add several wrappers for the getter and setter of size into square

1687326
width	height
in my application a canvas object has height 90 px width 86400 px indicating number of seconds in a day 60 60 24

1687332
dom4j	xom
this answer is part of my evaluation of xom as a potential replacement to dom4j .

1687341
jobs	cron
the php functionality contains system calls exec to merge edit create files with gnu software nix environment as well as api calls to rest services for uploading these files this will be done with cron jobs however

1687351
x86	mips
it uses glr for parsing builds an ast uses ssa as its intermediate form does inter procedural optimizations and generates code for x86 arm mips powerpc sparc and others

1687355
try-catch	exception-handling
this is wrapped around a try-catch loop so within the catch portion i had it dump the exception-handling to stdout

1687363
hide	show
if there were a show hide function taking a boolean parameter it could be even shorter

1687366
stdout	stderr
in createprocess you pass a startupinfo where you can specify handles for sdin stdout and stderr

1687386
width	height
so long as the behaviour of those components remain the same same width height area otherwise you might want to declare them as virtual in the base class in order to be able to override them if necessary

1687511
move	drag
but what i want is when i drag the item than it should reach at some point where i drop it and again from the drop point it should move to the other point

1687520
int	double
i think you can do without the mprotect if it is that important to you declare the pointer as static in your lookup.c or whatever it is called and then have a non-static double get_sine int index

1687521
folder	directory
one option is to add the file containing the class to a sub directory of the app_code directory and set compilation to vb for that folder

1687594
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state

1687610
post	put	post	get	put	get
sys.net.webrequest offers a way to specify the verb get post put and delete but no built-in callback for a failed request they all seem to use the same callback success or fail

1687610
post	get
sys.net.webserviceproxy seems to only do get post via the useget parameter on the invoke method

1687624
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome firefox safari on a netbook

1687680
implements	extends
you implements your own date either by extends java.util.date like in option 2 or wrapping it with some timezone object

1687690
getter	setter
in order to access the composed class i would define wrappers for its member functions if the class is small has only a few functions like size or would use getter setter to the whole composed object if the class is big

1687807
int	chars
basically i have a seq of int representing ascii chars

1687809
folder	directory
note in order to do this you must put a copy of your exe file or whatever assembly contains the type passed to createapplicationhost in your asp.net folder s bin directory

1687875
post	get
there s a simple implementation of just creating a form that post directly to paypal and you can optionally use ipn to get info about the transaction

1687881
mouse	keyboard
i have been able to use autoit for some ms office vba projects where keyboard or mouse input was the only way such as when ms office does not expose something in the object model but it exists in the gui

1687896
touchesbegan	uiscrollviewdelegate
you should add touchesbegan withevent on your uiscrollview not on the uiscrollviewdelegate

1687948
awt	swing
you can only run a swing awt app as headless if there is truly no gui

1687987
firefox	safari
the following code doesn t work in ie and safari but works fine in firefox

1688139
opera	safari
also there is interesting project called fauxconsole simulating a firebug safari or opera debugging console in microsoft internet explorer with faux console

1688140
put	get
without a temporary table you can t since you must find a way to put all the values of bunit into a table of some kind and then join mytable against that table to get the null values

1688145
stdout	stderr
writing the output stderr or stdout maybe happening through a callback or some other thread

1688187
vtune	gprof
if your function is a long running one you have to use some sort of profiling tool like gprof it is very easy to use intel s vtune application which i have not used for a long time

1688187
gprof	callgrind
after seeing art s answer i changed my mind from gprof to callgrind

1688187
valgrind	memcheck
i used only the memcheck tool of valgrind in the past and it was a magnificent tool

1688225
dictionary	map
is there any reason that a dictionary map wouldn t work

1688226
profiler	callgrind
the open-source callgrind profiler for linux is a really awesome way to measure performance

1688226
valgrind	callgrind
callgrind is part of valgrind

1688293
children	parent
now you can bind an event handler to a single parent element and that handler will get executed whenever the event occurs on any of its child nodes and any of their children in turn

1688299
implements	extends
if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces

1688378
scheme	prolog
you won t see main in scheme or prolog for instance

1688409
min	max
there is a child mdi form inside that is always present and cannot be closed is it possible to hide the close button while keeping the min and max buttons

1688444
puts	gets
the underlying idea is to dedicate a thread to entirely own a shared resource or subsystem and have all other worker threads access the resource only by gets and or puts on queues used by that dedicated thread queue is intrinsically threadsafe

1688478
for-loop	loops
as the variable s context is loops a new instance will be created each time because we have moved the variable inside the local context the for-loop

1688482
comparator	comparable
typically if you want to be able to reorder a list using a comparator you don t need to implement comparable only good for one ordering you create new comparator objects which can be written outside that class and can specify any ordering possible by the getters in that class

1688500
comparator	comparable
based on your code you seem to have some confusion between the comparable and comparator interfaces

1688500
arraylist	treeset
a better approach of course would be to use a treeset rather than an arraylist

1688505
pop-up	dialog
in other words by clicking a certain button in form1 form2 needs to pop-up like a dialog box

1688520
hide	show
you can put these controls on a panel or other docking control so that users can hide it and show it as required

1688528
vb.net	vb6
i found that the easiest solution was to create a class in vb to call those functions since vb.net does support optional parameters and then call that vb6 class from c#

1688528
vb.net	vb6
in the class written in vb.net i followed the proper method overloading to provide several methods to call that one vb6 function

1688528
vb.net	vb6
example - say the vb6 function has three parameters the first one required and the second two optional i d create three functions in the vb.net component

1688543
button	checkbox
for every item you place in the list item that is focusable button checkbox etc you need to set the android focusable attribute to false

1688550
restrict	shared
there might also be a problem if you run the application from a network shared then it runs with restrict rights

1688566
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m trying to get rid of a server hit to improve responsiveness of an ajax app but i might only be able to do it for firefox google-chrome opera and safari if there s no way to coax the info out of ie

1688670
fseek	fread
when you do fseek ..seek_end the position inside the opened file is at the end whenever you call fread you are getting 0 bytes as you re at the end

1688690
vmware	virtualbox
when i installed windows xp on a virtualbox machine i made the hard drive only 10 gb since and assumed it would expand in size as do hard drives in vmware as far as i can remember isn t this true

1688723
isnull	nvl
for mssql replace ifnull with isnull or for oracle use nvl

1688797
put	get
when you get your response from the server you need to make a view controller and put that string into it

1688817
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
much to my surprise it works great in ie google-chrome safari and opera - but it pretty much sucks in firefox

1688833
vmware	virtualbox
use a virtualization tool like virtualbox or vmware to install a fresh copy of windows and your application

1688855
post	get
they say to get this to work it has to be a form post multipart form-data but i m not using a form

1688871
width	height
first guess - width and height in tags

1688871
width	height
use css properties width and height sic instead

1688897
gridview	objectdatasource
there is also objectdatasource connected to the gridview

1688897
gridview	objectdatasource
i thought that this value is evaluated just as objectdatasource connects to gridview and this theid property should get the valu from the objectdatasource

1688918
bazaar	perforce	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	git	perforce	cvs
software configuration management version control cvs subversion git mercurial bazaar perforce etc

1688918
trac	bugzilla
issue tracking bugzilla trac fogbugz etc

1688942
int	chars
in my program there are no way to know which is the type of variable arguments it can be a chars an array an int an short an function point etc.

1688983
hash	md5
i have used md5 successfully but i have read that it is possible to generate a hash collision with md5 though i have never done it

1689026
yslow	pagespeed
you can use firefox plugins yslow and pagespeed to test for load performance bottlenecks

1689027
lisp	smalltalk
but it is not necessarily a language that is the best suited for those who are approaching their problem from a strictly high-level perspective lisp smalltalk java c#

1689097
nginx	lighttpd
there is a unofficial memcache module for lighttpd but it does not seem stable i have also heard a memcache module for nginx but don t know whether is this possible or not

1689110
versioning	upgrade
they have an enterprise versioning but to be honest after using community versioning for almost a year in a environment with about 150 users - i really don t see the need to upgrade

1689126
width	height
the width and height fields were specified to 300 in the custom control s xaml when it was created i didn t notice

1689182
ubuntu	linux
update i m running on ubuntu linux and the reader objects are sockets

1689227
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
it was getting so hard to write up a pom.xml that i generated a ant build.xml from one of maven s tasks which is a nice handy task...

1689243
mouseup	mousedown
so the effect that i was seeing in firefox and ie was a result of a slight delay between mousedown and mouseup

1689243
google-chrome	safari
i tried it in safari and google-chrome and they worked fine as usual

1689248
ffmpeg	libav
finally if you want you can write computer code in c or c++ using ffmpeg s libav libraries or java using xuggler to programatically do this but that s pretty advanced for your use case

1689256
implements	extends
you would just extends the class defaultftplet and implements onuploadend onrenameend ondeleteend

1689284
memcached	apc
if you are only using a single server i would suggest you make a switch to apc which provides both opcode caching and a caching mechanism faster than memcached for a single server application

1689290
ienumerable	icollection
ienumerable or icollection

1689320
pop-up	dialog
i needed to have my js pop-up login dialog box support localization

1689366
width	height
width and height undeclared

1689441
integer	unsigned
this will always print out as an unsigned integer in hexadecimal which is far more useful than a signed decimal integer

1689447
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
so you re-did what maven gives you for free by writing ant tasks within a pom.xml

1689447
ant	pom.xml
it is not common to enrich a pom.xml with ant clutter

1689447
ant	pom.xml
however some special tasks or legacy ant tasks are sometimes embedded into the pom.xml lifecycle but these are exceptions and not the common case

1689451
ant	maven
they use maven for dependency management and then do their building with ant

1689451
ant	maven
this undermines some of the benefits maven is supposed to bring such as the fact that a normal build is simpler to specify in maven than ant

1689505
ubuntu	linux
this is on a linux ubuntu system

1689550
hash	md5
if you want to know why other smtp auth mechanisms use base64 its because typically the data they re sending is actually binary data of some sort like a md5 hash of the shared secret and a token provided by the server

1689607
post	get
one workaround i use to get around the lack of this feature is an extension method like what s described in this blog post to allow code like this

1689609
post	get
a suggestion - use the link below how to post data code on a forum to get the best help

1689644
width	height
for instance if i start would with 32x32 buttons that need to shrink to fit all of them in the layout i want them to shrink proportionally so that the width to height scale is maintained

1689697
ant	maven
one of the reasons i eventually switched to maven though is that for many of the mojos similar to ant tasks you don t have to understand how to configure them

1689713
des	rsa
determining strength is a very hard thing to do in the general case although some algorithms have been given enough attention that their strengths and weaknesses are fairly well known des rsa etc

1689739
opera	google-chrome
my feeling is that it s a problem doesn t lie in the code at all but in the rendering of the div and or its contents in google-chrome and opera a css problem or something along those lines where the innerhtml of the div is updated but because of styling or positioning you don t get the visual result you were looking for

1689771
width	height
in the css for my web site i have specfied the height as 800px width as 1050px

1689771
width	height
the entire application width and height should be this size

1689771
width	height
i need to specify the entire width and height of the application to the blue color with no white space at either edge

1689791
postgresql	mysql
they are loaded from .net assemblies so you can write your own provider if you want to but mono already has ms sql and oracle plus postgresql and mysql provide their own .net assemblies

1689804
width	height
do not set a width and height on the body this is unnecessary

1689804
width	height
if you want to restrict your application from leaving the 800x1050 margins while retaining the background just put a wrapper div around the site and set the width and height there

1689805
post	get
the only way to get data into appengine is to call up a web app of yours as a web app and feed it data through the usual http-ish means as parameters to a get request for short data or to a post if long or binary

1689841
disk	ram
you then make a system call to read some data from the file and the os fetches it from the disk and copies it into some region of ram that you specify that would be a character byte array in your program

1689841
disk	ram
if you re interested in what the os actually does behind the scenes to get data from the disk to ram well.

1689861
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for instance i would like to store mozilla firefox safari google-chrome ie etc.

1689874
cdr	cons
a cons statement is used to allocate a pair whose car is obj1 and whose cdr is obj2

1689890
free	malloc
when the thread exits will the malloc ed memory be free automatically

1689897
filesystems	ntfs
how can i query the filesystems ntfs with sqlite

1689902
scrollable	panels
since the imagecontainer is the class being added to your scrollable panels that is the panels which needs to exceed a certain size to make things scrollable

1689909
equals	tostring
tostring and equals too

1689919
free	malloc
no - malloc ed memory is only ever free by an explicit free

1689921
button	checkbox
i believe it has something to do with bindings and the control views i have in my nib file because when i remove the bindings from the checkbox and radio button from the nib the window can close an unlimited number of times and not crash

1689950
tolower	uppercase
but for the uppercase to lowercase conversion youâ ll either need a mapping like the internal tolower function or you use php for both

1689964
dictionary	map
to answer your question of what can go wrong the hashcode generated by your function will be used to find the place for instances of your class if you put it in a hashtable dictionary map

1689967
onkeyup	onkeydown
to respond to the arrow keys you need to use onkeydown or onkeyup

1689981
postgresql	mysql
also dbs are designed to handle thousands of inserts and deletions - any major db - sql server mysql postgresql shouldn t have any problem with it

1689987
codeigniter	kohana
kohana a fork of codeigniter is worth checking out if you are still looking for a good php framework

1689988
rdf	owl
bigdata r comes packaged with a very high-performance rdf store supporting rdf s and owl lite inference

1689996
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
malloc realloc free memory management is not actually aware about threads

1690016
subclass	accessor
the first is preferred because if you go through the accessor it can trigger kvo notifications which can cause weird issues if your subclass the object

1690023
lisp	scheme
lisp including scheme are dynamically typed and the lisp way is to have many functions over a single data structure rather than different data structures for different tasks

1690038
sorting	filtering
it depends - if the database doesn t need to do any sort of filtering or sorting on the data in the delimited strings and the data was originally sent to the database in a delimited format why not

1690059
ant	maven
maven uses convention over configuration with lots of useful defaults directory locations a defined life-cycle a set of common plugins that know how to build and assemble software maven provides a common interface to build project unlike ant you know how to do things like running tests packaging etc with every project no need to open the build script to find out how it s done maven implements reuse through maven plugins build logic is embedded into plugins for dry purpose you don t have to repeat yourself over and over you don t have to copy paste parts of your build scripts maven has a project object model that allows you to describe your project through meta-data this enables dependency management remote repositories reuse of build logic tool integration artifacts search...

1690059
ant	maven
ant + ivy if you want maven vs

1690059
maven	buildr
buildr maven vs

1690059
ant	maven
this might seem tempting because you have the feeling that you regain control because you understand what is happening with ant but you are actually repeating yourself again and losing all advantages of maven

1690182
children	parent
basically you would call this function passing in the parent control and it would recursively loop through all child controls and any children they had

1690194
xmltype	clob
the data is currently stored in oracle as xml documents not using the xmltype but normal clob

1690217
postgresql	mysql
another option is to use postgresql -- unlike mysql it has timezone support for datetimes built-in

1690244
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox opera ie

1690267
puts	gets
currently we use for searching and for gets puts deletes of a single product

1690287
post	get
you post or get a single thing a single product

1690300
width	height
in this case with w width and h height it s

1690310
post	put
typically you use post to create a resource when you don t know the identifier of the resource in advance and put when you do

1690310
post	put
so you d post to products or put to products new-id

1690435
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
you can do a getelementbyid to get the menu then getelementsbytagname for the lis which will return an array say items

1690438
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop can start with the second element of the arrays because you have already initialized maxvalue with the first element

1690463
for-loop	arrays
also since it is an arrays you shouldn t use the for...in statement a normal for-loop it s enough i think something like this

1690521
put	get
if you put that somewhere like in your application delegate s applicationdidfinishlaunching method you ll get the picture taker window startup

1690526
converter	multibinding
step 5 use a multibinding to bind the textblock s text property using your converter

1690669
serializable	deserialization
another way to approach the problem is to design the object tree that you ll use in-app first then write serializable and deserialization routines to save and load the contents from a file

1690730
nsstring	nsdata
overriding these messages to return your nsstring as either nsdata or nsinputstream might work

a couple of hours later i had railroad tracks i could draw anywhere on the screens using bã zier curves and they would join and switching automatically

1693788
drawrect	layoutsubviews
you might still have to pass a bunch of information from the delegate to the cell class like a model object or some contents and you might have to duplicate some code from your cell s layoutsubviews or drawrect but at least all of the logic would live within the cell class

1695152
getter	setter
it probably makes sense to use the getter setter or dot notation everywhere else for good encapsulation

1695154
ssms	sqlcmd
i tried the generate scripts tool and thought that was going to make it - the export to my local disk worked but when i went to import using sqlcmd the script was 1gb so ssms errored when i tried to open it there it told me there was a syntax error a few thousand lines in

getter	setter
however there is little difference between property access and invoke the getter setter method

1695327
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
i ve wrestled with this a couple of times and my usual reason for needing some sort of onload event triggering is to be able to interact with the html dom and have getelementbyid getelementsbytagname or various other dom selectors return something other than nothing

1695464
for-loop	loops
therefore your logic is almost correct if it were to do nothing in the found case the one thing missing would be to return true systematically after the for-loop since if it didn t exit with a false value within loops then all items of l2 are in l1...

1695478
int	double
just cast one of your variables to double and it will promote the entire expression to be evaluated as floating-point only rounding to int at the end

1695561
ilist	iqueryable
wraps the iqueryable functionality of an ilist collection but maximises some of linqtosql s deferred execution functions and

1695729
int	chars
i m not sure i d trust system.out to be able to handle non-ascii chars though - you may want to find a different way of examining strings such as printing out the individual values of chars as int preferably in hex and then comparing them with the charts at unicode.org

1695730
int	chars
in c are primitive data types such as int long chars unsigned .

1695739

mouseleave	mouseenter
might consider using hover which is essentially mouseenter and mouseleave

1696102
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
the difference is that mouseover and mouseout will fire when you move into a child element of the element to which the event handler is attached whereas mouseenter and mouseleave a.k.a

1696103
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave

free	malloc
you can trap malloc free etc by writing your own shared library and forcing your process to use it instead of the real versions via ld_preload

1696844
free	malloc	dlsym	dlopen
you can use dlopen dlsym to load invoke the real malloc free etc

1696844
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	dlsym	dlopen
but be aware of re-entrant situations when coding this library and that your process will initially invoke malloc calloc realloc before dlopen dlsym can complete loading the real functions

1696913
division	modulo
the modulo will give you the remainder of a division

1696917

is there any significant overhead involved in writing cout statements and then piping that output to files or would i be better off writing directly to the file using an ofstream

1697003
postgresql	mysql
all major dbms s have support for the entity framework although for many mysql postgresql you ll need to download something separate from your .net framework install

1697007
iprincipal	iidentity

all of these are standard issues with any other int type except unsigned chars

1697241
try-catch	exception-handling
the first and second try-catch blocks are exactly the same thing they simply rethrow the current exception-handling and that exception-handling will keep its source and the stack trace

1697241

1697569
post	get
django form models aren t just about rendering forms they re more about processing and sanitizing form get post input which is what you want to do

1697569

might be an issue with the way you structured your productsummarycontrol because even if you don t put binding the datacontext will get automatically inherited to the control

1697928
ocaml	sml
also not really what you re looking for at the moment but if you want a good ml book it s actually a dialect of ocaml but old enough to not be that different from sml then look at cousineau + mauny

1698206
subtraction	addition
if you are going to implement the swap of two characters without a temporary variable which is a neat trick but not something that you should actually use in practice it would be prudent to either use the bitwise exclusive or instead of addition subtraction or use unsigned char instead of char because overflow in signed arithmetic is undefined in the c99 standard and guess what gcc started to make use of this undefinedness for optimization purposes
