there s some shared connection between all instances of mydatacontext which obviously inherited from datacontext and when two threads try simultaneously to use the connection properties even of two different data contexts somehow they re both accessing the same datareader

11504771
octree	quadtree
i have been messing around with octree and quadtree for the past couple of days

11504771
octree	quadtree
however i can not fathom how an octree or quadtree could be used to generate a cube type world

11504771
quad	uniform
1 you use the quad oct tree to subdivide a set cube 10x10x10 and subdivide it until at-least one leaf is uniform

11504771
octree	quadtree
can anyone explain the logic behind using an octree or quadtree in building such a 3d environment

11504785
int	double
i created this class because the stack will be able to store strings functions pointers to functions double and int

11504785
int	double
the problem is when i push an int or double into the stack and then pop it and get the pointer to the data i m debugging it by printing out it s value therefore i basically have this

11504785
int	double
i don t know what might be wrong maybe it s the way i assign __p the pointer returned by get these are the __data constructors for int and double

11504785
int	double
so basically my problem is when i try to get the int or double pointed by the returned it either gives me a value of 1 int or 2.13171e-314 double

11504870
filtering	grouping
if it is where clause that filtering out some stats before even grouping is applied then you need to move the date condition into left join condition ie

11504886
inherited	properties
regarding a preloader the tilelist should already use an imagecell which contains an uiloader so you can access bytesloaded bytestotal and it also inherited from the labelbutton uicomponent so you have a label properties textfield available

11504891

11505249
portrait	landscape
you may also need to create various portrait and landscape layouts in different sizes

11505288
range	infinity
to get a range by score you would call zrangebyscore instead -- where -inf and +inf can be used to denote negative and positive infinity respectively as didier spezia notes in his comment

11505297
comparator	comparable
your question does not clarify what the key of the map is but maybe you could use a custom class in a regular list and have the class implement the comparable interface or implement an external comparator to sort the list

11505344
viewdidload	viewwillappear
don t call this on viewwillappear - you want this code to be executed on viewdidload

11505347
width	height
you can set editor s height and width at start up only - there are config options height and width

11505347

see this ckeditor javascript - adjust height and width in ckeditor

11505347
width	height
this one ckeditor 3.0 height may be interesting to if you want to set height and width maybe too to a percentage

11505352
viewdidload	viewdidappear
first of all move your code out from the viewdidload to either viewdidappear or to a function call

11505378
integer	fractions
therefore anywhere that takes an integer as a parameter should also accept a number so long as there are no fractions parts

11505391
post	get
in this example i could add the address back to the attributes and manage it with set get but then in my own environment i ve created an alternate tojson function for the json to post to the server and couldn t find a good way to set the json to the object without changing it from a collection to a json response

11505409
for-loop	loops
so in this case i would actually get rid of the using for objdbcon and pull it outside of the for-loop just make sure you close it outside of loops after all the db calls

11505416
wan	lan
i am going to guess that either you have not requested internet permissions in your manifest or you are using a local ip and your device is trying to connect over wan and not lan

11505419

or hard-code set android screenorientation portrait landscape in manifest

11505426

11505513
button	checkbox
i have implemented a listview each element of which contains a checkbox and a button

in my understanding since inherited is used to reduce duplication why should we define the same method in subclassing

11505581
super	self
leak near entries object instance variable used while self is not set to the result of super of self init ...

11505581

11505618
width	height
set the width and or height on page load after the other div sizes are already calculated

11505670
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
but precisely because of that all the subclassing will contain the same operations defined in the superclass the implementation details common to several classes will appear only once in the class hierarchy at the abstract-class level and they are not defined again in the subclassing - only the parts that change are redefined in concrete subclassing

11505688
getter	setter
a val is composed of a getter and a setter so the assignment is done through the setter and the reading is done through the getter and no cycle exists

11505760
innodb	myisam
have a look at this post in innodb you need to do a full table scan where as in myisam its a index read

11505760
innodb	myisam
if you use a where clause though it changes the execution pattern to use indexes so in general innodb will be slower than myisam on full unrestricted counts where as the performance matches up on restricted counts

11505777

i ve heard that search engines index http and https as separate entries so for consistency in both seo and page behavior blanketing ssl over everything and just setting up a 301 redirect seems like a nice easy solution

11506787

hassle - so i did say that it s easier to ssl everything but at the same time you re going to have to make sure every resource is loaded through https or do the quick solution

what is the better way to work with the branches branch folder create a new folder branch in branches dir or get the contents of trunk to branches and work it from there

11507617
range	minimum
i would suggest that if this is a common application having a range defined and checking against it that you encapsulate the range in a class which would probably be just a pair of properties for minimum and maximum as well as methods for checking values against the range and so forth and then use that

11507622
ready	each
each controller for those domains has a single index action and depending on which request.method is used and whether the id is passed i have it ready to send off json replies or do save delete etc

absolutely positioning elements should us top and other such positioning controls instead of margin etc and set a width and height

11507732
subtract	add
any time you add or subtract floats of widely varying magnitudes you need to watch for loss of precision

so for instance i have temperature and want to break it out into min and max operating temp so the columns will look like

11508319
min	max
however i can t find any way to statically define the column breakdowns for temperature and one of my main problems is i need to pull the min max data from a different database than the rest of the information and therefore need to make it it s own dataset

11508325
division	multiplication
also looking at the assembly they do not use division but rather only multiplication so look into that for your c code

11508325
addition	multiplication
this again may be another trick as the multiplication may be slower on a iphone application than an addition

11508347

this extensions is responsible for creating the appropriate prepare and execute statements for your database according to the database driver you have selected

11508985
prepare	execute
here is an example adapted from the php manual using prepare and execute

i only manage to get the height width of the first image however i get the src of all images

11514362
width	font-size
also with same width of browsers metal bar in mozilla is smaller which leads me to a thought that mozilla counts smaller font-size

11514369
int	double
however because the return type of the recursive template function is taken from the first argument only you can get suprising results if you mix different argument types in one call sum 2.5 2 returns 4.5 as expected but sum 2 2.5 returns 2 because the return type is int not double

so it s even more odd that the width is greater than the height when it should be the other way around

11514391
width	height
i actually expected the width to be 768 and the height 1024

11514391

stick with xcode for most stuff but when you need the power of emacs or possibly vim bulk repetitive editor macros is my main reason just edit the file using show in finder and open with or just by switching to your editor navigating to the file from there

domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
there might be some problem with domcontentloaded event as none version of ie afaik does recognizes it and developers are obligated to use onreadystatechange instead

11521160
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
but doesn t changed onreadystatechange into domcontentloaded

11521160
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
i can t use above line in window.addeventlistener part because this will rewrite domcontentloaded into onreadystatechange event even for other browsers and fail there as they use domcontentloaded

11521160
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
so does the only way to solve this problem is to add browser detection type and version to window.addeventlistener part and if it detects that script is dealing with ie 9 or above it will rewrite event name from domcontentloaded to onreadystatechange and supplement other events name with on required for ie and in case of other browsers will leave event name not changed

11521160
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange	google-chrome	firefox
or maybe i m wrong because as i just tested neither domcontentloaded nor onreadystatechange is being fired in my ie 8 first one fires correctly in firefox google-chrome

11521360
setinterval	settimeout
the reason is settimeout and setinterval do not guarantee that your code will execute after the specified delay

11521360
setinterval	settimeout
the above delta timer is better than setinterval method 1 makes use of settimeout method 2 but also corrects itself starts the timer using a function method 3 and doesn t pollute the scope with a special clockstart function method 4

11521408

11521495

it seems like both cobertura and emma are outdated now

11523072
post	put
after reading a lot of post and stack overflow resources i ve still got some problems about the famous question about where to put business logic

11523072
getter	setter
if i didn t miss something you have to create an entity with some properties getter setter and so on in order to make it persist into a db

11523072
post	put
when you render and post a form you bind it with your entity and with constraints of course and use all the concepts defined above to put all together

11523151
width	height
i ve tried binding the width and height of the path s to the contentpresenters width and height but no dice

11523151
width	height
note that in the image above the text fits in the width and height of the path however when i add text or remove text from the contentpresenter it does not resize

11523152
addclass	removeclass
i know that there is a jquery function to addclass and removeclass

11523160
post	get
what i mean is that as long that it is a valid url it will work and you ll be able to get the parameters via get or post

11523160
post	get
in order to post data about foo you might call as a post request and now the rest fw know that since its a post request it will call the method responsible for handling post and not the one for handling get

11523160
put	get	post	put	post	get
so although you have the same url it really matters if its a get post put delete request

11523169
width	height
to find the screen width and height then you can scale the image using

11523253
for-loop	arrays
the first uses the for-loop with the second doing the same but not using the arrays s length property just for interest

11523296
post	get
found out the issue john doe s post in this question helped to get to the answer - javascript load order

11523305
min	max
variables which do not participate in active constraints can be set at either min value or max value 0 or 1 as per your description depending on whether their coefficients in the objective function are positive or negative assuming you are minimizing your objective function

11523307
actualheight	actualwidth
i d suggest binding the path property to the actualwidth actualheight of the contentpresenter using a converter to calculate the path.data

11523307
width	height
since two properties are needed height and width you ll need an imultivalueconverter or you ll need to pass the entire contentpresenter into your binding like this

11523318
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
what i have done before is set the top margin of the element to -1000 and the position to absolute the get the width and height after that setting the top margin right

11523337
implements	extends
instead of extends class it can also implements any interface

11523397
width	height
which is correct since the cgsize is defined as width height

11523432
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop in a while loops

11523432
for-loop	loops
can the for-loop make the while loops broken

11523433
width	height
i fixed the problem by setting the height and width of the dialog to the same of the iframe

11523434
put	get
i create some object objcake and put it into both maps so each map has a reference to objcake and when i make some changes to objcake whichever map i access it from i get correct state of my object

11523451
min	max	range	max	range	min
if you want the full range of doubles you could set min max to -double.max_value and double.max_value respectively.

11523473
int	boolean
this should be completely safe from malicious code unlike eval but the object that it is able to read are must be simple objects strings int floats none and boolean or lists tuples dictionaries composed entirely of strings int floats none and boolean

11523495
dbcontext	objectcontext
and i expect context to be object of objectcontext or dbcontext

11523509
hide	show
what is the best way patterns practices specific examples to now take my actual web form controls and map them to the records in my tbl_fieldaccess table and then use that to determine whether or not to show hide the control make it readonly etc

11523514
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you serialize the container and deserialize it back the references should be what you were expecting because the objectinputstream and objectoutputstream keep references to them while serializing deserializing your object graph

11523522
post	get
2 post 1 session you get a no session bound to the current context -error

11523532
getter	setter
if your business objects entities are anemic i mean if they donâ t have business logic just getter and setter then you will prefer soa

11523569
int	chars
however when i entered a chars it goes into an infinite loop displaying the previous int value entered

11523671
dictionary	map
i would recommend a map object which is different from the dictionary to allow get and co as message names

11523681
int	double
the range of double exceeds that of both int and long which is why the return type of math.round double is double

11523711
ant	emma
publishesr and subscribers of main classes are getting executed .currently working in code coverage part using the tool emma .i have created the build file using ant script and created the targets for emma at present m facing issue as mentioned below

this actually creates a view with the right height and width a scrollview with a list of those has exactly the expected length and scrollbars but they are empty black even though the xml layout contains a lot of textviews

11523787
onclick	onfocus
well you could add your function to onclick or onfocus attribute and check if the user hasnt changed anything it should do the trick

11523791
draggable	droppable
you should also read docs on droppable and draggable

11523821
google-chrome	firefox
localstorage works well with google-chrome and ie but with firefox the version i am using 13.0.1 it seems it is cleared after i close it

11523855
abstract-class	superclass
this way you can spare abstract-class with a cost of defining a rigid superclass so you would be unable to have different superclass for the square

11523887
getter	setter
error 200 org.springframework.beans.notreadablepropertyexception invalid property currentdevicedata of bean class java.lang.string bean property currentdevicedata is not readable or has an invalid getter method does the return type of the getter match the parameter type of the setter

11524115

11524237
portrait	landscape
these will allow you to change the css styling of of screen elements in landscape and portrait modes without having to rely on javascript at all

11524302

11524646
put	get
so what you could do is either stop the event from bubbling up the stack if the element you want to hover is lower in the stack that the elements you want to prevent hover effects on or specifically put in prevent default for onhover events for all elements in the stacking context except for the one you want to actually get a hover effect

11524691
integer	unsigned
i suspect the issue is that the return of count is an unsigned integer and subtracting more than it s magnitude it underflows and becomes quite large

11524701
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the custom font proximanovalight is not loading so the height of the h2 element inside .steps is slightly different to what it is in google-chrome

11524701

in google-chrome the h2 has a computed height of 26 pixels whereas in firefox it s 30 pixels

well my guess is that this has something to do with your height width ratio

11525998
width	height
if you look at the default embed link for the video the width height is 500 281 which differs by a factor of about 1.78

11525998
width	height
your width height ratio is 2.15

11525998
width	height
that seems to further suggest that the issue is with your width height

11525998

perhaps try to make your width 1.78 times your height and see what happens

if you can have a fixed width or fixed height of the div like 200px wide then it shouldn t be too hard to give the image a range to fill

11527191
short	base
so in short when microsoft chooses to add functionality to a single class or family with a common base class they d probably just add the method directly all things being equal but if they wanted to apply a new method to all implementations of a given interface they d probably use an extension method on that interface

11527239
children	parent
either i do a hierachical model with parent children ancestors etc or a flat more graph-like structure

11527239

i have a script that shows a filtering list of what grouping a particular ad user is a member of

11527524
restrict	shared
i d then probably group those together by the actual users so i can easily choose joe blow to give him access on all his devices -- but with a hierarchical display i could also pretty easily restrict access to a subset of those so if i want to shared it with joe on his office machine but it s sensitive enough that i don t want it going where somebody might look over his shoulder while he looks at it i can pretty easily do that too

11527544
integer	unsigned
with a not too old compiler supporting a reasonably recent c standard probably c99 perhaps even earlier you should have a header giving you a type like int64_t for a signed 64 bits integer or uint64_t for an unsigned 64 bits integer which is exactly 64 bits even on 32 bits machine

11527740
children	parent
also considering what you re showing here you probably are ending up with children going outside of the inner parent

11527740
children	parent
basically it adds a pseudo element to the end of the parent clears that element which gives a context so your children play nicely

11527741

11528368
google-chrome	firefox
but logging in the first way three inputs only google-chrome and firefox ask

11528380
put	get
to get around that use the extern keyword to tell the compiler this name will be declared somewhere else and then put the real declaration in an implementation file

11528380
put	get
it doesn t appear that _x is a function but if it were and if you were silly enough to put the function definition in a header file then you d again get an error if that file were imported into more than one implementation file

hide	show
sure just hide all other screens except the one you re currently showing and the one you want to show and slide over

11528775
put	get
sc0tt is correct that you probably want to use however that might not be good enough to get what you want since your frames will likely resize themselves depending on what you put in them unless you do myframe.grid_propagate false

you may also want to consider redirecting stdout and stderr to a file or dev null to prevent nohup from writing output to a file

11528825
equals	gethashcode
the rule for implementing gethashcode is that any two objects that are equals must generate the same hash code

11528825
int	boolean
this implementation uses the bitarray class to take your boolean array in groups of 32 treats them as bits and computes the hash code of the resulting 32-bit int

11528845
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox etc

11528845
google-chrome	firefox
which makes the client firefox google-chrome etc produce an alert box

11528876
serializable	deserialization
both filename field and method getfilename have the correct property name of filename and setfilename has a different one filename1 in this case jackson will look for a filename1 attribute in json at the point of deserialization and will create a attribute called filename1 at the point of serializable

11528890
pop-up	dialog
instead of built-in javascript dialog box pop-up - that are ugly and impossible to customize with css - i would recommend using jquery dialog box controls

11528913
inherited	properties
if you re saying this because there s additional functionality in class a that doesn t apply to class c then i would hoist out the properties part of the class compositionally so you have a b c containing aprops bprops and cprops respectively and give the properties classes a proper inherited relationship

11528933
width	height
32px height by width would be much larger obviously

nowadays with cache-based pipelined branch-predictive hardware your cpu will be pipelined well into the next loop iteration speculatively executing the loop code again by the time you detect the i end exit condition at which point the processors will throw out that final speculatively-executed set of results

downloaded all your resources and confirmed that the problem does indeed appear even in google-chrome if the webfont isn t loading just as it does in firefox

11530199
google-chrome	firefox
simply deactivating the font in dev tools doesn t work for reproducing it because the element sizes have already been established by the time you do that. so we can answer why is it happening in firefox but not google-chrome

11545042
xpages	lotus
and since you said you are new at developing in domino lotus notes i believe your best bet is to go for xpages

i am totally totally clueless when it comes to powershell but after downloading an enormous torrent full of subdirectories publisher.title.author.year essentially each containing one or more zip files which when unzipped each contained a part of a multi-file rar arhive and finally once assembled that contained a uselessly named pdf file.

11545765
ready	each
so i came up with this rough and ready script to recurse into each subdirectory unzip the zips into that directory then assemble the rar files and extract the pdf into that directory then rename the pdf with the directory name and move it up a directory so by the end i ended up with the base directory full of meaningfully named pdf files.

11545784
screens	mdpi
if you try to support multiple screens prior to api 13 that the small width feature was added you have to use the screens size small medium etc and density ldpi mdpi etc to supply different layouts for different screens

i would recommend checking it in every browser and every client possible hotmail gmail ect in different browsers thunderbird outlook...

11545826
jena	dotnetrdf
as a developer on both dotnetrdf and jena i personally dislike the notion of jena.net besides the fact that there is likely to be some degree of performance hit involved in running ported code there is the fact that jena is very non .net in it s design in many ways - naming conventions design patterns static factories everywhere

11545826
jena	dotnetrdf
if there are specific features of jena that you d like to see in dotnetrdf i d be much more interested in just writing native .net implementations of those features using jena codebase as a guide

11545962
children	parent
though it sort of reverses things links to children instead of to parent

11546024
vb.net	vb6
a typical vb6 standalone application would map to a vb.net winforms application and once you get to that point the coding differences you ll come across will highlight how much better the object orientation of the .net world is than vb6 - you ll get true implementation inheritance all most of the other goodies of oo

11546054
width	height
i have a layout at the moment with two main divs both have to be full width and height but obviously you can only see one at a time

this method is presumably what the django docs on widgets are referring to when it says the widget handles the rendering of the html and the extraction of data from a get post dictionary that corresponds to the widget. there s nothing further on this point in the docs but you can see how it works from the code for the built-in widgets

free	realloc
is it necessary to free memory before using realloc again for a pointer variable

11548883
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
it should also be mentioned that realloc s capabilities also cover malloc s and free s functionality given the appropriate argument values

11548883
realloc	malloc
what you are doing in the second cycle of your code is essentially using realloc in pure malloc mode

11548890
free	realloc
the specific usefulness of realloc is that you don t need to free before using it it exists to grow memory that has already been allocated

11548890
realloc	malloc
when passed a null pointer realloc behaves as malloc

11548890
free	malloc
if you re using free before calling it you might as well be using malloc

11548901
realloc	malloc
realloc null n is the same as malloc n so the second case is semantically equivalent to

11548901
free	realloc
it should be noted that realloc will return null if the allocation fails -- but if you passed it a non- null pointer then that allocation will not have been free

11548943

you can simply make the insert method protected instead of public and make class a extend list

11549803
zypper	yum	rhel	suse
it will be run on either rhel or suse meaning i have to have a case for each one one for yum and the other for zypper

11549804
union	distinct
so you ll either have to fetch all results not just the top 5 and sort them in the application or use two distinct queries possibly merged on the server side using union the way redfilter suggests

google-chrome	firefox
is there possibly any reason why ember.select would bind in firefox google-chrome ie9 but it won t work in ie8

11550271
popupwindow	pop-up
for whatever reason you need to call popup.getcontentview .findviewbyid instead of just findviewbyid where pop-up is your popupwindow object

11550315
put	get
that is not to say you can t put together a complex query to get the data you are after you just have to build that logic perhaps by doing unions on the results of various select statements

11550423
put	get
my doubt is this i have in a database table my news with my field link and you can add a link in any table except that when i go to the view and dolphins do not get me the link it redirects the q link i put it so does lotuscap.com cakephpus news index globo.com i want to get only globo.com how do

min	max
i m using sparklines and am trying to draw a simple blox plot with predetermined min max whiskers quartiles and one additional value -- the user s value that might fall within the quartile or outside the whole point is to show the user where his her value falls in the distribution

11551371
min	max
also i can t see how to set min and max but it looks like the outliers sort of do this

11551425
min	max
for example if you include the std namespace and later try to write a max or min function you will most likely get compiler errors

11551454
portrait	landscape
what you can do is provide your own back button and if the view is in portrait pop an alert that says please rotate to landscape first or better yet animate a small view in from the bottom or top of the screen

11551454
portrait	landscape
its a terrible ui choice to let the user go back and see the view in landscape while the phone is in portrait mode in any case

11567199
superclass	subclassing
now a superclass reference can be assigned to an object of the type subclassing as well

11567199
superclass	subclassing
if we have a method say somemethod in the superclass which we override in the subclassing then a call of that method on a superclass reference can only be resolved at runtime as the compiler can t be sure of what type of object this reference would be pointing to at runtime

11567199

each operation you push and pop the list and compare the popped item to the stored min and max

11567442
min	max
you then update the min max with the next best

11567442
min	max
this method has o 1 typical case and o n worst case min or max needs an update

11567442
min	max	range	max	range	min
it s important to note that for some range of n numbers the number of times you will need to update min and max goes to a constant and the number of times you won t goes to n

though most browers are running the code okay especially firefox some like safari have problems after a while a while like 15 seconds

11568470

i m thinking this is just a side effect of using get instead of post

11568483
multiplying	add
and you need to add a macro do_mult which will multiplying instead - there are 2 ways to do this

11568487

11568510
google-chrome	firefox
the vote image updates to an oval shape on firefox google-chrome

11568629

if you aren t using one of those you ll need to do some manual sql joins in your query assuming you re using a relational db like mysql postgresql or sqlite

11568639
width	height
i noticed that the width and height of the span element went from 33x19 to 0x0

11568648

i have several forms that have radio button and checkbox embedded in tables

11568670
button	checkbox
first the user can click a radio button or checkbox by clicking the table cell that contains the button

11568670

second the user can toggle checkbox and radio button by clicking twice

11568683
entity-relationship	diagram
is it possible to generate entity-relationship diagram that can by convertert to latex file or text file for printing that in pdf maybe some dll

11568683
entity-relationship	diagram
could you give me some advice or maybe like i said before there is an easier way to generate simple entity-relationship diagram from database

11568687

i know i could achieve this effect by creating all of the fields before hand and then simply using css to show hide each one but this is a lot of repetitive code

11568692
postgresql	mysql
if you want to switch from say mysql to postgresql you will find things extremely difficult without using migrations

11568707
innodb	myisam
ok so it seems changing the storage engine on the database table from innodb to myisam solved the issue

11568752
integer	unsigned
please note that you might prefer using unsigned long integer long integer to receive the value

11568800
wav	aiff	wav	ogg	mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	aiff	ogg
mp3 and ogg will probably give you similar performance so first identify how mp3 compares to uncompressed audio such as wav or aiff

11568800
mp3	ogg
if mp3 ogg is better try different compression ratios and sample rates to see which goes faster

11568800
wav	ogg	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
with wav files you can try lowering the sample rate you can do this with mp3 ogg as well

11568822

11568875
profiling	instrumentation
the profiling command in xcode cmd-i should do a build and then restart the run in instrumentation

11568922
sharepoint	spsite
i started off by using web services to read the listitems from a certain list which worked to a certain extent. i couldn t do any more testing because it was immediately recommendeded that i stop using that method and instead try to use sharepoint s own services like by using microsoft.sharepoint and the respective .dll in my project. i found plenty of tutorials on how to go about doing this online but i keep getting hung up on one part namely the spsite portion

11568996
post	get
however whenever i call the page or search methods that normally work on my post collection i get a method does not exist error

11569051
ssms	sqlcmd
remember to enable sqlcmd-mode in the ssms look under query - sqlcmd mode

11569077
sorting	filtering
some rest apis use query strings for filtering pagination and sorting but since rest isn t a strict standard i d recommend checking some rest apis out there such as github and stackoverflow and see what could work well for your use case

11569114
folder	directory
i have a small program which iterates recursively through each file and folder under a target directory checking the names for specific characters

11569114
folder	directory
when the top level and all subordinate directory are folder which the user has read access everything works fine again

11569114
folder	directory
the issue lies with directory where the user has read access to the top level but does not for some child folder deeper within

11569127
google-chrome	firefox
but it does not with firefox nor google-chrome

11569134
hide	show
i think when you blur a field in safari it hide the keyboard and then when you focus a new field it show the keyboard

11569164
put	get
and obivously you have to download each of those and put them in your project - on the website there is a link that says download thats where you get it

11569192
accelerometer	gyroscope
using the gyroscope magnetometer and accelerometer i was able to fuse and extract the roll pitch and yaw angles all in quaternion format cal it q

11569203
nunit	mstest
you should check out another thread that contrasts the capabilities of nunit and mstest

11569208
pull	push
what i found at the end was that the way i shall use nested arrays is with push and pull

11569213
google-chrome	firefox
on a sidenote you should use console.log for debugging this logs in firebug s console on firefox in the google-chrome webinspector window or in the ie development console

11569217
width	height
i m trying to alter code so that i can resize a bmp by a factor of n adding n triples to the the width and the height

11569601
client-side	server-side
this task splits into client-side and server-side parts

11569638
maven	pom.xml
maven won t explicitly write a dependency onto the pom.xml for you

11569638
maven	pom.xml
but once you have a dependency listed in either of the pom.xml files parent or child then maven should be able to have all the dependencies in the classpath whereby it is able to deploy all the dependencies

11569644
int	chars
i had a thought that i could be sneaky and read the file as a formatted file byte-by-byte or 4 bytes by 4 bytes really into a chars array and then convert the contents of the chars into int and floats via the transfer function or the dreaded equivalence statement

11569653
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome and opera

11569661
hide	show
other idea one liner replaces your code if hide and show are existing methods contained by this.window

11569692
int	chars
if the int promotion would promote the unsigned chars s to unsigned int s and that could produce wrong results because before the modulus by w a modulus by uint_max + 1 is performed due to unsigned arithmetic

i m really new to silex and symfony

11569719

superclass	subclassing
you re breaking the liskov principle everything a superclass can do a subclassing must be able to do

11570073
min	max
the biggest difference in max min over these values over a certain period say 1 60th of a second will be the volume of that frame

11570073

about bitmaps i wrote my own bitmap class to convert a png to a bmp because the bitmapfactory and co didn t work for me

11570526

11570742
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
you edit the nsmenu that s attached to the nspopupbutton as follows

11570756
free	malloc
so look for free that is called with the same argument which was returned by malloc previously

you can use the rdtsc read timestamp counter instruction on x86 to get the 64bit cpu timestamp into edx eax

11570791

11571012
geocoding	geocode
the best strategy is to geocode the addresses offline using the geocoding web service store the coordinates in your database then use them to display the markers this will reduce the time to load your page since the geocode is subject to rate limits and quotas

11571072
stdout	stderr
redirecting stderr to stdout works because stdout is already pointing at the pipe

11571072
stdout	stderr
less s stdout and stderr both presumably started out pointed at the terminal so in this case has no effect

11571072
stdout	stderr
and cmd1 and cmd3 s stderr and cmd3 s stdout - the terminal

11571072
stdout	stderr
if you use the bash-specific pipe things get stranger because each of the pipeline s stdout redirects still occur first but the stderr redirect actually comes last

11571072
stdout	stderr
first stdout of f goes to the pipe next stdout of f is redirected to dev null and finally stderr is redirected to stdout dev null still

11571078

textarea	textbox
the text in textbox is not set with a textnode like for textarea but with the value attribute

11571216
range	minimum
for example i used a srtm in ca whose elevation range is from 136 to 737 but when i use numpy to get the maximum and minimum values the array value range is from -3.40 to 737 and it appears lots of negative values

11571257
multiplying	add
instead add the padding then multiplying by the row and column

post	get
once the session is built then http traffic goes over it starting with the get post whatever then the server responds as normal with the www-authenticate header that triggers the login box

11571621
superclass	subclassing
static methods of the same name defined in a subclassing can hide the superclass method but they do not override them

11571625
inherited	subclassing
when you call an inherited static method like that the subclassing isn t involved at all so i don t think that information is available

11571755
post	get
when the user submits the form let s assume the form is using post you can get the id with

11571761
hash	md5
if you don t want to go with this method because you don t want a 2nd column you could just md5 hash the id or some other hashing method

11571761
hash	md5
the downside to this method is that it is an expensive query since you won t be using an index and it has to compute all the md5 hash for each id

11571762
width	height
i need to create a grid view mosaic view to layout cells of different sizes both width and height

fontfamily	font-size
okay the issue was with 1 fontfamily not defined for code and pre blocks which meant chrome and other webkit browsers chose some monospace font that appears smaller 2 line-height was smaller almost equal to the font-size

11572113
google-chrome	safari
i have no idea why google-chrome dev tools web inspector s computed style shows 11px as the font-size also applies to any webkit browser including safari

11572113
fontfamily	font-size
also after setting the fontfamily on code and pre blocks chrome now shows the correct computed font-size value

11572114

int	chars
a chars enclosed in single quotes is just the same as the int representing it in the collating sequence in ascii implementation a means exactly the same as 97

11572177
int	chars
because an int is always large enough to hold several chars some implementations of c compilers allow multiple chars in a chars constant as well as a string constant which means that writing abc instead of abc may well go undetected

11572177
int	chars
many of the c compiler take it to mean an int that is composed somehow of the values of the chars a b and c

11572196

synthesize will generate the getter and setter methods of the properties if the getter and or setter has not already been implemented manually

11572317
getter	setter
dynamic is used when you don t want the runtime to automatically generate a getter and setter and you haven t implemented them manually

11572317
getter	setter
basically dynamic is telling the compiler that the getter setter will be provided dynamically at runtime using some sort of runtime magic

11572321
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
so bash tcsh or zsh is fine

once you have the data in the arrays what you will want to do is sort the corresponding row and then populate an html table using a for-loop

11572748
int	double
what i mean by this is if you have getdiv return an int and a 1 and b 2 it will return 0 1 2 0.5 which truncates to 0 if you are looking for a nice floating point answer you should be using a double or float

11572748

i know that nysiis is pretty similar to soundex but i don t have a good idea of how similar they are or how nysiis compares to metaphone

at first glance it seems like it would be ok to me but would it really be appropriate for a technology object to have getter setter methods for adding tools

11581545
stdout	stderr
you ll need to be careful with your io though since all those processes trying to write to stdout stderr at the same time will get garbled results

11581545
stdout	stderr
you ll need to do something like the answer from this question pipes between parent and child processes fork and stdout stderr to the console from child processes

11581553

i can t seem to find a good explanation of how the canvas is handling this i m getting the same behaviour in safari on macosx and google-chrome and firefox on windows7

it is possible to do so with the setter but highly unrecommended and is completely impossible with the getter as it takes no parameter to determine what to get

11583715
getter	setter
for the setter you would have to pass a with a single pair but it goes against what you would expect the getter setter to usually do and completely stops you setting the entire dictionary

11583718

11583997
post	get
as you seem to be pretty comfortable with diving in to the code and running in debug mode one avenue to try is to capture the defective post url and post data and attempting the update via a browser based rest client like simple rest client or poster and observing if you get the same error message in the wsapi response

strlen	strcpy
with this you can remove the overhead of iterations in strcpy and strlen functions

vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
dms has production front ends for many languages both modern and legacy including visual basic in its variety of dialects vb6 vba essentially the same as vb6 and vb.net

11584225

this is pretty hard for legacy languages vb especially the older dialects because such languages are generally poorly documented vb6 and vba especially so

also do not set fixed width and height if you want them to be managed automatically

11584355
for-loop	arrays
edit if you are trying to find a single item of an arrays that matches some criteria i would suggest just using a regular for-loop

11584365
int	chars
as shown in for bar bar int m chars n initialize base using m and n works fine

11584397
int	chars
the code relies on a regular expression to find all sequences of hex digits converting them to int and casting the resultant value to a chars

11584417

hex	binary
after some fight i finally got it...i just need to convert the binary to hex and then back to binary.

11584504
hex	binary
two notes to convert a binary to hex you can use string.unpack which will return an array

11584504
hex	binary
to convert an hex to binary you first need to build it as an array anystringhere and then pack it back to binary using array.pack

if you clone using the https address then that will be saved as the remote location for your repository and will be where git tries to push and pull from

11584797

as a result one group founded hypertable a c++ implementation and the other group started working on hbase in java

11584959
children	parent
in your case it seems that there is not a clear view flow hierarchy your parent view holds a view that can change but your parent view does not come before or go after your first and second children views so let s start making our transitions

11584959
children	parent
you can get your first and second viewcontrollers by instantiating your two children view controllers in your parent view controller as such

11584962

getter	setter
it represents current state of the object doesn t actually do anything when invoked other than report that state and generally getter setter in .net are properties

11584990
accessor	properties
this would be particularly true if the method returned void of course which isn t the case here so this could be considered a borderline issue and not even a question in languages which don t have properties but just use accessor methods which under the hood is what a properties does

11585057
width	height
maybe you can try box-sizing if you mixing width height with padding border

11585057
width	height
it ll force the browser to take the width height value

11585124
put	get
obviously you d need a recursive query to get the sub-categories from all levels but it should be fairly efficient provided you put an index on parent_id

11585315
toolbar	tabs
dock a toolbar to the bottom of this container and fill the items array with different tabs

11585315
toolbar	tabs
in your controller add control properties to your config object for each of the tabs in the toolbar and listen for the tab tap event

google-chrome	firefox
use firebug on firefox or just right click and chose inspect element on google-chrome to see in which css file properties are defined

11585363
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
as a rule of thumb if you want good browser compatibility don t put width and margin padding left or right in the same element same with height and margin padding top bottom

11585363
width	margin
try putting a container like a around #menu_option and put the width there and leave the margin in the internal element just to see if it makes it any better

11585424
superclass	subclassing
i now realise that although in my case it works fine it is somewhat dangerous since subclassing methods are called on an object that has currently only been constructed as a superclass object something that may be overlooked when new classes that extend superclass are added in the future

11585485
children	parent
there are also different types of trees -- i am going to assume that you are using a normal old tree any number of children no more than one parent one root node

beginning with android 3.2 api level 13 the screen size also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape orientation

11585586
portrait	landscape
it views upside-down only in landscape mode and not in portrait and in landscape from version 2.2 if i remember correctly

11585586

i used the code below so you can set the size you want and then it applys it to the form s size but still haven t figured out how to automatically detect the form s width and height when it s resized

11585909
width	height
here is the code as you can see the image will maintain its aspect ratio since i used the width 100 but other elements have their own size width and height which cannot be in percent

11585909
width	height
so ideally i like to set the width height top and left position of those elements when resizing the window keeping their aspect ration correctly

children	parent
each qobject maintains a parent pointer and a list of its children which it deletes when it gets deleted

11585920

for this reason and to avoid bloat from #1 the qt datatypes qstring qhash etc. aren t qobject

if you decide you don t want need these here s what i d recommend instead keep your classes vanilla but store them in a qobject descendant from qabstractitemmodel

11586220
hide	show
is this possible with zend form or would i need to use client side javascript to show and hide the elements

11586266

what you have to do is do a request to the php page if you are going to use this on a real app and not for an exercise you ll have to put the page somewhere publicly and get the data for processing

11586399
mouse	keyboard
however if i then move the mouse out of the item the input field reverts to whatever the user had typed losing the selection previously made via the keyboard

11586401
put	get
i get the feeling that the problem with your attempt is likely to be the order of the rules a missing rewritecond on the redirect rewriterule and or that you didn t put a l flag in the redirect rewriterule - but the above regexes make me happier than yours do because they are a little more specific about what they match

11586430
ggplot2	lattice
my experience has been that people coming to ggplot2 or lattice graphics fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of faceting or trellising in lattice

int	double
the int above and below both those quantities are precisely representable as float but the nearest double to each of them has a fractional part of precisely 0.5

11586688
int	double
because converting such double values between 2 23 and 2 24 with a fractions of precisely 0.5 to float will round to the nearest even int

11586701
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop to loops over the json and print out the information you need

11587100
dictionary	map
the idea of the json object is the same as a dictionary map where you have keys and values assigned to those keys so what you want to construct would be something like this

11587100
dictionary	map
where the 1 is the id and the contents is another dictionary map with the info

11587131
express	node.js
i have a search engine written in node.js express that is currently not logging any statistics and i d like to start keeping track of # of queries per day

tcplistener	tcpclient
so in a nutshell i have server set up using tcplistener tcpclient and it has a couple dozen client machines

11587160
cufft	fftw
originally i ran fftw but i saw that i couldn t call it in kernel so i then rewrote that part using cufft but it tells me the same thing

11587167
flac	ogg
the flac-to-ogg mapping page has a fairly thorough explanation of why it s desirable to use ogg encapsulation in many cases instead of streaming native flac

11587167
flac	ogg
the alternative is to treat native flac frames as ogg packets and accept the transport redundancy

11587167
flac	ogg
see the complete page for more information but the upshot is that while usable for streaming native flac isn t well-suited to more complex setups and the cost of ogg encapsulation is quite low

11587167
flac	ogg
if native flac works fine for your specific needs you can go ahead and use it but ogg will ultimately give you more flexibility

11587175
width	height
update in reply to comment in that case you can set other properties like the width and height to 0px and the over-flow to hidden so that the divs don t occupy any space on screen

11587175
addclass	removeclass
you can use the jquery addclass and removeclass methods to make the divs visible and invisible and

11587182
pull	push
that set up is correct i can push and pull using the command line as well as the git extensions gui which itself uses the command line

11587182
pull	push
in monodevelop however push and pull fail

11587183
hide	show
to hide the jpeg header he uses css rules to hide the body and show only some elements

11587201
public	protected
the protected class cannot inherit from the private class for the same reason that public classes cannot inherit from internal classes a class cannot be more accessible than its base class

11587213
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu usr share qt4 mkspecs common g++.conf usr share qt4 mkspecs common linux.conf and the target dependent conf files

11587217
post	put
however the record already exists on the server and since i fetched it and the model instance has an id property i thought that backbone should do a put instead of a post

11587224
inherited	properties
how do you extend the inherited properties without destroying the existing ones

11587231
getter	setter
ecmascript allows us to define getter or setter as following

11587232
hide	show
why not use jquery show and hide

11587232
hide	show
show or hide them by using

11587298
getter	setter
also note that the new ecma standards ecmascript5 mentions object.defineproperty as the way to define properties with getter setter

11587339
post	get
this works for both get and post

11587341
ssl	https
so network solutions redirects https queries behind a firewall or some such nonsense so there is no way to detect an ssl connection on the server side

11587371
post	get
the problem is in order to use post get request i ll need to send the data to another link

11587382
bash	zsh
the tilde is part of a shell expansion like in bash csh zsh etc

11587474
min	max
for example if you want a gap of 5 generate the first number between min and max add 5 to it and generate the next number between that and max

11587474
range	max
a little extra code to wrap around to the beginning of the range if you pass max and you re good to go

11587509
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
use proper layoutmanager that accepting different preferredsize boxlayout or gridbaglayout

11587514
google-chrome	safari
this works fine in safari google-chrome but the effect is not triggered in other browsers

11587518
width	height
i m setting a nstextfield height based on the size of a text with a fixed width

11587538

elements that are floated automatically behave like block elements see w3c definition in terms of the box model width height margins

11587583
websphere	ibm
is it possible to develop portal applications directly on amazon ec2 base websphere instance by using ibm rad ide

11587589
post	get
the docs specify using only get or post methods

11587678
gson	jackson
there are lots of different libraries out there for doing this for instance jackson or gson

11587681
addclass	removeclass
use addclass removeclass and hasclass

11587687
int	boolean
the language itself is fairly simple as it only has int and boolean

11587687
int	boolean
the number of int or boolean pushed poped by a command never changes so the commands have fixed arity

11587687
subtract	add
for simple commands like add subtract etc. translating the integer stack commands to cil is almost trivially easy the cil stack can wholesale replace the integer stack although i have a side question is there a limit on how deep the cil stack can be either in spec or in practice

11587687
int	boolean
however there s also commands like storeiftrue which will only store a value from the int stack to the flat int array at some index the index also from the int stack if the top value of the boolean stack is true

11587687
int	boolean
so i need access to the boolean stack and the int stack simultaneously for some of the commands

11587740
put	get
had to put loggingin interceptors in to get to that

11587764
int	boolean
so the ves cannot see the difference between a boolean and an int on the stack internally the ves treats boolean as 32-bit int so it is not possible to use the execution stack to simulate both your boolean and int stacks

11587764
int	boolean
you could do the same treat boolean as int and non-zero int as boolean true

11587786
getter	setter
i tried to set up getter and setter

11587832
post	put
check how the first instance of the model has an id and it tries to do the put but the other post

11587892
int	double
it is highly likely that the high-order word is between 0 and 0x4000000 0 and a billion - most int and memory addresses will be in this range which means you end up with a double between approximately 0 and 2

11587932
versioning	upgrade
save switching to pdo for after the launch and the next minor versioning upgrade so that you have more time for testing

11587985
width	height
i have the device in lanscape mode but the window frame returns a swapped value of width and height

11587999
oncreate	findviewbyid
that s maybe something you already done but more generally in android we use to declare all the interface elements button imagebutton edittext ... as fields of the activity and applying findviewbyid and setonclicklistener ... functions inside the oncreate bundle savedinstancestate function

11588026
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
however i think this only works in google-chrome maybe opera or safari not sure and also appears to be deprecated

11588078
udp	tcp
i was using udp to send receive data but i now want to switch to tcp to avoid packet loss

11588078
udp	tcp	outputstream	inputstream
i ve read several tutorials on tcp and noticed that instead of using datagrampacket like udp tcp uses inputstream outputstream

11588086
cocos2d-x	libgdx

backbone.js	javascriptmvc
qunit is helpful if you have functions that return values or if you use an javascriptmvc framework like backbone.js

11588117
google-chrome	firefox
that works perfectly in firefox however it breaks in ie and google-chrome

11588124
google-chrome	firefox
it looks fantastic outside when started directly with any popular browser google-chrome ie firefox

11588132
super	implements
ideally something super lightweight that ideally doesn t even need to deal with sql at all just implements whatever contract that activerecord expects

11588151
put	get
you can put the code mappings into an associative array then a single statement will get the right name

11588176
free	malloc
so you cannot really track malloc and free at system call level

11588176
free	malloc
malloc free ..

11588179
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles

11588186
int	double
values that can be represented exactly as an int can also be represented exactly as a double

11588209
oncreate	setcontentview
wrong layout in setcontentview of the oncreate method of the fragmentactivity

11588215
google-chrome	firefox
the event is triggered in firefox google-chrome ie9+ without a problem

11588250
mouseleave	mouseenter
as amin eshaq pointed out use mouseenter mouseleave

11588374
vbscript	vba
what i would do is to use vbscript or vba to connect to teradata via odbc

11588385
disk	ram
for either of the above you want to make sure you have enough ram or really fast disk to hold all the input data the intermediate steps and the result

11588411
jobs	cron
you can then use php to slice and dice your cron jobs and get as deep into map reduce as you want

11588413
folder	directory
i did not export jar from the project as eclipse creates main.class and files inside the bin directory of the project folder which i think should be part of classpath

11588426
post	get
i sawe a link from laviak on a post from here ... but i can t get it to work

11588446
post	get
once i do get this thing up and running i ll do what i can to post the code and hopefully help others who are having similar issues

11588464
getter	setter
then i would like from here to use an ibaction outlet as so but xcode does not recognize my getter setter method in my custom class when using this code

11588468
post	get
-- i can just feel how many negative points i m going to get from this post xc--

11588513
fadein	hide
or if you don t want to hide it with css just call hide before calling fadein

11588551
mouseover	mouseout
the problem i am facing is that when they move the cursor from the image to the div which now covers the bottom portion of the image it triggers the mouseout as it is a separate element from the image and then a new mouseover event in quick succession because the div disappears when it detects that the cursor is no longer over the image meaning the div appears and disappears quickly over and over again

11588554
int	boolean
i admit this looks a bit complicated but all that s really doing is checking that the age is not at least 1 year and otherwise subtracting the years and then using a conditional test which that returns a boolean we interpret as an int 1 or 0 to adjust the difference back by 1 year when the current month and day are prior to the month and day of the birthday.

11588569
mouseover	mouseout
attach the mouseover mouseout events to the wrapper and they will trigger when you re expecting them to

11588580
folder	directory
you can do this by creating a src main webapp meta-inf context.xml i m assuming you re using the standard maven directory structure - if not then the meta-inf folder should be a sibling of your web-inf directory

11588611
tax	shipping
for example the product price the shipping price the tax collected any adjustments that were made

11588628
width	height
content div size is width 1076px height 475px

11588641
sorting	filtering
i ended up removing as much as possible the sqlite cache loading up what i needed and sorting filtering it using my own routines

11588641
sorting	filtering
this makes my database small enough to use less as a database and more as an indexing service which works well for loading the info into memory and sorting filtering

11588641
sorting	filtering
instead it s better to do the sorting filtering yourself though i will admit that s a lot work

11588682
mp4	webm	vorbis	webm
the practical solution probably is to provide two versions h264 in a mp4 container and what is usually called webm vp8 video and vorbis audio in a specific matroska container

11588693
multiplying	division
but determining the digit and the carry by division is much more concise and for the larger factors also much more efficient when multiplying a digit by 100 the result is on average 450 requiring 45 subtractions but two divisions are sufficient for all factors

11588699
rss	feed
the class below parses an rss feed and draws images text on the screen using asynctask

11588699

11588873
trie	tree
you can use prefix tree trie data structure to store words and keep track of count of words within prefix tree node

11588896
verilog	vhdl
in certain respects systemc deliberately mimics the hardware description languages vhdl and verilog but is more aptly described as a system-level modeling language

11588906
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
it only happens and only occasionally if i start the subprocess after some other things such as string manipulation opening communicating closing a socket with an objectinputstream objectoutputstream and reading from a small file

11588941
width	height
but the images need to stay together as if it were one so the top and bottom width is dynamic the left and right height is dynamic and the middle width and height is dynamic

11588941
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this needs to be supported by ie 8+ firefox google-chrome safari

11588967
cocos2d-x	libgdx
i need to know how libgdx compares to cocos2d-x for the android platform

11588974
width	margin
column margin is contributing to the cell width and generating this offset

11589021
free	malloc
so you just cannot write an allocator function malloc alternative c unless it only calls malloc free each time

11589065
onclick	onchange
select boxes you can either use onclick or onchange preferrably onchange

11589080
hash	salt
salt could be false mcrypt_create_iv returns false on error unlikely because of the hash output differences you mentioned above but worth checking

11589080
hex	binary
you could try converting the database column types to varbinary and using a string to binary or hex decoder before adding to your prepare

11589080
hash	salt
a salt and a hash are generally considered to be fixed-with bit fields often expressed in hex format for convenience

11589111
hide	show
the site loads all the questions 40 numbers of the test at once and show one after one to the user using javascript show hide

11589118
bazaar	git
i am thinking about this specifically for mercurial but it also applies to git bazaar etc

11589118
jobs	cron
back in the bad old days i used to run cron jobs that might do the equivalent of - pseudocode because i may not remember the cvs commands

11589126
qmenubar	qwidget
currently i have created a mywidget which derives from qwidget and contains a qtablewidget + a qmenubar

11589133
int	chars
the first two are int that i will declare to a variable and the next 2 are chars that i need to either assign to a string or a chars so i can print them out later

11589133
int	chars
i know how to get the int but my main problem with reading the chars is that i am not sure how to and there is a possibility that ones of the chars can be a or just a space

11589161
spaces	delimiter
it would make sense that attempting to use next to read a spaces character would not work as it is the default delimiter character

11589183
post	get
i used webview.posturl to post value but how to get result that i echo in the php

11589243
for-loop	loops
if you can find such an event you could loops through the items by an indexed for-loop and having all items there would know what the length would be meaning you don t have to hardcode that value

11589249
qmenubar	qwidget
since both qtablewidget and qmenubar inherit from qwidget i strongly recommend not using double inheritance

11589262
glfw	glew
everything else requiring glfw and glew in the program is working fine and when i replace gluint and glint with unsigned int and int then the program runs

11589273
folder	directory
for example i could create a directory with the time-stamp appended to the directory name tmp_123142345 and delete this folder after i m done writing the zip file to the stream

11589288
backgrounding	multitasking
supports multitasking playing audio in the backgrounding

11589321
postgresql	greenplum
edit one caveat is that i m using postgresql 8.4 with greenplum and so correlated subqueries are not supported

11589326
folder	directory
first the exact nature of what i am doing involves letting the user choose a directory then renaming all files of a certain type for instance all .pdf files within that folder while leaving all other files alone

11589335
freemarker	velocity
you should probably look into a proper templating system like freemarker or velocity or something like that

postgresql	informix
postgresql and informix have table inheritance

11589360
postgresql	informix

11589546
entity-relationship	diagram
for me when building an application that uses a backend database an entity-relationship diagram is pretty crucial

11589546
entity-relationship	diagram
do some tutorials on how to examine a problem domain create an entity-relationship diagram and build a set of related tables based on the diagram

11589546
many-to-many	one-to-many
to begin with you might think members and family could be in one table but then you discover that creates a lot of duplication so you separate that out into family and member table with a one-to-many relationship but then you realise that through marriage for instance people can belong to more than one family and you need to create a many-to-many relationship

11589594
jobs	cron

11589715
children	parent
if you set your #maincontainer div to position relative and your #leftcolumn div to position absolute you can then set both top and bottom on #leftcolumn so it always assumes the height of its parent #maincontainer even though #maincontiner s height is being set by its children #contentcolumn in this case

11589717
hide	show
i have also tried the mouseeneter and mouseleave function with show and hide and the toggle function

11589717
hide	show
i can get it to hide on mouse over and show on mouse exit although it does flicker while the mouse is inside the div

11589722
hide	show
the main difference between using opacity and between using hide show is that the element will still occupy space in your page when setting the opacity which is why it can still receive events but when you hide it it will no longer occupy any space in the page which is why it doesn t receive any mouse events

11589733
for-loop	while-loop
when i run the debugging one ellipse is drawn on the canvas and no more - i have already tried a for-loop and a while-loop to set an arbitrary amount of ellipses to be drawn on each timer tick but that didn t work

11589746
nsoperation	nsblockoperation
that s because nsblockoperation does not override the default behavior of nsoperation that specifies it is not a concurrent operation

11589770
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

11589991
versioning	upgrade
what the best solution for public versioning management and also for including automatic upgrade in our desktop .net application

11590034
cpu	processors
gpu code works best when all oarsmen processors cores threads are pulling in the same direction - uniform execution on separate data while database indexing might see some benefit by using a gpu approach it certainly won t be as big of a performance improvement over cpu baseline as something better suited to the gpu execution model constraints - like signal processing

11590045
stdout	stderr
and in the meantime there s a c source code library that will do all this for you redirecting stdout or stderr

11590045
stdout	stderr
on top of that it makes it trivial to create new streams that look and behave the same as stdout and stderr where you can redirect these new streams to multiple locations as well

11590059
fadein	fadeout
raphael does have only animation opacity for simulation of fadein and fadeout

implements	extends
it seems that there is little need for a distinct keyword interface when from my point of view as a developer the compiler spits out exactly the same thing which in human-speak is you cannot utilise this until you derive via implements or extends a new class which implements its methods

11593455
implements	extends
surely it would be trivial to build the language in such a way that the compiler recognises when there are any method bodies or declared variables and subsequently disallows multi- implements extends where appropriate

implements	extends
in your example there is no category name specified so it just extends the class and you can implements the method in the normal implementation

can anyone tell me why the following code works in google-chrome firefox and ie but not in safari

11594559
webclient	httpwebrequest
for the first three the client is webclient or perhaps httpwebrequest with a known or dynamically determined url

11594560
hide	show
each link inside this submenu hide the current content and show another one

11594560
hide	show
also maybe there s a better way to do this show and hide stuff but this seems to work fine

11594575
interbase	firebird
apart from rdb database which is simply a table that is guaraneed to only contain one record in firebird and interbase and possibly current_date obvious meaning this should be quite standard sql although far from all databases support with recursive required for the myresultset tmp_payment is not recursive and some may have different ways to subtract one date from another

11594596
datediff	difference
look at using something with datediff in mysql to get the difference between now and 24 weeks ago

11594642
x86	64bit
be sure to use win32 x86 platform on your application to avoid running into scenario that your app is running in 64bit domain while support for mp4 only exists in 32-bit components libraries installed

11594693
keydown	keyup
there is keydown keypressed keyup

11594693
keydown	keyup
not to be right and the keypressed is not fired for every keydown or keyup

11594738
webclient	httpwebrequest
some user speak about webclient others speak about httpwebrequest

11594786
children	parent
i know that a child of the view being added had the attribute layout_alignparentbottom true which caused it to fill the whole parent blocking any additional children

11594874
autocomplete	multi-select
jquery ui autocomplete has multi-select support

11594878
getter	setter
imo - too many answers here are promoting getter setter

11594878
getter	setter
getter setter are great for procedural code you either do some calculation and set the result or grab the value s and make some decision

11594878
accessor	properties
that being said i use accessor properties myself

11594894
fadein	hide
use .show and hide instead of fadein and .fadeout

11594950
children	parent
my next thought was to use addstatesfromchildren but all this did was make the parent show pressed but not the children

11594972
google-chrome	firefox
in this fiddle google-chrome and firefox display the expanding tree significantly differently

11594972
google-chrome	firefox
any idea how to get google-chrome to display like firefox

11594974
client-side	server-side
since php is a server-side language so it can t be dyanamic like javascript which is a client-side language do you have any better idea to do this other way round

11594999
width	height
for images width and height have not effect neither does autodimensions

11594999

you may also try adding the option type image in case your link looks like or it doesn t have an image extension jpg png gif

11595151
int	chars
you re trying to pass a list of int s to a function that takes a list of chars s

11595164
instances	transient
but then i have an issue because when requesting two of the same entity from active record at the same time both instances refer to the same object they can t have different transient data

11595204
width	height
the second line sets the frame of the button which is where it should be located on the screen and the button s height and width

11595236
put	get
if it is because you need to load alot of images you could get all the images on your site and put it in a single file and always get that file but with different background positions

11595246
implements	extends
the type licenseseditor cannot extends or implements haseditorerrors

11595320
ddms	adb
but not ddms or adb

11595342
postgresql	mysql
for instance nhibernate orm my personal favorite supports both postgresql and mysql

11595380
keydown	keyup
for example in windows if you hold down a key you ll see a keydown and or keypressed repeatedly as the key repeats and a single keyup once the key is released

11595380
keydown	keyup
also as mentioned in the comments if the focus switches while a key is down you might only see a keyup or keydown

11595380
keydown	keyup
the key state was already that way before the focus switch and windows probably won t tell you about it. and dead keys ones that don t generate a character on their own won t trigger a keypressed at all though they do typically trigger keyup and keydown

11595380
keydown	keyup
so don t assume that every keyup will match a keydown or vice versa or that keypressed appears before keyup

and reading the ndb source code especially get and put in context.py might also help

11595587
goto	break
goto is required to break out of the 2nd loop once the next area is found

11595638
hide	show
in extjs 4.1.x you can use the toggleall function of the line series to show hide all of the series elements markers lines etc.

11595638
hide	show
it is pretty easy if you have the series field name that you want to show hide

11595638
hide	show
you can simply iterate through the series of the chart and check if the series field is the one you want then call toggleall on it with a boolean parameter to either show or hide it

11595638
hide	show
for example if myfield is the series field name that you want to show hide and mychart is a reference to your chart

11595643
typedef	struct
the name cell is simply the name of a typedef that refers to this unnamed struct

11595647
typedef	struct
you need to provide the tag for your struct not only a typedef

11595647
typedef	struct
without the tag you are typedef -ing a tagless struct

11595674

11595914
bitwise-and	modulo
i have replaced two of the modulo operations in the wikipedia algorithm with bitwise-and operations

11595914
division	modulo
performing a modulo calculation requires division

11595914
division	subtract	subtract	add
on such cpus division is an arduous process involving repetitive looping bit shifting and add subtract operations that is very slow

11595914
bitwise-and	modulo
it turns out that the modulo of powers of two can be alternately achieved using a bitwise-and operation see wikipedia modulo - performance issues

11595914
bitwise-and	modulo
many optimizing compilers will convert such modulo operations to bitwise-and for you but less advanced compilers for smaller and less popular cpus may not

11595914
bitwise-and	modulo	addition	modulo
in addition to using bitwise-and to replace modulo operations you may note two additional disputes between the wikipedia algorithm and the optimized expression

11595914
division	modulo
this speeds up program execution greatly especially since it avoids the division necessary for the 100th year test the modulo 25 operation

11595922

if you have remove the codebehind ... declaration from global.asax and change the inherited ... declaration to reference the correct namespace and classname as it is defined in global.asax.cs file

11596430
many-to-many	one-to-many
the error could occur for the one-to-many relationship between person and location you apparently have in your model in addition to the many-to-many relationship

11596430
many-to-many	one-to-many
since every many-to-many relationship is an independent association no foreign key property in the model my guess is that the error is not related to your many-to-many relationship but to the one-to-many

11596441
client-side	server-side
while in python it is mostly a matter of style whether to catch the exception or to validate the input in other languages it might not be the case as sometimes exceptions are much slower to process than checking for a condition in web development is customary to also additionally to check the input server-side which you should always do validate the input client-side with javascript as this saves time to the user and cpu to the provider eliminating a request response cycle

width	height
the outer div has a set height and width as well as relative position

11596450
width	height
the inner div also has a set height and width

11596450
width	height
from what i understand padding will be derived based on the parent s height and width

11596450
width	height
my question is why has this been implemented in such a way and whether there is a way for me to reference parent s height instead of parent s width for top and bottom padding

11596461
width	height
this defines how margins and borders are treated in terms of the box width and height

11596461
width	margin
in quirks mode the margin and borders are inside the box so the width is the entire space the box takes up whereas in standards mode the margins and borders are added outside the box so the space the box takes up in total is the width plus the margin and border on either side

11596461
box-sizing	border-box
this is actually the perfect solution for you all you need to do is simply put box-sizing border-box

i followed this tutorial but changed it to use passenger and thin with nginx

11596796
accessor	properties
one important factor to note is i removed the mustinherit attribute accessor on the race.base class and no runtime exception was thrown when the get statement of the properties type was retrieving racetype.notset

11596796
inherited	properties
another note overloading the properties type in the inherited classes while still adding new instances of the inherited objects to the custombindingsource will not throw a runtime exception but instead returns racetypes.notset

11596801
stdout	stderr
if i output some message thru stdout system.out in java and stderr system.err in java in mapper and reducer where can i see them in task tracker node

11596898
std	ostream
changing all uses of stream in the signature back to std ostream will not make it any better so i assume that the new function declaration syntax is playing a major role here â â even though gcc claims to support it since 4.4

11596898
std	ostream
a way to make this work would be great too although using std ostream only works well enough for my current application

11596905

hide	show
show hide is functional in ie9 though transitions are missing gradient fade is emulated using an additional element

11597193
mouse	keyboard
i understand this is to help protect against keyboard loggers the password memorable data provides traditional password security but the drop-down numeric lists provides keylogger protection because the digits is randomised and selected with the mouse keyloggers generally don t log mouse movements

11597193
hash	salt
however one would assume that the website in question merely concatenates the two passwords together before going through the password match implementation hopefully using salt hash but even if they weren t concatenated it s obvious that the number of combinations assuming alphabetical passwords only of 16 char passwords 26 16 is identical to two 8-char passwords 26 8 26 8 26 8+8

11597198
inherited	subclassing
the difference is that it won t be inherited by subclassing of myclass

i upgrade to the latest versioning and now everything works fine

11597441
google-chrome	firefox
and i experience the same problem in both firefox and google-chrome

11597460
super	self
since this example only has single inheritance super example self .__init__ parent is exactly the same as qtgui.qdialog.__init__ self parent

11597460
super	self
the former uses super to get a version of self that calles qtgui.qdialog s methods instead of example s so that self is automatically included while the latter directly calls the function qtgui.qdialog.__init__ and explicitly passes the self and parent arguments

11597460
qdialog	qwidget
the third example actually uses qwidget instead of qdialog which is a little weird

11597460
qdialog	qwidget
presumably that works because qdialog is a subclass of qwidget and doesn t do anything meaningful in its __init__ but i don t know for sure

edit well moving the setcontentinset out of viewdidload into viewdidappear makes it work correctly except as the view is shown the content inset is wrong and then it snaps into place once the view appears

11597757
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
guess something weird is happening between viewwillappear and viewdidappear that i m not aware of.

11597785
width	margin
width and margin are now linked so if i try

11597785
width	margin
i think that since the user has to compute specific low-level layout quantities like margin and width we are still basically writing a plotting library

11597798
post	get
this is the correct way to redirect the client to a resource using the get method after the server has correctly handled a post request

11597801
post	get
it allows you to scrape site quite easily but problem is when i try to post to login i get nothing back

11597843

when using jquery to detect keyboard mouse events you should always use event.which to get the normalized user input cross-browser

slightly off-topic illustrative history couple months ago i made an userscript in vanilla js which runs perfectly fine in firefox and google-chrome and just now i had a report that it wasn t working in opera

11597866
octal	decimal
only decimal octal and hexadecimal are supported

11597897
getter	setter
but it s a bit unidiomatic in clojure where the use of data encapsulated behind side-effectful setter and getter functions is discouraged

11597900
elf	dwarf
basically i want to be able to change the path to the source file in debug dwarf section in a elf binary

11597905

put	get	post	put	post	get
do we use all these ways for each of http methods like get put post delete

11602512
put	get
are there any restrictions like get put etc should use only some ways to send data

11602534
put	get	post	put	post	get
but it s customary to use only path and query parameters with get and mostly body and path parameters with post and all three with put

11602567
subtract	add
my problem is that i need to know if the first query was an insert or a update because if it is an update i will need to subtract the old vote and add the new one but id it is just an insert i don t need to subtract anything and just increment the vote

if the block has fixed height and width just set background one image and padding s

11602618

if both width and height are dynamic i d suggest to use 2-3 additional divs anyway i know you want to avoid it i dont think playing with before and after is better

11602672
hide	show
this is just very simple thing.what i am looking for is some animation to show and hide calendar

11602695
getter	setter
for class-dump-z the -p option will generate property instead of getter setter which is more clear so you d probably type in

11602695
theos	logos
to ease the work some tools such as logos you will probably also need to see theos has been created that reduce the boilerplate code needed

11602762
uilabel	uitextview
mixing uilabel and uitextview is unlikely to give you easy copy and paste

11602802

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested with safari google-chrome and firefox

11602848
post	get
scroll down until the http verbs and check out the difference between get and post

11602865
hide	show
you can also use jquery function like .show hide or .toggle method for show hide your calender and animation

11603022
hide	show
however if say two are on a page the animation would show and then hide

11603022
hide	show
if there are three on a page the animation would run three times show hide show

11603056
hash	md5
i thought it may have something to do with the long md5 hash that contains the link so i used goo.gl api to shorten it

int	chars
the bytecode operands do need explicit casts l2i and longs need 2 stack positions compared to 1 for int chars short byte casting from byte to int doesn t need a bytecode instruction

11603186
hide	show
my problem is that as far as i can tell the standard actionbar api provides no such mechanism to show or hide action item buttons at will and the only time that the menu items can be defined is within oncreateoptionsmenu which is of course called by the system

11603186
hide	show
my belief is that the only way i m going to add buttons like this and show hide them at will is to create a custom layout for them and make use of .setcustomview to place them into the action bar

11603243
vb6	vba
mappoint s api is actually pretty well documented in the mappoint help file and most of the examples use vb6 which should be adaptable for vba - you will need to add a reference to mappoint s object model

11603243
vb6	vba
i recently wrote an article about using the latter from c# it would be simpler from vb6 or vba

if you cannot don t want to use polling based wcf and stick to your current mechanism i d suggest you to change the service from a post to get as apparently you wont have to send any complex data while fetching notifications

a get is a bit quicker and than a post in an ajax scenario

i didn t set up my database and noticed that some of my tables are innodb whereas others are myisam

11603339
int	chars
when you assign a negative chars to an int variable as in here what happens is not really sign-extension but - since all values a chars can represent are also representable as an int - a value-preserving conversion the chars i is converted to an int with the same value

i have a superclass and a set of subclassing

11603508
subclass	accessor
to create an accessor for one of these classes i would just use in the subclass definition

but if i put this in the superclass definition then won t it define an accessor for the instance variable of the superclass

11603520
imagemagick	magick++
i tried imagemagick and its api magick++ but that requires building it from scratch which is undesireable

11603660
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	show	hide	fadeout
though note i m using fadein and fadeout rather than the more-sudden show and hide

11603660
hide	show
which lends itself to the following jquery which stores the nodes to hide show as they are and then restores them as required

11603662
extendscript	jsx
i have searched high and low but can t figure out how to use extendscript jsx to flip a single selected object horizontally

11603883
uiview	subviews
i d like to display multiple small uiview as subviews relative to the screen estate

11603883
portrait	landscape
this should work across different screen sizes ipad iphone portrait landscape modes

11603883
min	max
each subview to display has two nsnumber objects with an unsigned int ranging from -100 min to 100 max which needs to be mapped to the correct x and y coordinates for positioning

11603884
tablet	galaxy
i need to test with galaxy tablet emulator

11603898
inherited	properties
...you can t achieve that as long as your abstractclass is an entity in your model with its own table because you must map between navigation properties of the types they are declared in and impl1.independentclass and impl2.independentclass are inherited properties but they are not declared in impl1 and impl2

11603898
inherited	properties
for ef your model does not have any inherited instead it considers impl1 and impl2 as an entity that just contains its own properties plus the properties of the base class as if it were one class without base

hide	show
i m trying to do a simple hover over div and show hide image

11604064
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

11604064
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
the difference between these events is that mouseenter and mouseleave only count when you fully leave an element while mouseover and mouseout count when you leave the element regardless if you are still inside the element

11604064
mouseout	mouseleave
for example when you leave an outer element for an inner element that s a mouseout but not a mouseleave because you are still inside the outer element

11604091
pull	push
to be able to sort on array length you have to maintain it in a separate field votes_count or whatever and update it when you push pull elements to from votes

11604159
multiplication	exponent
i d like to use an exponent in less.css in order to generate a series of fonts and save typing multiple multiplication operators

11604161
width	margin
you need to set an explicit width in order for the margin 0 auto to work

11604191
folder	directory
this directory and create a separate new folder for develop branch

11604214
xslt	xquery
for that you need xslt or xquery

11604245

you can have the subclassing implement just the before class method and inherited all the tests

11604291
int	double
void addnumber int number and double int getaverage

11604325
ant	maven
2 should we use one-time generated pojos or should we write add a maven plugin or ant that auto generates the pojos before each time compile task is invoked

11604377
qscrollarea	qgridlayout
use a qgridlayout in a qscrollarea

11604516

if you have an element whose width may change - you ll probably have to calculate it dynamically by jquery for instance and then set the negative margin

11604534
ienumerable	ienumerator
i m not gonna give you a complete solution but you should check out the ienumerable and ienumerator interfaces

11604539
width	height
i have not been able to find any d3 api documentation that would allow you to easily determine the needed width and height for a given d3.layout.tree or any other layout to ensure that no nodes overlap with one another

11604539
width	height
is there a simple d3 method to determine the width and height that my tree needs to be to avoid overlapping

11604661
width	height
you are not updating your width height or size when the window changes

11604667
strstr	substr
go with strstr - using regex to count a number of occurrences is not a good idea as you would need to use loop anyway so i would suggest you to do a simple loop with searching for poistion of substr and increase counter and starting search position after each match

11604676
versioning	upgrade
you ll need to upgrade your mysql versioning to one which supports innodb

11604692
strstr	strtok	strstr	strcmp	strtok	strcmp
as for performance i expect string functions strtok strstr strchr strpos strcmp ... to run all more or less at the same speed really really fast and regex to run appreciably slower albeit still quite fast

11604702
switching	screens
the problem is that after a few moments the iphone goes in sleep mode screens switching off and then the process is no longer active

11604754
post	get
a contextmanager has the advantage of not requiring two next calls to get to the stop iteration and cleaner syntax but if you wanted to return multiple values or something you could also do it this way but you can see that the post yield statement doesn t actually get called until the generator raises stopiteration on the next call the for-loop ends when it gets stopiteration

11604784
int	chars
the main burden of the project is the database which will hold 20 million rows of data with 5 columns per row 10 letter code 10 letter code 10 letter code 10 digit int url say 20 chars long on average

qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
i hope this will also work in the paintevent of a qgraphicsitem where the qgraphicsview uses a qglwidget as the viewport since i only tested it in qglwidget paintevent directly

11604819
for-loop	arrays
as you can see from my for-loop i actually don t need all the files in the arrays after it gets separated by the t

11604820
express	node.js
i am tying to mock url s of the following form using the express module of node.js

11604837
post	get
the only problem with this is that get and possibly post request methods are already taken on your resources and mapped to your normal views which return html or consume http form post

11604847
getter	setter
you d just have to be sure to treat it as read-only unless either you use the function use a setcookie method attached to the function or you re targeting only browsers which support native getter and setter

11604909

i have my database which is named db_info.sqlite in the same directory as my .h and .m files and i also dragged the database into the folder section on the left bar in xcode

11605110
ferret	sphinx
i ve was looking briefly at sphinx and ferret both of which seem to create an api for this but it was unclear whether they provided a clear text based option or if i would need to parse the search strings myself

11605143
post	get
i ve looked at other similar questions on stacked and even used an example which i will post below that says it should return an integer but i still get an array.

11605173
put	get
i am trying to get a scanner to read the input of a text file have that input put into a string have a stringtokenizer of that string and then have a string with each element of that array being a token of that stringtokenizer

get see --- you should be able to download the jar in project lib or put org.springframework.aws spring-aws-ivy 1.0 in project build.sbt

11605278
mouse	keyboard
the simplest way to do this would be to use the java.awt.robot class which allows you to directly control the mouse and keyboard

11605303
folder	directory
the .git folder will contain all of the bits that are in your working directory so you can expect it to increase the size

11605313
free	malloc
now it might be in practise the number of threads doing is this is so low it s okay - in which case you may have a number of threads performing the malloc with the winner atomically activating the new memory and the losers seeing this and then free ing their memory

11605377
width	height
as far as i understand it asking uiscreen for its height and width

11605377
width	height
the only other way i am aware of that is pretty straightforward would be to ask a uiview covering the screen for its width and height most simply you could make your viewcontroller s view cover the whole screen

11605377
width	height
these should adjust for orientation by themselves from my experience it should definitely work if you get the height and width in viewdidappear animated or anything after

11605377
uiview	subviews
also the uiview needs to either be the uiviewcontroller s view property or a subviews of this view

11605377
width	height
once we have the width and height of the screen we can convert from your int s to screen position

11605389
implements	extends
extends listeditor and implements iswidget instead of extends composite

subtract	add
so let s change this to add six months got to the end of the month and subtract one day

btw i have tried using the online css validator tool but it didn t make a difference just took away the menu gradients visible in google-chrome and firefox only

11605733
width	height
where string specifies the screen width height pixeldepth and refresh rate to make it working in any system i need to dynamically determine the screen width and screen height of the host system prior to making the call to glutgamemodestring function

11605734
google-chrome	firefox
our plugin is a windowless one developed using gecko plugin api and is targeted for firefox and google-chrome

11605734
width	height
there is a window size issue problem when chrome from verion 18 onwards calls npp_setwindow npp instance npwindow pnpwindow for our plugin to respond and the html script uses the relative table cell size width 100 and height 100 to define the client area

11605734
google-chrome	firefox
the actual window position and size contained in npwindow is actually incorrect compared with what is in google-chrome 17 and firefox 14.0.1 currently the latest

11605738
width	height
suppose i have a div with 500 width and 700 height

11605765
width	height
you could consider dynamically setting the width or height as appropriate by using a basewidth variable and multiplying that by the number of final nodes being displayed

11605838
post	get
the crux of the issue here is encoding page a s post parameters into the get request for page b

11605870
opensuse	linux
i am following given upload-a-vhd help document to create my opensuse linux vhd

11605875
google-chrome	firefox
take a look at this jsfiddle example in google-chrome and firefox

11605875
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the button should be a tad smaller than in firefox

11605930
getter	setter
why use getter and setter

11605930
getter	setter
but why do we define private and then we use getter and setter

11605930
getter	setter
if for security reasons then what is the point of having getter or setter

11605930
getter	setter
i know that we can have restrictions inside getter and setter but those if clauses are mostly for preventing the mistakes not the privacy restrictions

11605958
getter	setter
we use private fields and have getter and setter so those private fields can be accessed by other classes

11605958
public	protected	getter	setter
you can avoid using getter and setter by making your fields public or protected where appropriate instead of private

11605962
getter	setter
but as good as getter and setter are if you use them too much then its a sign you aren t getting a object to do the work you need it to

11605975
pull	push
i can now successfully push and pull from server a to from my github repository

11605975
pull	push
now i want to also setup another server server b so that i can push and pull from that one as well

11606074
getter	setter
there are one more benefit if you use the getter and setter it allows a subclass to override how to access the information with a method and more flexibility

11606087
implements	extends	super	implements	super	extends
i would probably create a new table and textarea class extends their respective super class and implements an editor interface like so

11606096
submit	submission
this will help prevent people from automating the process of submission the form as they will need to re-load the form and submit the token each time which most script-kiddies would not bother with.

11606131
put	get
the rub is lets say we have something like a jax-rs web service which can get put over that user

11606189
getter	setter
spring will automatically find the command object to bind the request parameters based on the getter and setter defined in the command object

11606201
put	get
when i dont put therubyracer in my gemfile i get an error when i deploy below even if i run assets prcompile first before i deploy.

11606258
put	get
also how can i get the id for the row and put that into a variable

11606259
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i am using the qtableview to display a qabstracttablemodel

11606297

if i set width and height of contentcontrol it doesn t catch mouse event for eaxemple mouseleftclick event

11606335
google-chrome	firefox
use the console in google-chrome or firefox to check if there are any errors on your page such as css files that can t be loaded

11606344
noexcept	throw
the rules for destructors have changed in c++11 which means that a destructor without exception specification has an implicit noexcept specification which in turn means that if it throw an exception the runtime will call terminate but you can change the exception specification to noexcept false and then the destructor can also throw

11606400
post	put
which is also nice when creating updating and deleting comments using post put

11606400
post	get
method 3 is interesting from a get and post create perspective but gets kinda hairy with update and delete

11606401
width	height
every time i try to create a collision rectangle and pass in the planet.position values as well as the image width and height it throws back an error and wont let me

11606411
multiplying	subtraction
another way to do this is to multiplying the numbers you get by subtraction by 10 then convert to an integer then divide that integer by by 10.0

11606415
sorting	filtering
the requirement was that a user needed to be able save the existing gridpanel s visible columns applied filtering and applied sorting into a database with a name and then at later date be able to re-apply these three things to a grid panel to get the same filtering visible columns and sort state by selecting their saved format

11606416
width	height
once the user has positioned an element the z-index location is saved x-positiom y-position width and height

11606416
screens	tablet
my client has this requirement where it should be a in a fluid layout manner where the position will change when it is viewed in a different screens resolution iphone ipad tablet and others

11606417
pop-up	dialog
each item includes a button where the user can pop-up a dialog to enter or read their previously entered feedback on said line item

11606441
width	height
another complication i believe is that the final output and whether or not the widths match will also depend on the width and height of where i m outputting the final grob to whether its in a r rstudio environment or to a png file

11606442
pop-up	dialog
from that dialog i try to open another pop-up using this

11606447
qapplication	qcoreapplication
without a qapplication or a qcoreapplication and an app.exec nothing will work

google-chrome	firefox
i could browse to the css manually just fine but both firefox and google-chrome weren t applying them

11606475
google-chrome	firefox
so even though i specified type in the link tag both firefox and google-chrome were seeing the wrong content-type from the server and refusing to apply the stylesheets

11606484
websphere	ibm
we use ibm websphere app server

11606485
stdout	stderr
now in this example if i read only stdout stderr and prints it later on if i try to write y or n based on user s input i got an error that channel is closed

11606489
width	height
the actual view size is fill_parent for both width and height

11606504
feedback	review
please review and provide your valuable feedback

11606559
next	except
but then the next task must take care of both cases maybe except when it s configured to be immutable not accept more arguments

11606587
getter	setter
setter amd getter method basically used to restrict to make any changes by the other person

11606592
extjs	gxt
extract the gxt.xxx.zip file somewhere and take a look at samples examples src com extjs gxt samples server fileserviceimpl.java

extjs	gxt
you can view the corresponding client-side code in examples src com extjs gxt samples client examples treepanel asynctreepanelexample.java

11606599
onresume	onpause
you have to handle the pause resume states of the activity cycle by implementing the onpause and onresume methods

11606599
onresume	onpause
of course you stop the video in the onpause method and maybe save the video tracking information and you restart it in the onresume method making the video continue from where it was stopped using the stored tracking information

11606603
children	parent
nearly three children are there for parent node like

11606630
opensuse	linux
this is a known issues with opensuse linux agent as in opensuse you will need to use sudo usr sbin waagent instead of sudo waagent as the bash shell is not the default shell used in that image right now

11606646
width	height
the matrix you re creating - scaling by inverse width and inverse height - is going to make the width always be 1 unit wide and the height 1 unit tall

11606646
width	height
if the width and height aren t the same number of pixels then squares won t draw square

11606686
width	height
a textview with width fill_parent and height 1dp and background

hide	show
i am creating dropdown in iphone app i have place the button on top on that click tableview opens and hide but it does not show table view it

11606769
public	protected
just as you ve declared count to be public you can change it to be protected much in the same way just by using the protected keyword

11606776
children	parent
the parent_identifier tag helps relate the children to the parent

11606776
post	get
i ve used a transformation which was referred to here in this post xslt group parent child but i can t seem to get it to work

11607221
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

11607221
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

11607221
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

11607254

now the problem is since i am storing the ids to identify the description of the items in the other four table i might get similar ids when i put ids of four table together

11607366
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
the default is set to 240 which is a hdpi screens you can lower it for mdpi or increase it for xhdpi

11607366

also consider this a extra large screens like a 10inch tablet motorolla xoom for example has a xlarge layout but mdpi density

11607368
haskell	ocaml
this effectively ruled out haskell and ocaml for my purposes as we needed easy access to the java ecosystem and integration with jvm based tools maven build etc.

11607374
width	height
i am trying to calculate the width and height in degrees of a satellite image returned by google static maps

11607374
width	height
the following code can correctly calculate the width of the satellite image in degrees but not the height

11607379
haskell	ocaml
ocaml and haskell should be chosen for other reasons similar benchmark scores but they have different syntax and interoperability and so on

11607379
haskell	ocaml
as far as which system has the best concurrency support haskell clojure and scala are all just fine while ocaml is a bit lacking

11607391

nsstring temp tmp scratch

11607889
pow	math.h
to get 2 to the power of 8 you need to either use a loop res 2 in a loop or round the pow function in math.h note that the math.h function returns float - and therefore won t be equal to the integer

11607924
pow	math.h
is bitwise xor the function you are looking for is pow in math.h

11607952
jax-ws	jax-rs
because i unfortunately do not fully understand second question do any jax-rs or jax-ws classes which each can be injected with ejb can be said in the same jta

11608038
postgresql	mysql
it is evil by design to include business logic inside a storage engine no matter if it s mysql oracle postgresql etc

11608048
post	get
as css is applied on the client side your only chance would be to get the values by javascript with the jquery methods mentioned by torr3nt being the easiest way that i know of and post these values back to your app using ajax

11608070
width	height
in other words the width and height do not need to be a

post	get
i ve been looking for about a week for the answer but i can not for the sake of me even get a straight answer mainly because i don t know the exact question so i thought i d post an example of the question

11608380
daemons	systemd
whenever is backed by the cron daemons of your systemd so if your systemd has no cron daemons it won t work

11608380
daemon	cron
rufus-scheduler is running inside of your ruby runtime it s not depending on a cron daemon but if your ruby runtime is going down the schedules will be lost

11608460
box-sizing	border-box
you are missing box-sizing border-box

11608503
box-sizing	margin
i m using to style border margin font and box-sizing of all elements in page

you should use an asynctask and put that code in the on pre post execute or if your just displaying a toast you can run it on the ui thread

11608694
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy	jython	pypy
the above is clean pythonic and should run just as well under ironpython jython or pypy as it does under cpython

11608742
width	height
both pages take the full width and height of the page

11608742
width	height
it seems to me that different browsers don t like width 100 and height 100 and is creating some unexpected results

11608869
post	get
just to get an idea of their impact i did some simple performance testing and noticed that these functions are much slower than simple pre post incrementing

11608878
hex	binary
i need to compare the string with hex code i ve read in a binary file

11608952
post	get
now how can i post the data to the form so that the user get registered by the site

11609023
int	double
you should use autoincrement and an int field is there any reason for you to want a double key there

11609043
for-loop	loops
the solution in your case is pretty simple since you do not use dc inside loops why not use a normal for-loop like

11609044
width	height
in your original code you set the ortho limits to the viewport size you re going to see the world space coordinate rate 0 0 to width height

11609045
width	height
then you should experiment with the options that gridview provides it has some properties that auto stacks elements according to width and height in the layout

11609057
inherited	properties
i d like to search in a collection which inherited an another collection for a properties value

11609061
ant	maven
we re currently moving from a quite old perl + ant build system to maven

why did you choose double and not an int datatype

11609142
rss	feed
so to clarify - i had the code to consume a rss feed but the page being generated dynamically was not being parsed correctly by the parser i was using

11609170
implements	extends
if class b extends a then you don t have to explicitly say implements myinterface since there is no way for a subclass to unimplement an interface

11609173
implements	extends
yes if you let a implements an interface then all classes that extends that class also implements that interface

11609200
post	get
i want to get ids of users which are subscribed to one post but in some other type

11609201
implements	extends
if you implements the interface call it i in class a and b c + d extends a then b c and d will implements the i interface as well

11609213
min	max
if they are not part of the same object let s say return min max then they should be a tuple

11609222
client-side	server-side
i think it s better to have both validation types every time client-side using javascript so no ajax call is made to the browser and server-side using php validations

11609264
comparator	comparable
your listdata object should implements comparable not comparator interface

11609264

addclass	removeclass
you can use addclass or removeclass function of jquery also they provide you feature to add css class over element for any effect

11609441
pull	push
it sounds like you have quite a lot of process kicking off and you may be able to better orchestrate it using signalr to push pull info to and from the server as necessary - just something worth considering that might help

11609452
spaces	delimiter
we assume that links don t have spaces so we create an array with explode using the spaces as the delimiter

11609452
spaces	delimiter
finally we rebuild the text using implode and the spaces as the delimiter

11609461
post	get
anyway you just have to replace all get requests links by post requests forms

11609532

since that feature is based on a simple check on the y coordinates of all children controls of a control against that control s height the scrollbar was not appearing despite the fact the the tablelayoutpanel s child controls were disapearing out of sight due to its parent control clip area

11616156
children	parent
if i understand correctly if we reach the number of maximum children the will return 0 and the parent will do the work

11616173

if you can coax the compiler into producing jump-table code in the chars int enum selector case this can execute faster than using your own hash table

11618748
post	get

11621845
hide	show
if so that s the ui thread so you ve sent the ui thread 2 messages - one to show and one to hide before it could even handle them and when it finally reaches the point it can handle them it handles both of them so for a very short time probably un-noticed the progressdialog will be show

one of the ways to compare sets is to take the count of grouping filtering grouping by search set and see if number of matches per grouping equals original number of grouping members

11649851
sorting	filtering
i d suggest putting findclientbyname findprouctbytype findproductbyyear findorderfullypaid notpaid on your dao as well in some way because your database will most likely be better at filtering and sorting data than your in memory code

11649883
qgraphicsitem	qgraphicspixmapitem
if you would like to handle clicks on a specific gui element rather than handle click on the whole scene you should derive your own class either from qgraphicsitem see example of simpleclass here or derive from one of existing elements qgraphicspixmapitem

11650992
int	double
lat lon double int

11650992

assuming you are working in 32 bits you are passing 3 pointer values a 32 bit each 12 bytes but the function takes an int 32 bit and two double 64 bit 20 bytes

11651001
bash	tcsh
though i can t get this to work with the tcsh it works fine with bash

11651002

11651088
nexus	artifactory
how does maven interacts with different repositories like nexus and artifactory

11651088
nexus	artifactory	maven	pom.xml
it is possible to resolve dependent artifacts to actual locations to get them from using these apis but the two apis are somewhat different form each other as far as i see artifactory nexus and the repository definition element in maven pom.xml files does not contain a property to state the type of the repository

11651129
children	parent
but i would also like to display the relations for an object either parent or children

my example works fine on a desktop browser google-chrome firefox etc. on android

11651212
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended
i think you use touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended can solve the problem

11651222
getter	setter
so i don t really see the point of it because declaring the same instance variable would produce the same effect without the overhead of calling the getter and setter

11651255
hide	show
i have used a show hide script to hide certain columns which is great but i would really like the row total to update when column is hidden iin example below if i hide say jan it should deduct the value in that column row and update the total column

11651258
accessor	properties
you are 100 sure that your properties accessor will never contain any actual logic

11651295

11651368
versioning	upgrade
may be able to upgrade to newer versioning if required

11651389
getter	setter
you can just make some getter and setter pseudocode

11651390

put	get
i ve already tried to put a notifypropertychanged isvalid before the getvalidationerror returns its value but this way i get a stackoverflow exception

11651447
maven	pom.xml
in pom.xml you define a root url of repository and then maven is able to resolve an artifact by constructing a url

11651695
spaces	linefeed
it turned out that these were not only the extra spaces for self-closing elements inserted in .net output but also the use of r n for linefeed where the original input string had only n

11651695
spaces	linefeed
there is however one exception to this there s also the occassion where i receive an xml string without the extra spaces for self-closing elements but with the full r n linefeed sequence

11651695
spaces	linefeed
for validating purposes in the end only the difference in linefeed sequences seem to matter because the extra spaces for self-closing elements will disappear after canonicalization when explicit closing tags are introduced which usually preceeds the computation of digestvalue and signaturevalue

11651740
put	get
in column d you put in this formula to get the hours spent running total column

11651740

11652138
getter	setter
c# allows these so-called magic getter and setter also known as syntactical sugar

11652138
getter	setter
writing getter and setter for a private variable allows you to make changes to the variable but gives you greater control over how that actually happens

11652164
move	drag
probably would be most user friendly to wait until the drag end event then move the marker out of the disallowed region or let the user know that they need to move it

11652185
getter	setter
this magic getter and setter as you call them actually end up creating methods just like you would do in java

11652185
getter	setter
the properties themselves even though declared as for example actually have a backing field and a getter and a setter method

11652190
symlink	realpath
however magento uses function realpath which resolves the symlink to its full path

11652199

width	height
dividing this value by width and height uwindims gives the position again from 0 on the left side of the screen to 1 on the right side

11667565
portrait	landscape
i dont know how to fix this but i guess one solution is first to check if the image is in portrait landscape mode and then if it is on landscape mode rotate it by 90degrees before showing it on screen

11667923

is it correct to get the canvas height and width inside the ondraw method

11667939
width	height
you guys can assign how much height and width want

11668025
put	get
till here i am able to get the data in optionlist but it just grab all the elements and put it as a one option in my select menu like this...

put	get
so if want more frequent get operations than put then arraylist is best to go

11668150
implements	extends
i ve been experimenting with the decorator pattern to extends functionality of code you do not want to touch for example and i see how to implements it however i am now unsure why you don t just inherit from the original class and extends that way

11668158
char-pointer	pointers	short	base
in c or c++ there is no common base class for all types like java s object the best you can use is void stands for untyped pointers so it can hold anything or explicitely cast to the desired type but then it s undefined to access a short via a char-pointer

11668174
google-chrome	firefox
this would be a good starting point i haven t tested this in ie9 but i know it works ok in google-chrome firefox

how can i get this state of comobject on client-side and create the interface implementation instance on server-side

11668326

edit ok they have little to do with properties but they fall under the category of other accessor

11668333
getter	setter
in real terms there is just a getter and setter

11668333
getter	setter
this is shown in table ii.17 and uses the .other caption in il note it is .get for the getter .set for the setter and .custom for attributes

11668368
inherited	properties
if you want all instances of the control to inherited the default background color then don t set the backcolor properties for individual instances of it

as you noticed your implementation of the cron daemon does not allow to be the files owned by non-root-users and you will not be allowed to make the file world-writable for the same reason of security

11668737
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i could have used a separate sortedlist instead of the sorteddictionary for keeping the key and timestamp sorted on the timestamp but then i ll have to do a linear lookup for finding the key from the list when i have to update the timestamp when the same key is accessed again - i am looking for a better than linear way if possible

11668762
post	get
so this is a mega-simple post redirect get - submit data from somewhere get it in the post-friendly action do stuff with it poke it into temp data redirect to get-friendly pick it up again stick the user on a new view with the object in the model

nsstring	nsdata
the docs states that the classes in the dictionary must be of nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary

aside my suggestion would be to use double-quotes for the string as you have with o clock. since mixing backslash escapes with php strings and regex patterns can get confusing quickly

11668996
bash	subshell
a recent addition to bash is the lastpipe option which allows the last command in a pipeline to run in the current shell not a subshell when job control is deactivated

11669012
int	boolean
a workaround would probably be to use the wrapper types instead of the primitive ones boolean instead of boolean int instead of int

11669067
division	multiplication
should i use multiplication or division

11669071
spaces	delimiter
pageâ caption is not a valid attribute identifier so the parser is probably interpreting page as the attribute identifier treating the spaces as a delimiter and wondering what to do with caption

11669425
hide	show
in my opinion the easiest way is to implement your requirement is to include both select elements in the html markup and just hide and show the second one as applicable

11669452
hide	show
you can then use the selector .show and selector hide methods to display show some other element

11669453
google-chrome	firefox
but date and time process is not working on firefox it is only working in google-chrome

11669462
hide	show
this works great declarativly using the visible binding - but it falls short when you attempt to add animations to the mix since there s no chaining of the show hide animations

11669476
int	double
if you cast double to int the answer will not be 59 -- it will be 58

11669476
int	double
when casting double to int the value will be rounded towards zero

11670138
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ive got it working fine in firefox and ie but ive come across a strange issue with google-chrome and safari where by using .hide works fine but when using .show to reveal the table again the height of the table increase each time .show completes

opera	firefox
worse than opera and firefox on the desktop as well

11670583
firefox	safari
on firefox and safari the video plays nicely

11670621
portrait	landscape
in androidmanifest.xml for each activity you want to be able to change between portrait and landscape make sure you add screensize - you didn t used to need this

11670621
portrait	landscape
the only thing i can t seem to figure out is how to to get the app to change layout files when switching from landscape to portrait or vice versa

11670621
portrait	landscape
but if you have a simple enough app that you have the same layout file for portrait and landscape this should work

11670659

11670716
equals	gethashcode
just for the reference here are some links about equals and gethashcode usage

11670716

11671051
getter	setter
i did not copy getter and setter but thoses methods exists.

11671075
fadein	fadeout
anders holmstrom beat me to it - i used the same basic approach but used an absolutely positioned inner image and jquery fadein and fadeout

11671107
fiddler	charles
if ga tracking calls doesn t use the ios proxy they obviously won t be sent to charles or fiddler or whatever and it can t track anything

11671107
ethernet	wireless
the only way to monitor these calls is to do something like share your ethernet internet connection on your computer to your ios device wireless and use a tool like ngrep or wireshark to monitor the traffic coming through your wireless interface usually en1 on a mac

11671134
tinyint	boolean
ok i ve found out that for mysql boolean type is hardcoded to tinyint 1

11671161

11671248
decoder	encoder
you have to decoder the image and then re-encode it using a tiff supported image encoder

11671280
activiti	alfresco
i found alfresco and activiti very promising but not sure which should i adopt

11671280
activiti	alfresco
from my research alfresco is a full blown crm with cloud and workflow using activiti as engine whereas activiti is the engine on its own

11671280
activiti	alfresco
how should i judge when to go for alfresco and likewise for activiti

11671301

for these classes i m currently using the background-position-x and background-position-y css attributes which work in ie and google-chrome but not in firefox and opera

11671322
inherited	properties
these two properties aren t officially part of any css spec. since we re using the less preprocessor i want to know if there s a way to create a less mixin that will dynamically inherited an x or y value for the background-position properties

11671483
ember.js	backbone.js
ember.js is 42k minified+gzip while backbone.js is just 5.6kb

11671483
ember.js	backbone.js
ember.js packs a lot of power in it which the barebones backbone.js doesn t give you

11671483
ember.js	backbone.js
if your requirements are covered by just backbone.js imo you should give ember.js a pass

11671483
ember.js	backbone.js
imho i would use ember.js if the single page web app is super complex with lots of feature requirements else backbone.js should suffice

11671485
udp	tcp
tcp or udp could work for some applications but if you start trying to stream video your phone will hate you

11671491

11671767
inherited	properties
this is so that classes that inherited from the base class can access the variables themselves but classes outside of the inherited chain have to access the values via properties

11671767
inherited	properties
i find this particularly useful in a case where the base class needs to set the value of a variable in an inherited class without providing a setter on the properties so that classes outside of the inherited chain cannot modify the value

11671767
inherited	properties
what i m finding by fixing sa1401 issues is that i m opening up properties values to be set because i need to set them in their inherited class that i really don t want to be settable

11671767
public	protected	inherited	properties
i suppose i could just create a protected properties on the base class that allows me to set the value and then create a new public properties that does not allow me to set the value but then i have to create that new public properties on every inherited class

11671789
public	protected
it is public and being called from a not static protected method

11671792

11671864
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome works fine and the desktop version of safari but on my iphone it scrolls horizontally

11671870
inherited	properties
usually this data is collected from the properties attributes and the properties type attributes but here it is not possible since the datasource properties has some options what you can set for it and those types don t have anything in common except from they inherited from object so this properties tells anyone who needs to know that the type should be an ilistsource

11671899
folder	directory
to get a list of files only not directory in a specific folder not recursively you would do

edit i am using postgresql not mysql but i m pretty sure there s little difference except port numbers and small syntax changes

11672015
post	get
i ve seen post on here about manually cleaning things up in the ondestroy method but the activity doesn t always get that far

11672019
int	boolean
you could simply change the resend boolean on the case to an int count of the send attempts and have your workflow rule re-send only while that count is less than 3

11672030
integer	unsigned
so yes it is a 16-bit unsigned integer

11672030
int	chars
so a chars in c does not necessarily represent the same range of int values as a chars in java

11672032
int	chars
the c specification calls for the chars type to be implemented as a 1-byte int

11672054

11672221
google-chrome	firefox
this is working perfectly in firefox and ie but displays a blank page in google-chrome

google-chrome	firefox
when i do a view source on the blank page in google-chrome the source code is the same as in firefox and ie

11672221
google-chrome	firefox
and was i breaking some sort of rule by passing javascript in a parameter- a rule that firefox and ie didn t care about but google-chrome did

bash	zsh
works in zsh and bash

11672296

the problem is the destination view shows up in portrait orientation even though every other view in the app is landscape orientation

11672343
google-chrome	firefox
the the amount of captures is correct but the problem is that in google-chrome all the canvases appear black and in firefox they always show the same image

11672397

int	double
int and double arguments are passed to printf using the same mechanism probably on the stack

11674058
int	double
so the call will plausibly push the int value 10 onto the stack as a 4-byte quantity and printf will grab 8 bytes of data off the stack and treat it as the representation of a double

11674058
int	double
rather than abusing printf it copies the representation of an int object into a double object using memcpy

int	double
here as your pointer to double pf points to an address hosting an int value i what you ll get is undefined and most probably garbage

11674595
int	double
if you really want to see what s possibly behind that garbage when debugging on some platforms try the following code where we will use an union to simulate a piece of memory where we will write either double or int data

11674595
int	double
your printf could well behave like that and thus try to interpret a raw piece of memory as a double when it was initially set as an int

11674595
int	double
p.s. note that as the int and the double have different size in bytes the garbage gets even more complicated but it is mostly what i described above

int	double
but i want to print an int as a double

here it s basically a way of documenting the requirement that md5_digest_length - which is the size in chars of the textual representation of the md5 hash - be at least as long as the number of bytes your system uses for an int int type

11680253
hash	md5
what that does is read a value from the bytes at the start of the textual representation of the md5 hash as if those bytes contained an int

11680253
hash	md5
so say your int size is 4 md5 hash is 0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661 as in your comment the first 4 bytes contain 0cc1

google-chrome	firefox
my issue is that the following code works fine in firefox and google-chrome but does not work in ie9

11681627
accessor	properties
this makes some logical sense if you have set get accessor on a properties that properties is never going to be written to and or read from because any attempts to read write it will be intercepted by the accessor functions

11681627
accessor	properties
if you define a properties as writable and give it accessor functions you are simultaneously saying

11681627
getter	setter
i assume from the fact that you wrote a getter and setter you don t really want the property to be writable

hash	salt
to be able to answer this question you have to understand two things the role of hash and the role of salt

11682099
hash	salt
every time i hash a password i generate a completely random salt which need not be secret and prepend it to my password before hashing it

11682099
hash	salt
the reason that the random salt need not be secret and in fact must be stored in plaintext along with the hash password is because the same salt used to generate the original hash is required to verify for authentication purposes that a given password matches the hash

11682099
hash	salt
because a good salt is randomly generated every time a user wants to change a password even re-storing the same password will almost surely create a completely different hash as long as the application storing passwords makes proper use of salt

11682099
hash	salt
if the hash algorithm is well-constructed then the only attack possible against passwords stored with random salt is a brute-force search

11682099
hash	md5
some hash algorithms like md5 are considered broken in that it is possible to find so-called hash collisions in faster than brute-force time

your oncreate bundle b should be public instead of protected

nsurl	nsstring
if that url is returning html you can use the - void loadhtmlstring nsstring string baseurl nsurl baseurl method of the uiwebview

wild guess - the icollection interface is a base interface for other interfaces that extend it such as ilist and idictionary

11690327
idictionary	ilist
ilist takes one param idictionary needs two obviously

11690340

11690764

11690945
google-chrome	firefox
this page works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

11691070

11691193
portrait	landscape
i made my app detect the orientation on the ipad and readjust it s location position accordingly fine so it works good on portrait and landscape

11691193
portrait	landscape
my problem in the virtual keyboard method that i have it s not considering the orientation in portrait once user tap one of the text boxes the method would lift up the view to make room for the keyboard and have the text box visible not covered - however when user in landscape and tap a text box the animation would push the view sideways instead of up as if it s still in portrait

11691198

while we can t say if some tablet omit mobile many including the samsung galaxy tab do have mobile in their user-agent making it impossible to detect between an android tablet and android phone without resorting to checking model specifics

11691345
int	double
because of my c++ oci wrapper only supports to bind int double string clob type of data

11691347
put	get
i think the best doable approach would be instead of using a normal list to have a wrapper to the list that when the get pos method is executed to obtain the object to create the view you make something like this get pos numberofviews and when it ask for the size of the list you put that the list is integer.max_value and you start your list in the middle of it so you can say that is mostly impossible to have an error unless they actually swipe to the same side until the reach the end of the list

11691356
hide	show
is this something that is allowed by jquery to hide everything and then show individual items

11691378

i prefer to be able to add listeners to my models such as a propertychangelistener and have the view the swing gui instigate a change of its display based on its listener being fired

11692208
serializable	deserialization
so when you add later a new serializable field to the class then you d need to change the serialversionuid field usually just incrementing it by 1 is sufficient to prevent problems during deserialization of an instance of an older version of the class

11692208
instances	transient
if your serializable class contains in turn a field property referencing an instances of another class which can absolutely not be made serializable then you d need to mark it transient

11692208
serializable	deserialization
if you d like to have finer grained control over serializable and deserialization then override the readobject and writeobject methods

11692231
children	parent
i am basically wanting to copy the behavior of how buttonbase.click allows parent to subscribe to any button click methods for their children

update i can t install external libraries such as pexpect either because aix doesn t have a config folder in the python install directory

11692290

11692445
min	max
table-cells dimensions are determined by their contents of course you can add your own or max min dimensions

11692445
width	text-align
the width of the table would be fluid because it would be based on the width of the widest cell thus the blocks will line up nicely and will look very neat and you could hard-code or script of course i suggest scripting a style method to check if the last row contains less blocks and if it does to set the text-align to left for that cell only

11692456
google-chrome	firefox
also this is working everywhere and resize is working in google-chrome and firefox with proportions 100 to 50

mouseleave	mouseenter
i don t want event handlers other than mouseenter and mouseleave to get disturbed

11692856
post	get
it works using the post method but it doesn t update the querystring and i want users to be able to see what they have searched so i must use the get method

11692932
integer	unsigned
my understanding is that it provides types long long and unsigned long long as an extension but doesn t change the semantics of integer constants

11692938
subtract	add
you then can easily just add or subtract the # of hours 3600 seconds in an hour depending on the time zone

11692946
google-chrome	safari
i ve logged a bug with apple they ve marked it as a duplicate so hopefully they ve received enough requests to fix this until then i m continuing to use google-chrome as the webkit developer is the same as safari s old version

11693013
hide	show
the point of the checkboxes is to hide and show certain parts of the program

11693014
setinterval	settimeout
production different options different timings for setinterval settimeout

11693036
mouseleave	mouseenter
the way you re describing this you will actually want to pass two functions to .hover one for the action on mouseenter and one for the action on mouseleave

11693066
mouseleave	mouseenter
in this specific case you can use the shorthand .hover for mouseenter and mouseleave

11693067
width	height
one other possibility is an item like textview that does not specify height and width values

11693068
mouseleave	mouseenter
at first .hover includes mouseenter and mouseleave

11693068
mouseleave	mouseenter
alone or you use mouseenter and mouseleave

at init it creates an uiview containing uiscrollview uipagecontrol

11693086
postgresql	mysql
limit x offset y is understood by mysql postgresql sqlite and some others rdbms

anything you put in web-inf lib folder in your war directory goes up to appengine

11693214
min	max
how i can store the result in two variables called max and min

11693226
google-chrome	firefox
when you press the back button in google-chrome it seems it caches the source code as opposed to the dom in firefox but that is just observation not some thing i know for sure

11693256
width	height
so it is just a simple table with 2 columns width and height

11693319
hide	show
i have two buttons that show hide areas below

11693337
int	double
you re returning 1 or 0 which are implicity either int or double i forget which but it s unimportant in the context of your question.

11693346
inherited	properties
no .prototype or the value returned by object.getprototypeof is an object which you can extend with properties so that those properties are inherited by instances

11693395
ontouchevent	ondraw
it is getting stuck because ontouchevent operates in ui thread so as ondraw

11693409
nsstring	nsdata
the array representation in the file identified by apath must contain only property list objects nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary objects

11693438
jobs	cron
do i have to use cron jobs or is there anything in php to make such kind of scripts

11693455
post	put
however when json containing these smaller names is passed using a post or a put request to the controllers asp.net mvc model binding is not able to correctly map the en json property to employeename

11693460
jobs	cron
you need to use cron jobs if you want it to run on a set schedule

11693463
jobs	cron
if you are not allowed to set cron jobs on your web hosting there exist websites that will call one url periodically like

11693487
int	chars
so my question is first is their a chars type and secondly is it possible to convert that to an int

11693524
hide	show
i have nice helper functions that allow me to show hide the master popover view controller

11693537
squash	branch	squash	merge
i ve got a branch i want to merge into another via a squash commit

11693537
squash	branch	squash	merge
if i remove the extra spaces during the squash merge how do i push those changes into the original branch without having to manually do the fixes again

11693537
squash	branch	squash	merge
once when i squash merge into a testing branch

11693537
squash	branch	squash	merge
and again when i squash merge the original branch into master

11693538
post	get
users will hate any app that automatically post on their behalf so i recommend you do not do that as either people will stop using your app or they ll report it and it ll get banned

11693548
int	chars
there is no chars type in php and the string type does not readily convert to int

11693551
int	double
how can i convert this field to a numerical value int for this one but i have a couple other fields that it must work with double while also determining exactly how many digits must be shown

11693569
ready	each
so if i was you i d create it in viewdidload and then hide it until you are ready to use it instead of creating it each time

11693572

11693575
folder	directory
that same thing happened when i moved the project files in a folder and forget to move the directory .meteor

11693577

the ord function will return a chars s int value

11693580
google-chrome	safari
i am having trouble showing a linear gradient in safari and google-chrome

11693606
width	height
just be sure to call inherited first and then use the updated width height to create the new region

11693606
width	height
createwnd should still create the initial region using the current width height

11693644
width	height	portrait	landscape
my photo sizes vary they are either landscape portrait or square and i need to make a watermark the best fit for each photo - so i need to resize just the width of the watermark without imagick as it s a long rectangle shape so height doesn t matter

11693644
width	height
i m also not sure if after using imagecopyresized the rest of my function will work where it gets the watermark width and height

11693714
post	get
i have also tried the following from this post but get an identical error

subtract	add
i m looking for a formula that will compare the items and subtract where it is shipped from received on matching items and lotnum and it will add received together

11693887
google-chrome	firefox
the behavior observed seems to be a glitch in firefox javascript engine because it is not observed in google-chrome and ie9 see this fiddle

11693930
rss	feed
the first tab gets posts from an rss feed

11693959
post	get
in a traditional web application idempotent requests which don t change any state are made via http s get method and all non-idempotent requests are typically made via the post method

11693959
post	put
the form is received from the browser via post and then rails looks for this field and decides whether to route the request to the put or delete methods of the controller

11693978
filtering	grouping
i also followed the instructions here about putting in a before filtering and only turn on profiling if the user is in the appropriate admin grouping

11693980
mouseover	mouseout
i m constructing the same selector twice for the mouseover and mouseout

11693986
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning like 2.3.2 or even the latest 2.5.1 and the default will be 1.5 and it should work just fine

11693986
versioning	upgrade
and while you are at it also upgrade to the latest versioning of maven 3.0.4 so that these newer versioning of the maven compiler plugin are the default

11693990
put	get
my working man s definition of functional programming is that if you put the same thing s in you always get the same thing s out

11694005
dropbox	icloud
you can store data externally in icloud dropbox or another online service

11694046
post	get
the only problem is the browsers don t as they only support get and post

11694048
swt	swing
swt is one thing swing is another

11694048
swt	swing	awt	swing
if you already have something written in swt and want to add swing components then you have to use the swt awt bridge

11694071
hide	show
i m working on the ability to show hide div s when an image is clicked and to randomly show divs on page load

11694085
pop-up	dialog
what i did was add an itemlistener and based on a certain logic i pop-up this dialog box

11694085
pop-up	dialog
the 1st one is to close the combobox pop-up and the 2nd one is the actual one on the confirmation dialog

11694085
pop-up	dialog
i want the confirm dialog to pop-up once the user has done selecting his option and the combobox pop-up closes

11694100
google-chrome	safari
one interesting thing to note this is working as expected in safari but google-chrome and ie are producing the problem above

11694101
required	placeholder
i added some additional functionality like after selecting required files when the user hits upload all button the images get saved to the app_images folder and the page displays a placeholder with the images uploaded

11694152
client-side	server-side
there are two types of result sets client-side and server-side

11694179

11694208
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
basically if i m not drawing i call the touchesbegan and touchesmoved of the scroll view

11694220
folder	directory
i am using the following recursive method to list all files and folder within a given directory however it seems to be listing some files that aren t visible in windows explorer - even when i display hidden and system protected files

11694232
hide	show
i usually put the html for lightboxes in my rails application layout file then i would simply use js to show hide these lightboxes when needed - this is very static

11694232
hide	show
sometimes i would use jquery to create the lightbox and the content within it on the fly and then show and hide that very messy

11694237
put	get	post	put	post	get
the get put post delete mapping you re quoting works fine for crud operations but isn t necessarily appropriate for everything and isn t necessarily supported by all browsers

11694237
post	put
it s an architectural style don t stress too much about what post put delete the javascript does underneath

11694237
post	put
it s good for the framework to be able to expose delete put as such directly but have a fallback solution via post for the clients that don t support it

11694237
post	put
emulating put through post is ok you re just not making the most of put emulating post through put would be problematic

11694239
folder	directory
spontaneously i d save the images in a temp folder and move them to the production directory upon submit

11694248
post	get
see also my blog post here for some more details if you get stuck

11694251
pop-up	dialog
the other day somehow i got xcode instead to pop-up a dialog with all my entities with checkboxes next to them

11694266
onresume	onpause
do the save in onpause and load in onresume

11694267
children	parent
if you only need the children to exist when the parent exists i would consider changing the node to simply have a std vector of other nodes remove the pointer

11694267
children	parent
if you have a use case where you do really want to have the children outlive the parent you ll have to deal with the parent pointer since it could be destroyed before the children

11694289
int	chars
i m pulling it in converting to chars finding the first zero-index chars which should be the positionid of the spinner selection and converting that back into an int and finally using that int to set the selection on the new spinner which is reading from the same array

11694315
chunked	transfer-encoding
we found that each request from java client required transfer-encoding chunked

11694369
int	boolean
so why do they bother differentiating between bool boolean tiny int 1

11694369
tinyint	boolean
bool and boolean mysql default converts these to the tinyint type

11694408
google-chrome	firefox
browser support is ie8 and up google-chrome firefox and other modern browsers

11694416
post	get
in my system i also use session variables to handle all the errors in the form since nothing is saved withe the post redirect get technique

11694437
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie9

11694451
post	get
i also saw some post saying something like oracle enterprise manager is available through which we can administer the db but i just can t find out how to get to the console

11694468
post	get
in my system i also use session variables to handle all the errors in the form since nothing is saved withe the post redirect get technique

11694496
post	get
but it would be better if you post part of the xaml code because you probably could get the same result in a cleaner way

11694559
google-chrome	firefox
tip using webrowser with some king of inspector - for an example google-chrome with build-in inspector or firefox + firebug is best friend of every webmaster webdevloper webdesigner etc

11694562
width	height
but when giving xx percent width of height this can vary

11694585
stdout	stderr
popen requires more arguments than i have given it like file location and where to run it stdout or stderr

11694618
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
however the dropdownlistfor and the grouped checkbox keep falling into their own row

11694640
pop-up	dialog
i am looking for a solution where i can add the ui of the showdocspicker to a pop-up or something such that the full view of the dialog can be seen.

11694653
post	get
so if the users clicks submit jquery will use ajax or something to post it in the background to a db connect page and then get the response text from that asp displaying either a successful login or incorrect in the errors label

11694666
super	extends
just extends this class instead of asynctask and be sure to call super when appropriate

11694691
ant	maven
it is probably worth looking into useing a dependency management tool such as maven or ivy if you are using ant

11694709
hide	show
i am loading a component in doget and after a click event i am trying to hide that component and show another

11694765
maven	pom.xml
here s a really quick pom.xml example from maven s website

11694815
post	get
it s there to get the tags to appear in this post

11694866
google-chrome	firefox
it works well in google-chrome and even in ie but in firefox icons get down

11694878
clang	llvm
edit well according to a key llvm clang apple engineer there is a library that already gets linked in with the implementations so you just need the interface file

11694883
inherited	subclassing
for example i am using multi-table inherited for a class node with subclassing conceptnode and derivednode

11694886
min	max
the grid itself is 2d but each cell in the grid has a float min max height

11694886
min	max	range	max	range	min
i want to stop traversing the line if the range of z values between entering exiting a grid cell doesn t overlap with the min max height for that cell

11694886
min	max
if i could do that i could test the z value when entering leaving the cell against the min max height for the cell

11694894
pop-up	dialog
when a list item is double clicked a dialog box pop-up asking if the user would like to delete it

11694945
width	height
i use four buttons to set height as wrap content height as fill parent width as wrap content and width as fill parent

11694945
width	height
i googled a bit and found a solution using layoutparams although that code didn t specify if height of width was alterd

11694984
put	get
i did the comparison via sql and i get the result i want but when i tried to put it in code i m not successful

11695017
post	get
this string can be send to a php or other server side language using a post or get request

11695035
width	height
you could try using a jquery animation height width in your case on the div instead so that you can select the particular elements that you wish to animate

11695045
hide	show
off the top of my head i don t think that show and hide are valid params to pass to the show and hide functions unless you re using custom animations by those names

11695061
folder	directory
i ve copied the files to the extension directory while leaving them in the php folder and i ve added the extension lines

11695091
hide	show
i am trying to hide and show a list from a certain point

11695091
hide	show
that s all the code and i want to hide and show the list items from a point and further down

11695097
getter	setter
the general idea is that just like most other languages you have getter and setter for object properties

11695115
width	height
by using the below code you can easily alter the height and width dynamically

11695126
ubuntu	linux
this program works the way you want it to both on my mac 10.6.8 and on a linux machine ubuntu 10.10 i just tried

11695130
rspec	capybara
however when i tried to test it using rspec capybara

11695138
daemons	launchd
however after a daemons process is launchd i realized that it can be controlled with other means like querying it or restarting it arch way

11695160
jlist	jlabel
the data is saved in a .txt file and when a name is selected from the jlist my program reads the appropriate lines of data converts them into an object i ve defined counterparty and displays the appropriate fields of the objects in jlabel s

11695160
jtextfield	jlabel
i want the jlabel s where the information is initially displayed to convert into jtextfield s populated with the data from the jlabel when the edit button is clicked

11695160
jtextfield	jlabel
i assume is would change the visibility to false of the jlabel s and create new jtextfield objects

11695160
jtextfield	jlabel
can jlabel objects be converted to jtextfield s

11695167
hide	show
these show hide a textbox

11695167
hide	show
when i show hide the .mytextbox then the text bumps a couple of pixels

11695200
accessor	properties
yes properties accessor invoked by the dot notation are automagically traansformed to method calls by the compiler

11695205
hide	show
what i am doing is basically instead of show and hide i m altering the visibility property

11695207
range	minimum
i am trying to make a struct for a range variable minimum maximum with a few members and a method to know if between values

11695207
dictionary	map
the whole point of making this range variable type is to make a map key dictionary like

11695236
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
these work fine in google-chrome firefox and safari but not in ie9

11695246
ubuntu	linux

11695282
sorting	grouping
an example can be found here wpf sample series â listbox grouping sorting subtotals and collapsible regions

11695302
memcached	apc
the site is running on dedicated server with memcached and apc

11695302
memcached	apc
flush cache memcached apc

11695313
jtextfield	jlabel
assuming that jlabel is your label and textfield your jtextfield

11695313
jtextfield	jlabel
you should place your jlabel in a dedicated jpanel so you remove the jlabel from it and replace it with the jtextfield then repaint revalidate

11695336
getter	setter
if i change to a different view and then change back to the original view instead of the getter being called the setter gets called and the value passed is the first option for my radio buttons

11695392
jtextfield	jlabel
it uses a button which when pressed will either remove the jtextfield and add the jlabel and vice versa and then it will call revalidate and repaint to show changes to the frame after each button click

11695400
multiplying	add
multiplying the number by 10 add 0.9999999999999 truncate the fractional part ie floor then divide by 10

11695402
int	chars
i have a chars array that starts with zeroes but when i try to convert it to a int value it deletes the zeroes so i want to keep the zeroes as well

11695402
int	chars
something like this array chars contains 00001234 and the int has to be like this 00001234 but when i use the parseint it just leaves me 1234

11695472
put	get
ok now that i know how to put the html form to get the files

11695513
portrait	landscape
i will assume you are in fact trying to hide the splitview masterpopover in landscape since it should already be hidden in portrait

11695525
google-chrome	firefox
the three lines above effectively perform the same action slightly different implementations depending on your needs but i had varying success across browsers using each one - google-chrome worked with one firefox another etc

11695545
google-chrome	safari
in the above code my problem is that the document.formsv2display part doesn t work in ie i have to replace that part with document.form 0 and then of course neither of those work correctly in google-chrome or safari

11695554
width	height
this approach is brilliant but even though the height responds to max-width the width does not respond to max-height

11695574
width	height
the elements i use vary in width and height but all fit in a grid 4 different sizes all multiple of smallest+margins

11695586
hex	binary
you would need to read file in binary mode to prevent x conversion as in python xhh represents hex escape characters

11695595
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
touchesbegan and touchesmoved

11695595
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
if i change in touchesbegan and touchesmoved the index of posible arrayimage.. for 0 it only works for the first uiimageview i understand why but it doesent crash

11695602
rvm	bundler
i want to work on a supporting library while building an application while using rvm and bundler to manage my application environment

11695605
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome you can see the source on github and the firefox source can be found here

11695607
button	checkbox
this still grays out the button in chrome at least and still allows you to click radios and checkbox

11695617
google-chrome	firefox
i m developing in google-chrome but i ve tried it in firefox also and get the same

11695634
ember.js	backbone.js
backbone.js does support implementing model binding but it s not automatic as in some other client-side application frameworks for example angularjs s data-binding through ng-controller or ember.js s bindattr

11695745
min	max
you just stop when the accumulated error in z reaches some critical level which would indicate it is outside of your min max

11695754
hide	show
in a nutshell this simply hide the view normally responsible for showing the checkmark allowing me to add my own view that can be show in its place

11695816
hide	show
i m using an image scroller plugin within a set of divs that are set to randomly show when the page is loaded and then show hide when an image logo is clicked on

11695819
button	checkbox
like everybody said use either checkbox radio button

11695852
mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick	joystick	keyboard
in my wpf app i have to detect the system idle time that includes not using mouse keyboard joystick

11695852
mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick	joystick	keyboard
i used getlastinputinfo to get the idle time of the system but i found that it s working only for input from mouse or keyboard but not from joystick

11695852
mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick	joystick	keyboard
is there a way or any win32 api that can give the lastinputinfo by detecting the input from all three devices mouse keyboard joystick

11695861
integer	fractions
the number of days forms the integer portion of the result and the time is computed as a fractions day

11695885
width	height
if what you want is for some text to show up in a separate scrollable frame you could also use a div with the appropriate style settings set an absolute or percentage height and width and set overflow to scroll

11695892
min	max
it taught me how to use self-joins to get the max min something-n rows per group

11695899
textarea	textbox
i have a textarea asp.net multiline textbox wrapped in a few nested divs

11695908
feedback	review
5- define milestones it is very useful to do feature review sessions with the customer if possible for an example milestone one demo feature 1 2 3 and add the feedback to the tasks log prioritized against remaining tasks

11695920
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari and internet explorer the field is editable

11695921
put	get
if the app is granted access to the dlq it is usually only to put messages there and not to get them back out

11695927
intersect	contains
that works fine if you want to determine whether the point is contains in the fill of a uibezierpath but it does not work for determining whether only the stroke of the uibezierpath intersect the point

11695940
post	get
anyways i use a get request to get the page and then a post request with all the parameters required including the jsf view state parameter that was parsed out of the get request

11695954
width	height
this is not a good practice but when you set some content you have to set the iframe width and height

11695977
thunk	trampolines
then the c c++ callback interface trampolines thunk

11696001
versioning	upgrade
i went online and installed the latest versioning of ant directly from the apache website but now i ve realized that i need to upgrade the versioning of ant in the sdk directory

mousehover	mouseleave
c# winforms mousehover and mouseleave problem
