keep in mind that the 12factor applies mainly to your applications or let s call it your micro services not to your servers like nginx apache cherokee etc that they can log as always but your application is the one you may want to scale and will be deployed in distributed environments therefore needs to be handled differently

regarding the logging the main idea is to avoid the application write to disk and just write to stdout or stderr normally the logs are in a structured logging format and later collected analyzed by tools like elastiksearch

46104077
stdout	stderr
check immortal it can either combine stdout and stderr or log separately besides also letting the log intact without timestamp in the case is a structured log that later may be used by elastic search or any other tool example

46104077
stdout	stderr

the api is still in working draft but it shows that google-chrome and firefox support it but i can t get it to work

46109683

normally git receive-pack and git upload-pack accepts 1 argument a git directory the directory containing the objects folder and then performs a full duplex communication over its stdin stdout with the remote git push pull

46109962
pull	push
take a note that git pull and git push aren t exactly the inverse operations of each other

46109962
pull	push
git push refuses to push by default when the other side has commits it doesn t have by its own unless -f has given then it will overwrite while pull makes a merge commit

46110099
fast-forward	merge
git spells out this fast-forward idea directly with the git merge command which is a slightly odd thing to do because a fast-forward operation is not actually a merge at all

46110099
fast-forward	merge
if git merge can do a fast-forward you must tell it not to using --no-ff to force git to make a new merge commit

46110099
pull	push
this is why the opposite of git push is git fetch having only git pull was a mistake

46110099
pull	push
mercurial s hg pull does what git s git fetch does 3 so mercurial s pull and push are in fact paired up while git s just aren t.

46110479
post	get
i have called the get in both styles with -1 with valid id and it works fine but the post has so far led to this error

46110479
post	get
the major difference between the two apart from get post is the way i call them this is how i use the get

46110843
postgresql	mysql
laravel understands the arrow operator for querying json fields in mysql 5.7+ and postgresql

46110843
postgresql	mysql
so for mysql and postgresql your query would look like

46110978

int	chars
because the both array as display as chars and the chars are keep as ascii code and int are kept as int thanks cpt

46111133
int	chars
printf interprets the input as code ascii so in case of int you have control chars which are not very understandable

46111356
getter	setter
the most common case is not the getter that s rather a side effect but the setter allows to execute code valdiation or similar when the value is updated

46111356
getter	setter
what you can do with getter and setter can be done with methods as well but having properties with getter and setter that can be used like simple fields where it s not obvious there is calculation going on seem more natural

46111365
spring-data	mongotemplate
conclusion you can still use spring-data well supported named queries and additionally if you need aggregation or some complex queries for sub documents that a named query cannot be built by spring you can do it in your newly created mongotemplate repository class

you can either extends uiviewcontroller by implements the required methods of the protocol or probably an even easier solution would be to create your own uiviewcontroller subclassing which provides a default color for the classes view.backgroundcolor properties and make all your viewcontrollers inherited from this class instead of uiviewcontroller directly

i suspect that you never actually needed never overwrite or permanent because whether a file stays on the system or not is managed using componentid ref counting doing major upgrade late after installexecute and setting launch conditions that for example disallow an uninstall that isn t part of an upgrade

46129215
factors	matrix
with factors variable notation you tell stata to create a set of dummy variables that by definition will be multicollinear and since it understands that relationship between the dummy variables it can eliminate the multicollinearity ex ante before constructing the cross-products matrix rather than attempt to infer the problem ex post using the cross-products matrix s characteristics

angularjs addition is not working fro ng-bind and but multiplication is working why

multiplying	multiplication
my solution is since multiplication operator is doing type conversion just multiplying the variable by 1 so that you will get the same number and also convert the datatype to number

46130488
multiplying	addition
the + works as two ways as an addition operator for numbers and as a concatenation operator for strings so in your question the first scenario the operator is working as a concatenator and appending 3 and 5 as 35 for your second case i think multiplying operator is doing type conversion before performing operation thus the correct calculation takes place 15 whereas in the first case type conversion is not taking place

you simply declare a constant string holding the delimiter you wish to break the words on to break the words on spaces or tab and then call strtok str delims to return the first token word and then loop over repeated calls to strtok null delims to parse the remaining words or until you reach your max of 3 words

46139177
width	height
it looks like you want to resize each jpeg image in a folder to a width of 1840 pixels with keeping aspect ratio for images in landscape format width is higher or equal than height

46139177
width	height
i do not recommend to resize each image with a too low height or width to 1840 x 1840 pixels to get only square images with blank area on top and bottom side on an image with a too low height or blank area on left and right side on a too small width

46139177
width	height
if the images are needed for a web gallery in 1840 x 1840 pixels reference each image from within aâ div or td element with a width and height of 1840 pixels and define that the image is displayed centered horizontally and vertically within the element

46139207
hide	show
i am busy with a angular4 app where i m trying to conditionally hide show two div elements using ngif with very strange results

46139212

to fix this error either change the json to a json object name value or change the deserialized type to an array or a type that implements a collection interface icollection ilist like list that can be deserialized from a json array

46139311
int	chars
there is a simplest approach in python with using struct.pack and manually provide a layout as first argument ic means int followed by a chars

46139321
qtabwidget	qtabbar
to change the style to each tab we must create a custom qtabbar and override its paintevent method to be able to change the style of each tab we use the qstyleoptiontab class but to change the qtabwidget tabbar we need to use the settabbar method but this is private so you need to create a custom qtabwidget as shown below

46139326
int	chars
and then use one of the int 10h services to display the ascii chars like the service

46139340

you can define a function that controls the show hide functionality

46139480
subtract	add
edit - per request you can add a check at the top of get_ordinal to scale values greater than 100 to their equivalent 0-99 range by successively subtract 100 and you can add more checks to optimize values greater than 1000 etc.

46139552
versioning	upgrade
moreover i have upgrade webpack from versioning 1 to latest one and i landed to the this error i easily come to a conclusion that webpack had some bug or something

46139698
versioning	upgrade
we use unboundid unfortunately the old versioning that should be upgrade soon

46139714

i ve read from other post that i should override shouldselectviewcontroller but it seems that it doesn t even get there

46140141
post	put
how do i redirect post requests and request that the method be changed to put or delete

46140194
put	get
higher values decrease the space overhead but increase the lookup cost reflected in most of the operations of the hashmap class including get and put

46140197
button	checkbox
validation for checkbox and radio button is checked function

46140204
post	get
in my view i need to display how many post and comments each user has written and i get the queryset like so

46140243
hide	show
is it suggested to hide show button while loading screen for a particular user or should i keep separate ui for separate user-type

46140286
bindparam	bindvalue
you need to bindvalue instead of bindparam

46140286
bindparam	bindvalue
see the difference here what is the difference between bindparam and bindvalue

46140292
free	malloc
the fundamental difference between gc and any malloc implementation is that gc keeps track of allocated objects while malloc basically keeps track of de allocated objects via free lists etc. which needed to collect free memory blocks to quickly return them on following malloc s - some malloc implementations even have no possibility in their internals to enumerate all allocated blocks by design

46140292
free	malloc
after all it obvious that free memory blocks always has zero maintenance overhead in contrast with allocated blocks objects. this is fundamental flaw of any gc as it collects maintains garbage while malloc maintains nongarbage

46140292
free	malloc
also i d like to note that programming languages without built-in gc offers many ways to wrap around explicit malloc free new delete calls for example std shared_ptr in c++ or arc in obj-c that makes program code looks similar to as in gc-powered languages but from performance point of view it is much closer almost equivalent to explicit memory allocation

46140362
width	height
in relation to not having a fixed width height any of the following from your examples will result in a fixed width of 956px unless the uploaded image is smaller and auto height

46140400
post	get
you can get an idea how they manage to get an accurate time from this so post 1 and so post 2

46140469

ssl	https
and point the tomcat server.xml ssl config to that the site loads over https and i get warnings in the browser telling me that it is a self-signed certificate

46140521
int	double
you first have to convert your string into double then cast it to int

46140521
int	double
in given examples you can see that converting from double representation to int gives format exception

46140533
int	double
the way i see it when you start with an float double and you convert to int you expect a loss of precision

46140608
int	double
you can think of the utility methods you re currently using to convert from double to int as casting i.e int 12.4 int 12.44 etc

46140679
button	checkbox
i usually name my html elements with prefix like button for button txt for textbox chk for checkbox rad for radio button etc

46140830
bots	api.ai
i have built a small conversational bots using api.ai with node.js as the back end

46140873
daemons	systemd
unlike initscripts the systemctl command will not try execute the start script directly - instead it tries to contact the systemd daemons to execute the start sequence of the service

46140873
daemons	systemd
so all services have a common parent in the systemd daemons

46140873
daemons	systemd
it can be quite overdone to run a systemd daemons inside a docker container just to start a service

46140873
daemons	systemd
you could use the systemctl-docker-replacement overwriting usr bin systemctl in which case the target service is started without the help of a systemd daemons

46140910

width	height
i also found it easier to just use the set height and width to be the total number of rows and cols in the data so that there s no need to add two

46141794
for-loop	arrays
my constructor fills an arrays with for-loop filled_army but i don t know how to retrieve it the right way so i could print it out after since constructors don t have return values

46141794
getter	setter
i m guessing it should be done with getter setter but i also had problems with using them since one variable is passed in index.php while other variable filled_army is property of class.

46142272
antialiasing	transparent
the reason it looks like it becomes more transparent rather than thin is because width of bottom-left border is between 0-1px therefore antialiasing kicks in to make it smoother you can t display for example 0.5px

instead since both sides are the same just multiplying each column by the vector since you know you need those values and then you can just look up the values for the results in column 1 and 3 and subtract them

46143399
addition	multiplication
but maybe on this computer multiplication is twice as expensive than addition so the difference is actually more like 10 2 5 1

46143445

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a static cell uitableviewcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller in a uitabbarcontroller

46144018
google-chrome	firefox
in your original script it should fix the problem and keep the output code consistent across firefox and google-chrome

46144159
floating-point	integer
client-side pixel data is integer rather than floating-point

46144164
width	height
i have 4 cells inside with the width of each one being 1 4 of the collection view and the height being the same as the collection view

46144179
for-loop	loops
you were really not entering loops with on your for-loop s entry condition

46144254
ssl	https	apache	nginx
i see your example url is using https and it is possible that your apache nginx server is not configured correctly to handle the ssl in this way but it would work fine with the certificate in the browser

46144335
width	margin
the default margin is 8px so the total width of the body is 100 of the window plus 16px totalling more than 100

46144355
public	protected
a protected static method would allow you to provide utility type functionality to derived classes without exposing them in the public api where they might not make sense on their own

46144355
public	protected
it would be marked static if it s not tied to any specific instance and marked protected so as not to be a part of the public api but also to allow derived classes to re-use the utility method in it s own implementation

46144371
post	get
now i want to get just the framerate and thanks to other post i ve found that ffprobe can be used to do just that

46144446
filtering	grouping
the filtering are rather nice they are grouping for each power of 2 in the following way the filtering are upto n 20

46144532
children	parent
the reason is because when you add the float property to all children of an element the parent will have no height so the links will appear to be outside the header and the links blend with the background of the page

46144641
viewdidload	viewdidappear
and i tried doing these things in viewdidload viewdidappear and at the point where i m writing the text into the textfield

46144964
setinterval	settimeout
if you see neither messages then the code does not even load and you need to debug the input mechanisms setinterval settimeout and or parameters depending on the error message

46144964
setinterval	settimeout
if you have no input mechanisms setinterval settimeout then add one or call the function directly from the code like shown in most of my code blocks above otherwise the code will never ever load

46144984
for-loop	loops
now i need to add some data in the last column of each row how do i loops over the table using for-loop and do the same

46144989

46145109
post	get
now i wanted to make a query from which i can get all best post which means the results i am expecting should be ordered by the number of ratings on a post

width	height	portrait	landscape
it is quite interesting since you are in portrait view but when keyobard is shown width of the available screen is higher than height and that change orientation to landscape

46145305
apache	nginx
use nginx or apache to serve your php file then you will be able to call it in your gettest function

46145310
integer	unsigned
printf 02x expects an unsigned integer

46145310
int	chars
passing a negative value of type chars and 0xd2 of type chars is a negative value will lead to promote the negative chars value to a 32 bit unsigned int thereby filling up the leading bits with 1 and yielding 0xffffffd2 in the end

46145314
width	height
using media screen and orientation portrait means that when is the width of the screen bigger then its height and when the soft keyboard popup the width of the screen become bigger than the height so that happen

46145365
factors	matrix
in each box of the new matrix it will store the number at the same position in the first matrix but a 2 factors

46145378
rss	feed
if you parse this rss feed â œ â in this rss parse website it reads all feed almost instantly which is never a surprise

46145378
rss	feed
well i tried out reading this rss feed by myself and parsed every single htmls to extract mp3 file links respectively using multi-threading but it took more than a minute to complete

46145431
post	get
the submit button value does not get sent along with the post

46145454
int	chars
i was thinking maybe i could do something where i count the total number of chars from the lastname all the way to the zip code and then have that subtracted from a very large number of spaces between the lastname and zipcode but i wasn t sure how to do that since it would be bouncing between strings and int

46145463
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your matplotlib to versioning 2.0+ then this should work

getter	setter
property descriptors setter and getter as well as similar

46145529
min	max
the step takes the into account the value of the min and max attributes

46145560
free	malloc
if you write to the memory you got from malloc then you will see that memory usage as seen by free will increase

46145561
daemons	systemd
the problem before version 0.12.0 was that the systemd configuration for the docker.service was using docker daemons instead of the new dockerd daemons command

46145627
range	min
so you set min 30 correctly and you want your range to be 30 100

46145631
width	height
it gives you a default width and height and you can change that by writing new numbers in width and height boxes

46145631
width	height
i think these numbers are the number of pixels so if you want the image to be twice as wide as it is long set the width to 800 and the height to height to 400

46145631
width	height
i think setting the width to 800 and the height to 500 would look a little better

46145639
ssl	https
whose processing is explained nicely in this video tutorial ssl for https with nginx - django web

46145646

rss	feed
i am using the below xml parsing codes to display rss feed

46146151
multiplying	add
maybe it s simplistic but you could build some simple evaluator by applying regexes first on multiplying then on add operators using a replacement function

46146205
min	max
i wrote the below code everything works fine except it never executes the last loop so the last value inputted is never calculated into the min max average

46146224
width	height
to make things work out well i need to set height or width to 100 depends on whether one length is bigger than the other

46146224
width	height
adding a class contains a height set is working but is a small problem with width

46146231
disassembly	shellcode
if you had shellcode which used call or jmp to jump over some data you d have to replace the strings with nops if the disassembly got out of sync while treating the data as instructions as davidj suggested

46146231
x86	mips
so you could objdump -mintel -bbinary -d -mi386 tmp shellcode for 32-bit -mi386 selects x86 as the architecture rather than arm or mips or whatever and implies -mi386 32-bit mode as well

46146231
disassembly	shellcode
i use this alias in my .bashrc because i normally disassembly elf executables objects to see what a compiler did not shellcode

46146245
explode	implode

i have successfully created a asp.net core mvc application that is hosted on a ubuntu linux server

46146409
google-chrome	firefox
however on google-chrome there is a rather larger gap on firefox it s small but still there and on ie it actually behaves as intended

46146504
width	height
basically the method gets a number which is the number of rows there should be and the width and height is the two numbers that will be in the two columns

46146524
google-chrome	firefox
but since am loading dynamically the datat google-chrome firefox ...

any idea how i could prevent access to the war file running on elastic beanstalk while still allowing the client access to the amazon-web-services account

46146590

i have an ajax script that submit a form on button click the script appends the form data to the url while submission which isn t safe by any standard the script works well for other forms except the one am currently debugging

46146631
int	chars
output after converting chars to int 52

46146658
put	get
and if i simply put print title i get the following ugly result

46146717

if you want become a string into int you need use the int function ord function returns an int representing unicode code point for the given unicode chars

46146784
internationalization	localization
following the ecmascript spec conforming browsers and other environments such as node.js should implement localization following the ecmascript internationalization api ecma-402 which only outlines the following for getting the default locale

46146867
jtextfield	jtable
my jtextfield addbutton editbutton and the jtable was originally on one jframe

46146882
hide	show
in the table - td there is button to control the staging release show or revert hide

46146884
keystore	jks
if you want to generate using openssl you must then convert the private key and certificate chain not just the certificate s alone to a java-usable keystore either pkcs12 or jks

46146894
submit	submission
use proper event handlers on the forms submit event and prevent the form from submission otherwise the page just reloads and the changed value is lost

46146934
folder	directory
as you probably know setoutpath sets the destination directory and decompilers can only display parts of that path they cannot resolve custom variables and you used just jre for both the 32-bit and 64-bit folder

46146985
put	get
201 response code also does not make a lot of sense for get method it is usually used as a response to an ajax put method request to an api endpoint

46146994
ubuntu	linux
you cant use the local db file from visual studio on ubuntu its not supported as error say but you can use the sql server 2017 as database engine its now supporting linux or any supported dbms on ubuntu

46147009
openbsd	freebsd
one workaround would be to use something like tcpdrop 8 however as can be seen from usr.sbin tcpdrop tcpdrop.c on openbsd and freebsd it s implemented through a sysctl-based interface and may have portability issues outside of bsds

46147009
openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd	freebsd	netbsd
in fact it looks like even the sysctl-based implementation may be different enough between openbsd and freebsd to require a porting layer -- openbsd uses the tcp_ident_mapping structure which subsequently contains two sockaddr_storage elements plus some other info whereas freebsd dragonfly and netbsd use an array of two sockaddr_storage elements directly. it turns out that openbsd s tcpdrop does appear to send the r packet as per tcpdump 8 and can be confirmed by looking at sys netinet tcp_subr.c tcp_drop which calls tcp_close in the end and tcp_close is confirmed to send rst elsewhere on so so it appears that it wouldn t even work either

46147019
keras	tensorflow
i made a model using keras with tensorflow

46147037
metal	scenekit
scenekit and metal

affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
the reason i started messing with processors affinity is because i would launch multiple bash child processes and all the bash child process affinities had the value ff so it seemed like they were all targeting the same cpu

46147120
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol in each tabitem there is a datagrid

46147129
affinity	processors
the affinity mask controls the set of processors that a process may run on - not a single specific processors

if i open the app then fastly close back btn and open again i can see in log that oncreate is called before ondestroy of previous main activity

46157536
oncreate	ondestroy
and since i have flag singletask - all my singletons works bad - in oncreate i initialize them again let s assume i have to create them there and in a short time when first activity ondestroy fires i clear them all in ondestroy - which is definitely not app has to do

hi my textview is not moved into next line even i set maxlenght maxsize also need to set imageview width based height sorry for my poor english

46157989
put	get
you ll need to use an idempotent repository or build your own custom processor to skip a file already in constants.req_folder or maybe you can use one of the caching component camel has to offer put the s3 key in the cache once the file has been downloaded and check the cache for the key before donwload it again by using a get operation on the cache

46157998
swift	objective-c
on the documentation of react native we have a tutorial for swift and objective-c but don t with c++

46158006
stdout	stderr
but if you redirect both stdout and stderr to a pipe on windows you ll need to run an additional thread so you can read from both pipes at the same time

46158006
stdout	stderr
if you do it in a single thread and block on reading stdout while a lot of data is dumped to the stderr pipe you might hang forever because the stderr pipe buffer would fill up and block the process that writes to stderr which would mean that both processes would be deadlocked one waiting for the stderr buffer to become empty the other for the stdout buffer to fill up with a line of output

46158006
stdout	stderr
another solution that doesn t require threads might be to redirect your command s stderr into stdout before piping it to your python process

46158006
stdout	stderr
you won t be able to tell which bytes originally went to stdout and which ones to stderr but depending on your use case that might not be important to know

46158071
ubuntu	linux
the same test done on linux ubuntu 16.04 with valgrind 3.11.0 provides a clean output

46158338
width	height
if you just want the columns to be next to each other you could try using tables a table to hold other tables and if that doesn t work just use css grid layouts with three grid columns of specified or auto width and then one row of auto height and then just place the tables as you see fit

46158349

to stop the request being made from the form submission you would be better hooking to the submit event of the form instead

46159210
super	self
the problem seems to be triggered by a combination of attrs undecorated classes with explicit work slots regular attr.s -decorated classes work and the plain super call super derived self works

46159210
super	self
i would like to understand how super behaves differently from the explicit super derived self version since the documentation says they do the same thing

46159307
children	parent
if you have a highly developed modeling you will more then likely have a set where you think you going to get your intended entity and it s child list but if those list items also have children or other parent then you will load those

46159382
getter	setter
however the getter is always null although the value in setter part keeps changing

46159416
super	self
that closure lets super work without arguments the self argument is taken from the local namespace

46159416
super	self
the super derived self variant explicitly looks up the name derived as a global when called finding the new generated class so works

for if you use theano as the backend them images are in the samples color_depth width height form and if you use tf then images are in the samples width height color_depth format

if you set then it means width will be first computed from other constraints and then height will be adjusted according to the aspect ratio

46159915
keras	tensorflow	theano	keras	theano	tensorflow
you can create a keras model and use it either with tensorflow or theano without changing anything about the model

46160139
width	height
i removed the set max width and height

46160157
min	max
if you are looking to determine a time span between the min and max date i would use the datediff function

46160171
width	height
you may use display width and height if you want to do in oncreate

46160224
inherited	properties
since a categoryattribute doesn t do anything but set a properties on the test i would suggest you inherited from testattribute and implement the category behavior yourself

46160237
google-chrome	firefox
all works perfectly fine in firefox and internet explorer but in google-chrome i get this error

46160254
outputstream	inputstream
my problem is i can t write anything to outputstream after reading the inputstream

46160259
onchange	onblur
also you should use onchange instead of onblur

46160309
folder	directory
open the middleware folder in the app directory

46160352
width	height
the examples i found use the first one but i see that the second one provides me with more information about the picture after taking it such as width height

46160352

and if i am supposed the first one how can i retrieve the image information width height afterwards

46160521
versioning	upgrade
upgrading a dependency versioning is done in one place for all the projects so when someone upgrade the versioning he or she does this for all the projects at once so that different teams benefit from that

46160521
versioning	upgrade
when one project can t be upgrade to a new plugin versioning for some reason the whole repository has to wait

46160630
int	boolean
as ray toal pointed out in java assignments are expressions too but int are not automatically casted to boolean

46160631
prepare	execute
the difference between execute and prepare is not that the prepare method has some internal flag like which will be set and magically you are save for sql injections

46160631
prepare	execute
because of this you cannot just redirect the execute call internally to prepare to be safe because then you are missing the bind_param calls

46160631
prepare	execute
that being said use execute when you have a fixed sql query without any variables and or user inputs and use prepare for prepare statements where you have an sql query which depends on variables and or user inputs

46160633
getter	setter
this way you don t even need to use getter and setter

46160633
getter	setter
one more thing is you should avoid using getter and setter in android

46160639
folder	directory
i add images from my local disk to the directory proj.ios_mac ios then pull them into the resources folder in the xcode project

46160643
children	parent
also to the newly added children item the usual treeview logic is being applied since the parent is checked the children should also be checked and so it checks it right after adding and i don t want that by default either

46160649
width	margin
body width page width - left margin + right margin

46160700
for-loop	loops
as loops condition in a for-loop in both languages

46160700
int	boolean
is int not boolean so the java compiler gives the error

46160700
int	boolean
c does not have this restriction as it tends to be a lot more permissive with types with int and boolean being more or less the same thing. details are a little technical perhaps but the int 5 is implicitly coerced to truthiness so you see an infinite loop

46160701
multiplying	add
my understanding of this should multiplying no more than 40 hours by the wage hence the 700 cap and to add no less than 0 hours by the wage and a half

46160703
int	boolean
in c c++ assigning i 5 is fine as this expression get converted to bool as true java compiler will throw you error cannot convert from int to boolean

46160723
ati	nvidia

the go answer is programers should just do the right thing when there might be multibyte characters. swift s answer is the language should always do the right thing. there are legitimate arguments for both but swift s approach avoids a lot of real-world bugs like the horrible security problem i introduced for my chinese users when i accidentally truncated multibyte passwords when working in objective-c

46163434

46163558
min	max
this is because in the heightcalculation function it sets the height to somewhere between the min and max based off the value of zoompos as you use the scrollwheel this value changes and so does the zoom

46163601

46180449
int	double
the error is double you are using findviewbyid increment where in your code increment is an int variable whose value is actually 0

46180456

google-chrome	firefox
i have tried both firefox mobile and google-chrome

46181004
width	height
similarly here you ll have to take a parent first which is linearlayout in this case and then you ll have to define its height width and orientation and after that you ll add the child views which are edittext in your case with height as wrap_content

the 0x00000279d8f9606f number also makes sense because 0x00000279d8f9606f - 0x00000279d7c76070 0d20054015 which means there are 20054016 valid char s which is expected 2048 height 2448 width 4 channels 20054016

for the second to work i need to rename children to children_ids and parent to parent_id as described in their readme

minimum	max	min	max
your graph is displaying october as the minimum value from its automatic formatting of max min values

46186489
min	max
i believe if you scroll up in that formatting window on the right while you have the x-axis selected you will see an option for min and max value

46186489
range	minimum
the unfortunate side effect is that half your circle will be cut off as it extends into the range that is less than your minimum value

46186489
min	max
now if you want every month to be displayed which is independent of placing max min values on your graph look for the units and major box

46186489
min	max
try using 32 as themajor unit step first before putting min and max caps on

46186489
min	max
adding the max and min to the axis will cut off your circles but limit the axis to only displaying 12 months

children	parent
i d say if parent component retrieves children using some service most likely then probably the same service handles save operation as well and thus it is parent component who should be responsible for invoking save operation

this way their responsibilities are better separated since only one parent component is responsible for data operations on the service one concern while children are only responsible for showing and editing items another concern

cpu	processors
reason for the comparison i do believe that hardware cost and running cost investment depreciation and power are the most interesting because if you can write in cuda it means you can use cpu clusters also but from my perspective it is cheaper to escalate on gpus than cpu a regular computer can handle multiple gpus while a mainboard to manage two processors is not that usual

46188873

kerberos	ldap
in short as an authentication protocol kerberos is far more secure out of the box is de-centralized and will put less load on your directory authentication servers than ldap will

46188971
kerberos	ldap
kerberos in pure microsoft active directory environments will do both authentication and authorization for you while directory look-ups is always ldap

46188971
kerberos	ldap
now if you use kerberos for authentication and ldap for directory look-ups and or group-based authorization than that is the best practice as ldap was originally designed per the rfcs as a directory lookup protocol only

46188971
kerberos	ldap
in fact when you use a tool such as the active directory users and computers utility what happens when you use it is exactly this you pass a kerberos authentication in order to allow yourself to query the ad ldap service and then your ldap query from that point forward is just pure ldap

46188971
kerberos	ldap
in mixed environments consisting of both windows and say for instance linux then you can always use kerberos for authentication but that takes some more doing on the application side for instance you ll need a keytab generated for you by the ad admin but group-based authorization will have to be ldap and of course directory look-ups is always ldap

46188971
kerberos	ldap
this question really involves a deep understanding of kerberos versus ldap and there s so much more to say and read about but i ll need to leave it at this for now and provide you with a link kerberos vs

int	chars
first of all a chars array and a chars pointer are mostly the same can at times be used interchangeably but ultimately a chars has a known size making it possible to use the sizeof function whereas chars just points to the first address of contiguous memory of unknown length so sizeof will return whatever your default size for int are 4 on 32-bit systems 8 on 64-bit systems to indicate the size required to store an address

you can do the loading of all the data in viewdidload and of single child in viewwillappear since viewdidload will be called once initially

viewdidload	viewwillappear
since both methods will be called initially so we can have a bool flag so we can control which code runs initially and which does not since viewwillappear is called after viewdidload so we change the value of this flag in viewwillappear method and then control the execution of code inside viewwillappear using this flag

46209441

so if you want to have a specific height you need to set the width accordingly

46237170
width	height
you might use them maybe to calculate a ratio and from this set the width to achieve your desired height

46237372

as barmar says - you can use array.slice 0 random_number but so that you can see whats going on i did a sample as a straight javascript for-loop that iterates over the arrays for as many items as the random number and and appends a into a display list

46248190

int	chars
in that case you should analyze the chars sequence of the argument to see whether it matches the pattern of an int and if not whether it matches the pattern of a floating-point number

46250938
int	double
the question is strictly about form so that the properties of your system s built-in data types such as int and double are not relevant

46250938
floating-point	integer
each argument will have the form of either an integer or a floating-point number so that eliminating integer as a possibility leaves floating-point as the only alternative

46250938
floating-point	integer
if neither is a possibility that must also be accommodated then you ll also need to compare the inputs that do not have integer form to a pattern for floating-point numbers too

width	height
i think you should define the pseudo-elements as block s instead of inline-block s and give them width and height since they otherwise would remain as large as their content which is

46267250
free	malloc
the memory allocated by malloc remains valid until you call free on it

46267250
free	malloc
being able to call malloc and free from different functions is the whole point of dynamic memory allocation

46268832
width	height
the width and height of the generated content could be 480 x 270

46268832
width	height
so we could restrict the maximum width and height of the video

google-chrome	firefox
thus greasemonkey doesnâ t need a gm_forceautofill api because firefox doesnâ t exhibit this google-chrome quirk

46268925
for-loop	loops
my reasoning is that instead of a nested for-loop i use two o n loops instead which should improve performance by a decent margin especially if our a blists are sufficiently large or used often enough

move	drag
for example if i move a dragged object very slowly a drag event will fire each pixel i move

46269674
move	drag
however if i move fairly fast the drag event is not triggered in a one-to-one correlation with the amount of pixels i have move

46269674
move	drag
i am thinking that the reason for the decreased calls to drag has something to do with something perhaps internal in chrome and that perhaps it just uses some sort of algorithm to call drag based on how fast the mouse move

46269674
move	drag
one last thing i am also aware that sometimes when you move the mouse cursor so quickly that it exits the object you are dragging then the drag event should not be called

46269674
move	drag
however even when i don t leave the object i am dragging there are still less calls to drag based on how quickly i move the mouse cursor

46269678
distance	polygons
one way is discretizing the exterior of the polygons into set of points and calculate the distance between the point and each point in this set of points

46270465
range	median
all other colors possible h s s s and l s are single continuous range for which the median approach or my modified version works well but it isn t ideal in the purple h case because it yields results which are actually closer to the edge of its range so the input hsl value is more likely to be mistaken for another color red s h range is 9 - 14

46270465
range	median
is there a better aggregation algorithm than median for this task one that will tend to produce results nearer the middle of a color s h s and l range even in the wrap around purple h case

46280041
width	height
the simplest schema is a table with three columns width height cost

46280041
width	height
define a unique index containing both width and height columns

46280041
width	height
to find a particular cost search filter or join on the width and height columns

46280041
width	height
this schema will require that you have duplicate width and height values although each pair should be unique but that s the nature of relational table design

46280041
width	height
it may not seems as efficient as the visual lookup capability of the original table since in that case you only label each width column and each height row once but the index defined on the table provides the necessary efficient lookup mechanism

why when the new android project is started in the android studio there is no explicit call of onstart after oncreate in the autogenerated code although all the tutorials say that oncreate is always followed by onstart

46291423
oncreate	onstart
also i looked up in the base classes like appcompatactivity and in the implementation of oncreate there is no explicit or implicit callback of onstart either

46291423
oncreate	onstart
to be clear everything works fine i do not have any errors or problems but there seems to be a contradiction between what i see no onstart after oncreate and what the tutorials say

46308184
put	get
edit if i put the scripts tag and functions inside the element then angular can get access to it regularly as a global

46308210

swift	objective-c	int	double
most swift int and floating types can be cast to nsnumber via the swift - objective-c bridging magic which is why you can just send something like an int or a double to userdefaults s methods and expect it to work

46308473
floating-point	integer
anyway nsnumber magically bridges to most of the standard swift integer and floating-point types but the system doesn t have magic to bridge it to decimal

onkeyup	onkeydown	onkeyup	onmouseup	onkeydown	onmouseup
unfortunately javascript doesn t have a direct equivalent to text_changed and you ll need to look at the onkeydown onkeyup onkeypress onpaste oncut and onmouseup events any of which might cause text to change

46324344
onchange	onblur
you might instead want to look at events like onblur and onchange for the popup and use some other visual indication that things are not right while the user is still working in the textbox.

accessor	properties
that s a keyword that tells swift that this properties may be observed and so its accessor can t be optimized to static dispatch

46324383
accessor	properties	swift	objective-c
it just means even though you can t find an accessor implementation for this properties anywhere trust me by the time this runs an implementation will be available. this relies on the ability of objective-c s runtime to generate implementations dynamically or dispatch in programmer-controlled ways this still kind of exists in swift by manipulating the objective-c runtime but it isn t really a swift feature

46324383
accessor	properties	accessor	superclass

46337393
int	double
here 1 is an int type not a double type then why does compiler generated ambiguous error

46337443
int	double
to the compiler an implicit conversion of int to short int is equally as valid as an implicit conversion of int to double cf

46337443
int	double
thus because the compiler can t decide between the double and short int overloads it gives up and issues a diagnostic

46337443

it would be annoying if the compiler chose at runtime the short int overload if the calling argument was appropriate and the double one in other instances.

46345047
min	max
selecting rows that are between the min and max rowversion like this is easy

46345047
range	min	range	max	min	max
with this in place i should then be able to determine which rows have been created and which rows have been updated since the last sync i.e between min and max rowversions - because for created rows i can look at rows that have a creationrowversion that fall within the min and max row version range

46345047
range	min	range	max	min	max
for updated rows i can look at rows that have a lastchanged that fall within min and max row version range - but i can also exclude rows from being detected as updates if their creationrowversion also falls between min and max rowversions as then i know they are actually already included as inserts

wrt the problem in the admin unless you did something strange in your modeladmin or it s form or you didn t post your whole model code it should just redisplay the form with an error message not raise an integrityerror unless eventually you get a race condition between form validation and instance save but that should be very very very rare

so what this does is when your component initializes you set the state to the width and height of the viewport using jquery

46346726
width	height
this ensures that your state always contains the width and height of the viewport

an exception is thrown by cascade for e1.endnode referencing a transient entity while in test2 no exception is called on persistent even if e1.endnode is null

integer	unsigned
please correct me if i am wrong but it appears that the answer to that question would be use unsigned rather than signed integers because the results are well defined per c11 6.2.5 9 a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type.

46348670
integer	unsigned
so the result of the subtraction could be kept as an unsigned number and compared 1 or converted back to a signed int for comparison c11 6.3.1.3 when a value with integer type is converted to another integer type .

46348680

46350419
min	max
the binary search i m pretty sure assumes the list is both unique and in order and returns escapes the loop when the value is found or iterated through the list by changing the min max value

46350419
min	max
in your final else where the value is found all it does is increment the counter and it never returns where a normal binary search would escape the loop not does it update the min or max values so your guess will always be the same in future loops

46350436
int	chars
while at least one comment mentions that the developer chose to use a magic number which is almost always unwise in this case i suspect that he assumed that any developer reading his code would be familiar with this approach to converting chars to int values

int	chars
from a-h the ascii chars code go from 65 a up to 72 h so when you pick a letter in that range and subtract 65 the int value of a you obtain a value in the indexable range of the board matrix 0-7

46350947
int	chars
i suggest you google for ascii table so you can take a look at how printable and nonprintable chars of the ascii coding are mapped to int numbers as it widely used in all programming languages and a nice thing to understand some of the inner workings of string coding

could it be possible to have screen b s panel made to handle only touch events and screen a to handle only keyboard mouse events

why is ie setting the readystate to complete so much earlier than google-chrome and firefox

46353574
width	height
i thought something like dividing my parent div both width and height by 10 and having the divs class be different depending on their quadrant so upon creation the div will have the proper class to identify what quadrant it is in

think about it this way if an operation is stateless you can call it and get repeatable results however if it is stateful an operation might change the results based on the state

46353848
folder	directory
however i would rather have my tests in the top folder of the package which assuming the package is called project and not parser would give the following directory structure

46353853
width	height
note that the width and height properties should be set on the element of your svg for canvg to render it correctly or at least so it seemed to me

46353928

the issue is you have a folder called help in your project directory which iis is maybe routing to instead of your help area

46369691
chunked	transfer-encoding
the leading transfer-encoding chunked is still there but the last one is no longer there

46369691
chunked	transfer-encoding
and the response body is not chunked anymore even though there is still a transfer-encoding chunked in the response header

chunked	transfer-encoding
further tests show that the leading transfer-encoding chunked header is also sent if the client is doing a http 1.0 request

46369691
chunked	transfer-encoding
this suggests that some part of the web application running on the server and not the web server itself is issuing the first transfer-encoding chunked header

the problem as i can see it is that the pictures you upload is not the same dimensions so it will fit your width and make the height auto there are pretty much two ways you can get around this 1

46390817
width	height
fix your pictures before you upload or fit it with css no.2 make your box that holds your img the width and height that you want and make it overflow hidden then take your image and say it have to be the same height as the box and the width have to be auto the reason for this that most pictures is made as a landscape so in that way your pictures can fit

with easymock jmock mockito static methods constructors and new -ed objects cannot be mocked at all

46391371

powermockito supports full mocking as well but still focused on mock objects specifically new-ed objects must be replaced with mock objects through whennew recording while with jmockit a test can simply declare a mocked field

i m now switching everything to use hk2 but sadly it seems like hk2 fails for certain cases where guice would succeed

46411547
hk2	guice
guice was happy to just create a new instance of these classes and inject recursively but hk2 not so much

46411547
hk2	guice
is there some list of different behaviors between hk2 and guice so i can track down why this isn t working

for-loop	loops	filtering	grouping
because it appears that your filtering are not mutually exclusive that is a data point can be in more than one filtering grouping i think that your best bet is likely to make a vector of your filtering then loops through that vector though i would use lapply instead of a for-loop

46411665
filtering	grouping
since you didn t provide a reproducible dataset or idea of what filtering you are using i am going to use the builtin iris data and grouping by species only the code will work the same for multiple grouping variables

46411665

width	height
as in the main class you are setting the scene width and height by 300 it will override the height and width set in the fxml file while launching

i can see that you have implemented the .row-eq-height to set the height of all columns equal but you have missed that there is another .col-md-12 inside each column which takes the width of the content inside it so just set it to height 100 for it to take the height of the parent instead

gunicorn	waitress
however when using gunicorn --paste foo.ini you re already telling gunicorn you want to use the gunicorn server not waitress so it ignores the server section and focuses only on loading the app

46437113
gunicorn	waitress
alternatively you can start your app using pserve which does use the server section to determine what server to use - but in your current setup that would run waitress instead of gunicorn

46437141
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
you ll notice that this algorithm still has the same time complexity as the two for-loop solution but now one of those loops is being internalized by numpy so i would expect a speedup on a large arrays

46441321
getter	setter
this is because by defining the property on the object s prototype every object gets that getter setter

46441321
getter	setter
and everything in js is an object so this means window is also going to have a key setter getter

46441321
getter	setter
inside your setter getter functions you just use key

46441321
getter	setter
and since you are using arrow functions there is no this bound to the setter getter calls and therefore you have no way of knowing which instance object you are interacting with

46441321
getter	setter
this will make it so the setter getter can get a instance reference to the object

46441353
width	height
this won t work because if you use both on width and on height

46441353
width	height
you need to declare width or height in px

my query returns 1 value if i use the max sampledatetime or min on the date time field i want but it returns no values if i leave out the max or min

46456530

also you are mixing prepare statements which are good with inserting the values directly in the query string which is bad because it can lead to sql injection you should use bindvalue for all the values of the table

46456531
min	max
i have a box plot which has 3 values on y axis and the corresponding text is min medium and max

46456849
uilabel	uitextview
if you re using a uilabel or uitextfield they don t need a height constraint and can calculate their height based on it s inner contents but uitextview is not going to do that because it will start scrolling if the contents is more than it s height and that s why it can not set the height based on it s inner contents and it s height is zero by default

following the error message if the pci_j format is used to describe the rotation matrix the values should be normalised to 1 and any scaling factors encoded separately in the cdelt values

46457142

46457623

i have a bool in my table depending on if that is true or false i would like to hide or show rows in the table but it s only the first row that gets affected

46457787
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i m new to java and inspired by this discussion i wrote a while loops version here and a for-loop version this question of a program that searches an arrays for an item int 20 as called in the main method and returns its value and they both work

46457787
for-loop	arrays
i tried swapping the second if with an else statement but then the for-loop evaluated every value in the arrays before 20 and printed item not found three times

46457790

i guess such errors are related with using postgresql maybe the liquibase job was designed and tested just for mysql

for tome reason that i can t explain the entity migrations don t work if i get connectionstring in appsettings.json but if i put it hardcoded it works

this should not be done inside the for-loop since at this point you haven t processed the whole arrays yet

46457961
post	get
but this doesn t address your fallback position which is to get all post belonging to the first callurl

46457961

46458092

i am trying without success to scale an image to 250 px width keeping aspect ratio using imagemagick and then crop it from top corner x y with size 160 px width and 160 px height

46458217
width	height
the current size of key-icons look large therefore you need to reduce the width and height of it to fit in keys

46458225
keras	tensorflow
under assumption that keras in my setup is using feed_dict and that assumption is a question to me i am thinking of speeding things up by switching to raw tensorflow + dataset.from_generator

46458225
keras	tensorflow
does keras with tensorflow backend use feed_dict method

46458246

docker-compose logs logs stderr and stdout of the containers

46458267
versioning	upgrade
a better fix may be to upgrade the versioning

46458275
tensorflow	cudnn
it s probably because tensorflow now only supports cudnn v6.0 or v6.1 at least is what s maintained in the installation guide for windows

46458275
tensorflow	cudnn
i had the same problem but after updating tensorflow from an old version to a newer one where the cudnn had to be updated

46458311
post	put
1 use transform to convert the post payload to java list application java â the output should just have payload remove the curly braces and just put payload

46458332
min	max
you can also use max or min or top 1 to get a single value on the sub-query but this is dependent to the logic you want to achieve for locations.climate_id

46458368
queue	fifo
if you need fast fifo queue semantics consider taking inspiration from ring buffers have a cursor for the next element to be read returned and only shrink the array when there s a big chunk of elements to be freed up

46458368
int	double
side note 2 rounding a double to an int via parseint is pretty slow because it first formats the double as a string then reads that string back as an int

46458389
children	parent
the child elements of grid items are well whatever they may be they are not children of the main container so they are not grid items and cannot accept grid properties like their grid item parent

for-loop	loops
the correct way to structure loops should you wish to use a while loops instead of a for-loop is as follows

46458433
post	get
you cannot get location of followers from api you can may be estimate the location by checking for location in bio or analyzing all user post and finding most posted location this is expensive on api side and will have to make a lot of api calls to get analyze

46458447

46498802
width	height
rather they set the width height relative to the containing block

swift	objective-c
another observation is that objective-c inference is deprecated in swift 4 so it s a good idea to explicitly mark swift methods and properties callable from swift with objective-c

46499111
swift	objective-c
in fact you have to do it if swift 3 objective-c inference is set to off

46499111
swift	objective-c
i get the behavior you described if i add swift code to a project initially set up as objective-c but internal members defined in swift can be accessed just fine in objective-c if the project is initially set up in swift with objective-c files added later

46499111
swift	objective-c
again if swift 3 objective-c inference is disabled you still have to mark such members with objective-c

46499111
swift	objective-c
then internal swift members become visible in objective-c even though the purpose of a bridging header is the opposite make objective-c stuff visible in swift
