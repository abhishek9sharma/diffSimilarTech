30066
stdout	stderr
by default these stderr streams are redirected to the stdout of an interactive bash

30066
stdout	stderr
i would like to get them on the stderr of this interactive bash process in order to prevent my stdout to be polluted by error messages and be able to treat them separatly

30069
int	chars
if you do it either of the first two ways it is too easy to either start adding new meaning to the int without going through a proper design or ending up with that chars field having y y n n t t f f values and having to remember which section of code uses which table and which version of true it is using

30091
tinyint	boolean
oracle doesn t support boolean bit or tinyint data types so char s one byte is as small as you can get

30126
intersect	contains
check that your denominator isn t zero line doesn t intersect or is contains in the plane and you ll be good to go

30134
post	get
without that abstraction you work much more closely with the html and the http post and get commands

30152
folder	directory
i was zipping the contents of my subversion sandbox using winxp s inbuilt send to compressed zipped folder capability and was surprised to find that the .zip file created did not contain the .svn directory and their contents

30171
int	double
i have tried with other primitives int double and the same thing happens

30184
move	drag
but i would like the user to be able to click anywhere in the form and drag it to move it around on the desktop while it is still being displayed

30187
mouse	keyboard
this event fires when the keyboard or mouse state changes after dodragdrop has been called on that control

30187
mouseup	mousedown
just a note though as i call dodragdrop from within the mousedown event handler in my example this code should never actually get a direct mouseup event to fire

30195
folder	directory
it looks like the compressed folder shell extension ignores directory but not files whose names begin with a dot unless explicitly given as a parameter selected for the send to command

30197
google-chrome	firefox
google gears workerpool demo not a good example as it runs too fast to test in google-chrome and firefox although ie runs it slow enough to see it blocking interaction

30243
textmate	gedit
for very simple linux support if you like textmate try just gedit loaded with the right plugins

30243
textmate	gedit
gedit how to set up like textmate

30397
hide	show
it is trivial to modify this example to check the users group and show or hide the menu based on membership

30471
getdate	strtotime
you can avoid having to use strtotime or getdate in php by using mysql s unix_timestamp function

30479
ienumerable	ilist
for example if you have a method that accepts an array as a parameter would you be able to accept an ienumerable or ilist instead

30490
post	get
users can post questions comments and feedback about and application and get answers to their questions either from other members or from members of the development team themselves

30564
x86	64bit
you can target x64 and it will generate dll s specifically for 64bit systems or you can do x86 which will run on 32-bit and 64bit but will have the same restrictions as 32-bit on a 64bit system

30598
implements	extends
by contrast i can also create an object that does not extends from account say a user abstract class and still implements listable and editable but not versionable which doesn t make sense here

30598
implements	extends
likewise baraccount extends from account but is not a user subclass but implements editable listable and also versionable

30620
ubuntu	linux
i use windows at work and windows linux ubuntu osx at home

30669
decoder	encoder
most filters in this list are codecs so contain both a encoder and decoder

30677
xstream	jibx
but if you are want to deal with java objects then you should look at castor jibx jaxb xmlbeans xstream or something similar

30691
post	put
let me know if you need more detail and i will see if i can put together a step-by-step blog post but hopefully this gets you off on the right direction

30699
mouse	keyboard
manipulate with the keyboard and or mouse

30819
set	bag
this gives the bare minimum that is required - if you later wanted some other form of storage like a bag or set or tree or whatnot your contract would remain intact

30931
kde	gnome
i m looking for a way that is standard works with gnome and kde based systems and can be done automatic when my program is installed or run for the first time

30939
kde	gnome
2 gnome and kde have different methods to accomplish this

30949
salt	md5
md5 or sha1 + salt

30952
salt	md5
if you use md5 or sha1 use a salt to avoid rainbow table hacks

30964
ssl	https
we have an external service that is currently accessible via the http port 80 non-ssl and https port 443 ssl addresses

30967
salt	md5
i second the vote for md5 or sha with a salt

30971
hash	salt
you need to be using an uni-directional hash algorithm like sha-1 suggested above with a salt

30979
hash	salt
a salt is a constant value that you mix in with the input before using the hash function

30995
pop-up	dialog
occasionally while attempting to save a crystal report that i m working on in vs2008 a dialog titled file save failed pop-up saying the document could not be saved in c users phillip appdata local temp xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx .rpt

31042
perforce	svn
i use perforce right now and for some reason i like svn better

31042
perforce	svn
personally i feel like svn s price tag makes up for anything it lacks compared to perforce

31059
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
in vs .net when you are selecting a folder for a project a dialog that looks like an openfiledialog or savefiledialog is displayed but is set up to accept only folders

31119
getter	setter
static functions often require you to use setter and getter which clutter a class s api and makes things more complicated in general

31211
inherited	properties
this is totally off the cuff but you could make the user control expose some protected methods and properties to return validation information and then have a testing user control inherited it

31238
accessor	properties
the thing i don t know how to do is take the string prop1 in the config file and turn that into the actual properties accessor in the code

31285
ubuntu	linux
i am using vmware tools for ubuntu hardy but for some reason vmware-install.pl finds fault with my linux headers

31288
getter	setter
core data also gets you features like visual modeling of your entities automatic generation of property getter setter fine-grained control over migration from one schema version to another and so on

31295
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
are there any good libraries that don t create this problem in safari but are also good for internet explorer and firefox and hopefully opera

31304
disk	ram
as long as you have the resources separate hard disk for the virtual machine sufficient ram i don t see why you would have any problems

31332
ccl	clisp
sbcl ext saveinitmem in clisp and ccl save-application in

31358
implements	extends
in my example my foo class extends thread i then implements the run method which is where the code that you would like to run in a thread goes

31372
put	get
edit i should also point out that you can put some of the code in c c++ if you want to get around the gil as well

31425
postgresql	mysql
the long answer expanding on what the op said is to be more compatible with apache and mysql postgresql

31425
x86	64bit
they are all 64bit apache is a fat binary with ppc ppc64 x86 and x86 and x86_64 the others just straight 64bit

31446
entities	entitymanager
in my program i eventually have to call flush on the entitymanager which would persist all changes from attached entities to the underyling database but i want to exclude specific objects

31572
udp	tcp
is there a way that we can broadcast out messages like this like udp will let you do while keeping guaranteed delivery like tcp

31625
getter	setter
i use to be a fan of the java and worse c# practice of making getter and setter get set properties throughout an object

31625
getter	setter
you really only want to add as much complexity as is required to get the job done and getter and setter while simple in themselves add complexity in heaps when added in mass

31648
mbunit	nunit
i used to use nunit but now tend to use mbunit for two key features

31648
mbunit	nunit
another nice aspect of mbunit is that its syntax is nearly identical to nunit so if you have a whole test bed already in place under nunit you can just switch out the references without the need to change any very much

31652
collabnet	svn
svn solved both those is easy to set up i use collabnet server and tortoisesvn client although there are two good visual studio plugins visualsvn - commercial and ankhsvn - open source easy to use and administer and well documented

31768
udp	tcp
almost all games have a need for the fast-reacting properties and to a lesser extent the connectionless properties of udp and the reliability of tcp

31783
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
take a look at sctp which has a combination of tcp and udp features

31799
ienumerable	icollection
i ran into problems with a couple of classes i have that implement ienumerable and icollection t

31827
kde	gnome
i thought that both gnome and kde maybe only 4+

31835
bazaar	git
the distributed nature of git and the option of private temporary checkins assuming i ve understood what i ve read is attractive - hence my looking at bazaar

31921
pylons	turbogears	web.py	pylons	web.py	turbogears
why haven t anyone talked about turbogears web.py and pylons

32027
ant	cruisecontrol	nant	cruisecontrol
i m new to nant but have some experience with ant and cruisecontrol

32035
folder	directory
another alternative approach you may want to consider could be to have a folder that contains symlinks to each of your projects or frequently-used directory

32049
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the scriptmanager allows a script to run on startup inside of an updatepanel

32145
getter	setter
i see a lot of debate about getter setter class methods and is it better to just access simple property variables directly or should every class have explicit get set methods defined blah blah blah

32145
inherited	subclassing
since you can t have true multiple inherited in php you can make your subclassing have a propertyhandler instance as a private variable

32145
getter	setter
another good argument against handling getter and setter this way is that it makes it really hard to document

32146
post	get
i did get a bit of a shiver at the similarity of the post though..

32198
udp	tcp
i am looking for any strategies people use when implementing server applications that service client tcp or udp requests design patterns implementation techniques best practices etc

32203
button	checkbox
off the top of my head i think you have to check the type attribute of the checkbox to determine if it s a radio button

32219
getter	setter
i like having methods instead of just using public fields as well but my problem with php s default implementation using __get and __set or your custom implementation is that you aren t establishing getter and setter on a per-property basis

32219
getter	setter
my problem with this is that adding more logic later requires that you add blanket logic that applies to all properties accessed with the getter setter or that you use if or switch statements to evaluate which property you re accessing so that you can apply specific logic

32222
postgresql	mysql
or use something like mysql postgresql etc on linux

32310
public	protected
i have a rule that i only use assertions in public and protected methods

32356
getter	setter
my problem with this is that adding more logic later requires that you add blanket logic that applies to all properties accessed with the getter setter or that you use if or switch statements to evaluate which property you re accessing so that you can apply specific logic

32376
disk	ram
ideally this library supports the b-tree index to be stored manipulated as a disk file so that large trees can be built using a configurable ie minimal ram footprint

32448
versioning	upgrade
the product-group i work for is currently using gcc 3.4.6 we know it is ancient for a large low-level c-code base and want to upgrade to a later versioning

32448
versioning	upgrade
we are however very scared of c-compiler bugs for a good reason historically and wonder if anyone has insight to which versioning we should upgrade to

32477
affinity	processors
at that point you could experiment with using native api s to give the underlying native thread processors affinity

32484
put	get
another possibility is to put the if statement within your logging function you get less code this way but at the expense of some extra function calls

32507
getter	setter
however it s compact and uses the reflection classes to only add getter setter for properties you have already set won t add new ones

32507
getter	setter
simply adding the getter setter explicitly will add more complex functionality

32511
dxcore	coderush
there s also a dxcore plugin the foundation upon which coderush refactor pro are built that does current-line highlighting

32521
prng	random
personally i do think there are places where constant random data is useful in testing - after you think you ve done all your carefully-thought-out corners using stimuli from a prng can sometimes find other things

32717
inherited	properties
i just finished setting up an out-of-place build system for our existing c++ code using inherited properties sheets a feature that seems to be specific to the visual c++ product

32717
inherited	properties
building out-of-place requires that many of the project settings be changed and the inherited properties sheets allowed me to change all the necessary settings just by attaching a properties sheet to the project

32744
gmail	hotmail
first server gmail to second server hotmail

32744
gmail	hotmail
however i don t understand how gmail server transfers the message to the hotmail server

32744
gmail	hotmail
so the big question is when i click send mail sends my message to my gmail server how does my gmail server forward the message to say a hotmail server so my friend can recieve it

32765
gmail	hotmail
step 2 to 3 gmail to hotmail would normally happen through smtp or esmtp - extended smtp

32775
gmail	hotmail
knowing ip address of hotmail server gmail server will sent the message using smtp protocol and will wait for an answer

32775
gmail	hotmail
if hotmail server goes down gmail server wiil try to resend the message it will depend on server software configuration

32779
rundll32	shell32.dll
rundll32 shell32.dll control_rundll systemroot system32 timedate.cpl z 1

32783
folder	directory
this recurses directory only copies files that have been modified and suppresses the message to replace an existing file the list of files folder in backupexclude.txt will not be copied

32797
wan	lan
you should be able to block wan connections to the server on the router and still leave it open to accepting lan connection

32813
gmail	hotmail
also it would be possible to send the message without using gmail server by sending it directly from your pc to hotmail using smtp

32866
button	checkbox
manageofflinestatus.aspx contains an offline online checkbox textarea for offline message and an update button

32867
gmail	hotmail
you might also be interested to know why the gmail to hotmail link uses smtp just like your thunderbird client

32867
gmail	hotmail
the historical aspect is that in the old days the link between gmail and hotmail was likely to be intermittent

32878
firefox	safari
tested on safari firefox 3 ie 7

32914
degrafa	flex
i d like to render to svg data in a swf at runtime not in flex - not using degrafa - how would i go about doing that

32925
int	double
so you know instantly when looking at dpvarname that it s a pointer to a double and that lvarname is a long int

32986
for-loop	loops
i know that if you have a loops that modifies the count of the items in loops using the nsenumerator on a set is the best way to make sure your code blows up however i would like to understand the performance tradeoffs between the nsenumerator class and just an old school for-loop

32996
pagemethods	registerstartupscript
traditionally you were supposed to register scripts via pagemethods such as registerstartupscript and page.registerclientscriptblock

33010
comparator	comparable
if your class is also comparable the equals and comparator methods should be consistent too

33019
width	height
i halfway looked at swffit but the height and width sometimes but mainly height would be dynamic - swffit let s you declare a maxheight but that number would be constantly changing...maybe i could figure out how to set it dynamically

33031
public	protected
the design guidelines that you linked specifically state that they only apply to static public and protected fields

33031
public	protected
i m not positive but i m relatively confident that private members are not considered when the compiler checks for cls compliance because only public protected members come in to play there the idea is what if someone who uses a language that doesn t allow the _ character tries to use your library

33035
for-loop	loops
the one step that you save over the classic for-loop is not having to call objectatindex i each time inside loops

33071
vmware	virtualbox
perhaps this can be easily accomplished with some virtualization software like vmware or virtualbox

33104
jquery	jqmodal
at the moment website a opens a modal window containing website b using a jquery plug-in called jqmodal

33133
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux	mint	live-cd
creating your own custom ubuntu 7.10 or linux mint 4.0 live-cd with remastersys

33159
pop-up	dialog
when you do this the ide pop-up a warning dialog that there is an unsafe entry point in your project - but you can ignore this and you can make it not appear at all by editing a registry entry evidently

33159
put	get
now to get the output path to refer to it - unfortunately when you add a string like myspecialpath debug to the output path field and save the project the and chars are converted to hex and your file get s put in a debug directory under a directory named myspecialpath

33159
inherited	properties
sadly this is more work and a less elegant solution than the properties sheet inherited mechanism in c++

33236
xctest	ocunit
xcode includes xctest which is similar to ocunit an objective-c unit testing framework and has full support for running xctest-based unit tests as part of your project s build process

33236
xctest	ocunit
despite using ocunit rather than xctest the concepts are largely the same

33313
allocator	stl
stl classes by default allocate their internal buffers from the heap although these classes also allow custom allocator that allow a user to specify an alternate location to allocate from - a shared memory pool

33337
int	boolean
it appears from the msdn article you linked to it was provided to allow for nullable boolean types prior to the nullable int

33466
allocator	stl
the default allocator for stl containers uses operator new and delete so it s whatever those route to for the type being contained

33486
stdout	stderr
when you log in interactively stdin stdout and stderr are set up for you and so your script works

33502
firefox	safari
and it only fully works in safari 3 and partly in firefox 3 although there is an experimental port to internet explorer as well

33585
sharepoint	splist
not sure on exactly which web service to use but if you are in a position where you can use the sharepoint .net api dlls then using the splist and splibrary.items.add is really easy

33592
folder	directory
it has a task for building the app calling msbuild to do the heavy lifting in compiling and then uses ruby to zip the build output and copy to a specified location create a folder in virtual directory and copy the build output to see the build results in action

33602
opera	firefox
it works in saffari and firefox 3 opera 9 and people are developing support for ie

33626
children	parent
the stream functionality is great because it makes merging no brainier as all changes from parent streams are automatically propagated to all children

33679
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
should never go outside the testing phase then leave the system throw it or if there are side-effects reaching that point check for null at the beginning and throw either illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception

33847
bazaar	git	bazaar	perforce
use a source control system â subversion perforce git mercurial bazaar etc

33854
hide	show
one potential way to solve it is to hide and show the div whenever you change the content that in turn changes the height

33881
opera	firefox
mainly in opera and firefox also in ie7 but not quite as bad

33891
vpn	lan
cifs is really geared towards lan with a reasonably calm trafic so you have zero chance to not suffer intermittent lag accessing a share through a vpn

33919
opera	firefox
viewed in ie 8.0 opera 9 firefox 3

33940
post	get
when the cookie resets during an asynch post back from ajax you will get this error

33942
put	get
what if you put the ellipses in a div with a low z-index so that when it moves to the left for shorter lines they get covered up by a background image or something

33957
superclass	subclassing
after having used them extensively on a couple of projects i feel they tend to lead to code that is satisfyingly dry to write but very hard to read and maintain later because functionality is spread across so many different places and subclassing are so dependent on every implementation detail of the superclass and mixins

33967
wan	lan
it has to be called on the machine you are interested in - the mac is not transferred across network boundaries lan and wan

34018
chgrp	chmod
sure chgrp apache the_writable_file and chmod g+w the_writable_file

34054
restrict	shared
unfortunately in shared hosts that use mod_php there is no way to restrict access to secure files to your web app and login user

34104
yacc	bison
flex and bison are the new lex and yacc though

34115
firefox	safari
but you get lucky in firefox ie and safari with their corresponding blocking of 3rd party cookies because they violate rfc2965 in multiple situations

34195
opera	safari
by the way it s a little buggy in some versions of safari and opera - check out this quirksmode page for more

34227
sorting	filtering
on the search results page there are a ton of ui controls for filtering sorting the search results to find what you are looking for

34227
sorting	filtering
this latency is fine in case where the user is initially filtering sorting their results.

34295
emacs	aquamacs
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like

34310
versioning	upgrade
when i had problems with lc.exe in the past most times it was because the licensed component was upgrade the versioning number increased but the licx file still contained the old versioning

34338
phpunit	simpletest
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

34377
pop-up	dialog
it will pop-up a dialog with a couple of filtering options and then show you what s out of date

34429
next	except
obviously the next prissioner must skip the already known boxes except for the last choice if the box which contains his number is already known

34443
padding	overlapping
you could also use a background image on the li elements with a padding to keep the text from overlapping it

34465
spweb	spsite
the using statements are to ensure that you do not create a memory leak as the spsite and spweb are unmanaged objects

34474
phpunit	simpletest
i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line

34474
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest is nice but the only thing it really has over phpunit in my opinion is the web runner

34474
phpunit	simpletest
the reasons i like phpunit are that it integrates with other php developer tools such as phing as does simpletest phpundercontrol and xinc

34566
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

34566
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

34566
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

34583
actionscript	mxml
better choices to try would be -incremental which only recompiles the parts that have changed and -keep-generated-actionscript which stops the compiler from deleting the actionscript files it has generated from your application s mxml files

34589
bazaar	cvs
i ve used visual sourcesafe hopefully never again cvs subversion and bazaar

34589
bazaar	git
bazaar is the one i ve used that does this but the other major distributed vcs systems git and mercurial also do

34600
switching	screens
since we are not in the same place most of the time the only option is to use some kind of screens sharing and skype to have one of us drive while the other consults and then switching

34758
toolchain	binutils
you can use the nm -g tool from the binutils toolchain

34828
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode should always be in sync with equals and equals isn t necessarily guaranteed to check for all of the fields in your object there s certain situations where you want that to not be the case

34876
jboss	glassfish
jboss or glassfish are good alternatives

35016
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
the reason i asked is that perforce provides a completely different way to create branches from svn or cvs

35018
getter	setter
if you re simply looking to expose a collection on your instance then using a getter setter to a private member variable seems like the most sensible solution to me your first proposed option

35063
postgresql	mysql
it is really much easier to install ubuntu on an old junk computer with postgresql or mysql

35092
pop-up	dialog
what i m not sure of is how to get rid of the dialog box that pop-up that asks for your confirmation

35103
hash	md5
i d like to do this by storing an md5 hash of the file inside the executable

35126
decoder	encoder
which microcontroller pins are connected to the encoder and what is the code you re currently using to decoder the pulses

35154
getter	setter
i never expose a private collection property because other parts of the program can change it without parent noticing so that in the getter method i return an array with the objects of the collection and in the setter method i call a clearall over the collection and then an addall

35177
jquery	scriptaculous
but i found that while mochikit has very expressive syntax it didn t feel nearly as comfortable to me as prototype scriptaculous or jquery did for me

35218
pop-up	dialog
for example checking in code shouldn t pop-up a modal dialog

35229
updatepanel	onclientclick
i would leave the onclientclick and set it as the trigger for the updatepanel

35248
firefox	safari
firefox does not have this problem haven t tested safari yet

35317
pop-up	dialog
the dialog box that pop-up doesn t automatically gain focus so pressing enter serves no purpose

35327
debian	linux
i describes the foundation for almost any linux distribution and is officially endorsed by debian and the linux standards base lsb

35333
typedef	struct
same goes for using the typedef of the struct

35417
typedef	struct
because you ve already made a typedef for the struct because you used the s1 version you should write

35486
width	height
what is the best way to create fluid width height rounded corners with jquery

35490
udp	tcp
in one of the answers to broadcast like udp with the reliability of tcp a user mentions the spread messaging api

35561
radeditor	radgrid
in previous releases they were definitely a bit sluggish i m thinking specifically of their radgrid and radeditor

35575
versioning	upgrade
you should also upgrade to the rtm versioning of fxcop 1.36 the beta will not automatically detect the newer versioning

35584
put	get
get the book linq in action it is an easy read for a coding book and really teaches you how to use linq and the new features of .net 3.5 some of the cool parts they put in for the language

35599
folder	directory
i have heard that in a unix system the number of files in a given directory will not slow file access while on windows direct file access will degrade as the # of files increase in the given folder true

35601
filesystems	ntfs
i don t know enough about the guts of the filesystems to answer the first except when i read the first descriptions of ntfs it sounded an awful lot like the berkley fast filesystems

35605
filesystems	ntfs
windows primarily has had support for fat16 32 and their own filesystems ntfs

35608
filesystems	ntfs
well the nix filesystems do a far better job of actual file managment than fat16 32 or ntfs

35627
filesystems	ntfs
when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above

disk	ram
for example if you move your program files to a second disk you probably have to refer to them as d program files while in unix usr bin could be a hard drive a network drive a cd rom or ram

35636
getter	setter
the only thing that changes this is if a property has a getter and or setter attribute specified

35667
nltk	opennlp
there is a python port of parts of opennlp called nltk but i don t have much experience with it yet

35674
ready	each
if you have a lots of parallel development you ll want to have branches for each of the efforts but that ll also require more discipline making sure your branches are tested and ready to merge back

35704
folder	directory
if your concern is in how to write apps that can be moved from machine to machine without losing settings you should probably write all your configuration to a file in the same directory as the executable and not touch the windows registry or create any dot directory in the home folder of the user that s running the program on linux or mac

35734
post	get
post your questions if you get stuck along the way and we ll be happy to help

35758
haskell	ocaml
you can sort of imagine this getting nasty in c# or c++ but in haskell ml and ocaml this is central to the language design and syntax so coding style supports it in a much more convenient manner via pattern matching

35762
kde	gnome
are frameworks such as kde gnome usable for this objective or is better to use something more generic other than x

35762
kde	gnome
i feel like if i chose one of gnome or kde i m closing the market out for a chunk of the linux market who have chosen one over the other

35768
kde	gnome
gnome apps work on kde desktops and vice versa

35770
kde	gnome
it s also important to make the distinction between gnome libraries and gtk and likewise kde libraries and qt

35777
int	boolean
and it is easy to end up with messy code that has methods returning either int or boolean or object or some sort under unknown circumstances

35848
width	height
in my vb6.0 application some of the mdi child formâ s height is 17000 and width is 13000

35848
width	height
now i want to set the same form size in vb.net forms but it allows maximum form width 1036 height 780 for resolution 1024x768

35852
vb.net	vb6
i think the vb6 units are not the same with the vb.net one

35867
jar	war
for persistence.xml specifically you can put a persistence unit in a separate jar which you can deploy separately from your web application war or both together in an ear archive depending on what your application server supports

35911
pull	push
thanks to the fact it doesn t need to communicate with a central server constantly pretty much every command runs in less than a second obviously git push pull fetch are slower simply because they have to initalise ssh connections

35922
gtk	ncurses
i ve played around with gtk tk wxpython cocoa ncurses and others

35922
gtk	ncurses
gtk tk wx ncurses all seem to basically be direct-ports of the appropriate c libraries and cocoa basically mandates using both pyobjc and interface builder both of which i dislike

35925
kde	kubuntu
or if you re using kubuntu kde

35935
wxpython	pygtk
there are were several other attempts to create a very pythonic gui as a layer on top of pygtk or wxpython such as wax and pygui which seem to be stuck at various degrees of being complete

35946
min	max
that gave me a min and max lat and a min and max long

35960
post	get
a modicum of security by obscurity - it s slightly more work to tamper with post submissions than get

35960
post	get
caching and resubmit rules are more restrictive for post than get

35960
post	get
different browsers have different max lengths for get requests - but none of them are as large as post

35967
freebsd	linux
if you have spare physical resources and have the technical skills and experience to maintain production machines running different operating systems i d recommend going running lighttpd on either linux or freebsd

36010
actionscript	mxml
one way to separate the mxml and actionscript for a component into separate files is by doing something similar to the asp.net 1.x code behind model

36010
actionscript	mxml	imperative	declarative
in this model the declarative part the mxml in this case is a subclass of the imperative part the actionscript

36108
width	height
a resizable gui would be quite horrible if you had to play with height width minheight minwidth etc

36108
width	height
can you bind your height and width properties to the grid cell you occupy

36197
post	get	srp	principles
i ve looked around online codecampserver etc... and they all seem to suffer the same issue wherein controller methods violate srp single responsibility principles pretty consistently - such as a controller method that simply renders the view if the request is a get but updates the model if it s a post

36219
lxml	libxml2
it seems that lxml does not expose this libxml2 feature grepping the source only turns up some #defines for the error handling

36219
lxml	libxml2
from the catalog implementation in libxml2 page it seems possible that the transparent handling through installation in etc xml catalog may still work in lxml but if you need more than that you can always abandon lxml and use the default python bindings which do expose the catalog functions

36234
gridview	repeater
if your textbox was in a repeater or gridview then this method would work

36344
g++	gcc
this is on a mac 10.4.11 my googling turned up some hints that this can happen if gcc is called instead of g++ but i believe that is set up correctly

36398
hbase	hypertable
since hbase and hypertable are all about performance being modeled on google s bigtable they sound like they would certainly be much faster than hive at the cost of functionality and a higher learning curve they don t have joins or the sql-like syntax

36419
post	get
url params shows get and post variables

36425
codeigniter	cakephp

36455
free	malloc
older k r 2nd ed. and other c-language texts i have read that discuss the implementation of a dynamic memory allocator in the style of malloc and free usually also mention in passing something about data type alignment restrictions

36466
int	chars
this is because the compiler enforces a 4 byte alignment for int but only 1 byte for chars

yacc	bison
is there a good yacc bison type lalr parser generator for .net

36718
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
the javaworld article why getter and setter methods are evil article also might be of interest to you in thinking about when not to implement accessor and mutators methods

36734
getter	setter
it s like defensive programming - someday getter and setter may be helpful and it doesn t cost a lot to create use them

36734
getter	setter
in practice most fields have simple getter and setter

36761
wxpython	pyqt
i think wxpython is nice but it s too limited and pyqt is well qt

36856
emacs	gedit
i haven t settled on an ide but if i m not using gedit i ll use emacs as my editor

36891
getter	setter
then there s little point in wrapping them up in getter and setter

36891
getter	setter
getter and setter will only slow you down

36891
getter	setter
this should really use getter and setter

36928
cvs	svn
svn tracks resources on a per-file basis just as cvs does so it can do sticky to the same effect

36944
getter	setter
it may seem sensible to omit getter setter

36945
lisp	scheme
however scheme common lisp and many other languages have what s called lexical scoping - in addition to storing the operation + x y we also store the namespace at that particular point

36997
comparator	comparable
sort both lists by id ascending using custom comparator if objects in lists aren t comparable

37024
public	protected
also some tools some o r mappers expect object data to be represented by properties and do not recognize public or protected member variables

37025
inherited	properties
they have no particular advantage over protected methods properties once upon a time they might have a slight performance advantage and they were also used more in an era when very deep inherited was in fashion which it isn t at the moment

37103
width	height
i have a container div with a fixed width and height with overflow hidden

37114
gif	png
modern browsers also support png and gif images

37162

serializable	deserialization
xml serializable deserialization largely without coding

37364
width	height
you don t need to call getimagesize to get the width height for imagecopyresmapled

37374
inherited	properties
previously we had being using a base dal class that implemented a cache manager properties that all our dal classes inherited from but now we don t have that

37384
getter	setter
i don t believe that they are ever necessary however because any use of a protected member variable can be replicated using a private member variable and a couple of getter and setter

37391
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
what i m trying to do though is create a class that could represent an arbitrarily large binary number and be able to perform simple arithmetic operations on two of them add subtract multiplying divide

37400
debian	linux
i d recommend basing your system on debian - the apt system has become the de-facto way to quickly install and update programs on linux

37400
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is debian based with an emphasis on usability and compatibility

37408
daemons	launchd
the use of a unix-domain socket means that the erlang daemons could be launchd on-demand by launchd and the cocoa front-end could find the path to the socket to use via an environment variable

37408
daemons	launchd
ultimately this means that the entire process of the front-end opening the socket to communicate with the daemons launchd launchd the daemons and the daemons responding to the communication can be secure even if the front-end and the daemons run at different privilege levels

37409
pop-up	dialog

37920
wtl	atl
the dialog itself is an atl wtl cpropertysheetimpl

37973
put	get
i find that a little annoying to use because they need a few more clicks or keypresses to get to but at least you can get the job done they tend to put things like input masks in here - regex numerical etc

38000
bazaar	git
gitty will essentially be bazzarx with the bazaar backend ripped out and a git backend put in instead and any ui tweaks made for git differences from bazaar ie hashes instead of version# s etc

38017
ffmpeg	libavformat
ffmpeg more precisely libavcodec and libavformat that comes with ffmpeg open- source multimedia utility

38087
mouseup	mousedown
you need the control to handle three events mousedown mouse move and mouseup

38097
datamapper	activerecord
this is more of a how-to-implement tip but i started dabbling with creating an activerecord datamapper implementation in php and quickly ran into many hurdles with array-like access

38097
arrayiterator	arrayobject
eventually i found the spl extensions to php and particularly arrayobject and arrayiterator

38139

do-something is cpu bound and i have a nice shiny 4 core processors

38183
seam	appfuse
kariem i can t use seam appfuse hasn t ejb session beans

instead of returning a new page immediately as the result of an http post return a 303 result code that redirects to another page that is a get that gets the contents you would like to show

38332
vmware	esx
vmware virtual machines are portable across different vmware products although you may need to use their converter tool to go from some hosted virtual machines to esx or esxi

38384
put	get
i guess they put compatability first and are now trying to get the performance up to par with other ruby implementations out there

38421
post	put
i m concerned about making sure i have put in place appropriate measures so that only my ajax calls can post data

38470
getter	setter
the only catch iirc was making sure dispids id attribute were correct on automation interfaces dispinterfaces for property getter setter - there was some invariant that tlibimp expected but midl didn t guarantee

38519
post	get
http post get etc

38543
qtkit	quicktime
there are layers on top of it like audio toolbox audio queue services quicktime and qtkit that you can use if you want a simplified api for common tasks

it also contains a link to download the parallel ctp and you can of course browse through the rest of the blog post to get an idea of what the ctp is meant to do and how the programming model works

38769
vb.net	vb6
the application can be written in perl vb6 vb.net or c# but must be easily scheduled from a windows based server

38809
free	malloc
graeme s suggestion of custom malloc free is a good idea

38809
free	malloc
for example if it is always in a block of the same size say 64 bytes then change your malloc free pair to always allocate 64 byte chunks in their own page

38839
lisp	scheme
common lisp code can be converted into scheme code with relative ease

38839
lisp	scheme
however going from scheme to common lisp can cause a few headaches

39033
google-chrome	firefox
but the new internet explorer 8 beta 2 and the just announced google-chrome browser are heading in that direction so i suppose firefox will be heading there too

39092
direct3d	directx
edit - yes i really meant direct3d not directx thanks to graham.reeds for clarification

39169
resx	csproj
add that code to the complile item group of a csproj file then replace the paths with your actual paths to the resx files and you sould be able to open them

39228
stdout	stderr
i needed more advanced stuff like stdout and stderr so i used the open4 gem

39249
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
monodevelop - link text this is based on sharpdevelop 0.9 if i remember it correctly

39267
free	malloc
the container itself is allocated where you decide it can be the stack the heap an object s member etc but the memory it uses is by default as others described taken on the free store managed through new and delete which is not the same as the heap managed through malloc free

39309
filesystems	hfs
the setfile tool sets a custom hfs filesystems property on the directory to tell finder that it is an app but giving it a .app extension serves the same purpose

39449
post	get
if you get the output stream then i believe it sends it as a post as it assumes you ll be writing data to it you may need to call setdooutput true for the output stream to work

39469
ienumerable	ilist
depending on how you need to filter the collection you may want to create a class that implements ilist or ienumerable if that works for you but that mucks about with the indexing and access to only return the values you want

39496
ienumerable	ienumerator
in earlier versions you had to create your own ienumerable and ienumerator objects to do stuff like this

39503
drive	createfile
also you can write to the bootsector at least as administrator on xp by call createfile with the device name of the drive that contains the mbr

39503

39786
cvs	svn
have a look in the svn manual here scroll down to svn keywords or here for cvs

39858
jython	pypy	cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
note this has become a popular answer but it is important to point out that if y has any non-string keys the fact that this works at all is an abuse of a cpython implementation detail and it does not work in python 3 or in pypy ironpython or jython

39867
stdout	stderr
if i run this as cron job works fine i see encrypting file in the log but the file doesn t get encrypted and gpg silent fails with no stdout stderr output

39868
superclass	subclassing
it may be best to subclassing jdialog so that you can just add the doannimation logic to the setvisible .. or show method before calling the superclass implementation

39917
stdout	stderr
redirect the stderr to stdout for gpg and then redirect stdout to a file to inspect any error messages which might get printed you can do this a command line

39945
put	get
to get right unless you put in extra restrictions like using only immutable data

39948
apache-poi	excellibrary
i ended up doing this a lot when working with the apache-poi excellibrary

39963
salt	md5
that s the login a colon apr1 the salt and 1000 times md5 encoded as base64
