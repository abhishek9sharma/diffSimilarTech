width	height
you can do this by wrapping your wrappanel in a scrollviewer but then binding the height and width of the inner panel to the height and width of the viewport of the scrollviewer so it stretches and contracts with the rest of the screen

45305783
width	height
i ve also added minimum height and width to my sample which ensures that the scrollbars appear once the wrap panel is pushed smaller than it s min dimensions

45305928
children	parent
some elements are parent of 0..n children elements themselves being parent of 0..n other elements

45305928
children	parent
the top level type has no parent and the bottom level elements have no children

45305928
children	parent
the idea is that when deriving from the parent base class you have to provide the type of children itself depending on the type of the parent

hash-collision	key
lookdict will use key s hash value to locate the key iterating over a list of possible key with identical hash value comparing first by address then by calling key s equivalence operator s see excellent comments in objects dictobject.c for more details on hash-collision resolution in python s implementation of open addressing

45306268
hash-collision	key
lookdict will search for the second nan by looking at its hash 0 then trying to resolve hash-collision by iterating over key with the same hash and comparing the key by identity address they are different then by invoking the expensive pyobject_richcomparebool do_richcompare which in turn calls float_richcompare which compares floats just as c does

45306272

i also consulted an ex-colleague who tried this and reckoned that it was much easier to make a new project and copy the necessary code rather than trying to manually migrate the conflicting pieces of code that arouse after doing an upgrade

45306317
width	height
given the fact in this case where a div with fixed width height sets the boundaries for the image here is a simple sample of that

45306317

it s a good practice not to have a function in ng-if ng-show and ng-hide because it s a performance hit

45307061
button	checkbox
however if i click the settings button and then either don t check the hide widget heading checkbox or check it and uncheck it again and then click submit i get the same true value displayed in the console debug which indicates that the code inside the function is running regardless of whether the watched element changes or not

mouse	keyboard
if i maximize then restore the window then press alt then press down to get the window menu and select move and then move the window around with the keyboard it stays stuck in bogus not-mazimized mode even though the window is being moved so it seems the only way to unstick it is to move it with the mouse

put	get
the maven-pmd-plugin allows to get ruleset files from the local filesystem with an absolute path only which makes it unflexible to use and from classpath which practically means for a multi-module project that rulesets are put into a separate project which is build by a maven parent or aggregator to that it s available for its siblings

45352217
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
the first operations in the acronym must always be done before the later operations in the acronym except for multiplication and division in which you just go from left to right in the equation since they are considered to have an equal priority and addition and subtraction same scenario as multiplication and division

45352641
int	chars
whereas we can pass a chars value to another method whose parameter is of int type

45352641

that s because there is an implicit conversion available from chars to int in an invocation context

45352641
unsigned	short
although char and short are the same size char is unsigned whereas short is signed

45352641
int	chars
the conversion from chars to int is a widening primitive conversion jls 5.1.2 whereas the conversion from chars to short is a narrowing primitive conversion jls 5.1.3

45352641
int	chars
in addition to a possible loss of information about the magnitude of the numeric value this may cause the resulting value to be a negative number even though chars represent 16-bit unsigned int values

children	parent
on angular i created a component that on ngoninit calls a function loadchildrencomponents so every time it loads it does a for-loop with the children building the tree on a table i used the componentfactoryresolver to create a copy of the same component and i used it s own viewcontainerref to use as reference so the children data will be placed below the parent

45357212

qgraphicsscene	qwidget
if there is some initialization code in your constructor that creates new objects for instance a customwidget qwidget that creates a new customscene qgraphicsscene but you d like to pickle or copy the scene from one customwidget to a new one then one way is to make a parameter in your __init__ and say

on top of the above in the inner loops where you are finding the titles you are practically traversing the replacementobject for each cc this means at least you are traversing this arrays 700 times and to make things worse you are using the array.indexof method to find the index by key just fyi in the browser we use for add-ins latest ie this is the most expensive way of traversing an arrays in fact is 90 slower than if you do a for-loop trying to find the indesx given the key this simple change theoretically will be 90 faster in latest ie if you want to keep this logic

45374943
width	height
my eventual intention is to have the height and width of each button set to the smallest dimension of the button so that it is always displayed as a circle in the centre of the button but that s something for later unless this extra information allows for a better solution.

45375576
int	chars
you cannot store a long chars sequence an std string inside an int or inside a long int because the size of a chars is usually 8-bit and the length of an int is usually 32-bit therefore a 32-bit long int can store only 4 chars

45375586
equals	gethashcode
implementing the actual equals logic which you already have in the list lookup would also negate the need for the duplicate gethashcode method

45375595

it sounds like your coworker performed a force push perhaps because they didn t understand that they needed to pull and merge before pushing

45375797
int	double
the reason your estimate is double what it should be might be because your random function or hashing function is returning a signed int that is always positive and a leading zero is always present

45375810

45376166
free	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
long answer one call to malloc calloc realloc null ... 1 allows requires to not leak memory exactly one call to free passing the value to the latter as returned by one of the former

45376166
free	realloc
successive calls to realloc not passing null do not increment the sum of necessary calls to free

45376166
realloc	malloc
passing null to realloc makes realloc count like a call to malloc

45376179
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
internally both malloc and calloc should do the same thing to allocate memory just as realloc does

45376179
memset	calloc
the only difference being a call to memset in calloc

45376179
free	calloc
so yes memory you allocate with calloc must be passed to free if you want to avoid a memory leak

all elements should be the same width and height of the viewport window but #canvas-blur has the css transform scale 1.1

45377054
cpu	processors
for example opening a compute context in a uva regime requires among other things that virtual allocations be requested of the host os and that the memory maps of all processors in the system all visible gpus plus the cpu be harmonized so that everyone has a unique space to work in and the numerical value of a 64-bit pointer in the space can be used to uniquely determine ownership or meaning introspection of that pointer

so super clsfour self .__init__ will return the clsthree.__init__ method

45378362
super	self
the super clsthree self in the clsthree class will - given it is an clsfour object work with the same mro since it takes the mro from the self

implements	extends
taking the title of your question literally you cannot achieve what you want by extends a collector that returns a set because the third generic type parameter of collector specifies the result type of the reduction operation so a can never be a subclass of unless r implements set

post	get
the method is post but i m manually adding a get parameter to the url string depending on which button the user clicks

45379493

45379525
button	checkbox
i have basically no experience in php but have managed to make my list with checkbox and a download script attached to the button that when it is selected should start the download but doesn t it does however clear the boxes.if possible i would also like to store a copy of this zip to a folder on the server in case the user would like to re-download in a certain amount of time

post	get
if i were you i would keep get and post separate

45379971
post	get
if get and post share code then i would move that code to a method of the requesthandler that can be called from both get and post or move the shared code into another class i find a lot of my requesthandlers just call methods on my model classes

45379971
post	get
if you still want one method to replace both get and post then instead of using dispatch i recommend you set the handler_method for the route see here in the docs

45379971
post	get
i would advise against handling these requests entirely in the dispatch method as that is supposed to at some point call the handler method which defaults to get post etc

45379971
post	get
based on the http method but you can set your own handler method to handle get and post and whatever else

45379971
post	get
i like to think of dispatch as pre- and post-processing to occur before after calling get post whatever handler method you specify

min	max
just be sure that all returns here is parentid and childid should it be returning other columns you will need to either add them to the group by or apply some sort of aggregator to it so that it can still group max min count...

45380502
min	max
this would take the maximum id when rows matched which would normally be your latest entry if you want the earliest entry just change max to min

easier still in this case is to use a while loop to remove the last child as long as the parent has any children

45384209
implements	extends
but since index implements cellobject and employee extends index it should work

45384225
qimage	qwidget
while a qimage instance isn t a widget object and hence is never itself rendered by qt it can be drawn to an ordinary qwidget object

45384225
qimage	qwidget	qimage	qpainterpath

how can i move the parent and all children by dragging either the parent or one of the children elements

45384525
hide	show
in a looping situation modifying the hidden property on multiple graphs first before calling validatenow once at the end of the loop is significantly faster than calling the show hide method at each iteration

45384543
width	height
i m in the middle of working on a code that wants me to incorporate an inputted dimension as the width and height of the image displayed

45384543
width	height
the dimension would be written as 300x250 and the height and width of the image would change accordingly to that

45384543
width	height
i want something like 300x250 to be understood as width 300px and height 250px

spaces	delimiter
how can i import the contents of the file into a matlab cell array where each row is a line separated by spaces delimiter

45384654
median	minimum
i m not sure this comparison makes much sense but in any case you should use a tool such as the microbenchmark package which measures in microseconds and provides maximum minimum median and average times over a number of replications of each call to get some valid data

45384688
int	double
however in some cases i require int parsing sometimes double

45384738
pop-up	dialog
when i launch the injector i run createprocess on the executable when launched from a user writable directory such as documents this cause steam to pop-up a preparing to launch game name ... dialog what ends up happening is that createprocess returns this dialog instead of the application we launched - this is very annoying since we then have to close these handles and try with a fallback openprocess which may or may not work since as far as the os cares we didn t spawn this process - this may not be reasonable to circumvent depending on what winapi exposes but oh well this flowchart may help to illustrate what s happening versus what i want to happen

45384789
width	height
if you write these to the component s state you can automatically recalculate your new height and width and trigger a rerender when the screen rotates set onlayout on your root view and update the image s width to be the width of the entire screen

45384857
post	get
you are try to get value from post is wrong

i re-installed libtiff using pip and homebrew and pillow using conda following the advice of some scikit-image developers

45385141

45385224
width	height
to enable the ratio click toggle aspect ratio constraint callout 1 in figure 10 and then enter the width height ratio in the input that appears

45385224
width	height
if both the width and height are set to match constraints you can click toggle aspect ratio constraint to select which dimension is based on a ratio of the other

45385224
width	height
for example if you set both sides to match constraints click toggle aspect ratio constraint twice to set the width be a ratio of the height

multiplication	exponent	addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	exponent	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	exponent	addition
i am new to javascript so while looking into basics i came across expression evaluation so normally expression will be evaluated in the order of parenthesis exponent multiplication division addition subtraction and others

45385281
subtraction	addition
my understanding is in the above expression first the no s will perform addition based on the priority of addition over subtraction so it will be 12-23-91 and the result might be -80 but while checking the output of the expression it returns -92

45385310
for-loop	loops
you should probably use a for-loop since this will let you easily loops through values in both lists

45385325
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction have the same priority precedence and are performed left to right whichever occurs first

45385325
division	multiplication
same follows for multiplication and division

45385389
min	max
so i would have void minmax array int min int max

45385389
min	max
the min and max variables would be sent in as null and get changed when the function runs

45385412
folder	directory
when i run phpdocumentor2 it creates lots of phpdoc-cache- folder in the output directory which i specify with --target

45385413
min	max
that s totally fine except that you ll need min and max to be pointers

45385423
min	max
q so i would have void minmax array int min int max ...

45385423
min	max
that would not pass min and max back to the caller

45385441
reactjs	react-starter-kit
i think it s good to start with a small environment like this because if you go with an advanced boilerplate like kriasoft s react-starter-kit there may be a lot of terminology and extraneous things you may not need like tests which is always a good practice to have but you may not need it while learning basic reactjs or making a small website

45385477

for-loop	arrays
i know how to do this for a 1d arrays in java i would just run a for-loop with the condition of i pixels.length

45385590
put	get
when a function calls itself recursively more data gets put on the stack for every time it calls itself over and over and none of them get taken off the stack until one of them ends

45385633
for-loop	loops
i am really worried about it as i am not sure what could be done which could make it faster but so far to my knowledge is that by using foreach loops instead of for-loop can make things faster but i want to know if you people can please provide me with solutions

45385644
pull	push
then i could push switch computers and pull from the branch on my fork

45385644
pull	push
when i m ready i can push a batch of commits to the pull request on repo

45385668
put	get
so it would take the request extract parameters and state call the back-end system with this information get a result back which included what kind of reply to send and the values needed and then format the exact phrase and any other supporting info such as a card or whatever and put it into a properly formatted response

45390011
x86	mips
and there are different instruction sets arm is different from x86 is different from mips the opcodes and or bits you examine in the instruction vary for none of these can you simply look at 8 bits each you have some bits then if that is not enough to uniquely identify the instruction operation then you need to examine some more bits where those bits are what the rules are are very specific to each architecture

45390067
getter	setter
then assuming multilinktextview exposes a property in quotes because android doesn t appear to have properties per se only getter setter and external attributes which holds a collection array list of those linkinfo objects below is how we d like to define it in the xml layout

width	height
i have a canvas which has a varying height width according to view-port width

45390093
floating-point	integer
it s worth asking if an integer value could not be added to floating-point value what would the symptom be

45390093
floating-point	integer
when you add an integer to a floating-point value the compiler automatically converts the integer to a floating-point value so it can do the addition that way and this is perfectly well defined

45390093
floating-point	integer	multiplying	subtract
and it works this way for just about all operations the same logic is applied when you subtract multiplying or divide a floating-point value and an integer

45390205
hide	show
so whenever we want to show one of these elements we iterate over all of them and hide show them depending on their id

45390227
multiplication	modulo
therefore as a conclusion this proves that the number of digits your library has to handle correctly is twice the number of digits of the modulo if you are computing the exponentiation using integer multiplication the way explained here

45390272
width	margin
if you have other elements inside the container which you want to center apply margin 0 auto to them as you did to the container itself they need a width less than 100 for that to have any effect...

45390296
factors	mean
i assume when you say that there is no replica nodes you mean that you have set the replication factors 1

45390405
post	get
i try to get image name through post but it will give me image like this c fakelink imagename i don t know what s the issue kindly help me to solve this issue

45390406
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
the next step is to get the first of these anonymous inline boxes the pseudo element and take it out of the normal flow by floating it left then setting its width to 100 and making it take up a height which matches the height of the sibling s margin which i accomplished by setting a margin of half the s margin but you could do the same by setting a height or bottom margin matching the s margin

45390406
width	margin
since the float is set to a width of 100 the doesn t fit next to the floated box and it sitting inside its line box moves down to the next line where it somehow magically decides to partly honour the first part of the rule non-positioned block boxes created before and after the float box flow vertically as if the float did not exist which only seems to be true for the margin because as soon as the float box outgrows the margin the block box does start to move down maybe because its sitting in a line box as well

45390438
int	double
you have to use double instead of int

45390441
charindex	substr
i have a column with a set of string that is separated by . example below i ve the query to split it by using substr and charindex the issue is the second delimiter is not always the same length so when i case it it s not splitting correctly

45390490
children	parent
let s say it is parent and children

45390490
children	parent
one parent can have zero or many children

45390490
children	parent
ideally the view can be brought up and while they enter the parent s data they could add one or many children

45390501
int	chars	int	boolean
you can use a chars and utilize different bits at the cost of some bit masking operations you can use a 16 bit int but i will illustrate with the clearest imho approach a struct with two boolean

45390501
int	boolean
this may or may not optimize as well as using a 16 bit int and casting out the two boolean by hand

45390507
for-loop	loops
but in the video i watched they use a while loops with a swapcounter and one one for-loop

45390522
valgrind	memcheck
how can i publish the results of the memcheck with the jenkins valgrind plugin

45390526

45392036
division	subtraction
now we enter the next number 3 therefore now if it were to work correctly we need to switch around calculation of diff so it should be and now if we run it it will give us -12 which is the technically the correct answer as we are asking now i m assuming you actually want to find the only simple fix to this is to set diff as the first number in this case 9 and then doing what i said above giving the expected 9 - 3 6 the reason the division function does not work is the same as subtraction and you can use similar logic as above to fix it

45392036
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
in addition to this making an addition subtraction multiplication and division method defeats the point of methods that is to prevent using the same code several times and having to write less but in this case running calculator.addition a b is longer and less flexible than simply using a + b

bash	subshell
note that the point of demonstrating this is to show that if you are using a testing method that s quite easy to fall into the habit of using subshell grep or sed or gawk or a bash builtin like echo which is for me a bad habit i tend to fall into when hacking fast it s worth realizing that this will have a significant performance hit and it s probably worth the time avoiding those if bash builtins can handle the job natively

because they need to fit into their parents width which can change i was forced to use tags with data uris rather than inline i won t go into detail on this problem here but it s a flaw of the webkit engine used by webview which prevents elements from adjusting their height according to their width which works fine in current firefox versions

equals	compareto
equals method of the class comparator and comparator require equals consistency because some java collection classes may behave unpredictably if the compareto and equals methods are not returning consistent results

45399335
comparator	comparable
supplying appropriate comparator or comparable allows you to pass your intent

45399335
comparator	comparable
so we need to supply either comparator or comparable in order to get them stored in the collection particularly in treeset

45399335
comparator	comparable
there is only required consistency between comparable comparator method and equals method

45399335
equals	compareto
the compareto method returns 0 if two objects are equals while your equals method returns true if two objects are equals

45399335
equals	compareto
a natural ordering that uses compareto required to be consistent with equals iff x.equals y is true whenever x.compareto y equals 0

45399335
comparator	comparable
so you have to make your comparable class consistent with equals because some java collection classes may behave unpredictably if the comparator and equals methods are not returning consistent results

45399335
equals	compareto
the following example shows compareto method that is not consistent with equals

45399335
equals	compareto
therefore the return value of compareto might not be 0 when comparing two equals apple objects which mean that this compareto method is not consistent with equals

45402007

comparator	comparable
having that out of the way you seem to be confusing comparator and comparable

45402281
comparator	comparable
note that the two are not mutually exclusive â you can also compare objects that implement comparable by using a comparator whose ordering differs from the natural ordering of the comparable objects

45402281
comparator	comparable
now when the javadocs talk about comparisons being consistent with equals then equals in this context always refers to the equals object method of the object to be compared may that object implement comparable itself or just be compared to another object with a comparator

45402281
equals	compareto
two bigdecimal s representing 2.0 and 2.00 will not be equals according to bigdecimal.equals object but they will be considered equals by their natural ordering by compareto bigdecimal

subtract	add
one advantage of doing this is that it s easy to add and subtract arbitrary intervals of time from it

this code will create an array of the superclass type i.e animal and will initialize two objects - one of the superclass and one of the subclassing to be stored in the array

now since the subclassing cow inherited the superclass animal therefore adding the cow class object to the superclass array could be re-written as

45423178
superclass	subclassing
this is polymorphism where a superclass reference variable can used to store the address of a subclassing object

45442207
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see both examples format just fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie11 and edge only the div example formats properly -- the table gets all screwy

45442220
int	chars
one of the biggest that i forgot was assuming the sizes of integral types chars short int long long long - those types are ordered by size but there is pretty much no guarantee

45442247
implements	extends
apparently the problem with the original design was that i was extends baseapilistingresource on the same class where i was trying to implements readerlistener

45442247

45442408
min	max
without any error but min and max generate an error

45442473
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
assuming the omitted curly braces on your second loops is simply a typo and typo in the for-loop and the fact that you ask about multiplying floats but your code shows arrays of ints this won t get great vectorisation even if the compiler sees it

45442513
shiny	dplyr
i have some variable names specified as string input from shiny app and i would like to use them in my dplyr and ggplot2 code as if they were variables

45442956
serializable	deserialization
it s impossible compensate the cost of repeated serializable deserialization and data movement between python interpreter and jvm python udfs result on in data being serializable between the executor jvm and the python interpreter running the udf logic â this significantly reduces performance as compared to udf implementations in java or scala

45442971
ubuntu	linux
i am working in linux ubuntu

it s only when i put them chained that i get the error

45443658
mouse	keyboard
is there any documentation that indicates whether or not the sub-millisecond precision is used to provide accurate timestamps for nsevents that represent keyboard and mouse inputs

45443658

45444041
cpu	hyperthreading
on a x64 cpu with hyperthreading two logical cpu cores usually share an l2 cache and all logical cpu cores share the l3 cache

45444041
cpu	hyperthreading
as an example for most intel cpus with hyperthreading group_affinity.mask will contain 2 bits set for the l2 cache and 8 bits set for the l3 cache for a cpu with 4 physical cpu cores and 8 logical cpu cores

45444045
sorting	filtering
it has tons of the stuff i need like advance pagination filtering and sorting

45444074
children	parent
this is my suggestion in this case you can make the parent component the only class componente and the children a staless component this will help have a better structure and manage your child component this will make you do a different work around of the case that will be more easy to approach

45444089
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that xargs sees spaces as a new argument the solutions to change the delimiter character using -d or -e is unfortunately not properly working on mac os

i updated the width height top left on .ribbon and top right on .ribbon span

45444633
put	get
i tried to put unzipper.unzip in initialize of progressboxcontroller but i can t get filepath to that controller

45444654
folder	directory
utils folder in my windows directory is created with lower case

45444657

45444769
for-loop	arrays
you can check for adding item into another item.also will again call the function which is not good.and same in for-loop givedata .length will also call the same function agian so try to initialize givedata with a variable and then use it and not call the function.one more thing as you have arrays of object you can opt for foreach.or let us know what you want to achieve by doing this

45444777
client-side	server-side
how can i call them from javascript client-side or server-side .all in visual studio 2015 environment

45444916
sorting	grouping
but if a grouping extends to a second page the sorting doesn t take into account the grouping s entries on the other page so that sorting in this case is incorrect

45444917
for-loop	loops
you are adding adapter in for-loop so for every item in loops is setting

45444923
pull	push
it doesn t make sense to use the hostname during build because the basic idea is to build in a central server then push then pull from every instance that need to run the image as a container

45444933

the exception-handling is caught at an intermediate try-catch

45445058
width	height
the documentation for createwindow says the width and height parameters are in device units while the documentation for rectangle says the width and height parameters are in logical coordinates which i assume means they re measured in logical units

45445058
width	height
i thought setting a point struct with the length and width i use to create a window passing the point through dptolp then using the resulting x and y values as the width and height of my rectangle should work but the rectangle ends up being bigger than the window

implements	extends
if you re uncomfortable extends a native object this would be the correct way to do so since it is a configurable non-enumerable and writable property you can just implements it as a static function

45445297

uistackview	uicollectionview
for example should it be a single type with some axis property like uistackview or some other arrangement property to broaden the notion to capture uicollectionview layouts too

45448979
post	get
how you are getting the parameters in the controller will depend if you choose post get any

45448979
post	get
that does not really helps when the code with the laravel example comes with the route calling the get method not the post and in the js example no options of http is set to get

45448979
post	get
meaning you are trying to call get where post is the default therefore the route will never work

45448984
slideup	slidedown
assuming plus+ should be showed if the content is slideup and minus- should be showed if the content is slidedown so by default show + and content is hidden

45449064
cdr	cons
cons is an array of two machine words and car and cdr can have any value in it

45449064

45449505
min	max
if the conditions were met i d replace the max min unit and the max min birth

45449505
min	max
i tried extracting the value from the tuple as described in finding the max and min in dictionary as tuples python but could not get this to work

45449505
min	max
finally i m aware of the max and min functions but i do not want to use them for this exercise

45449534
min	max
if you want to preset your max min values you can use float inf and -float inf

45449534
min	max
for reference a simpler version using max and min

45449534
min	max
items generates a list of tuples out of your dictionary and the key tells the functions what to compare against when picking the max min

if i wanted it to be something more generic that i could have return type of boolean int or even nothing how could i make this even more generic

45449629
int	chars
by having a state variable when you re inside an int by checking if a given chars is a number of space you can keep track of the count by ignoring white space

45449670
min	max
futher by factoring op out into a function parameter rather than hard-coding the operator we open the door for reusing this code for both the min and max variations

45449840

45450285
button	checkbox
the button and checkbox work just fine

45450345
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
major browsers firefox safari and google-chrome choose not to percent encode as 20 when it is in the path segment and therefore okhttp chooses to be consistent with those behaviors

45450345
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the only part of a url that the browsers and okhttp differ on for is the host in which safari and okhttp will error firefox leaves as is and google-chrome percent encodes as 20

width	height
why was i not able to set the width and height of inline elements

45450782
ostringstream	std
this particular formulation is nice in that you don t have to explicitly construct a std ostringstream and you can easily vary the format to whatever you like for example

45450785
width	height
inline elements by definition do not take explicit width or height but are inline and conform to the surrounding elements

45450785
width	height
the float property implies block layout and the display property of elements is changed to block in most cases thus making them block-level elements where you can set explicit width and height because they occupy all of their container

git-svn	svn2git

45463852
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

45463852
git-svn	svn2git
if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually

git-svn	svn2git
the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn

opencv	emgucv
emgucv opencv are sdks for computer vision applications are not really intended to to do general purpose manipulation of video audio streams

45464460
opencv	emgucv
in general i have found it is better to avoid emgucv opencv for video capture and use these tools strictly for computer vision applications

45483101
post	put
i want to put named native query in orm.xml and use this blog post as reference

45483135

45483285
next	except
open this site which looks like github except that it has a paint bucket icon next to the notification icon in the top right

45483321
onclick	onsubmit
i think the issue is that you re catching the onclick of the submit input button but you re not catching the onsubmit of the form

45483321
onclick	onsubmit
if you replace the onclick of the input type submit to the be a onsubmit on the form it should avoid an extra request that is likely giving you the 404

45483453

unlike objective-c categories swift extensions do not have names.

45483597
folder	directory
even worst some of these files must be included 2 folder up the directory tree - so when my application is deployed it should look something like this

45483644
for-loop	loops
in a for-loop the number of iterations and the values that loops variable will have in those iterations are selected as soon as it is executed the first time

45483644
for-loop	loops
since you want to check the condition on every iteration you cannot use a for-loop without introducing an if condition inside loops

45483662
maven	pom.xml
put these in pom.xml if you are using maven

45483675
range	minimum
note that the filter function take as input the range of values between 0 and the minimum length between our two lists

45483687

is a dynamically-generated md5 hash and each time i run the command it needs to be replaced by a new hash

45484124
integer	unsigned
the two you are referring to are of types unsigned 8 bit integer and unsigned 16 bit integer

45484124
integer	unsigned
however in the case of types an unsigned integer can only be positive as it does not designate space for a sign a negative sign

45484124
integer	unsigned
an unsigned 8 bit integer s values can be 0 - 255 while an unsigned 16 bit integer can hold values from 0 - 65 535 side note if you are familiar with networking you may notice that 65 535 is the largest port number possible

45484124
integer	unsigned
this is due to the fact a port number is an unsigned 16 bit integer .

45484132
for-loop	loops
to fix this you can use a self invoking anonymous function inside the for-loop - this way you will create a scope for each loops and the value of i will remain for the click when it happens

45484210
folder	directory
in fact some files have been placed directly under the root directory instead of being placed under the right sub folder

45484256

the index is a data structure that includes min and max values for each column and the row positions within each column

45484866
ubuntu	linux
i use linux ubuntu

45484873
min	max
you use a function like max min sum avg to specify what to do with the data from rows that are thrown away

45484873
min	max
the result is a unique set of values from the columns that were grouped and a single value corresponding to the min max avg etc from the columns that were not grouped

45484874
google-chrome	safari

45484906
post	get
whether you are using get or post to transmit parameters the http request is sent to your server by the user s client whether it s a web browser telnet or anything else

45484906
post	get
therefore you must not allow your code to perform any operation that could damage you in any way if the post or get parameters you receive aren t what you expect be it by mistake or from malicious intents

45484914
post	get
as far as having it decorated with a get and a post when you do this you are essentially telling the action to look for data on the request in two different places which will most likely not end well for you unless you plan on doing that switch logic yourself inside the action

45484934

imageview	picasso
if your images are static then you should store them in drawables as shown in that tutorial and if your images are dynamic and fetched from network you should use picasso glide or any such library to load those images directly from network into your imageview

45511733
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking to build a google-chrome extension that opens up the selected links in new tabs that is the initial goal i want to achieve as my final goal is to open the links in frames of the same tab - if possible - in order to save the images from those links similar to what the save images extension for firefox is doing

navigation can only happen within a defined router so you should have a navigator wrapping the screens you want to switching between

45512141
post	get
every get post and cookie value could be anything at all and should therefore be validated

to go full iframe width and height because the content of page.php will be resized if i change the size like this

45512557
google-chrome	safari
i ve accomplished this and it works nicely in google-chrome but safari doesn t seem to recognize any sort of parameters to the url such as zoom or page

45512622
width	height
you could do something similar passing in width and height independently and then using those values in the css

45512632
gridview	detailsview
in this gridview i have a button that will display all of the information about the selected user inside a detailsview below the gridview

45512639

what is the best way to create responsive image using css i m basically trying to switching the header image when screens is max-width 480px this is the code i have

45512820
pull	push
an interim solution may be to push pull data to a cloud storage solution

45512824
internationalization	translation
it s pointless because the native tool in angular 2 to do internationalization the i18n attribute doesn t have a means to support translation when 2-way binding is involved so we are going to end up using something like ngx-translate instead

45512918
width	height
then on your form_load event specify your width and height to the values saved in your settings

45512946
put	get
however when i put the publishedafter parameter i get a confused answer

45513059
versioning	upgrade
i have a free ios app which has an in-app purchase to upgrade to pro versioning to unlock some features

45513114
theano	tensorflow
but to be specific -- i am trying to compare theano speed vs tensorflow speed with some of my more complex computations with a much larger dataset size

45513114
theano	tensorflow
so i am ultimately trying to input the same random matrix to both theano and tensorflow and i guess this approach isn t working

45513124
put	get	post	get	post	put
in general 1 api call 1 http request get post put delete

45513143
google-chrome	firefox
point 1 the webbrowser control in vb and later visual studio is not a fully functioning browser like we expect from google-chrome ie firefox etc

45513170
hide	show
you can use events of highcharts for show and hide of buttons

45513171
textview	imageview
i have a button to open the gallery and i have another one to open the phone s camera when the image is loaded on a imageview it show a textview saying image uploaded and if its not loaded i use .seterror to shows a message upload a picture or something

45513194
build.gradle	gradlew
change the project-level build.gradle to refer to com.android.tools.build gradlew 2.3.3 instead of com.android.tools.build gradlew 3.0.0-alpha6

45513200
width	height
the only difference is that i had to add a little extra styling for my images width and height

45513212
post	get
post should be used for any operation that s not standardized by http which is your case since there s no standard for a get operation with a body

45513230
portrait	landscape
even though the device is in portrait mode the preview i am getting is in landscape

45513245
ionic	angular
i already have my key in a build.json file just like the old ionic 1 angular 1 but i never changed anything anywhere for this so not sure if it will just pick this up or not

45513305
folder	directory
at the end of setup_local_config it hardlinks the config_local.py into the data directory s config folder so the user can easily find and modify it

45513315
int	boolean	int	double
obviously in jsoncpp only int uint real null and boolean could be coerced to double

45513322
vsts	tfs
now i have a vsts tfs extension with a hub and custom endpoint

45513336
implements	extends
so you have to implements this functionality on your own via extends the control or something else

45513340
hide	show
am planning to add duplicate items with both options show hide required options mimic the behavior for both options

45513381
post	put
also with django rest framework you need to use put patch request and not post request

45513389
width	height
just swapping the width height doesn t do anything because in general the camera only supports landscape resolutions

45513400
width	height
another solution could be to set image s width and height to 100 and object-fit to cover

45513400
width	height
i get the window s dimensions since the object s width and height are set to 100 not the resized image s new size

45513415
free	malloc
also you are remembering to free all the memory you ve malloc ed right

45513448
min	max
find the max and min

45513453
post	get
then i want to pass below info possibly using post method so it does not get exposed to the user when the user clicks on the link

45513458
for-loop	loops
put the with before your loops so that you can write the values to the file from within your for-loop

45513513
google-chrome	firefox
if my web opened in google-chrome and firefox browser it s no error

45513558
multiplying	multiplication
is there an easy matrix multiplication to multiplying these two panda dataframes together

45513574
folder	directory
okay so i actually had an issue with this line of code beforehand but i realized thanks to a fellow answer from this site that i had to delete my web.py folder from my directory and reinstall an updated version

45513592
imageview	picasso
i would like to know how i can use the instagram api to get the user s image and load it into an imageview using picasso

45513600
width	height
i m trying to create a square graph x axis width is the same as the y axis height

45513715
hide	show
and in css you just hide it show it with media queries

45513744
dplyr	tidyr
pivot table on r using dplyr or tidyr

45513761
range	minimum
in the following code i made a simple slider with two slider button in it to read range and minimum value

45513761
range	minimum
and i have set the minimum value of slider so that user cannot decrease the range beyond a minimum limit

45513761
range	minimum
but when a user reaches the minimum range limit and the user cannot decrease the range further but the user should be allowed to increase the range

45513761
range	minimum
but after the minimum range is hit and when user tries to increase the range the cursor goes not-allowed like and browser stops reading any kind of mouse event at that time and after that every time user tries to increase the range this happens and the user no longer can increase the range

45513761
range	minimum
why does the cursor go not-allowed type when the user tries to increase the range after the minimum range is hit

45513829
width	height
removing all that and just using standard values for width and height the issue for me was resolved

45513930
accessor	properties
have the checkbox inputs fill properties of an object with properties accessor bracket notation

45513933
maven	pom.xml
when i was learning maven i too noticed that any resources defined in child modules took precedence over those in a parent pom.xml

45513938
virtualenv	conda
i have a conda virtualenv called pymatgenwork with anaconda 3.6.1 python installed

45513952
width	height
step 3 set the image in storyboard on the uiimageview to give the uiimageview the intrinsic content size specifically width since height is equal to the main view it needs to relay to the scrollview content size

45513966
libxml2	libxslt	lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2
i can also confirm after testing that escaping space as the xml entity code also does not work at least in lxml which is based on libxml2 and libxslt

45513977
getter	setter
you have to provide your own backing variable and your own getter setter

45514009
getter	setter
downside here is that apart from the dll method call there is quite a good amount of ui elements that are affected by getter setter after the long method

45514009
getter	setter
i could write alternated getter setter based on the appropriate invokerequired but if there is a more correct way to do this i d rather take that approach

45514009
getter	setter
here is what i had related to option 1 left out duplicate code and the getter setter without their invokes

45514016
lxml	elementtree
from lxml import elementtree

45514026
bids	ssis
i have implemented a ssis package using bids 2008 which has an execute sql task to get max of record from a table

45514039
getter	setter
class properties and never auto-synthesised the getter and or setter must be implemented and no backing variable is automatically created for them

45514078
folder	directory
after a user enters all the equipment info chooses the image location and clicks submit....the equipment data is written to a mysql db the image is renamed with the equipment s serial number and stored in a folder named uploads located in the sites root directory

45514078
folder	directory
my it department setup a iis virtual directory pointing to the trxshares folder in the root of the data entry site

45514118
int	chars
so_reuseaddr requires a bool 4 byte int not a chars 1 byte

45514118
int	chars
you are passing in a pointer to a single chars but are telling setsockopt that you are passing in a pointer to an int

45514166
screens	tablet
and so in my automation script if i have a loop that uses that 100 times i m going to see 100 of each cmd adb and conhost running in the background i know this because i enter ps in powershell to get the list of processes. the purpose of the function if you re curious is to look for logcat messages from the usb attached android tablet to see when processes are finished so that the script knows when to command screens touches to move forward with automation testing

45514234
post	get
it might seem obvious but when using post versus get you re using one more byte in the method name

45514234
content-length	content-type	post	get
in addition if you have few data to send using get will url-encode the data this means that the number of generated sent bytes will be higher than the data size itself while post will consume more byte in general because the request will additionally contain a content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded header likely a content-length header plus the same url-encoded data as get

45514234
post	get
in the end the get request will be shorter and for the same network link bandwidth will be faster than post

45514234
post	put
to send binary data put will be faster than post based on the same logic and because post will use multipart form-data encoding headers but browser support is more limited for put requests

45514245
google-chrome	safari
i had the same problem and it is because of new standards for the golocation api in google-chrome and safari

45514270
for-loop	arrays
as a good practice you can also change your for-loop to use the length of the grade arrays like this

45514299
odoo	openerp
at end of odoo 8 server openerp addons web static src css base.css add

45514323
scipy	scikit-learn
i have already downloaded scikit-learn which turned out just fine but when i run the program it says that i need to install scipy numpy and .base

45514331
websphere	ibm
is anyone aware of an ibm websphere mq module compatible with python3

45514342
width	height
and underneath all that i want a big picture but auto height and width doesn t work if i make the page bigger

45514359
for-loop	arrays
i d probably just store the listbox data in another arrays and for-loop through all 3 of them

45514433
dplyr	tidyr
is there a way in tidyr and dplyr to save the data as it goes along to avoid this

45514444
width	height
a good approach is to override the recyclerview onmeasure method and get the width height values if they are 0 they are just created if they are greater do you ondraw after the measure ends

45514483
getter	setter
if you truly need them you should use properties with getter and setter

45514549
width	height
then i would change the height width to a standard minimum screen size like 800x400

45514551
filesystems	ntfs
there was even no ntfs-3g installed to work with ntfs filesystems

45514562
google-chrome	safari
i manage to get the code working under secure connection https on google-chrome windows android but fail to run on ios safari

45514567
superclass	subclassing
if your cbo is subclassing as you pointed in the comment than in your superclass add

45514580
swift	objective-c
swift can read #define s from a c or objective-c header file but not from the configuration

45514613
box-sizing	border-box
the closest i have been to solving this problem is to use box-sizing border-box but that unfortunately removes the padding and thus change the design

45514657
post	get
i did not get any responses but wanted to post my solution so others can hopefully use it

45514671
swift	objective-c
swift or objective-c answers are welcome

45514683
multiplying	add
for each byte in the uint8array from most to least significant multiplying running total by 256 and add to it the value of the new byte

45514697
post	get
the problem was that i was sending via the get method not post so the _post email was a mistake

45514820
dplyr	lubridate	tidyverse	dplyr	tidyverse	lubridate
with lubridate and tidyverse dplyr magrittr

45514835
alexa	amazon
i have not tried this but having extensive experience with amazon alexa skills in node.js i would say this might be accomplished in a programmatic way as follows

45514835
alexa	amazon
alternatively amazon has recently released documentation on how to connect alexa users to your own api s

45514846
width	height
you should tune the width height and res parameters of your graphic output file

45514876
submit	submission
i am submission forms via django forms and i want data to refresh on submit in a certain part of the page div

45514888
int	double
however if you have a datagrid with say a datagridtextcolumn that is bound to a datetime or a double type and you edit one of the rows and write something on that column that fails to convert to the bound type like writting a string on a datagridtextcolumn bound to an int type

45514890
inherited	properties
as this is a quite common case to develop components properties inherited you can also consider some ready-to-use solutions like hierarchynodeinheritancevaluemap api or inherited paragraph system iparsys in your implementation design

45514953
oncreate	recreate
laalto is right you need to recreate your table once you ve dropped it you need to add a call to oncreate p0 inside your onupgrade method

45514975
box-sizing	border-box
you had the right idea but unfortunately you are going to have make additional adjustments to what you re creating whether you use the box-sizing border-box

45514975
width	border-box
the reason it s acting funny is because without border-box you are going over the total of 100 width

45514975
box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
added box-sizing border-box to .form-2 and increased the height to 40px and padding to 12px

45515019
min	max
after it fetches the numbers from the user it ll use math.min and math.max to get the min and max between all 3 numbers

45515019
min	max
then it s just a simple if else tree to figure out which one lies in between the calculated min max

45515055
crypt	salt
for generating a salt for crypt you need 2 random bytes

45515060
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
terraform successfully picks up the local file localdir myapp-1.0.war uploads to s3 in the appropriate bucket and key and also associates the war file as a version in my beanstalk application i can see the war listed in beanstalk application versions list when viewed through the amazon-web-services console

45515062
newtype	either
a useful newtype a validator is a function which takes an a and returns either the a or a monoidal summary of the errors

45515207
min	max
it compares the start and end values with max and min to make sure it doesn t overflow underflow

45515241
slug	permalinks
fear that my slug function might produce a permalinks that would differ slightly

45515269
express	node.js
i m using node.js express with handlebars templating

45515299
sudo	passwd
the problem is on the passwd for sudo or a request for passwd

45515299
sudo	passwd
you need to pass env_variables to your container related with removing the sudo request for passwd as follows

a signed integer converted to unsigned integer will use the modulo arithmetic to wrap the signed value into the range of the unsigned type as if by repeatedly adding or subtracting the maximum value of the unsigned type + 1

45534644
int	chars
the solution is to use cast to unsigned chars if you want the value to be portably zero-extended or for storing small int in range 0..255

45534644

likewise if you want to store signed int in range -127..127 128 use signed chars

unsigned	short	int	chars
and my answer to your question is that java wants that all of it s primitive types byte chars short int and long should be treated as byte word dword and qword respectively exactly like in assembly and the java operators are signed operations on all of it s primitive types except for chars but only on chars they are unsigned 16 bit only

45536475
unsigned	short
also i recommend to avoid using short int and long primitive types and use word dword and qword respectively instead and you are about call the static methods for unsigned operations and or signed operations instead of using operators

portrait	landscape
on the iphone 5s actual device portrait mode works fine but in landscape mode on the device it s not respecting this same media query

portrait	landscape
after setting the text to a teeny 8px and again confirming that portrait mode works fine i noticed that in landscape mode the text size is being affected and in fact it s scaling the text but still not according to my specified size again as rendered correctly in portrait mode and i ve already established that the max-width is registering in landscape mode

45547143
portrait	landscape
the fact that font-size does seem to change in landscape mode but not to the size i specify and can see correctly in portrait mode--8px is very small but in landscape mode it s only reducing slightly in size sounds almost like the device browser is helping out according to its own rules

width	height
and while they are interchangeable it is probably a bit more intuitive to use ratio when constraining an object to itself - i want my view s width to be 2 x its own height so 2 1 - and using multiplier when constraining one object to another - i want my view s width to be 75 of the width of its superview so 0.75

width	height
... for example if the input is 227x227x3 in the format height x width x n_channels and it is to be convolved with 11x11x3 filters at stride 4 then we would take 11x11x3 blocks of pixels in the input and stretch each block into a column vector of size 11 11 3 363

45553929
width	height
iterating this process in the input at stride of 4 gives 227-11 4+1 55 locations along both width and height leading to an output matrix x_col of im2col of size 363 x 3025 where every column is a stretched out receptive field and there are 55 55 3025 of them in total

as you can see every message container view has a different width and a different height but the curve of the corners are all exactly the same

the whole file is properly structured so should always follow the same pattern so when it reaches prob i have been trying to find a way to check if the next value is min max and if it isn t print otherwise print after reading min max i haven t been able

45554630
min	max
the output i want from the program would be like this when it finds a min max property

45554630
min	max
if there is no min max after prob then the same line should be like this instead

45554630
min	max

volumeinfo is next dictionary so i really don t know exactly how to map it and get for example authors because it s next array

45572149

setinterval and settimeout both take a function as a first parameter while in your example you are actually invoking you function immediately that s why you are seeing the results right away

for-loop	arrays
in the console at the end of the for-loop it prints the required out put but not in the arrays push

45573157
int	double
so because your parameters are of type string the + operator assumes that you re trying to combine them there s no implicit type conversion to int or long or double because the operator is perfectly valid for combining strings which is what you gave it

45573157
int	double
to handle the resulting input as a numeric type to perform addition or other arithmetic operation then you need to be working with numeric data int long double type instead of string type

45573163
int	boolean
what i find funny is that the has_sorted_indices attribute does not always return a boolean but mixes it with int representation

45573213
qtableview	qstandarditemmodel
now i want to display the entire database onto a qtableview using qstandarditemmodel

45573221
for-loop	arrays
probably you set obj outside the for-loop therefore the props are overwritten and you push the same object multiple times into the arrays

versioning	upgrade
my questions is contrary to how microsoft has framed their advice is it appropriate and sensible for me to use this workaround as my permanent system for managing .net versioning upgrade

45573314
versioning	upgrade
do developer teams in other large it shops have better permanent reliable strategies for tighly controlling the rollout of their .net framework versioning upgrade

45573314
versioning	upgrade
i think it would be very undesirable to ever roll out a .net versioning upgrade without thoroughly functionally retesting my applications even though microsoft intends for these upgrade to be highly backwards compatible

45573314
versioning	upgrade
using these registry settings appears to be the most reliable way to prevent the accidental rollout of a .net versioning upgrade

45573314

i don t like relying on a system where i m micromanaging my windows registry with permanent temporary workarounds and where i m delaying upgrade to the latest versioning

45573391
hash	md5
this is because md5 and sha1 are not perfect hash functions

45573391
hash	md5
in the case of md5 each hash can potentially have an infinite number of collisions

45573406
width	margin
so change your body tag to remove the left and right margin may be that is why the full width is not filled

45573407

min	max
in any swap scenario a_i is the new max for j and a_j is the new min for i and j gets extended to the right at least up to and including i

45574133
min	max
we can handle this by keeping in a segment tree a record of min max and number of groups which correspond with a count of sequential maxes

45574133
min	max
to add group counts in a larger interval the left group s max must be lower than the right group s min

45574133
min	max
on the right side we have two groups where the left group s max is greater than the right group s min 4 4 1 2 6 2

getter	setter
i created a new variable in the kotlin class with the name x with a custom getter and setter and it complains about an accidental override for the setter that is understandable.

45574203
getter	setter
this means that the the java setter and getter is visible in the data class

45574332
getter	setter
this is because of how kotlin represents java getter and setter as properties

45574340

i verified the resultants which get put into a folder

45574390

fasttext is essentially word2vec with some extra enhancements and new modes

45574963
fasttext	word2vec
some modes with the extras turned off are exactly the same as word2vec so using fasttext word-vectors in some wordvecs-to-textvecs scheme should closely approximate using word2vec word-vectors in the same scheme

children	parent
seeing that their parentid is x it must then check parent x to see if that child is still in it s children collection and throw an error if it s not

45577357
children	parent
this allowed me to make a prediction that if i loaded a parent and one of it s children separately and the parent s children collection is null that should cause an error

45577357
children	parent
indeed when i load parent by itself the collection is initially null and then when i load one or two children separtely the parent s children collection is automatically initialized updated by ef to include the loaded children such that clearing it would cause the foreign key error

45577357
children	parent
it will ensure they re all in the parent s children collection whether you initialized it earlier or not

45577357

loading all the children separately after loading the parent ends up putting the entire system in the same state as if you had just called include up front

int	chars
everything is working absolutely fine but one calculation i am planing to make is estimated to produce a number with about 8 bilion digits and although the gmp library can handle that and the machine which will execute the code has more than enough memory the problem is that the only way of getting this number in base 10 is through the method tostring int base or simply tostring which returns a string containing the number at the specified base but since a string relies on a chars array to hold the letters it will not be able to hold 8 bilion letters since the max array size is arround 2 32-6 if i m not mistaken

45601366

wildfly	weblogic
considering the amount of local instances the possible high traffic each local can have up to 300 clients each client can generate several requests per minute the calculation of each request can take a lot of time and the result may be big and all of the other constraints for example central instance will be cluster of weblogic servers but each local will be single wildfly the databases will also be different for central and local - including different schema what would be the best approach for this communication and synchronization problem

45628215
int	chars
assuming an orthodox setup with 8-bit chars and 32-bit int types then the bits in a are

45628215
int	chars
the types shorter than int the chars types and short types â i m assuming that short is a 16-bit type which is usually but not necessarily the case are automatically promoted to int

45628215

width	height
these numbers represent left bottom width height in the figure coordinate system which ranges from 0 at the bottom left of the figure to 1 at the top right of the figure

getter	setter
in regards to java i m very accustomed to declaring all of my variables as private and generating public getter and setter to hold true to common convention

45637792
getter	setter
i find it curious though in relation to getter and setter with no functionality outside of assigning and returning the requested value is there no performance hit for calling methods like

45637920
getter	setter
i also like to use getter and setter but they are slower than plain variables

45637920
getter	setter
so go with getter and setter if you re creating an api and choose public variables if you need performance and readability is not that important

45637957
google-chrome	firefox
note we are mainly targeting on google-chrome and firefox

45637969
getter	setter
a hotspot jit compiler will inline short methods and a simple getter or setter is short enough to allow that

width	height
so the problem is that if you set the width and height the same on two differently sized images at least one of them will be distorted

45638087
width	height
the idea is you surround the image with a div and give the div the height and width instead of the image

45638140
width	height
this will not distort the images as setting the height and width on an img element would

45638145

45639122
range	minimum
their minimum range are specified in the language standard a non-official pre-publication draft is available here

45639129

when you create a subclassing it inherited all of the public and protected attributes of the parent class

45639739
inherited	subclassing
it also inherited the private bits but it cannot access them. while you could override some methods with something that throws an exception to indicate that it s no longer relevant illegalstateexception the subclassing will still have the method and in some circles that may be viewed subjectively as poor design

45655710
spaces	delimiter
if you are getting an output like as you say then i would personally have to assume that there is something wrong with your entry of the cyclic values string heaven forbid if you re actually entering 1609 spaces delimiter values or there is something wrong with the way you re generating that string which for some unknown reason you re not showing us

innodb	myisam
there are actually some notable differences in the implementation of the myisam and innodb fulltext searches

45674350
innodb	myisam
the myisam natural language search but not the boolean mode has a 50 threshold while innodb doesn t so very very common words are excluded in the myisam results

45674350
innodb	myisam
the myisam stopword list a list of words that is not included in the fulltext index and thus cannot be found is significantly longer than the default one used by innodb so everybody or unfortunately can be found with innodb but not with myisam

45674350
innodb	myisam
match against mary had a little lamb will usually contain a lot more results as had is a stopword in myisam but not in innodb

45674350
innodb	myisam
myisam and innodb use different weight algorithms

45674350
innodb	myisam
innodb supports to match exact phrases words in given order while myisam at least in natural language mode doesn t

45674350
innodb	myisam
so if you use match against mary had a little lamb innodb will only return a row if it contains this exact sentence while myisam will find every row that contains any of these words apart from had as mentioned above and a which is in both stopword lists

45674350
innodb	myisam
if you use match against +about +mary in boolean mode about is a stopword in both engines innodb will try to find that word in the index although it cannot be in there and thus return no results while myisam will ignore that word and can return results that may not contain about only mary

45674350
innodb	myisam
ft_min_word_len for myisam default 4 and innodb_ft_min_token_size for innodb default 3 are different so if you do not adjust them the innodb index will contain and find more words

persistent	transient
and merging transient entity forces hibernate to just one by one copy all the properties from source entity the ones which you are persistent to the target one which is autocreate by hibernate with all the properties set to default values aka nulls and here comes the problem as hibernate will just copy the values of associations of from_parent type or in other words only associations which are hold on entity side but in your case the association is to_parent a foreign key from child to parent hibernate will try to postpone association persistent after main entity save but save will not work as entity will not pass notempty validation

45683291
children	parent
can you avoid serialization and use references when a parent web-component passes its objects to its children

45683329
for-loop	loops
instead you redesign your loops so that it only carries out the next ajax call when the previous one is done which means you have to loops manually you can t use a for-loop

45683369
tidyverse	purrr
i would like to use purrr and tidyverse

45683879
for-loop	loops
there is a typo in your second for-loop and the push needs to happen inside the outer loops

45683909
put	get
can someone please let me know where i should put values to get the desired results

45683923
for-loop	arrays
and particulary not in a for-loop from an arrays of string because this is just non sense

45683927
metaclass	subclassing
in a further quirk the metaclass of the root class of a class hierarchy is a subclassing of the root class itself

45683929

i put break points in these 2 functions and saw that an error was thrown in the validate function and an nserror was returned in responseobject but it looks like it never triggers my error handler for the post method

45683943
postgresql	mysql
scalikejdbc natively supports the use of the streaming iterator method for the mysql and postgresql drivers

45683943
postgresql	mysql
that is with the mysql and the postgresql driver the following works

45683943
postgresql	mysql
the above works for mysql and postgresql because of this

45683943
postgresql	mysql
notice that the last case clause means that scalikejdbc does not by default support a streaming iterator with drivers other than the ones for mysql and postgresql

45683943
postgresql	mysql
what the documentation is saying is that to enable streaming for databases other than mysql and postgresql you need to customize the dbsession attributes like in the above example such that cursor support is enabled

45683970
post	get
while i get several errors that the target origin does not match the recipient window s origin i understand from other post by the plugin author that this is a bug with chrome and should not prevent the plugin from functioning

min	max
for example even after removing the extreme max and min in a timeseries i still want to see the entire timeseries but with the outliers removed or changed to a null value

45684214
ready	each
in terms of consolidating the code when you re ready you could also make the second ajax call a separate function and call it for each event and also extract the code section which clears the code when the base currency is changed into its own block

45684236
switching	screens
when i switching between different resolution screens the footer gets positioned either upper the bottom line or lower causing scrollbar appear

45684238
post	get
i sometimes get a successful post but cannot get the rest to work properly

45684271
int	chars
the #chars method breaks a string up into an array of single chars then converts it into an array of int representing the utf-8 codes

45684271
int	chars
finally we map the int back to single chars with and then join the resulting array of chars back into a string

45684277
for-loop	loops
it s also worth mentioning that the outer while loops can be and should be replaced with a for-loop

45684303
post	get
i am suspecting that there is something wrong with post form as i don t get any errors it is like post doesn t reach controller at all

45684305
charts	pie-chart
when i comment out the pie-chart the bar charts sorts correctly again

45684343
width	height
since the arrow divider is a fixed width height of 12px.

45684360
min	max
if you want the max of each channel you can split the hsv mat into the 3 channels and the do a getrangevalue which should return you the max and min for each channel

45684377
int	chars
in c source code a literal is a token that denotes a fixed value which may be an int a floating-point number a chars or a string

45684378

if you can t drag webview to the top of your viewcontroller -- when you have an extra ui on top of the webview -- then put a container view instead and move web view inside it

45684414
width	height
the idea is that the three dimensional array has three indices the first describing the position s height the second its width and the last the color of a pixel

45684424

45684436
superclass	subclassing
i would like to avoid casting superclass into subclassing like this

45684439
google-chrome	firefox
i ve come to the conclusion that i need to use percentages and on initial page load this works fine but then when attempting to resize the textarea any wider it causes some weird behavior in google-chrome and firefox

45684439
google-chrome	firefox
i would like this to be the desired behavior but i can t get google-chrome to mimic firefox

45684464
min	max
if you make sure that you have a max and min width it will not exceed the sizes

45684483
stdout	stderr
instead configure the logging module to output messages to the stream handler for the terminal stdout stderr

45684516
serializable	deserialization
other idea is json serializable deserialization

45684547
post	get
we are using post xxx usage get instead of using get xxx usage for security reasons as per api naming conventions verbs are not allowed to be used in resource path

45684547
post	get
but we are using post instead of get to avoid sending some sensitive information over query param what would be the best way to identify the uri has get job

45684547
post	get
option 2 while using post use naming convention to tell its actually a get job without compromising naming convention

45684553
post	get
there is a built-in endpoint in indentityserver 3 which validate token it can be called using get or post by passing token and the response status code can tell if it is valid or not

45684562
hide	show
in my app i am attempting to hide show some sklabelnodes in spritekit

int	chars
tokens such as 0 0.0 the a in and 0 are called constants collectively and int constants floating-point constants enumeration constants and chars constants respectively

45684586
children	parent
reason for this relationship instead of nested documents is that children are updated frequently and i can avoid touching parent documents everytime

45684586
children	parent
but i also want to retrieve all children for that parent list

45684586
children	parent
is it possible to get all parent and associated children with the same query instead of running a separate query to get children of each parent

45684610
width	height
the container has fixed height and should include n fixed width horizontally scrolling blocks

45684658

otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank

45684706
integer	unsigned
operand with unsigned integer type

45684708
free	malloc
so if we called malloc 10 times then free should be called 10 times as well - otherwise a memory leak should occur

45684961
integer	unsigned
storing ip addresses in dotted quad notation in a varchar is not the most optimal way of storing them since dotted-quad is a human friendly representation of a 32 bit unsigned integer that doesn t lend itself to database indexing

45685049
profiling	debugging
3.open the profiling and change the release to debugging

45685087
put	get
not because i put it here but because the linear-combination however the tweaking of the non-linearised factors get incorporated down the road during re-calculating all the layers till the final sum and output transformation takes place -- all this principally cannot introduce a cubic-behaviour accross the full domain-ranges of the inputs which the mother nature natively in the problem-domain real-world behaviour does -- and here is the devil hidden and the reason why it cannot get any better this way -- not so hard to create an easy simulation of this principal failure to meet the cubic-reality in code

uistackview	uitextview
i m trying to add some uitextview to a uistackview and the text views aren t showing up

for the image size i think using percentage will do the trick instead of defining definite width height

45685679

i was asked to make it so that check boxes would allow the user to hide products for a page about selling sport health products when they are unchecked and show them back in the list when they are checked again

45685679

swift objective-c and c++

45685989
swift	objective-c
changes are visible back in objective-c or swift code

45685989
swift	objective-c
do you mind creating a copy of the whole swift objective-c array in

45685992
post	get
you can use either get or post but you need to be consistent on the server and the client side

45685992
post	get
as far as the flow of data is concerned both a get and a post can return data it just needs to be specified on the express route

45685994
post	get
you should also get an export.id in the body of the post request this should aid in further uniqueness

45686033
subtract	add	realloc	malloc
malloc realloc errors when i add to binary heap enough to make it to length 4 and beyond and then subtract to length 2 i get a non-valid binary heap structure length 3 when i do this as well

45686033
subtract	add
after that it seems like every other test case works fine past length 4 i can add and subtract from binary heap just fine and the sorting process works great

45686049

try-catch	exception-handling
without a try-catch block that s going to produce this unhandled exception-handling

45686111
put	get
you can even get rid of the code by declaring data_carga as a bytebuffer then using the available put .. methods to build the byte array which makes the code cleaner

45686116
width	height
i came across this post shape drawable in layer-list rendered incorrectly for apis below 23 and understood that the attributes width and height work only for api 23 and above

45686116

45686204
post	get
we are using post instead of get to avoid sending some sensitive information over query param what would be the best way to identify the uri has get job

45686204

note that its the identifier for the resource not the method -- if its suitable for get it is fine for post as well generally

45686213
folder	directory
and i make a directory called ng-module-test inside of ng-app-test src and i copy the contents of the ng-module-test src folder into that then it works as hosar kindly discovered in the comments

45686224
fgets	getline
alternatively you can use fgets and deal with overlong lines yourself perhaps implementing getline since it is pretty easy

45686228
folder	directory
its a way to do it but not exactly user friendly to type out 8 folder directory

45686262

direct3d	directdraw
dr is there any way of forcing java2d graphics to only go through the opengl pipeline and entirely and completely ignore direct3d and directdraw desired effect opengl32.dll should be used before ddraw.dll

45686279
direct3d	directdraw
the game is initializing direct3d and directdraw before opengl and the overlay is hooking on to the first of these however opengl is the acceleration type supported by the steam overlay

45686279
direct3d	directdraw
the problem would hopefully be fixed if direct3d and directdraw are not used

g++	gcc
while gcc will compile code as c++ if it has certain suffixes there is no way to compile c with g++

45686400
g++	gcc
the only difference between gcc and g++ is that the latter always compiles c++ and that it links with the c++ libraries

45686424
ubuntu	linux
linux base images like ubuntu alpine etc. are updated regularly and so are the windows ones

45686471
for-loop	arrays
the reason you are getting the orderaddress.region undefined error is because the orderaddress in your for-loop is an arrays based on your orderaddresses type

45686536
