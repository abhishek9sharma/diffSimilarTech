583int	double
pattern4		
personally i prefer int string double etc

2360mouse	keyboard
pattern4		
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts

2562wmv	flv
pattern0		
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv

6659junit	testng	junit	unitils	junit	easymock	testng	unitils	testng	easymock	easymock	unitils
pattern4		
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take

6671junit	testng
pattern8		
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well

9788subtraction	addition
pattern2		
additionally while reads and writes are atomic there is a race condition with addition subtraction and incrementing and decrementing primitive types since they must be read operated on and rewritten

10232ant	maven
pattern3		
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant

10809listview	gridview
pattern0		
listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

12586rss	feed
pattern4		pattern4		
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number

13455cvs	svn
pattern4		pattern2		
i would definitely choose svn over cvs if only because people who learned source control using cvs tend to use svn delete then svn add instead of svn move

14261actionscript	mxml
pattern7	better	
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better

16381equals	gethashcode
pattern0		
gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique

20192cassini	iis
pattern4		
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier

20666hash	md5
pattern4		
to go along with what everyone here is saying i use hashtab when i need to generate compare md5 and sha1 hash on windows

22074nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
pattern10		pattern10		
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method

23203haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
pattern7		
i really like thompsonâ s â œhaskell the craft of functional programmingâ because itâ s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme

24035integer	unsigned
pattern0		
in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46

24476goto	break
pattern0		
if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks

25701jdom	xom
pattern4		
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom

26851perforce	svn
pattern8		
if anything i find working with svn easier and more intuitive than perforce

26851perforce	svn
pattern8		
perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too

27439postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	less	pattern10	less correct	
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

27440postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
better performance can be bought with more ram and cpu and more appropriate database design and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-x than agonizing over which to pick mysql or postgresql and specialist tuning from expensive dbas

27443postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

27529postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
hard to compare mysql and postgresql

29557mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
pattern8		
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

29923bazaar	git
pattern7	better	
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it

34295emacs	aquamacs
pattern4		
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like

34338phpunit	simpletest
pattern0		
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

34474phpunit	simpletest
pattern4		
i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line

34566equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

34566equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

35627filesystems	ntfs
pattern0		
when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above

37162portrait	landscape
pattern4		
web browser print dialogs default to portrait so for every print job the user has to manually select landscape

44638merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern4		
ok ruby-on-rails is actually pretty good but there is just a little bit too much magic going on in there from the ruby world i would much prefer merb to ruby-on-rails

44752perforce	svn
pattern10		pattern10		
make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with perforce and svn and while perforce is better svn is free

45963free	malloc
pattern10	more	pattern10	more flexibility	
finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility

46614post	get
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

47674maven	m2e
pattern10		pattern10		
in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way

47929udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

48015emacs	textmate
pattern7		
textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris

48103division	modulo
pattern0		
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo

50632integer	unsigned
pattern7		
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

50909youtube	vimeo
pattern0		
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users

52179postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

52725gridview	repeater	gridview	formview
pattern10		pattern10		
the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list

52881codeigniter	cakephp
pattern0		
also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby on rails etc. the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages they are familiar with

54817invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
pattern4		pattern2		
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life

55578vmware	virtualbox
pattern7		
vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details

58301directx	gdi
pattern0		pattern0		
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

58363memcached	apc
pattern4		
i would recommend memcached or apc

60137ubuntu	debian
pattern4		
i haven t decided which one yet but my understanding is that they ll give me a base os install i d prefer debian or ubuntu an ip address a root account ssh and that s about it

60910emacs	aquamacs
pattern7	less	
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change

62220postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
however the observation of database-locking stands - if you have particularly onerous updates sqlite performance won t match mysql or postgresql

64644vim	emacs
pattern4		
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim

65079wideimage	phpthumb
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	more	pattern10	more features	
wideimage is the more modern php5 approach while phpthumb has much more features

67312addition	multiplication
pattern0		
transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck

68674ubuntu	linux
pattern10		pattern10		
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

69545richfaces	icefaces
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

69989post	get
pattern0		
get is basically just like post it just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do it

70375equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

70375equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

70423quicksort	heapsort
pattern7		pattern0		
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

70440quicksort	mergesort
pattern7		pattern0		
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

70440quicksort	mergesort
pattern10		pattern10		
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

70627quicksort	mergesort
pattern7		
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

70881addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

71743tapestry	sitemesh
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page

73157free	malloc
pattern7	safer	pattern7	safer	
yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructors

74931postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

74992bash	zsh
pattern4		pattern2		
i prefer zsh over bash because of its support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab completion

77328textwrangler	bbedit
pattern0		pattern0		
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more

77883bazaar	git
pattern7		
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

77945quicksort	mergesort
pattern7		pattern0		
quicksort is not better than mergesort

79550width	height
pattern7	position div.header	
if you can get that to work you might want to try progressively removing the height width position attributes from div.header to get the minimal required attributes to get the effect you want

79771multiplying	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

81982robocopy	xcopy
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
at least use xcopy robocopy is even faster

81983datediff	difference
pattern10		pattern10		
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

84239distance	polygons
pattern4		
for each vertex in the red polygons compute the distance to each vertex in the blue polygons and find the closest hint compare distance 2 so you don t need the sqrt

84974union	distinct
pattern4		
in most cases what you really want to say is union all as it does not do duplicate elimination think select distinct between sets which can result in quite a bit of savings in terms of execution time

85010restrict	shared
pattern0		
the code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time

85414vmware	virtualbox
pattern2		
i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox

85416integer	fractions
pattern7		
if the number of bits in the mantissa or fractions is larger than the number of bits in your integer type then you ll possibly lose precision when someone types in a number such as

87006cvs	svn	accurev	cvs	accurev	svn
pattern4		
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths

88100udp	tcp
pattern4		
for instance if a preference picks tcp versus udp have your conditional instantiate a tcpprovider or udpprovider which the rest of your code uses with minimal muss or fuss

90477quicksort	mergesort
pattern10		pattern10		
as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort

91149jboss	glassfish
pattern4		
i would choose jboss or glassfish for a start

91317webclient	webrequest
pattern7		
webclient is sometimes easier to use than webrequest

94070datamapper	activerecord
pattern10		pattern10		
datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord

95121x86	64bit
pattern7		pattern7	less	
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack

95821eruby	erb
pattern4		
i see that it supposedly beats erb and eruby now.

99817width	height
pattern7		
that is the height is more than half the width and depth -- little rule of thumb

101381hex	binary
pattern7		
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

105287nunit	mstest
pattern7	more	
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

105339int	double
pattern10		pattern10		
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

107883quicksort	heapsort
pattern0		
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort

109038cairngorm	puremvc
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t

113331wxpython	pyqt
pattern4		
wxpython has a very good demo and it can do pretty much anything which pyqt can do i would anyday prefer pyqt but it may bot be free for commercial purpose but wxpython is free and is decent cross platform library

115620google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		pattern7	better	
until people have more experience with google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice

115838gif	png
pattern7		pattern0		
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

115838gif	png
pattern7		
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

116210gif	png
pattern0		
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

116461gif	png
pattern0		
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

116739hash	md5
pattern0		
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1

116767pbkdf2	hash
pattern7		
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

123076metaphone	soundex
pattern0		
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english

124248rsa	aes
pattern0		
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes

124248rsa	aes
pattern10		pattern10		
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation

124248rsa	aes
pattern7		pattern0		
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

127152int	chars
pattern0		
schema is simple like hell one table with autoint as primary index and less than 10 int tiny int and chars 10

127922mbunit	nunit
pattern7	more	
mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests

128055quicksort	shellsort
pattern0		
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort

128221g++	gcc
pattern0		
unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code

132841solaris	bsd
pattern4		
personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability

133271inline	inlining
pattern0		
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

134346hash	md5
pattern10		pattern10		
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

135543versioning	upgrade
pattern0		
the subversion versioning on the server is older than the versioning on my notebook so i guess my newer versioning somehow upgrade the working directories so they are incompatible with the old versioning on the development server

139120codeigniter	cakephp
pattern0		
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

139478sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern3		
i recommend using sorteddictionary string tvalue or sortedlist string tvalue

140359mantis	bugzilla
pattern0		
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface

140501width	height
pattern7		
if the width is greater then height 3 4 screen.width then

140502pop-up	dialog
pattern7	smaller	
i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying

141340floating-point	integer
pattern0		
but integer arithmetic arguably is inherently simpler than floating-point

142240cpu	processors
pattern7		
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processors

142427versioning	upgrade
pattern7		
using compatibility as the central point in the versioning number makes it easier for users especially if te product is a library to judge whether or not they can expect a smoothe and safe upgrade or not

144494profiling	instrumentation
pattern4		
select profiling from the product menu in xcode 6 to launch apple s instrumentation tool

145433maven	buildr
pattern0		
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven

146871lisp	scheme
pattern4		
i have decided that i prefer scheme over common lisp so that narrows it down a bit

147392vim	emacs
pattern0		
emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs

148152nant	cruisecontrol
pattern0		
think about project management bug reports and it all adds up to something more than just cruisecontrol svn and nant

148194apache	nginx
pattern0		
servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t

149212cpu	hyperthreading
pattern7		
almost any new cpu has more than one core or if it has just one it might support hyperthreading and thus pretending it has more than one

1494093des	aes
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
3des is more expensive than aes for example

150964range	max	range	min	min	max
pattern4		pattern4		
so you can either pick a date range run a select max and select min against your db or execute your query and then add the missing dates

151399ogre	irrlicht
pattern7		
irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system requirements and works better across platforms than ogre in my opinion

154057inherited	subclassing
pattern10		pattern10		
inherited is more useful when a new subclassing wants to change the way a method works if you just need to change the data the class uses to work probably an approach like this would do the trick

157238lwjgl	jogl
pattern10		pattern10		pattern7	more	
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

159944cvs	svn
pattern4		
seriously why would you prefer cvs to svn

159971cvs	svn
pattern7		pattern0		
svn is better than cvs

160021cvs	svn
pattern7	better	
so what is with svn that your company dislikes so much and cvs does better

160037cvs	svn
pattern7		pattern0		
svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

161193mouse	keyboard
pattern0		
for example do you use keyboard more than mouse

161202cvs	svn
pattern8		
the first one can be solved by using svn +ssh which is the more comparable format as cvs uses its own protocol as well

161216cvs	svn
pattern0		
svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well

161216cvs	svn
pattern8		
the other distributed tools are a lot faster svn is slow as hell even cvs can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than svn are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in svn takes years

161559cvs	svn
pattern2		
nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land

162047int	chars
pattern4		
then you need a function called int scanback const chars s const chars matches int start which starts at start goes down to z as long as the chars being scanned at s id contained in matches return the last index where a match is found

162785post	put
pattern3		
you could put the text into an invisible span and read that spans width but basicly this looks like someone trying to sabotage your site and therefore i would recommend banning post with words longer than a certain lenth for example 30 characters without spaces allowing links to be longer

162991swt	swing
pattern4		
i will probably choose swt swing or qtjambi for the ui controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation

166196des	aes
pattern10	more	pattern10	more up-to-date	
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method

167539getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd dd 1 getdate will return a current date + 1 day

167922mouse	keyboard
pattern4		
the net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switch and the switch would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days

170948lisp	scheme
pattern0		
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work

171958merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern4		pattern2		
i personally prefer merb over ruby-on-rails as it adopts more ruby conventions

172177apache	lighttpd
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content

172992disk	ram
pattern4		
but it basically matches ram blocks to disk blocks

173548accurev	svn
pattern4		
we evaluated it alongside with plastic scm svn and clearcase-ucm that we already owned and used and decided to dump clearcase and svn both were used in two different groups and to purchase accurev

176144firefox	safari
pattern7	less	
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

177532verilog	vhdl
pattern4		
do you prefer vhdl or verilog and why

177565verilog	vhdl
pattern10		pattern10		
vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us

178555verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
pattern4		
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first

178555verilog	vhdl
pattern0		
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

179294post	get
pattern4		pattern2		
further i recommend to use post wherever possible avoid using get for form submits - if some users want to simulate a form submit via get make sure your application supports the desired parameters either via post or via get but when you submit the page yourself via a button or js prefer post over get

179520google-chrome	safari
pattern7		
google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers

181450coalesce	isnull
pattern0		
also you can make your code simpler by using isnull or coalesce to handle columns which contain nulls

183126inherited	properties
pattern10		pattern10		
now in .net for desktop controls you can use inherited which is much more powerful than the old tag properties anyway

183290ant	maven
pattern10		pattern10		
as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application

184056ant	maven
pattern4		
i find it most disturbing to see so few people around here are actually using maven or at least ant though i prefer maven for the dependency handling.

184381webkit	gecko
pattern0		
my understanding is webkit is pretty good smaller than gecko

186645perforce	svn
pattern4		
i would certainly recommend perforce for a number of reasons already covered in other answers but i m not in a position to offer a comparison with svn having never really used it

186990configobj	configparser
pattern7		
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser

190913subclass	abstract-class
pattern0		
making abstract-class before i had more than one subclass in mind for them

191616cvs	svn
pattern8		
in fact svn does stores binaries a lot more efficient than cvs for more info see the svn-faq

192156coalesce	isnull
pattern4		
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull

194130ant	maven
pattern0		
it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration

194197lxml	elementtree
pattern4		
i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well

194489xstream	xom
pattern3		
if you decide to roll your own xml configuration i d recommend using xstream with customized serialization options or if you just need to parse some xml take a look at xom

195398postgresql	mysql
pattern10	more	pattern10	more enterprisey	
that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey

195398postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks

195415postgresql	mysql
pattern2		
you could then compare these with mysql and postgresql

196705django	web2py	pylons	web2py
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails

197210mouse	keyboard
pattern4		
this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences

198565post	get
pattern10	more	pattern10	more secure	
neither one of get and post is inherently more secure than the other just like neither one of fax and phone is more secure than the other

198565post	get
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	more	pattern10	more appropiate	
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

198624nfa	dfa
pattern7		
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

199290nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
pattern0		
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever

199835vim	emacs
pattern4		
rather like editors do you prefer vim or emacs choice of shell is partly a question of familiarity and partly a question of preference

201030csla	.net
pattern4		
i would recommend csla .net by rockford lhotka

201171quicksort	mergesort
pattern7		pattern0		
quicksort is worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.

201950postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

204778django	web.py
pattern4		pattern2		
also this post by the web.py author is a very good explanation of why i much prefer web.py over django

205364postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

206134pop-up	dialog
pattern0		
from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows

209147opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
pattern0		pattern0		
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

215539antivirus	norton
pattern0		
many other antivirus software that works just as well if not better than norton like avg avast and others do allow you to uninstall from the add remove

217708config	ini
pattern0		
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions

218031mouse	keyboard
pattern7	simpler	
unless it s a usb keyboard mouse and 8042 emulation is disabled where you would need a usb stack but you can use the boot protocol for the keyboard mouse which is simpler

218544centos	linux	centos	solaris	solaris	aix
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

219506mouse	keyboard
pattern0		
some elements require more than simple mouse keyboard interactions due to the complex rendering carried out by extjs

220922elf	coff
pattern0		
it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others

222513kate	kde
pattern4		
i prefer kate part of kde as it features a built-in terminal as well as many features you would expect from an editor inside an ide like code folding and regex search replace

222513vim	emacs
pattern4		
many people also recommend vim or emacs both of which are probably available through your distro s repositories

223029interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0		
a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code

224223innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam

226515division	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	more	
multiplication is faster division is more accurate

226593cruisecontrol	teamcity
pattern7		
for a one man shop teamcity is far easier to setup and configure than cruisecontrol

228750innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select

229915for-loop	loops
pattern10		pattern10		
putting the whole thing in a for-loop makes it neater and ensures that the iterating isread is called each loops

232055clistctrl	ccombobox
pattern0		
possibly faster than ccombobox with drawitem would be an owner data clistctrl

234378accessor	properties
pattern0		pattern0		
specialname is more than properties accessor event add remove methods count here as well that s why you have to check the names as well

234591tolower	toupper
pattern8		
it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs

234639tolower	toupper
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though

237472vim	emacs
pattern4		
also whichever editor you prefer vim or emacs learn it back forth

241621nstableview	nssplitview
pattern0		
a pattern i also use is to make the nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have buttons at the bottom add delete etc

242546kerberos	ldap
pattern0		
one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server

242991rss	feed
pattern2		
i produce a feed reader and when scraping feed always prefer atom over rss

245323cvs	svn
pattern10		pattern10		
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs

249589perforce	svn
pattern4		
i agree with the previous yuval - having worked with perforce and svn both in gui and command-line mode i prefer svn

249617bazaar	git	bazaar	perforce
pattern4		
for many of the cases where subversion trumps perforce many people seem to prefer the distributed systems like git bazaar mercurial these days

251995getter	setter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable they do no more harm.

254023aptana	radrails
pattern4		
i prefer aptana radrails on both mac and linux

256092bazaar	git
pattern7	imo simpler	
bazaar is a distributed version tool just like git but is imo simpler to setup and use

257953width	height
pattern7		
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the window height

259080bluej	greenfoot
pattern7		pattern0		
i think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years old

259460postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

259517postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

260148lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
pattern10	more	pattern10	more straightforward	
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

262798innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more

263966ubuntu	centos
pattern10		pattern10		
in this respect ubuntu is less desirable on a server than rhel or centos which stick to more mature versions

269117swt	swing
pattern10		pattern10		
swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui

270764xsl-fo	xslt
pattern4		
you can also use apache fop if you prefer xslt and xsl-fo

277306boost	stl
pattern10		pattern10		
i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions

277511innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

277564bluecloth	rdiscount
pattern8		
rdiscount seems to be much faster and more reliable than bluecloth

281802cvsnt	tortoisecvs
pattern3		
firstly i d recommend using tortoisecvs as it has better cvsnt support

282643codeigniter	cakephp
pattern4		pattern2		
on the other hand i ve never played around with codeigniter so i can t recommend cakephp over codeigniter

283151coalesce	isnull
pattern4		
you also could read an article which compares coalesce and isnull

283405jboss	glassfish
pattern7		
i think glassfish is a better j2ee app server to start with than jboss

283405jboss	glassfish
pattern7	smaller	
jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find it easier to understand

285023quicksort	heapsort
pattern0		
i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort

288440salt	md5
pattern4		
get md5 js implementation and compare salt

288727floating-point	integer
pattern7		pattern0		
which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type

289468children	parent
pattern7		pattern0		
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do

289841inherited	properties
pattern4		
to access those properties or methods i need to make them public which defeats encapsulation or re-write them into my class which defeats inherited

291267lisp	scheme
pattern3		
if you re shaky on recursion at all i highly recommend learning scheme or lisp

292975domxpath	domdocument
pattern10	more	pattern10	more suitable	
for this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitable

294097redmine	trac
pattern0		
redmine handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than trac

294103bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
pattern4		
i worked on a project for one place that were forced to use a locking system and opted to use no control at all so i set up a secret svn branch even though i much prefer bazaar or git

294978int	double
pattern7	wider	
if you assign an int to a double there s no loss of precision because double is wider

298978lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
pattern4		
gimel and tim recommend lxml which is a nicely pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries

303277mapguide	arcmap
pattern0		
i mostly work with esri software though i ve had a little bit of work with mapguide mostly for clients whose engineering departments are using cad more than arcmap

303480kate	kde
pattern4		
i recommend kate part of kde as an editor

304069ant	maven
pattern7		pattern0		
however some things ant handles better than maven and if there s not a maven plugin for it it may be difficult to handle in maven

305216ant	maven
pattern0		
i think that inventing something better than both ant and maven wouldn t be that difficult but that tool doesn t seem to exist yet

307238getter	setter
pattern7		
from a performance and design perspective using annotations on getter is a better idea than member variables because the getter setter are called using reflection if placed on the field than a method

311896lisp	scheme
pattern0		
i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too

315407cos	sin
pattern0		
using a-star instead of brute force pathfinding will be faster just like how bresenham circles are better than using sin cos

317990crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

319433gif	png
pattern0		
paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation

323429trac	bugzilla
pattern4		
i have used both and didn t like them at all i prefer trac thou if you really need to choose between those two i d go for bugzilla

323542redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	redmine	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla	mantis	bugzilla
pattern0		
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis

323542redmine	trac
pattern0		
the authors of redmine are trying to create a better trac than trac

323893mantis	bugzilla
pattern4		
i ve used bugzilla and mantis but i prefer mantis simplicity

324355lxml	libxml2
pattern4		
but i prefer libxml2 and lxml for python because it seems to be more actively developed and tested

327393union	distinct
pattern4		
as other users said union is used to select distinct values from two tables

329742vim	emacs
pattern4		
as for an editor if you like cli stuff then emacs or vim is the way to go i prefer emacs

330657post	get
pattern3		
security wise i prefer using post than get as it gives at least some opaqueness as to what is being passed as a parameter and not anyone can just edit the url and play around

330918min	max
pattern4		
does hibernate hql queries support using select min max count and other sql functions

332211postgresql	mysql
pattern10	more	pattern10	more attractive	
for large and complicated systems yes there are enough bugs quirks that can rear their ugly heads - i am convinced that the reason that people tend to always go with mysql over postgresql is that the name mysql is much more attractive

332459postgresql	mysql
pattern7	less	
i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysql which i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested

333440activemq	rabbitmq
pattern10		pattern10		
apache activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine

337764int	chars
pattern0		
for lookup tables with a low volume of rows you can use a 3 chars code as the primary key as this takes less room than an int but the performance difference is negligible

338537config	ini
pattern4		
i am using zend_config_ini config adapter i prefer ini for base config

340054width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
add a new row until height is greater than width

340054width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
add a new column until width is greater than height

344281folder	directory
pattern7	harder	
the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for

344492google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	nicer	
used to be firefox but google-chrome is nicer out of the box

348306wordpress	phpbb
pattern7	more	
a typical lamp application like wordpress or phpbb runs more than 10 queries per pageview without problems

348548codeigniter	kohana
pattern4		pattern2		
i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv

354420listview	gridview	gridview	detailsview
pattern4		pattern2		
personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html

356602innodb	myisam
pattern4		
if your application generates a lot of updates you ll prefer innodb storage engine which allows to lock only one row when updating vs all the table on myisam

360494cpu	processors
pattern7		
passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors

361372moq	typemock
pattern4		
so far i found that we can buy typemock to mock the sharepoint objects and then use any free mocking framework moq

361681range	min
pattern0		
grid min value should be either 0 or a nice value lower than the min value of the data in range

365630for-loop	loops
pattern7		
i did test it a while ago with the result that a for-loop is much faster than a foreach loops

365804dlsym	dlopen
pattern0		
given that i know little about apache modules i would try to remove apache from the equation try writing a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits

365834innodb	myisam
pattern7		
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

365945firefox	safari
pattern0		
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery

367387versioning	upgrade
pattern0		
this code is more for an example and in this example below it is checking to see if the versioning of notepad.exe needs to be upgrade that means the versioning stored in the property table value notepad_verson is greater than the versioning of notepad.exe on the system

368466directx	gdi
pattern10		pattern10		
to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics

369779entity-relationship	diagram
pattern3		
well a picture tells a thousand words so i would recommend creating entity-relationship diagram where you can view the relationship between tables at a glance something that is hard to do with a text-only description

371821apache	lighttpd
pattern10		pattern10		
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache

373983rtp	rtcp	rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp	rtcp	sdp
pattern0		
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.

375160getter	setter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more complex	pattern10	more complex	
if the getter setter is any more complex than that i would use get_x and set_x

377519int	double
pattern7	higher	
i d guess that when calling mymethod 5 5 could be a double or an int as well and double has higher priority

380074innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		pattern7		pattern10	more	pattern10	more resistant	
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

380092int	chars
pattern0		
well then an int field may just be a better bet than a chars 50

380757redmine	trac
pattern4		pattern8		
i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac

382518imperative	declarative
pattern7		
declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code

384083googletest	cppunit
pattern2		
i prefer cruisecontrol.net with cppunit but i don t have any experience or knowledge of the googletest framework

384102tortoisegit	svn
pattern0		
nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk

386826ati	nvidia
pattern0		
a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this

386835redmine	trac
pattern0		
redmine is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than trac and seems to be much easier to administer

388146free	memmove
pattern8		
the compiler is free to choose a method that is more efficient than memmove

388422fink	macports
pattern10		pattern10		
i second macports it is more up to date than fink and closer to the freebsd ports system where i come from

389813sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7		pattern0		
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

389813sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7		
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

389813sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern10		pattern10		
if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

389824innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

389824innodb	myisam
pattern2		
innodb wins over myisam frequently enough that it s clearly not possible to say one is faster than the other

392733haskell	scheme
pattern0		
some background i m learning haskell now having earlier worked with scheme and cl and a little foray into clojure

393362perl	tcl
pattern0		
tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb

396601ienumerable	ilist
pattern2		
i would choose between ilist and ienumerable and wouldn t consider array at all

396838opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
pattern4		
you may prefer firefox opera safari because it s safer technologically superior or whatever but you may lose several users that way remember firefox has only recently reached 20 of usage share

399122int	chars
pattern7	larger	
there have been machines where sizeof int will be one value probably 4 but where sizeof chars is larger

400867mouse	keyboard
pattern7	easier	pattern7	easier	
getting proficient with a mix of sr and keyboard mouse is much easier than full hands-free operation

401279vsto	add-in
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
vba add-in are a bit troublesome to deploy but vsto is even more so

402030width	height
pattern0		
if the distance between the center of the circle and all of the vertices is greater than the radius of the circle and all of those distances are shorter than the width and height of the rectangle then the circle should be inside of the rectangle

402806trie	tree
pattern10		pattern10		
a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie

404634freemarker	velocity
pattern4		
i actually slightly prefer freemarker to velocity just in case you re open to exploring other options

405022innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

405022innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns

406288getter	setter
pattern10	example more	pattern10	example more clear	
i feel like the getter setter example is more clear and hides the implementation details of what name and description are

406323google-chrome	safari
pattern4		
in this benchmark safari 3.1 2 actually beats google-chrome despite having a js engine that is clearly much much slower this is basically due to more efficient bindings between jsc webcore the dom rendering etc of webkit and v8 webcore

406426lisp	prolog
pattern0		
i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think

408820awt	swing
pattern10		pattern10		
are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa

408853vim	gedit
pattern4		
normal people prefer gedit instead of vim

408981pyopengl	pyglet
pattern7		pattern0		
i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopengl

409563int	boolean
pattern7	more	
returning boolean or an int is more of a c mindset than a java in java you would just handle the exception one

410176photoshop	fireworks
pattern7		
i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill

410465profiler	perf
pattern10		pattern10		
a profiler gives you more detailed information which can help to diagnose and fix perf problems

411994postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
with that said if you are worried about sql server licensing costs i d recommend postgresql first or mysql second as your database of choice

413752ant	maven
pattern0		
i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well

414289mouse	keyboard
pattern0		
the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse

414763subtraction	modulo
pattern0		
as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction

415743vmware	virtualbox
pattern7	route simpler	
i managed to use andlinux + wine to get this working but honestly i think the vmware virtual pc virtualbox route is simpler

416947awt	swing
pattern0		
i mean by light weight i thought maybe the swing components occupy less memory than the awt components

417342multiplying	subtract
pattern8		
adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly

419590gif	png
pattern4		
the web favors gif jpg and png mostly

421566minimum	max
pattern0		
the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes

422343intersect	contains
pattern7		
given two ranges a a b and c c d do they intersect is one greater than the other or does one contains the other

425058tiff	png
pattern4		
tiff can beat png by about 2 1 43k vs

425355width	height
pattern7	greater	
for a cross-browser experience its either scroll width height or offset width height whichever is greater

430730post	get
pattern0		
or how is it better than post redirect get if the functions can in fact be used in solving my particular problem

430883junit	testng
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example

431398apache	nginx
pattern0		
so you can do a django redirect_to urlconf entry but you d be better off with an apache or nginx or insert-your-webserver-here redirect so the initial request never has to hit django at all

432306lisp	scheme
pattern4		
if you do choose a lisp variant i recommend scheme

433998int	chars
pattern0		
note that in c++ literals having more than one chars still have type int although their value is implementation defined

434277post	get
pattern0		
now that you accept more than simple get post json or xml your model will have to distinguish between each request type and know how to parse them

436503google-chrome	firefox
pattern2		
currently there s somewhat of an arms race between google-chrome firefox and webkit s javascript interpreters which has really improved the speed situation with javascript

436535division	multiplication
pattern0		
can be fast or it can be awfully slow even if division is done entirely in hardware if it is done using a div instruction this instruction is about 3 to 4 times slower than a multiplication on modern cpus

436535multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
pattern0		
in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine

436535division	multiplication
pattern0		
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division

439818postgresql	mysql
pattern2		
i have never used postgresql myself but i think it s mostly a matter of taste whether you prefer it over mysql

440239int	double
pattern8		
this shouldn t come as any surprise - there are more long values than double given the nan values and plenty of double aren t int so we can t expect every long to be exactly representable

442181postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

446962ati	nvidia
pattern4		
are there any third-party reports that compare ati s stream framework to nvidia s cuda framework ie not from ati or nvidia talking themselves up

448892mp3	flv
pattern3		
i would recommend using mp3 audio and flash using the free jw flv media player which should do everything that you want except for the low high quality thing but maybe you can just use two players if you need

449516getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd d getdate 8 - dow getdate

449918webclient	webrequest
pattern7		
webclient is simpler to use than webrequest

453751kerberos	ntlm
pattern7		pattern0		
in fact in some ways ntlm is better than kerberos

454121x86	mips
pattern8		
x86 have more complex instructions than mips

455359int	double
pattern8		
int and string are really quite different certainly more different than int and double

456500freemarker	velocity
pattern4		
i prefer freemarker here over velocity

460360springsource	grails
pattern4		
i also choose grails over simplicity and there are lots of java lib such as jasper report jawr etc and i am glad that now they join with springsource which makes their base solid

462567equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object

462722textwrangler	bbedit
pattern4		
if the text editor in xcode doesn t suit you i d recommend bbedit or its free little brother textwrangler

463420freemarker	velocity
pattern7		pattern0		
velocity is simpler than freemarker

463420freemarker	velocity
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
freemarker is more powerful than velocity

463954firefox	safari
pattern7		pattern4		
firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall

465728subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern0		
i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

466508inherited	subclassing
pattern4		
if you still want to favor inherited without necessarily thinking in terms of base class and subclassing you can simply define an interface ex

467418int	double	int	boolean
pattern4		
the surprising thing is that a single matlab data type may match different java data types logical matches boolean byte short int long float and double in that order of precedence

467696vmware	virtualbox
pattern4		
it was developed with only various versions of windows in mind and from my experience there s always some sort of problem running any linux distro under it. i would recommend vmware as suggested above or alternatively virtualbox which has worked very well for me in the past it runs certain linux distros best though i can t remember which ones

468724equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

470267int	double
pattern10	more	pattern10	more reliable	
this one s an overflow but i think it illustrates the unreliability of isnumeric in general especially for int - for double it s much more reliable

471259trac	bugzilla
pattern0		
trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible

471804rss	feed
pattern4		
i have used it for several years to grab rss feed

472158sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7		pattern0		
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

472158sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7		
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

472283for-loop	loops
pattern7		
the conclusion of the article is that using for-loop is generally better and faster than the foreach loops

472333disk	ram
pattern7		pattern0		
ram is much faster than disk

475026crypt	hash
pattern4		
also instead of using crypt you may prefer hash because this allows you to keep the string setting for the hash algorithm elsewhere

476792cvs	svn
pattern4		pattern2		
i would recommend svn over cvs although distributed version tracking tools like git and mercurial seem to be very popular among open source projects

480067ftgl	freetype
pattern4		
id recommend ftgl as already recommended above however i have implemented a freetype opengl renderer myself and thought you might find the code handy if you want reinvent this wheel yourself

482268hash	salt
pattern0		
you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from its hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

482412ftp	smb
pattern10		pattern10		
push log files to a central location ftp is faster than smb the windows ftp command can be automated with -s scriptfile

484066hex	binary
pattern7		
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

484840runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
pattern0		
note better than just runtimeexception would be to use a more specific unchecked-exception if one is available

484849hex	binary
pattern7		
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

486951nunit	mstest
pattern8		
attributes are used in a more meaningful manner than mstest or nunit

487454quicksort	mergesort
pattern7		
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort

488946superclass	subclassing
pattern10		pattern10		
if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ method

488978mockito	easymock
pattern7	plugin more	
the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work

491263union	distinct
pattern4		
depending on the number of rows returned you may be best using union all on the selects with a select distinct query around it

492954hash	salt
pattern4		
hash salt password that matches username and see if password matches hash

493221codeigniter	cakephp
pattern4		
of the frameworks i ve tried cakephp and codeigniter i prefer cakephp

495528vbscript	jscript
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection

496124toolbar	docking
pattern4		
however dockpaneleftof does not seem to work in this case so you lose docking toolbar next to each other

497794quicksort	mergesort
pattern0		
i had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this

497819quicksort	mergesort
pattern0		
previously discussed on so why is quicksort better than mergesort

497849mergesort	in-place
pattern7		
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort

497967quicksort	mergesort
pattern4		
i actually just wrote a linked-list comparative sort demo program in c and arrived at a similar conclusion that mergesort will beat quicksort for most uses altho i have been told that quicksort is generally not used for linked lists anyway

497967quicksort	mergesort
pattern7		pattern0		
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great

498069inherited	properties
pattern0		
if a browser s stylesheet does define a style for all types of element and this style has a higher precendence than inherited then inherited properties values should never be observed

498840integer	unsigned
pattern7	type rank greater	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

500622komodo	notepad++
pattern2		
if i had to choose between notepad++ and komodo i would choose pyscripter

502658vim	jedit
pattern4		
personally i would recommend jedit rather than vim

502970calloc	malloc
pattern4		
just this feature alone would be enough for me to prefer calloc to malloc

503943bazaar	git
pattern4		
as an alternative to git which has already been mentioned i would highly recommend bazaar

505839width	height
pattern10		pattern10		
my fixed document xps has its page orientation set to landscape the page media size has a width that is longer that its height and it displays correctly in the viewer as landscape

505901vb.net	vb6
pattern4		
if you want to learn more about tdd and unit testing you should apply it to functions or procedures in vb6 -- although i d recommend vb.net or c# and doing object-oriented development

506241division	multiplication
pattern0		
division is per se slower than multiplication however i don t know the details

506252division	multiplication
pattern0		
both operations are done down at the floating point unit fpu level and even in the world of integral alus the division circuit is a far busier place than a multiplication circuit

509703sproutcore	javascriptmvc
pattern0		
it s probably overkill for what you need but sproutcore is an mvc framework and it doesn t look any more heavyweight than javascriptmvc or trimpath s junction

511928int	double
pattern7		
the largest double value is also larger than the largest int so it would have to be a long

511966innodb	myisam
pattern10	more	pattern10	more efficient	
if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries

512569xsl-fo	xslt
pattern7		
all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo

514184floating-point	integer
pattern7		pattern0		
they take up more space and floating-point math is slower than integer math

515325wxpython	qt-designer
pattern10		pattern10		
as far as i can tell qt-designer is more powerful than any wxpython counterpart like boa constructor and pyglade

515501union	distinct
pattern4		
so there is no need to use select distinct combined with a union

516941disk	ram
pattern0		
disk space is probably always going to be cheaper than ram

518893vim	emacs
pattern4		
i am capable of using vim in a pinch but i really prefer emacs

519191emacs	jedit
pattern7	better	
jedit is still pretty good but emacs is quite better

521392maven	pom.xml
pattern7	easier	
sure there is a learning curve with maven but reading a pom.xml is far easier than reading a build.xml

522537goto	break
pattern4		
a much simpler way of inspecting the code in msvc is to simply set a break point and inspect the disassembly right click on the line and select goto disassembly from the pop-up menu

522964gif	png	tiff	png
pattern4		
other than that it s up to the uses of the images quality compression etc. in terms of whether you choose png gif jpeg tiff etc

525029backtracking	greedy
pattern4		
it doesn t show how to do greedy nongreedy matches backtracking matching within a line instead of the whole line and other more esoteric features of state machines that are easily handled by the re syntax

526070int	double
pattern7		
today i noticed that when i cast a double that is greater than the maximum possible int to an int i get -2147483648

526070int	double
pattern7		
similarly when i cast a double that is less than the minimum possible int i also get -2147483648

526337lisp	scheme
pattern4		
ever since reading what paul graham has to say about lisp i ve been intending to go back and pick scheme up again and see if it ll improve my programming in general

530086freebsd	linux
pattern10		pattern10		
just a tip but from personal experience i ve found that freebsd works much better on low-end hardware than a modern linux distro does

531772x86	64bit
pattern7		
reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly

534243crypto++	libtomcrypt
pattern4		
i can recommend crypto++ or libtomcrypt for that

535933apache	nginx
pattern0		
not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content

539857translation	localization
pattern7		
localization it s easier to translation text than images

542234awt	swing
pattern7	more	
which java framework awt or swing makes more sense for something this simple

544898northwind	adventureworks
pattern0		
what are your strategies best practices when it comes to dealing with a reasonably sized sql server database anything larger than northwind or adventureworks - do you use multiple filegroups

548312int	chars
pattern0		
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined

548356int	chars
pattern0		
when an int is declared using a chars constant of more than one chars it is sensitive to the byte order of the machine for which the constant was developed

548827boost	stl
pattern8		
boost libraries are generally less mature and less standard than stl

548848boost	stl
pattern0		
once you re past the basics with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost

550564int	double
pattern7		
even though a standard conversion sequence converting from int float double to long double is better than a user-defined conversion sequence converting from myclass to long double your operator version is not chosen because your other parameter long double requires a conversion from the argument which is worse than what the builtin operator needs for that argument perfect match

551068datamapper	activerecord
pattern4		
if what you want is to compare activerecord rails and datamapper hibernate the data source architectural patterns chapter from patterns of enterprise application architecture is a good place to start

551342vim	emacs
pattern7		
since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

559225cvsnt	svn
pattern7		
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints

559937trac	bugzilla
pattern8		
i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill

560114accessor	properties
pattern7		
and lastly the properties makes refactoring easier for example when the value later is no longer stored in a variable but is calculated inside the properties accessor or comes from some other source variable

562990boost	stl
pattern0		
.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost

563472lisp	scheme
pattern7		pattern0		
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp

565933disk	ram
pattern7		
buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk

568703opensuse	linux
pattern0		
i have used a lot more than 10 linux distributions and i now stick to opensuse

569500width	height
pattern0		
there is no automatic clipping performed so you have to ensure that parameters top and left are not smaller than 0 zero and left + as well as top + are not greater than the width or height of the destination image respectively

570223postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
i also greatly prefer postgresql but i think if you re planning to use other peoples php applications forums blogs etc it s just a reality that you re probably going to have to run mysql to support them

570247postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql

572622ubuntu	debian
pattern4		
i highly recommend debian or ubuntu server for domain-0

575934opera	firefox
pattern4		
most of opera s features are eventually available copied to firefox as plugins but i still prefer opera at home because the text looks better

576296skip-lists	tree
pattern0		
so as you can see the random binary search tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists

579589innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average

584128udp	tcp
pattern0		
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

584131udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		pattern0		pattern0		
tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

584198pdfbox	itext
pattern0		
start with pdfbox as it s text extraction abilities are better than itext s

584890yslow	pagespeed
pattern0		
in my testing so far google s pagespeed addon is far and above much better than yslow

585100asp.net-mvc	openrasta
pattern7		
i d suggest having a look at openrasta which is much closer to http semantics than asp.net asp.net-mvc is

585102mockups	balsamiq
pattern4		
i d still recommend balsamiq mockups

585442hudson	bamboo
pattern4		
i ve administered both bamboo and hudson and i would recommend hudson

586834postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

592265vim	emacs
pattern2		
you will always be using the best editor for the job if you re able to choose between vim and emacs

592640kerberos	ntlm
pattern0		
kerberos is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site

592640kerberos	ntlm
pattern0		
for a low traffic site the huge tokens that kerberos send across the network actually makes it slower than ntlm

593094lift	wicket
pattern4		
however i strongly prefer wicket and or lift especially the latter

594466int	double
pattern0		
so i asked myself can a double be faster than a int

595351stateless	stateful
pattern4		
one thing i ve learned over the years is that stateless trumps stateful for maintainability

595693for-loop	loops
pattern4		
i would choose for-loop when there is known number maximum number of iterations before loops starts

597265division	multiplication
pattern0		
for example a lot of people that started at a higher level have no idea why shifts are so much faster than multiplication and division or the impact of branching etc

597847northwind	adventureworks
pattern7		pattern0		
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind

598774ant	maven
pattern4		
there are plenty of articles on the net that compare ant and maven so you can look at those but from my experience its always worthwhile to consider how you can improve a project

599070maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
pattern3		
if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files

599070ant	maven
pattern7		
and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy

600969system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
pattern4		
personally i prefer odp.net but system.data.oracleclient will get the job done

601626getter	setter
pattern7	more	
or if your getter takes parameters or your setter takes more than a value parameter

601651debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
pattern4		
you just need very basic functions mostly the standard toolchain. you could pick centos ubuntu fedora debian whatever

601996wxhaskell	gtk2hs
pattern7	likely easier	
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases

602804postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
the advantage with sphinx is easier integration with mysql and postgresql however lucene is more feature-rich

604314width	height	width	margin	margin	height
pattern0		
edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use

605544int	double
pattern7		
the range of double is way greater than the range of 32 or 64 bit int which is why std floor returns a double

605544int	double
pattern7	greater	
casting to int should be fine so long as it s within the appropriate range - but be aware that a double can t represent all 64 bit int exactly so you may also end up with errors when you go beyond the point at which the accuracy of double is such that the difference between two consecutive double is greater than 1

605547int	double
pattern7		
another reason is that the range of double is far greater than that of int

610260memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strncpy
pattern7		
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively

610494strcpy	strncpy
pattern7	safer	
of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does

610542gif	png
pattern7		
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

610565gif	png
pattern0		
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq

610573gif	png
pattern0		
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics

610597gif	png
pattern4		
despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects

610769gif	png
pattern4		
despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects

611303ostringstream	std
pattern4		
i prefer std ostringstream for complex concatenation

612937spaces	delimiter
pattern0		
awk uses a comma surrounded by 0 or more spaces as field delimiter

613917opera	firefox
pattern4		
i do it with firefox opera but i prefer firefox because of firebug

614696telerik	componentart
pattern7		
although it depends on your project size and requriments i recommend devxpress and telerik web windows .i ve used componentart telerik devxpress and i think telerik is better if u are developing web applications.and devxpress are better in winforms.by the way while developing in some cases i came across especially performance problems in telerik products.nevertheless telerik is good choice for web development

614786nginx	lighttpd
pattern4		
this is all done with outer webserver which listens to the world i recommend nginx or lighttpd

618881shadowing	named
pattern4		
it is much more complicated at higher levels at deciding which function class choose named shadowing ambiguous named between namespaces etc. or when compiling to bytecode running ast

619544cpython	pypy
pattern0		
part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental jit generator now in its fifth incarnation and starting to work really well - the goal is for a jited pypy to run much faster than cpython

620976cpython	ironpython
pattern10		pattern10		
i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython

628270haskell	scheme	imperative	declarative	lisp	scheme
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

630233vmware	virtualbox
pattern0		
in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up

630233vmware	virtualbox
pattern10		pattern10		
even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap

630770uiview	catransition
pattern8		
the uiview class methods are convenience methods for common animations but are more limited than catransition

636004subtract	add
pattern4		
it handles leap years leap seconds invalid dates times it can output dates in any format it can compare add subtract etc.

638446udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		pattern7		pattern0		
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

638446udp	mtu	udp	tcp
pattern0		
for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

640303google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

pattern4		
from what i could gather so far people either recommend aes or rsa for this

646461vim	emacs
pattern4		
i d recommend vim if you are going to learn one or the other but i know emacs users will strongly disagree

646610trac	mantis
pattern4		
i d recommend mantis or trac

649736vim	emacs
pattern4		
i have only used emacs briefly and while i prefer vim i am jealous of some of its features

651200rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
pattern7	more	
with a gui interface along with a command line one subversion has tortoisesvn rapidsvn which is more of a traditional ui or ankhsvn for visual studio integration

654112svg	vml
pattern2		
i m writing a bit of javascript and need to choose between svg or vml or both or something else it s a weird world

655564multiplying	multiplication
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple

655581division	multiplication
pattern0		
division algorithms are slower than multiplication algorithms in most cases

655584division	multiplication
pattern0		
which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication

656377entity-relationship	diagram
pattern0		pattern0		
it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools

656559keystore	jks
pattern4		
command summary - to compare jks keystore to pem file

665023postgresql	mysql

pattern2		
you can restrict the number of times a pattern matches with min max

669924jquery	scriptaculous
pattern2		
jquery is light weight especially in compare with scriptaculous

673046folder	directory	folder	dir
pattern4		
i d recommend folder directory or even dir

674037hash	salt
pattern7		
as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content

674849lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
pattern3		
i strongly recommend using html5lib + lxml instead of beautifulsoup

677447gif	png
pattern4		
i prefer png for any internet image work i m doing as gif has a limited palette and jpg doesn t handle transparency

677459config	ini
pattern0		
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested

680030spaces	delimiter
pattern3		
the following should do the necessary but it s inefficient doing two full table selects and it also relies on your exact match being delimiter by spaces

680382opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
pattern4		
i ve checked the site on two machines vista with firefox ie6 ie7 ie8 safari win opera win

680613quicksort	mergesort
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss

681760trie	dawg
pattern10		pattern10		
it is a structure similar to but twice as space-efficient as the dawg that is more efficient than the trie which only compresses prefixes

683028joomla	typo3
pattern8		
i didn t work with these applications yet but afaik typo3 and ezpublish both php are considered much more professional than joomla

686138innodb	myisam
pattern2		
for instance myisam is widely held to be faster at selects than innodb

686982width	height
pattern0		
the padding on the #variablesize would have to be equal to or greater than the width height of the images

688135disk	ram
pattern0		
vs.net makes tons of i o calls and ram disk are much faster than real disk

688567disk	ram
pattern0		
you might want to investigate more than creating ram disk

690380firebird	dbisam
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
something like textolution s proprietary add-on for firebird looks like it could accommodate constructing single complex nested query that would apply both regular and fulltext criteria but dbisam does it more elegantly

691900post	get
pattern8		
eval is more dangerous than get post because the submitted content can run functions like include which can access any file apache has read privileges for or shell_exec which can do anything in the shell the apache user can do etc

694874cobertura	emma
pattern4		pattern2		
i prefer cobertura over emma

698048post	get
pattern0		
an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it

698780subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern0		
addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication

699357int	chars
pattern0		
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars

706428bazaar	git
pattern0		
i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git

706457bazaar	git
pattern0		
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested

709465nunit	mstest
pattern4		pattern2		
i strongly prefer nunit over mstest

710493int	double
pattern7		
this prints derived.foo double - even though the compiler knows there is a matching method with a parameter of type int and the argument is type int and the conversion from int to int is better than the conversion from int to double the fact that only the foo double method is originally declared in derived means the compiler ignores foo int

712054haskell	sml
pattern0		
it is semantically influenced more by java sml haskell and a very obscure oo language called gbeta

713801postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
an alternative would be firebird which is not so flexible but in my experience it is in some cases performing much better than mysql and postgresql

714814public	protected
pattern0		
package-private is stricter than protected and public scopes but more permissive than private scope

715836vim	emacs
pattern2		
i would recommend trying out vim or emacs

718625ienumerable	ilist
pattern3		
i recommend using ienumerable instead of ilist with it you will have more flexibility

720746boost	stl
pattern3		
i would really recommend using stl vector or boost multi_array containers for this

721224int	chars
pattern7		
an implicit cast is disallowed as an int is wider has a greater range of values than a chars

721563gridview	repeater
pattern10		pattern10		
maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it

723329goto	break
pattern0		
labeled break like in java would be better than goto for this purpose

724260nunit	mstest
pattern3		
lastly i would recommend using nunit with testdriven.net - a very useful plugin whether you re doing nunit or mstest

724272post	get
pattern7		
sorry that this post is more of the and for further information... type than a direct answer which i think has now been given-- i just thought it was helpful not to get things lost inside comments

724365free	malloc
pattern10	less	pattern10	less extensible	
this avoids malloc free but is less extensible and more prone to buffer overflow issues so i rarely ever use it

725366min	max
pattern4		
select min value1 max value1 from values_table

725366min	max
pattern4		
select min value2 max value2 from values_table

726875versioning	upgrade
pattern7	less	
upgrade_250 the wordpress 2.5.0 upgrade will be run if the database versioning is less than 7499. each of these functions run their own data migration and population procedures some of which are called during the initial database setup script

728426filtering	grouping
pattern2		
certainly if your select with grouping by has no where clause it s going to be a lot more efficient if you run the report with filtering values

728716width	height
pattern7		
unfortunately using nsstring -stringwithfont forwidth linebreakmode doesn t work - which ever wrap mode you choose the text wraps with a width that is less than the current width and the height becomes 0 on any overflow lines

731695hash	md5
pattern4		
ldap signon should select md5 digest as the authentication type supply the username and then supply the md5 hash of the password

734559typeerror	attributeerror
pattern7	simpler	
many times catching an attributeerror or typeerror is simpler and apparently faster

738996readonly	temporary
pattern4		
when an ie user clicks the link of a file residing in sharepoint and user selects readonly access the file is copied to temporary internet files my application is opened and passed that filename as a parameter

741341subtraction	addition
pattern8		
although i should warn you for anything more complicated than addition and subtraction and shifts you ll need to use non-trivial algorithms

744070cdr	cons
pattern0		
hons generally runs slower than cons because in creating a hons an attempt is made to see whether a hons already exists with the same car and cdr

746301junit	testng
pattern7	more	
you may want to use junit in the part of unit testing but testng is more than a unite testing framework

748094jquery	jqmodal
pattern3		
i would recommend using jquery with the jqmodal plugin instead of using a â popupâ

752002sum	coalesce
pattern4		
update users u mines m set u.mana u.mana + coalesce select sum m.mana_rate from mines m where m.user_id u.id 0

752002sum	coalesce

752147union	distinct
pattern0		
union forces a distinct to occur and there s little slower than distinct

754021vb.net	vb6
pattern4		
if your already familiar with vb5 and vb6 and your just building small desktop utilities then i would recommend vb.net

754723innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb

755202union	distinct
pattern4		
select distinct table.column from table where column like union

756327gridview	datalist
pattern10		pattern10		
gridview has much more bells and whistles than datalist

757699telerik	radwindow
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
telerik has a control called radwindow which is more or less a modal window

761581postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on

761596codeigniter	kohana
pattern10	better	
and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on codeigniter is better

761864public	protected
pattern7		pattern0		
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public

763284swt	swing
pattern4		pattern2		
i would recommend swt over swing any day as it is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and native-feeling swt app while it takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app

763764apache	nginx
pattern10	more	pattern10	more performant	
it seems to be common wisdom that if you are deploying django on an apache server then you should still put an nginx server in front of the application to serve static files at which nginx is more performant

764074verilog	vhdl
pattern8		
pacoblaze was written in verilog which like adam said less common than vhdl

764490merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern8		
this will be made less onerous by ruby-on-rails 3 which is intended to be orm agnostic after the merge with merb

765929installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
pattern7		
as for production side of things upgrading your database in transaction msi-style installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized database-application versioning

766479inherited	properties
pattern7		
multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state

771139ubuntu	linux
pattern4		
i usually prefer linux for programming i program in django on ubuntu

771892quicksort	heapsort
pattern8		
average asymptotic order of quicksort is o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops

772710versioning	upgrade
pattern0		
i am not sure could this be because now the older links after upgrade is been pointed to newer versioning and just linking is not sufficient and need to modify something more on linux

773225hide	show
pattern0		pattern0		
js for tabs generally does no more than show hide maybe load content

774381ferret	sphinx
pattern10	better	
i ve used ferret in the past with few problems although i ve heard sphinx is better

778807django	turbogears
pattern4		
you ll want some kind of framework i d recommend django or turbogears

780111cout	cin
pattern10		pattern10		
scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc

780156free	malloc
pattern0		pattern0		
i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free

782375cvs	svn
pattern8		
in addition another coworker said cvs was a lot more popular than svn

782494cvs	svn
pattern4		pattern2		
there are arguments for keeping cvs if you already have it but for virtually any other case i d recommend svn over cvs and so would most of the people who use either heavily

783534vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
pattern4		
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript

784328int	chars
pattern0		
for example if the string is going to store a decimal-formatted 32-bit int you know that you do not need more than 11 chars to do so

784719pop-up	dialog
pattern0		
use floating divs instead which looks like a modal dialog but are better than the pop-up

784951fiddler	charles
pattern4		
if you use a transparent echoing proxy this can show you all http traffic charles and fiddler are two good example i recommend charles

786330aggregate-functions	sum
pattern4		
you cannot nest aggregate-functions - select sum max x will always error

788881width	height
pattern7		
what would be perfect is keeping the percent height and width while child width is smaller than parent a width

790473rar	zip
pattern0		pattern0		
it s much better compressing than zip rar

790744rsa	dsa
pattern4		
a practical introduction to gnu privacy guard in windows recommends dsa and elgamal but i would like to know if rsa is good enough to use these days and if so what minimum key size should i use

792460floating-point	integer
pattern7	less	
the difference between each floating-point number and its corresponding integer is less than 1 or equal to 1 if you really must

794801put	get
pattern10		pattern10		
right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work

798046floating-point	integer
pattern7		
i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digit limitation of floating-point variable

799142udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		pattern10	faster	
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

803700nginx	lighttpd
pattern10		pattern10		
it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd

804829lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern0		
lxml is supposed to be much faster and efficient and can do much more than beautifulsoup

805392ssl	https
pattern10	key more	pattern10	key more	
if you have a secure ftp sftp server or secure http ssl https server then curl can accept ssh keys although using an ssl key is more commonly accepted on the internet. it can use those keys to authenticate and establish a secure connection to the directories which have been made public to your user through the server

808889glut	sdl
pattern10	better	
i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better

810193addition	multiplication
pattern7		
well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first

811801haskell	sml
pattern0		
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell

811937junit	testng
pattern7		
testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though

813646haskell	sml
pattern4		
much as i love haskell here are the reasons i would prefer sml for a class in discrete math and data structures and most other beginners classes

813984doc	rtf
pattern7		pattern0		
if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format

814811actionscript	mxml
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as

816576camping	ruby-on-rails	ramaze	camping
pattern0		
i would like to use a lighter framework than ruby-on-rails sinatra ramaze camping but am concerned that by doing so i will not be able to use a lot of shared libraries that have been tailored to ruby-on-rails in the form of plugins

817327xslt	xquery
pattern4		pattern2		
i use and recommend xquery over xslt

818424datamapper	activerecord
pattern4		pattern0		
i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install

819327int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
int is usually bigger than chars â more suitable for calculations but not so suitable for byte-level manipulation

824870mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
pattern3		
that said if you are using only visual studio and will be doing ci builds using cruisecontrol.net or teamcity i d recommend using mbunit or nunit.net

827594haskell	ocaml
pattern7		
haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction

828631sqldatareader	sqlconnection
pattern4		
it s much more difficult in 2.0 until you get your rythym down as previous poster i d recommend sqlconnection and sqldatareader etc

830892cpython	ironpython
pattern4		
for example cpython beats ironpython hands down start up time

831519aggregate-functions	sum
pattern2		
i want to take an ado.net datatable and perform the equivalent of a sql select query with aggregate-functions such as sum on some columns and group by set for the remaining columns

832483post	get
pattern4		pattern2		
when i first started doing web development ten years ago the conventional wisdom was to always favor post over get for forms and to have the application on the server side require post for form submission for precisely this reason

832496post	get
pattern4		pattern2		
the point isn t to prefer get over post the point is to use get where the request doesn t affect the data on the server and post where data is modified

832606post	get
pattern4		pattern2		
the already-given answers really do answer your question - no prevention of xss is not a valid reason to prefer post over get

836856division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

839116int	chars	subtract	add
pattern4		
if you need to compare add and or subtract time only values think about the possibility to use a int to store the time value and then to convert it to chars when displaying the result

839664superclass	subclassing
pattern7		
for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing

840730git-svn	svn2git
pattern0		
using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.

840989int	boolean
pattern0		
so the best approach here is either to use a wider type than int number or pass some flag boolean value to function as well as int to indicate actual value absence

843650django	turbogears
pattern4		
i usually prefer turbogears but django seems to be more smooth at the moment

843733qcodo	qcubed
pattern7		
qcubed community is much stronger at the moment so you might want to check in qcodo forum for your answers on basic problems but post on the qcubed forum

844519tapestry	wicket
pattern2		
beyond ones already suggested i would recommend checking out tapestry and wicket many developers like them

845066cpython	ironpython
pattern0		
i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home

846356postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query

848039for-loop	loops
pattern7		
the scope of the variable in the test of the while loops is wider than the scope of variables declared in the header of the for-loop

848572disk	ram
pattern7		
memory is a bottleneck to performance ram runs slower than the cpu and if you re paging to disk than it s really slow

851210range	max	range	min	min	max
pattern7	less	
and during sometime i have a range where min and max is less than 1 and greater than 0

851468strcpy	strncpy
pattern7	safer	
concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows

851496min	max
pattern4		
select min effdate max termdate from tab1

853042ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

857530int	chars
pattern4		
is there any reason why i should choose int statusid over chars 4 statuscode

857530int	chars
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
since sql server doesn t support named constants chars is far more descriptive than int when used in stored procedure and views as constants

857900isnull	nullif
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
in my opinion using isnull nullif is faster than using case when

859588versioning	upgrade
pattern4		
bear in mind that you can buy upgrade editions of vs and upgrade from the express versioning or even eclipse

862585button	checkbox
pattern4		
okay lets ignore safari for a while skinning input and button are rather easy but how to completely skin select checkbox radio etc

864659des	rsa

also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

871372union	distinct
pattern7		pattern0		
also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

874977innodb	myisam
pattern4		pattern2		
for mysql performance you should probably choose myisam over innodb as the storage engine provided your definition of optimal doesn t include most reliable

876774pascal	delphi
pattern7	solution easier	
delphi users might want to look at free pascal s paralel implementation of libchm since a pascal solution makes it easier embeddable

876945filtering	grouping
pattern2		
select settings under filtering keys grouping in here you can switch off repeating keys for that user on that machine

879201colt	jama
pattern8		pattern0		
colt does this already but i have found it is more complicated and more powerful than jama which may explain why simple functions are slower with colt

880821lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern10		pattern10		
i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now

882318ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
pattern4		
if you return collections or instance and if you choose ienumerable iqueryable ilist list or whatever depends on your needs

882572launch4j	jsmooth
pattern4		
if you want a no fuss way for the end user to kick off a program with multiple jar dependencies you may want to look at launch4j or jsmooth i prefer launch4j

883177imagemagick	libtiff
pattern7	quicker	
ghostscript and imagemagick convert should also be able to do this for you although libtiff is supposedly quicker

884697subtraction	addition	division	subtraction	division	addition
pattern10		pattern10		
the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

885598cifs	smb
pattern0		pattern0		
nfs with the right setup version and tuning is just a tad slower than smb cifs

886136rank	max
pattern0		
while i think gbn s answer is probably sufficient i m wondering whether use of an over clause to establish a max date per id attribute with which to reduce the select in a where clause wouldn t be faster than a rank

886207int	double
pattern10	etc more	pattern10	etc more	
using string int double etc is more expected and therefore more maintainable

887983udp	mtu
pattern0		
3 you are sending messages that are bigger than the udp max message size 4 each device in your network has a max message size mtu so you might be exceeding a limit there

888389deselect	multi-select
pattern4		
you can multi-select with shift and then select deselect the group

890438sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7		pattern0		
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

890438sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern0		
if the sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary

893300wmv	asf	wma	asf
pattern4		
if compatibility supercedes compression i would recommend asf which is basically just a container for wma and wmv

896482webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern10	less	pattern10	less convenient	
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false

897118disk	ram
pattern0		
if your working set is larger than your ram the operating system will be constantly swapping pages out to disk to make room to swap in pages that an application wants to access

897862bazaar	git
pattern0		pattern7		pattern0		
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference

898011klocwork	coverity
pattern4		
many companies see value and choose coverity or klocwork for a longer term solution although i see also running findbugs and pmd

898763subtraction	modulo	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	modulo	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	modulo	addition	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
pattern0		
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

899887division	multiplication

multiplication is faster than division so the second method is faster

899929division	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
if the latter yes floating point multiplication is generally faster than division

899967firefox	safari
pattern0		
in safari we found that the dom level 0 took twice the time off the dom level 2 but was still four times faster than either firefox case

901588monodevelop	sharpdevelop
pattern4		
n3 for web my preference will be vwd but for other stuff i ll prefer monodevelop and sharpdevelop

901826ubuntu	linux

at home w ubuntu linux virtualbox is easier to maintain performs as well as i require and is free

903548bitarray	bitvector
pattern8		
why is the bitvector 32 structure more efficient than bitarray

905454websphere	ibm
pattern4		
as stated by martin service is a crucial part of why people purchase ibm websphere products and btw

910557width	height
pattern7	less	
then when an image is loaded the rectangle s style checks its triggers to see if the image has a height or width that is less than 100px

912233pull	push
pattern10		pattern10		
why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters

913928junit	testng
pattern0		
if there is a junit extension or similar framework that provides a better solution than testng then please let me know

914297int	chars	implements	extends
pattern7		
plain chars having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extends a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain chars unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain chars gets implements as signed

917748fileoutputstream	filewriter
pattern3		
note that i wouldn t recommend using filewriter to write to a file - use a fileoutputstream and an outputstreamwriter chained onto it as this lets you set the character encoding instead of using the platform default one

921679children	parent
pattern0		
so long as the nodes in general have more parent than children this direction will be much faster

922429width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
it s close - i m finding if height is greater than width the left position of the rotated image is incorrect

922429width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
similarly if width is greater than height the top position of the rotated image is incorrect

923190mouse	keyboard
pattern8		
also in this case keyboard input is essential and more important than mouse interaction

924296min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
probably the line drawer was a bresenham modified to skip the points drawn unless they were greater than max or less than min

928247width	height
pattern7	more	
meaning if the height divided by width gives more than 1

928389union	distinct
pattern4		pattern4		
insert b col1 select distinct col1 from a union select distinct col2 from a

929548emacs	aquamacs
pattern7		
carbon emacs is closer to the unix emacs experience whereas the aquamacs people have put considerable effort into os x integration

931234children	parent
pattern0		
in the same breath i would also like to be able to run a specific number of child processes at any given time say for example n children running concurrently whenever one exits the parent process starts another child if needed but has no more than n children at any given moment

932360postgresql	mysql	innodb	myisam
pattern4		
this blog does provide one reason to prefer postgresql you can have full-text search and still be transactional while in mysql full-text indexing only work on myisam tables not innodb except if you add sphinx of course also see this follow-on for a bit more on full-text search in postgresql and lucene

933047superclass	subclassing
pattern0		
you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have

937211disk	ram
pattern0		
at some point if you re doing randomish queries and your working set is sufficiently larger than ram then you ll be limited by the small number of random iops a disk can do

937557filtering	grouping
pattern7	higher	pattern7	higher	
words grouping filtering has higher

941325quicksort	heapsort
pattern10		pattern10		
in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort

941325quicksort	heapsort
pattern0		
each iteration in quicksort is a lot simpler than heapsort

941685xna	spritebatch
pattern0		
in xna when is it appropriate to render your game content using more than one spritebatch

942017x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
pattern8		
in fact for x86 64 processors performing 32-bit or 16-bit operations are less efficient than 64bit or 8-bit operations due to the operand prefix byte that has to be decoded

942223punctuation	words
pattern4		
this matches words digits and a number of punctuation characters though by no means all

942786swt	swing
pattern2		
depending on who you ask it is either wonderful or evil since it competes with swing and makes use of native os widgets swt

943494ant	maven
pattern7	broader	
having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management

953814postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

953814postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

955645int	chars
pattern0		
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be shorter than a int one

955645int	chars
pattern0		
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be greater than a int one

957655postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysql optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with

960774sum	coalesce
pattern0		
i m pretty sure the linker will coalesce equivalent strings so the total will be less than the sum of the parts for these sections but i guess typically not by much

961662quicksort	mergesort
pattern0		
in most cases quicksort will run faster than mergesort even though the worst-case execution time is longer

962301octal	binary
pattern10		pattern10		
when converting from binary to octal it s more easy each 3 bits give you 1 digit in octal

962399vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6	vb6	vba
pattern0		
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

962806integer	unsigned	16-bit	64bit	unsigned	short
pattern0		
a number bigger than 64bit can never occur in a multiplication because c is an unsigned integer of 32 bits and k is a unsigned short of 16-bit

964541int	chars
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
sometimes chars type is more usable than int - fixed size chars doesn t take much storage room and you can see enumerated values directly in database fields

965313imagemagick	libjpeg
pattern0		
basically imagemagick was only slightly slower than libjpeg

966107int	chars
pattern10		pattern10		
far better to use a surrogate key and yes a join on an int is often faster and you can join in delete staments in many databases not use the slower subquery especially since names tend to be longer than a few chars

966689coff	omf
pattern4		
watcom c c++ v11.0 seems to prefer coff when compiling and linking windows applications but generates omf object files for use with their dos4gw 32-bit protected-mode dos-extender

967805emacs	textmate
pattern0		
i feel like emacs is so much better than textmate

967921primes	modulus
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
someone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing argument that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swapping

968640bazaar	git
pattern2		
as for the first tool to choose problem with git bazaar and mercurial is they are distributed vcs s

969709disk	ram
pattern0		
in future these lists may be read from disk and larger than available ram

970621lxml	elementtree
pattern4		
i would normally recommend lxml but since that uses a c-library libxml the alternative would have to be as aaron has already suggested elementtree as far as i know there is both a pure python and a c implementation of it available

971690width	height
pattern4		
i disagree i have been able to set select width and height using css with something like this

972203spaces	delimiter
pattern0		
this method can handle more delimiter than spaces by the regex being used

973083google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
you could also just recommend google-chrome or firefox

973361ocamllex	ocamlyacc
pattern4		
one of the main reasons i still prefer ocamlyacc ocamllex over treetop despite its very sexy appearance. this means you need to convert from left recursive forms to right recursion

973476redmine	trac
pattern4		
i would recommend redmine similar with trac in many aspects

977044cvsnt	tortoisecvs
pattern3		
since you re on windows i recommend installing tortoisecvs and then configuring the included cvsnt server as follows

977462vim	emacs
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
emacs is more powerful than vim it s scripting engine is far more flexible and there are far more scripts modes and the likes built around emacs

977462vim	emacs
pattern7		pattern7		
maybe not productive in the same way - i d say vim is quicker for editing files emacs is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the vim equivalent

980929udp	tcp
pattern7	ip simpler	
udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag

980962division	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		
on many processors integer multiplication is faster than integer division

981089getdate	datepart
pattern4		
select datepart dd getdate

982185sudo	passwd
pattern10		pattern10		
sudo is better in most respects but still requires a passwd which asroot does not

982437richfaces	icefaces
pattern7	more	
my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs

986203vim	emacs
pattern4		
a lot of people in the #python channel of freenode seem to prefer vim emacs nano and similar text editors in favor of ide s

989209ant	maven
pattern0		
i find the ant one much clearer than the maven one

990780innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it

990830innodb	myisam
pattern7		
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out

994571versioning	upgrade
pattern0		pattern0		
if i enable this then any setup is ran every time it will be asking for upgrade either it is on lower versioning over higher versioning or higher versioning over lower versioning

995453union	distinct
pattern4		
union is used to select distinct values from two tables

996052haskell	ocaml
pattern0		
i would just use ocaml but haskell s syntax is so much better than ocaml s and haskell is pure and has cool features such as type classes

999268width	height
pattern7		
if the orginal file s width is greater than 480 or lessthan 450 then i want to set the width of output image as 450px.and the height has to be proportional of the width

1001196datamapper	activerecord
pattern7	easier	
both use the activerecord pattern so you ll actually get your database tables back in objects without fancy domain logic but datamapper is way easier to work with and is thread-safe

1001806ant	maven
pattern0		
it s a lot easier than ant fully compatible with eclipse use maven eclipse eclipse to create eclipse projects and easy to configure

1001855vbscript	vba
pattern0		
i believe that the reports are using something more along the lines of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that

1003562width	height
pattern2		
whenever you mix padding with ie you start to lose control over width height

1004225disk	ram
pattern0		
the ssd is still slower than ram by orders of magnitude but it s quite reasonable to have a 50gb hash table on disk but not in ram unless you pay big money for big iron

1008671post	get
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
post is not more secure than get as itâ s also send unencrypted

1008704post	get
pattern7		pattern0		
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

1010388integer	unsigned
pattern7	type rank greater	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

1010388int	chars
pattern7	greater	
the unsigned chars would be converted to 152 as an int which is greater than 7

1010593ant	maven
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins

1011950bazaar	git
pattern10		pattern10		
bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git

1011950bazaar	git
pattern7		pattern7	easier	
bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes

1014688richfaces	icefaces
pattern0		
that said i found icefaces to be a useful product and much better than richfaces especially in terms of the quality of the documentation

1016512postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql

1018142vim	emacs
pattern8		
i m just looking for something a little more polished than vim or emacs but not quite as heavyweight as netbeans or eclipse

1018715emacs	gedit
pattern4		
now on linux i still prefer gedit to the other options i ve tried with apologies to vi and emacs fans

1019594getter	setter
pattern0		pattern0		
properties specially automatic properties in .net 3.5 are more concise than setter getter and less lines of code less code to maintain less bugs

1019808multiplication	exponent
pattern7		
as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication

1019934comparator	comparable
pattern2		
treeset uses comparator defined by comparable or compare defined by comparator

1020038vim	emacs
pattern7		pattern0		
it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa

1024985photoshop	fireworks
pattern4		
i don t know either of them but i have always worked with fireworks for things as web design as seemingly opposed to a lot of people who prefer photoshop

1026810argumentnullexception	argumentexception
pattern7	better	
an argumentnullexception would be misleading so argumentexception is a better fit

1027775coalesce	isnull
pattern2		
i was playing around a little with some union selects with coalesce and isnull .

1027808division	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
t is not very important as long as alpha is small otherwise you will run into some rather weird nyquist issues aliasing etc. and if you are working on a processor where multiplication is cheaper than division or fixed-point issues are important precalculate omega

1030688post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get

1032223width	height
pattern7	larger	
texture width or height is larger than the device supports

1032354vmware	virtualbox
pattern4		
everyone seems to be suggesting virtualbox but in my opinion you can t beat vmware at the virtualization game

1034539extjs	gxt
pattern0		
i have worked pretty heavily with both flavors of the gwt extjs libraries though i ve spent more time with gxt recently

1034652gprof	shark
pattern3		
regardless i d strongly recommend using shark instead of gprof - it s very easy to use and superior in pretty much every way to gprof - and doesn t require you to recompile your program

1035179automake	autotools
pattern10		pattern10		
in the case of autotools it is slightly more complicated because not everybody who compiles the software would need automake and autoconf installed only those that need to change the build system adding new files counts as changing the build system

1036076int	chars
pattern0		
although they technically can contain more than one chars the endianness of the resulting int constant is implementation-defined and they re not what you want in this case

1037080swt	swing
pattern2		
what criteria should i use to choose between swt and swing

1037130swt	swing
pattern7		
it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing

1037514swt	swing
pattern2		
my criteria to choose between swt and swing

1037514swt	swing
pattern4		
briefly after my swt eclipse rcp experience - on next project i would choose swing

1037514swt	swing
pattern0		
it api seems for me easier than swt you haven t got to manage disposing components by hand to prevent memory leaks you adding component to panel instead of constructing components with parent panel information former is closer to my previous experience...etc. native look and feel you can get in swing too overall performance is enough good swt should be faster because it s using native components of backed os - but is the performance gain really big pro

1037788coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl	isnull	nvl
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

1042989innodb	myisam
pattern7		
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

1043400gif	png
pattern7	better	
for non-animated gif images a conversion to png8 should be painless and beneficial as png compresses much better

1047997tolower	toupper
pattern10		pattern10		
as a side note using toupper is more efficient than using tolower so toupper would be the way to go

1049679getter	setter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more easy	
is this even possible for starters because this is about adding protocols to setter and a getter is much more easy like

1050080bmp	png
pattern4		
textures use apple s own texture2d class from the samples bmp will work but i recommend png because of the platform optimizations

1050501redmine	trac
pattern0		
we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use

1052188dictionary	map
pattern3		
first regarding the dictionary class that class is considered obselete the documentation recommends using map instead

1053267vb.net	vb6
pattern3		
however if your moving from vb6 then i d recommend learning vb.net or preferably c#

1056048lisp	scheme
pattern4		
in that regard i d recommend scheme which is in my opinion more elegant than common lisp

1059847ftp	telnet
pattern0		
it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each

1063920getter	setter
pattern10		pattern10		
but then your setter is less restricted than your getter which is odd.

1066014ubuntu	linux
pattern4		
if you are new to linux then i defiantly recommend ubuntu

1068152freebsd	linux
pattern10	postgres better	pattern10	postgres better	
migrate to enterprise linux or freebsd postgres works much better on unix type systems mdash

1071887richfaces	icefaces
pattern4		
you should be able to mix and match icefaces and richfaces just fine

1072917ubuntu	linux
pattern4		
if you choose linux then i suggest going with ubuntu as that has one of the best automatic hardware configuration i have seen

1074018button	checkbox
pattern10	more	pattern10	more approchable	
for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined

1075055argumentnullexception	argumentexception
pattern3		
i would recommend using argumentexception or argumentnullexception for parameters passed to routines rather then local variables

1075277bmp	png
pattern4		
also note that without compression also image size is just 30kb for rgb image and if you reduce size to 60x60 pixels image size would be only 10kb without any compression i.e you can use bmp images and if you want lesses sizer but lossless compression you can choose png

1077627ant	maven
pattern7		
maven usage is lower compared to ant but just how much lower is not really known

1078466webkit	gecko
pattern7		pattern0		
webkit is stricter than gecko

1079716icu	gettext
pattern3		
i would highly recommend using icu instead of gettext and the locale stuff offered by the standard library if you are developing a commercial application

1082128cassini	iis
pattern0		
for my webapp the integrated visual studio server cassini ist much slower than iis

1083732webclient	webrequest
pattern8		pattern2		
or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest

1084126gif	png
pattern0		
png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

1090158awt	swing
pattern8		
as far as when awt may be more useful than swing -

1092020serializable	deserialization
pattern7		
the serializable seems quicker but deserialization much slower and the app is doing more deserializing than serializing

1092587ant	maven
pattern3		
if you re just exporting from eclipse directly - i d recommend using ant or maven to get a repeatable build process not tied to the ide

1093097mouseup	mousedown
pattern3		
value for right mouse button is 2 although also note that it recommends using mousedown or mouseup events rather than click

1093986websphere	ibm
pattern4		
buy ibm websphere mq mqseries

1095291mouse	keyboard
pattern4		
the entire taskpane loses keyboard focus to word s main window but retains mouse capture

1099669awt	swing
pattern7	worse	
imho the main reason that they didn t catch on is that they require tended to require too much skill and used awt swing which produces worse uis than what a designer with little programming skills could achieve with flash

1099695udp	tcp
pattern0		
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

1100412union	distinct
pattern4		
i m sorry that i m not able to understand exactly what your issue is but i wonder if your issue stems from the fact that the union operator will eliminate duplicate rows kind of like a select distinct over the combined query

1100868udp	tcp
pattern0		
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

1101716cvs	svn
pattern0		
for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

1101923vb.net	vb6
pattern10		pattern10		
however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008

1104571int	chars
pattern4		
however you can easily get int representations of chars so you can compare chars like so

1105831xfce	gnome
pattern7		pattern0		
xfce runs much smaller than gnome and is full featured

1106588getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd dd ceiling datediff dd 1 1 09 getdate 14 14 1 1 09

1109951int	boolean
pattern4		
we can mix and match boolean and int values in our designs obtaining an if then else that requires evaluating both branches simd style by evaluating cond then + 1 - cond else using 1 as true and 0 as false in cond so you can get away with using the built in arithmetic of your ring to make your circuits more shallow

1111015free	malloc
pattern0		
now if you free some values on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

1117074uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
pattern7		
i am writing an app based on uitabbarcontroller which has more than 10 viewcontrollers with corresponding uinavigationcontroller

1117426nsexception	nserror
pattern10		pattern10		
aside from obejctive-c convention and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want to

1117688division	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
the cpu operation for float division is much more complicated than multiplication

1117702division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
pattern0		pattern0		
if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication

1119713distance	polygons
pattern7		
then i would simply check the edges of all blue polygons whose lower bound of distance is lower than the upper bound of minimal distance against all the edges of the red polygons

1120009distance	polygons
pattern7		
calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found so far

1122616touchesbegan	touchesmoved
pattern10	less	pattern10	less obvious	
however the transition from the initial touchesbegan event to the first touchesmoved is less obvious sometimes the device waits a while

1123182gridview	repeater
pattern0		
a repeater might be a better decision than a gridview as they are friendlier for using custom layouts

1124819getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd dd 0 datediff dd 0 getdate

1124819getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd dd datediff dd 0 getdate 0

1124848vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
pattern10		pattern10		
vbscript is much more convenient than creating an activex on vb6 or c# vb.net

1126681codeigniter	cakephp
pattern4		
i would recommend codeigniter cakephp or zend framework

1128221memcmp	strcmp
pattern10		pattern10		
if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp

1129132filtering	grouping
pattern4		
you can also filtering the display using the audiences functionality so that it only displays to a select grouping of users

1132284ferret	sphinx
pattern4		
most of the articles compare ferret lucene to ultrasphinx or possibly thinking sphinx but none that talk about searchlogic

1135308bazaar	git
pattern4		pattern2		
i choose bazaar over git mercurial coz bazaar is notifications are very well integrated in ubuntu

1135698division	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
integer multiplication is much faster than division

1137216move	drag
pattern10	less	pattern10	less laggy	
i use all the events for the drag operation so maybe the initial move is less laggy perceptually in this case

1139555typedef	struct
pattern4		
for instance here is a regex which will match typedef of struct which point to a single name and may or may not have a pointer

1140056equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if you have written a class which implements its own equality that is different from reference equality then you are required to override gethashcode such that two objects that compare as equals have equals hash codes

1140923postgresql	mysql

mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql

1141264client-side	server-side
pattern8		
not all of the reasons given are necessarily valid but one important one is that unless you re google server-side cpu cycles are a lot more valuable than client-side cycles so it s easier to have the client compile optimize what is quite often dynamically generated html javascript rather than the server

1143578gif	png
pattern10	less	pattern10	less	
this properly means if the file is an image of gif or jpeg or png and is less than that size

1144224margin	height
pattern0		
in conjunction with a negative margin equal to or greater than the height of the top and bottom borders if any to further remove the element

1144979postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
fyi postgresql scales better than mysql on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

1145134post	get
pattern7		pattern0		
and apart from common misleading information where post is safer than get it is not

1146843serializable	deserialization
pattern2		
you should have static xml data that can be used to compare against serializable output and to use as input data for deserialization

1147960subtract	add
pattern0		
this garentees that while a can be issued to the pipeline every cycle it will have a higher latency than an add subtract circuit

1148222versioning	upgrade
pattern7	earlier	
you have to make sure your local sql instance is exactly at the same build versioning versioning like the hosting provider otherwise your local sql may upgrade the database structure and you ll be unable to restore it back on the hosting provider or you ll be unable to restore in on your local server if your versioning is earlier than the host s

1148980powerpc	i386
pattern0		
be aware that there is more than just powerpc and i386 although these are the safest architectures to choose for a universal binary

1149288postgresql	mysql
pattern3		
if you want to go open source i would recommend using postgresql instead of mysql

1156709disk	ram
pattern7		pattern0		
disk is bigger than ram

1158483merb	ruby-on-rails
pattern4		pattern2		
matz himself prefers merb over ruby-on-rails 2 because ruby-on-rails create a dsl on top of ruby which is really against the ruby philosophy

1159503width	height
pattern4		
you have to compare width and height in this method

1161907pascal	delphi
pattern0		
you probably don t want to go back to anything earlier than delphi 3 but some pascal programming books can be helpful

1162378postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance

1162395postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

1163358gif	png
pattern4		pattern2		
and unless you require animation i d always recommend png over gif

1165594for-loop	loops
pattern0		
even if the hypothesis of the while loops being faster than the for-loop were true and it s not the loops you d had to change optimize wouldn t be the outer ones but the inner ones because those are executed more times

1168451division	multiplication
pattern0		
shifting bits left and right is apparently faster than multiplication and division operations on most maybe even all cpus if you happen to be using a power of 2

1168616division	multiplication
pattern0		
this can be a major clock-cycle saver since multiplication is often much faster than a division operation

1168889equals	compareto
pattern2		pattern0		
compareto compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than equals or greater than

1168957cpython	ironpython
pattern7		
cpython probably has better ide support at present than ironpython - so this may be a factor in the choosing of one over the other

1169717hash	md5
pattern4		
for a programming exercise i designed for myself and for use in a pretty non-secure system later on i m trying to compare md5 hash

1172158portrait	landscape
pattern4		
right-click the white space area of the design surface choose report properties page setup choose landscape portrait

1172381sorting	filtering
pattern7		pattern0		
if your author field is selective and sorting is cheaper than filtering

1172817maven	m2e
pattern4		
to enable m2e on an existing project right-click on it in the package explorer view then select maven - enable dependency management this will add the maven builder to the .project file and the classpath container to the .classpath file

1174754width	height
pattern0		
if the player is moving towards one of the edges of the screen and bounds.x y + 30 is less than the height of the current map width it moves the origin so that the player is still centered and displayed on the map

1176994freemarker	velocity
pattern4		
velocity did not give me any problems but having had some experience with freemarker i would probably pick freemarker now

1177246width	height
pattern7	harder	
the fact that you have height length and width makes it harder than a simple knapsack problem

1177422stateless	stateful
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
do you have any situation where stateful is more appropriate than stateless

1177930cassini	iis
pattern7	more	
cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation

1179563fdt	swc
pattern4		
we build the majority of our flash projects in this manner or sort of in reverse where we build the assets in flash professional output a swc of the graphics and use that swc in a better development environment we prefer fdt

1180648ienumerable	icollection
pattern7	more	
the second way i thought is testing for icollection instead of ienumerable since ienumerable is more of a potential collection than an actual one

1180732gridview	datalist
pattern7	better	
from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option

1181839width	height
pattern0		
you re probably being hit by the borders or margins on the body element -- you re asking for document.width height effectively but putting it in an element with a border so the total width of the page canvas.width+ left right borders is then bigger than the width height you originally asked for

1181840disk	ram
pattern0		
if the working set is smaller than your ram it should not be disk bound

1185123haskell	sml
pattern4		pattern2		
i would probably recommend sml over haskell if you feel like trying on a functional language for the first time

1186715pop-up	dialog
pattern7	more	
when you press print in calendar print preview the print dialog that pop-up has more options cross browsers

1188910mantis	bugzilla
pattern8		
since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks

1190551ant	maven
pattern7		pattern0		
while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2

1190656setinterval	settimeout
pattern7	slower	
this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right

1191410folder	directory
pattern0		
if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder

1192000superclass	subclassing
pattern7		
say all instance variables are 32-bit ints for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclassing adds 2 more then each instance of the subclassing will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for its own instance variables plus 12 for the instance variables of the superclass

1192094ubuntu	centos
pattern10	less	pattern10	less	
i don t know if it s activated by default on centos but it might be considering it is on ubuntu which is less entreprise oriented

1192201disk	ram
pattern7		
but becuase reading from ram is usually faster than from other kind of memory storage divice os copy the program from disk on ram and start executing program from there

1194866freebsd	opensolaris
pattern0		
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64 bits out of the box and part of default installation

1195244union	distinct
pattern4		
select distinct and union intersect except no longer always produce sorted output tom

1197324perl	tcl
pattern0		
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn

1197869lwjgl	jogl
pattern7	more	
you are mixing libraries and levels of libraries jogl and lwjgl are both pretty thin wrappers around opengl iirc lwjgl has more wrappers for openal audio

1198169profiler	yourkit
pattern4		
i personally would recommend yourkit java profiler i ve found it much more user-friendly than tptp and while i haven t tested it it should work on os x

1198433metaphone	soundex
pattern2		
if you implement it yourself you should look into the metaphone or double metaphone algorithms i d recommend them over soundex which is not nearly as good at this type of task to store phoenetic representations of all your words

1200232gif	png
pattern7		pattern0		pattern10	more	pattern10	more colors	
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time

1201337memcpy	memmove
pattern0		
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions

1202296imagemagick	im4java
pattern4		
if having imagemagick installed on your maschine is an option i recommend im4java

1204121disk	ram
pattern0		
loosely speaking ram is 1000 or more times faster than disk and cpu is faster still

1204968client-side	server-side
pattern8		
my guess is that server-side implementation may turn out to be more flexible and more powerful than client-side as i can add functionality to the server easily as long as the client understands it

1207519maven	cobertura	cobertura	emma
pattern7		pattern7	better	
i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checking just that cobertura has a better maven plugin and emma has a better eclipse plugin in my opinion

1208256vim	emacs
pattern3		
for someone just starting to program would you recommend using vim emacs or should you use some ide

1211881post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
it is said that get method is faster than post but i don t know why is it

1214032versioning	upgrade
pattern7		
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning

1216039punctuation	words
pattern4		
for matching and # tags i d suggest using the w metapattern matches words characters - so it ll match digits and letters but not whitespace punctuation

1217184vim	emacs
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platforms too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be installed separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systems

1217263nfa	dfa
pattern0		
in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that

1218185subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
pattern7		
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid

1221973post	get
pattern4		
to get the new post you select post which don t have a matching relation in that table for the current user

1223015emacs	aquamacs
pattern4		
if you have a mac i would recommend aquamacs which is a beginner-friendly version of gnu-emacs and therefore has all the power of emacs while still offering standard copy-paste save and other features including normal file dialogs and windows

1223031lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern0		pattern0		
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it

1230528width	height
pattern0		
so how can i determine a smaller width and height to which i will resize the watermark image something much less than 150 width 20 height so that it will appear still as a watermark and wont mask the image completely

1233693google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		pattern0		
firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit

1236826multiplying	subtract
pattern0		
if the parameter is greater than 0.5 multiplying lambda by two and subtract one this maps onto and return the interpolated color between color b and color c

1238849google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie

1239192charindex	substr
pattern4		
select substr this is my text. charindex text. this is my text. 5

1241338post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
i m sure there s a work around to use get for emails but the alternative post is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to get around

1243627code128	code39
pattern7		pattern0		
data density in code128 is better than code39 - since it gets mentioned that often in other replies

1244820jqgrid	datatables
pattern4		
i am currently using datatables because it is easy to implement on existing html but would prefer jqgrid s theme support and hooks

1245368lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern4		pattern2		
ian bicking agrees and prefers lxml over beautifulsoup

1247801innodb	myisam
pattern7		
innodb supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets

1248100keydown	keyup
pattern0		
i finally figured out that keypress has a better compatibility than keydown or keyup on linux platform

1250937django	web2py
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
and web2py is more lightweight than django rails whatever on pretty much all counts

1252126jsf	seam
pattern10		pattern10		
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3

1253366jsf	seam
pattern7		
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above

1253883gcov	lcov
pattern4		
i m unable to make any suggestions on this for windows but for linux projects i highly recommend gcov and lcov

1254132post	get
pattern2		
how should i choose between get and post methods in html forms

1254159post	get
pattern2		
how should i choose between get and post methods in html forms

1254726bash	zsh
pattern0		
how can you get similar highlightings to zsh s less than bash s less in ubuntu

1257952dictionary	map
pattern10	method less	pattern10	method less efficient	
though if you are going to eventually fill a substantial portion of the map the dictionary method is much less efficient

1258708strcpy	strncpy
pattern7		pattern0		
strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one type of bugs with another

1258971strcpy	strncpy
pattern8		
my personal opinion is that it is vastly more useful than strncpy and strcpy

1261364rss	feed
pattern0		
i am scraping a list of rss feed by using curl - look at the xml from the rss feed that s giving the problem there s more than one feed so it s possible for some feed to be right and for the feed that are wrong to be wrong in different ways

1261500serializable	deserialization
pattern0		
you can use the javascriptconverter class when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process

1265217960.gs	fluid
pattern4		
i prefer fluid version of 960.gs fluid 960 grid system

1267852thin	webrick
pattern7		pattern0		
from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin

1268518ienumerable	icollection
pattern8		
secondly i did not use ienumerable because it is more generic than icollection and does not even have simple properties like count

1270393postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

1270393postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

1271575apache	nginx
pattern7		pattern0		
nginx uses less memory than apache given the size of your setup i would definitely recommend that

1273705tapestry	wicket
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
wicket s goal is to support static typing to the fullest extent whereas tapestry is more about saving lines of code

1275337redmine	trac
pattern0		
we ve recently switched from trac to redmine where i work and i think i like it a little more than trac and use the wiki functionality almost everyday

1277646redmine	trac
pattern0		
redmine was written to be a better trac than trac

1278273opera	firefox
pattern0		
for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox

1283195xdebug	xhprof
pattern0		
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server

1284491children	parent
pattern4		
any ways if you want to know what sql to use checkout select parent record with all children in sql

1287034richtextbox	textblock
pattern0		
good advice but in the end i decided a bindable textblock was more useful and simpler than a richtextbox

1287890inherited	properties
pattern7		
less is a css extension that enables reuse and encapsulation of values color values for instance improves inherited allows a better nesting of related properties and operations also

1293769hash	md5
pattern7	smaller	pattern7	smaller	
the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid so it doesn t help with storage

1293916jsf	stripes
pattern4		
but if you do decide on using a framework from my experience of having used stripes struts1 and jsf myfaces recommend stripes without hesitation

1295425mouse	keyboard
pattern10		pattern10		
i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me

1295977lxml	celementtree
pattern2		
i have no recent experience as to how pyrxp today compares with lxml or celementtree

1298305feedback	review
pattern4		
firstly do not be discouraged or disheartened when something doesn t work or when something breaks or if you receive negative feedback the proverbial it sucks review

1298464swt	swing
pattern0		
is swt faster than swing

1301328textmate	textwrangler
pattern4		
open a good text editor i d recommend textmate but the free textwrangler or vi or nano will do too and open

1302592phpmyadmin	heidisql
pattern4		pattern2		
since you re on windows i can highly recommend heidisql over phpmyadmin for working with mysql

1305848inherited	properties
pattern4		
if using tag properties isn t in principle i m recommend inherited treeitem

1306207jboss	weblogic
pattern4		pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more complex	pattern10	more complex	
regarding weblogic and jboss i d prefer jboss weblogic is more complex

1309433jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
pattern4		
if money was not part of the equation and i had an employer that insisted on spending money that wasn t mine i d still choose weblogic over websphere or jboss or glassfish or anything else on the market

1309608bazaar	svn
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
you can not have multiple physical branches under one repository with mercurial like svn or bazaar but the good thing about mercurial imho is the easy user interface that is really straightforward and the performance that is faster than bazaar although bazaar is getting faster and faster in their recent release

1310736git-svn	svn2git
pattern3		
a simple git-svn will reproduce the svn branches actually simple directory with copies in it so i would recommend using svn2git and git2svn

1311516udp	tcp-ip
pattern4		
network cards and routers have a tendency to prefer tcp-ip packages above udp

1311580lxml	elementtree
pattern10	faster	
elementtree is included in the standard library but lxml is faster

1311750postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

1311780post	get
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable

1312826for-loop	loops
pattern7	more	
getimagedata has a for-loop i realised that each index in loops is called more than once

1315178apache	nginx
pattern7		pattern0		
for example nginx is much faster than apache

1315231jboss	weblogic
pattern4		
personally i would choose jboss community version over weblogic server because it s free you know like in freedom

1316114disk	ram
pattern0		
i ve written my own protocol since i need it to be lightweight and i m sending files that may be bigger than the ram available on the device â â therefore the files are being streamed straight from the network to disk

1316308button	checkbox	rss	feed
pattern4		
the user will select checkbox from a datagrid of rss feed on my site and when pressing a button the heavy lifting will happen

1316464postgresql	mysql
pattern3		
otherwise i recommend using postgresql over mysql since it is more standards compliant and has a nicer license

1316580ubuntu	debian
pattern0		
ubuntu heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than debian

1317327gedit	aptana
pattern4		
scratch be as close to just a text-editor as possible i use gedit for everything and i d recommend aptana in a heart-beat

1317710mvp	presenter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more passive	
to summarise the differences controllers in the mvc have more control over the ui and handle events while a presenter in the mvp is more passive and just presents information through the ui

1318324innodb	myisam
pattern0		
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb

131930016-bit	64bit
pattern0		
the standard only requires that int be larger than 16-bit and no larger than a long so it s not 64bit safe

1320978erlang	ocaml
pattern2		
ocaml is a great language -- one of my favorites -- but if your interest is distributed systems than i d recommend going with erlang which is head and shoulders ahead of the other fp languages with regards to distributed systems although there s an offshoot of ocaml called jocaml which has some interesting aspects

1322011client-side	server-side
pattern10		pattern10		
that said client-side javascript is much more common and if you were using server-side javascript you would probably know the answer to your question

1322771momentjs	datejs
pattern7	better	
nowadays datejs is outdated and not maintained so use momentjs which is much better as pointed out by t.j

1324161getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd yy datediff yy -1 getdate 0

1324674hash	md5
pattern0		
if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for integer primary keys

1325027onchange	onfocus	onchange	onblur	onfocus	onblur
pattern4		
select onblur onchange onfocus

1325420unsigned	short
pattern0		
if you really want all 8 bytes in a single number then you need to read more than the unsigned short

1331150inherited	subclassing
pattern10		pattern10		
since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherited a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept

1332466a-star	dijkstra
pattern2		
my question is how does a-star compare with dijkstra

1337085portrait	landscape
pattern10	mode more	pattern10	mode more suitable	
it will adapt the video frame height to landscape mode and it will play the video in the landscape mode whether or not a portrait mode is more suitable

1338597postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

1340207nunit	mstest
pattern0		
if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruise control also supports mstest

1346820vim	emacs
pattern4		
a number of people at the company i currently intern at prefer emacs or vim

1347625perforce	cvs
pattern4		
it s probably easier to learn from scratch than cvs but i don t have experience that way. if someone needed a centralized source-control system i would recommend perforce as long as they had the resources to license it

1347760interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern10		pattern10		
this is usually seen in dynamic interpreted-language but is less common in compiled-language

1347793ant	maven
pattern7		pattern0		
this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java

1348077division	addition	division	modulo	addition	modulo
pattern0		
performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

1348077division	addition	division	modulo	addition	modulo
pattern10		pattern10		
for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

1348958int	double
pattern7		
the range of double is much wider than the range of int or long

1352497xrange	enumerate
pattern0		
why is enumerate slower than xrange + lst i

1352521xrange	enumerate
pattern7		pattern0		
if you measure properly you ll see there s essentially no difference enumerate is microscopically faster than xrange in this example but well within noise

1354946hide	scrolltop	hide	show
pattern7		pattern0		
when scrolltop is less than 300 show the div otherwise hide it

1356125disk	ram
pattern0		
another option is to spend a bit of cash on a 15000 rpm disk or a ssd solid state disk although that ll be slower than a ram disk

1359270innodb	myisam
pattern0		
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam

1360435firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
pattern8		
ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox when it comes to js - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with js turned on

1361077wordpress	joomla
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
i seem to be getting the impression that wordpress is more popular than joomla nowadays

1361527uiview	subviews
pattern0		
i want to add a uiview of smaller frame as subviews to parental view but i am not getting the needed

1362458int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
since an int is bigger than a chars casting unsigned chars to signed int still retains the chars s original value

1363067prepare	execute
pattern10		pattern10		
any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsed optimized compiled and then execute

1363582gridview	repeater
pattern7		
instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater

1363818fontfamily	font-size
pattern3		
i recommend doing fontfamily helvetica neue helvetica arial font-size 20pt and setting the font weight to the lowest possible 100

1365849textmate	gedit
pattern0		
i tried a few ides on ubuntu and it just didn t seem right - gedit is lightweight and i actually enjoy using it more than textmate on os x

1368849postgresql	mysql
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
i haven t chosen a db yet so if mysql or postgresql is better in some way over the other please provide your preference and perhaps why if you have time

1369608xfce	gnome
pattern4		
don t uninstall gnome just select xfce in the graphical login screen

1370945clang	llvm
pattern4		
if i choose llvm gcc 4.2 or clang llvm when i hit breakpoint local symbols are not available and gdb says no symbol self in current context if i try to print self or any other local symbol

1371569postgresql	mysql
pattern0		pattern0		
other databases where it was about the same for a transactional database as oracle sql server where were better than mysql postgresql etc

1371975cpu	processors
pattern7		
the cpu is indeed slower on sparc 1.2ghz and as answered by one of the sun s engineers t2 is usualy 3 times slower for single-threaded application than modern intel processors

1372564bazaar	git
pattern0		
a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial

1373072width	height
pattern7		
another option might be to scale to maximum width and then check if the scaled height is greater then the maximum allowed height and if so scale by height or vice versa

1373566postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	more	pattern10	more feature	
some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.

1373625postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb

1374448http.sys	httplistener
pattern8		
and also don t forget - http.sys much more customizable than httplistener

1374694postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

1378686equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

1378686equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

1378796equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

1379436profiling	instrumentation
pattern8		
personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time when it matters

1380144client-side	server-side
pattern7	solution more	
a lot of the solutions i ve seen are client-side - i think a server-side solution makes more sense for my needs since i can give feedback to the user if the javascript is invalid and only save it on the server once it s clean

1382010ssl	https
pattern4		
i m not sure about iis 6 but in iis 7 you select the site and go to bindings and click add select https it will automaticaly chose port 443 and then chose your ssl cerificate

1382636x86	mips
pattern0		
do any of the other common architectures like arm mips sparc etc have an easier than x86 instruction set

1383228ubuntu	linux
pattern0		
although if you aren t interested in using adobe cs you can use ubuntu distro which is easier than other linux distro and quiet popular so you won t have any problem finding solution

1386038lambda	first-class-functions
pattern4		
first-class-functions functional match lambda libraries

1386828range	max
pattern0		
the range function produces a list of integers from 0 less than the max len s by step 3

1390035pexpect	subprocess
pattern3		
to avoid the many problems that can always arise with buffering for tasks such as getting the subprocess s output to the main process in real time i always recommend using pexpect for all non-windows platform wexpect on windows instead of subprocess when such tasks are desired

1397047cvs	svn
pattern0		
if you use svn then it still okay because svn handles binary files much better than cvs

1397081subtraction	addition
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster operation	
re-order your script so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again

1399024gradle	ivy	ant	maven
pattern8		
if you are looking for a more flexible build than ant or maven but at the same time utilize maven or ivy repositories you should consider gradle

1400465int	double
pattern10		pattern10		
i am guessing this is because modifying a double is a more complex operation than modifying an int

1404965vb6	vba
pattern0		
all the .net methods i tried were slower than vba and vb6 but the best ones were able to use the xll interface which gave better results than the automation interface

1405922charindex	substr
pattern4		
select substr substr field1 field2 field3 charindex field1 field2 field3 + 1 999 1 charindex substr field1 field2 field3 charindex field1 field2 field3 + 1 999 -1

1405994width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
the width is greater than the height so our calculations are

1408183nfa	dfa
pattern0		
if it can be practically determinized this give you a dfa that can be exponentially larger than the nfa then by all means do that

1414236floyd-warshall	dijkstra
pattern10	algorithm better	pattern10	algorithm better	
short answer dijkstra s is your best bet if you want just a few shortest paths and the floyd-warshall algorithm is better if you want to find the shortest paths between every pair of nodes

1414531migrate	upgrade
pattern4		
vss sucks migrate to a real scm microsoft will probably help you seamlessly upgrade to tfs which doesn t have this problem

1415328union	distinct
pattern2		
i have tried the following select with union distinct but the problem is that the limit 0 10 applies to the whole result set

1418229quicksort	mergesort
pattern4		
be aware of the real-world impact of the so-called hidden constants too - for instance the classic quicksort algorithm is o n 2 in the worst case and o n log n on average whereas mergesort is o n log n in the worst case but quicksort will outperform mergesort in practice

1421320equals	icomparable
pattern0		
icomparable is an interface that defines that two instances of the implementing class can be seen as greater than less than or equals to one another

1422299macvim	textmate
pattern4		
i would recommend textmate as above and also macvim if possible

1423595sqldatasource	objectdatasource
pattern10		pattern10		
objectdatasource also allows for more efficient paging than a simple sqldatasource i m assuming that s what you re using

1424117apache	nginx
pattern0		
i switched from apache to nginx to save memory especially to serve static file i seem to be using about 75 less memory with nginx

1427158sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern0		
sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey

1427191mp3	wav
pattern7		
either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a wav file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an mp3 file

1429767maven	m2e
pattern7		
maven 2 has a steeper learning curve but provides a much richer set of functionality for building your projects and eclipse integration through m2e or iam

1430434vim	emacs
pattern0		
and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still start up faster than emacs

1430939vim	emacs
pattern10		pattern10		
cut and paste in vim takes more steps than in emacs iirc

1432559hash	salt
pattern4		
compare salt hash input with stored data to check a password

1433315vim	emacs
pattern4		
even though i use emacs all day every day and love it unless you intend to spend a lot of time in the program you choose i would pick vim

1433909128bit	64bit
pattern0		
i ll just add that if the 128bit number is prime or has a prime factor larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem

1434405128bit	64bit
pattern0		pattern0		
and i ll just add to previous comment if 128bit number has prime factor larger than 64bit then it certainly has a factor less than 64bit

1436154udp	mtu
pattern0		
they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu

1436197udp	mtu
pattern0		
if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented

1437749apache	nginx
pattern0		
as for apache vs nginx in regards to your django app it seems that mod_python is indeed faster than nginx lighty + fastcgi but that s no surprise because cgi regardless of any speed ups is still slow

1439284googletest	gmock
pattern4		
i personally recommend googletest and gmock

1440450uitableview	uipickerview
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
uitableview is much more customizable than uipickerview

1440679entity-relationship	diagram
pattern0		
entity-relationship diagram are simpler than uml diagram

1441330cpython	ironpython
pattern8		
my understanding was it was written in vanilla python cpython but if you are more comfortable with ironpython it shouldn t be hard to translate

1442201django	web2py	django	turbogears	turbogears	web2py
pattern0		
web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears

1442901udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

1443062ssl	https
pattern0		
if i try to add more than 1 ssl binding i get the error at least one other site is using the same https binding and the binding is configured with a different certificate ...

1444213jdom	dom4j
pattern4		
i prefer dom4j personally but i don t mind other apis such as jdom or even xpp3 which has xpath support

1444549nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
pattern10	more	pattern10	more communicative	
as others have said illegalargumentexception is an option but i think nullpointerexception is more communicative

1445294int	double
pattern4		
i guess the question is then why does the compiler choose int instead of double in the first example

1445339antialiasing	transparent
pattern7		
and it seems working fine antialiasing is much better however this beats the idea of a transparent background in the process

1447805versioning	upgrade
pattern7		
running pear -v gives me versioning 1.7.2 when i run pear upgrade pear it says my versioning is newer than the current noe which is 1.9.0 if ran pear upgrade -f pear to force an upgrade it downloads the files and installs successfully but i still have versioning 1.7.2 and cannot install phpunit

1448859pugixml	rapidxml
pattern0		
quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parser i know of he had tested against version 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently version 0.42

1450896allocator	stl
pattern4		
so my question is has anybody used this kind of allocator scheme in combination with stl would it just completely blow stl apart as i suspect

1451062opera	firefox
pattern7		
the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on firefox and works even worse on opera

1453713vtk	paraview
pattern2		
to see some of what vtk can do i recommend checking out paraview

1457281fread	textscan
pattern8		
then for reading i find textscan to be more powerful than fread fscanf the differences between them all are summarized here

1458750jvisualvm	jstat
pattern10	more	pattern10	more reliable	
the tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliable

1459923salt	md5
pattern8		
decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5

1461340width	height
pattern4		
i m required to write a function to overload the operator to compare width height and colour

1461675int	chars
pattern0		
i believe it was one of the early pdp machines in which a chars was larger than an int

1462618client-side	server-side
pattern2		
use unique security token for each connection with client save security token on server-side session and compare with client-side stored value

1463254clang	llvm
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
clang llvm has much better separation between the parser and the other parts of the compiler chain

1464230128bit	64bit
pattern0		
perhaps 128bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit

1464476free	malloc
pattern7		
most likely malloc allocates more memory and puts so-called guard values that happen to contain null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by free later and this metadata happens to contain a null byte right at that position

1465066richfaces	icefaces
pattern7		
richfaces looks more good option to work than icefaces bcoz it has inbuilt support its easy to learn its long time support guarantee for seam+richfaces combination

1467029sorting	filtering
pattern8		
this may be optimal indeed if the table access to retrieve the values missing in the index is more expensive than filtering and sorting

1467079postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql

1468030spaces	delimiter
pattern0		
it checks for one or more spaces as field delimiter and also tabs

1468941xunit.net	fsunit
pattern0		
i d rather use fsunit or fstest to write tests in f# it feels more natural than oo xunit.net style tests

1468983cxxtest	cppunit
pattern4		
i prefer cxxtest as i find it easier not to have to register my test cases explicitly as you have to do with cppunit

1469813apache	lighttpd
pattern4		
i don t have thorough benchmarks but i m personally convinced that just like lighttpd can outperform apache on simpler tasks mod_wsgi gives apache the laurel when it comes to serving python web apps

1469813apache	nginx
pattern0		
nginx with its own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that

1470836firefox	safari
pattern4		
unfortunately unless you re happy with supporting only specific browsers ie7 win safari firefox 3.5 there s no pure css solution to your problem

1471285int	chars
pattern4		pattern2		
compare chars with chars not int

1477008pascal	delphi
pattern10	syntax more	pattern10	syntax more text	
while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and so the underscores look a bit strange as you don t expect them there

1477841django	web2py
pattern10		pattern10		
to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py

1478633folder	dir
pattern4		
iterate over every file in the client javascript folder that match dir command and for f are totally unneeded here though and only complicate things especially when file names contain spaces commas and the like

1480214imperative	declarative
pattern7	approach better	
while neither the declarative nor imperative approach is really better than the other both have their merits

1481132scheme	prolog
pattern10	less	pattern10	less	
in scheme or prolog it s often less than a page of code

1481174int	double
pattern2		
because 1.0 has type double and compiler really doesn t know what type to choose between int and float so it asks you to give it a hint

1481257getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
e.g select dateadd hh -1 getdate

1487773nunit	mstest
pattern4		
mstest comparisons and the developer community seems to pretty much overwhelmingly choose nunit

1490225getter	setter
pattern3		
do you recommend using getter and setter or accessing the member variables directly

1494219post	get
pattern8		
is post more compact than get since get requests have to be url-encoded

1494266post	get
pattern7		
post has one more letter in it than get so it s less compact

1497705getter	setter
pattern8		
what you ll need to do than is to complete the javadoc comments for the classes and methods that are more sophisticated than getter setter or default constructors

1499590width	height
pattern7		pattern7	bigger	
edit actually you resize the one that is the biggest if width is bigger you resize that and if height is bigger then you resize that

1500490maven	m2e
pattern3		
i recommend using maven eclipse and m2e

1500539post	get
pattern10		pattern10		pattern0		
since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests

1501406range	max
pattern0		
if requestedsize bigger than max size of the range

1504631children	parent
pattern0		
basically a given branch of the tree may be found under more than one parent branch but wherever it is found it has the same children

1514244udp	tcp
pattern0		pattern4		
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

1516459yacc	bison
pattern0		pattern0		
this is sometimes easier than yacc bison and usually more intuitive

1517591ant	maven
pattern4		
instead you should use an external dependency management system such as maven or ivy ivy works if you use ant but maven is both a build tool and a dependency management system so i would recommend maven if you can

1522558min	max
pattern4		
select min p1.start_time max p2.end_time p1.partition p2.partition

1525321addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition

1526793stateless	stateful
pattern10	server more	pattern10	server more aware	
i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires

1526793stateless	stateful
pattern4		
anyhow gwt and many other modern toolkits silverlight talking to wcf seems to prefer stateful client stateless server due to scaleability issues

1527161quicksort	mergesort
pattern0		
why is quicksort better than mergesort

1527533postgresql	mysql
pattern7	easier	
installing a real database server is fairly easy so i d recommend sql server express as others have or even mysql or postgresql whatever is easier to set up

1527694portrait	landscape
pattern4		
when user selects landscape printing from print setup it is printer in portrait again anyway

1527832min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
the code will also record the edge cases so if the the function produces a value greater than the max or less than the min you.will.know.about.it

1529588subclass	abstract-class
pattern0		
but unless you re using such excellent testing practices and patterns i d be suspicious of abstractions that have a single concrete example -- interfaces with just one implementation no less than abstract-class with just one concrete subclass

1529981portrait	landscape
pattern4		
but this code give portrait even if i select landscape from setup

1535713emacs	aquamacs
pattern7	better	
you may also want to look at aquamacs which currently has a beta for the latest emacs and offers somewhat better os x integration than the default build

1541739subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
pattern0		
the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

1545598postgresql	mysql
pattern7	nicer	
mysql has some advantages like easy replication but postgresql is generally nicer to work with

1546912postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s

1546912postgresql	mysql
pattern7	simpler	
note i m not saying mysql s license won t work for you but postgresql is definitely simpler

1550588codeigniter	yii
pattern4		
i don t recommend codeigniter as great and powerful framework but it s simple for beginners and they can learn a lot from it personally i m in favor of symfony and yii

1552911simulation	sampling
pattern0		
by decoupling simulation from rendering you can render at a higher frequency than your simulation does for sampling

1554431client-side	server-side
pattern2		
so honestly just have them all in one request you have a server-side race condition with client-side latency

1555170gridview	repeater
pattern4		
for lists i d put hidden fields inside whatever list mechanic you prefer gridview repeater manually building tables yuk

1560687quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n

1563301lxml	elementtree
pattern0		
lxml -- 100x better than elementtree

1566777kerberos	ntlm
pattern2		
yes negotiate will pick between kerberos and ntlm but this is a one time choice

1567102for-loop	loops
pattern10	more	pattern10	more appropriate	
don t use a for-loop when a while loops is more appropriate

1567157width	margin
pattern0		
give the sample text div a right margin greater than the width of the right-floated element

1567753for-loop	loops
pattern7	more	
i guess you can just manually check the condition within your for-loop continue if it s not met but a while loops makes more sense imo

1570729x86	64bit
pattern7	more	pattern7	more	
longer answer 64bit x86 has more general purpose registers which gives the compiler more of an opportunity to optimize local variables into registers for faster access

1577097boost	stl
pattern10		pattern10		
while boost is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge it is difficult to use correctly

1577549post	put
pattern0		
http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server

1578512cvs	svn
pattern7	more	pattern7	more	
i suspect the continued prevalence of cvs svn is much more to do with inertia than anything else

1579077fossil	git
pattern4		
i d recommend git msysgit on windows mercurial tortoisehg makes a great explorer addin and fossil as an awesome lightweight alternative

1580034cvs	svn
pattern0		
part of the point of svn was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in cvs

1581034udp	tcp
pattern0		pattern0		
at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too

1581820ienumerable	ienumerator
pattern7	better	
even though this is supported by c# via ienumerator ienumerable there is a better idiom foreach

1585115getter	setter
pattern0		
on the other hand you may very well have legitimate reasons to have a bunch of properties that are no more than getter and setter

1585305hash	md5
pattern0		
yes sha1 is a better hash than md5

1588866gtk	drawingarea
pattern7		pattern0		
so if the gtk scrolledwindow is smaller than the gtk drawingarea inside it the scrolled window should change to scrollable - but the problem is that it does not work

1589215cvs	svn
pattern0		
svn in much better than cvs and have lot of mature tools for every platform

1591315hash	salt
pattern7	better	
in storing hash passwords is a common practice to add a nonce or a salt and is marginally true that this salt is better kept secret

1592749ant	maven
pattern4		pattern2		
i prefer ant over maven personally

1595704subtraction	addition
pattern0		
i can t use anything more than basic addition and subtraction and string parsing functions

1597598post	get
pattern8		pattern7		
for example post request are considered more secure than get request as creating a post request is relatively harder than creating a get request

1598764client-side	server-side
pattern0		
while not really a console skulpt.org runs python code client-side with no plugins or anything which makes it a lot faster than a server-side prompt

1603119firefox	safari
pattern4		
this actually works fine on mac win firefox safari but on ie6 and ie8 only the first element grabbed by the selector displays the desired behavior

1603644haskell	sml
pattern0		
i haven t read the paper on edison but if it s nothing more than the haskell implementation of purely functional data structures doesn t it make more sense to port the sml code that s in the book thesis

1618019vim	emacs
pattern3		
i don t know about emacs but i would recommend learning vim for a beginner in a heartbeat

1618687nsurl	nsdata
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
1 it seems loading the sound file through nsdata rather than nsurl works faster later in playing

1618687wav	caf
pattern0		
2 caf seems a little better than wav but not much

1618906quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	easier	
one can implement a version of quicksort for a single-linked list but normally this is only interesting as a puzzle since mergesort is much easier to implement and works equally well or better for sorting linked lists

1624744disk	ram
pattern7		
in addition jemalloc tries to optimise for cache locality since the act of fetching data from ram is much slower than using data already in the cpu caches no different in concept to the difference between fast fetching from ram versus slow fetching from disk

1627072antialiasing	transparent
pattern4		
the way i fixed it was to open up the png in gimp choose the fuzzy select tool set the threshold to 150 check antialiasing uncheck feather edges check select transparent areas

1627212antialiasing	transparent
pattern4		
note on my fuzzy select tool my gimp settings were check antialiasing uncheck feather edges check select transparent areas uncheck sample merged and select by composite

1627531webstorm	aptana
pattern0		
if you re focussing on pure client code then i find webstorm to be an excellent javascript html ide - even better than aptana

1628230post	get
pattern7	simpler	
if you have the ajax use get rather than post this is simpler then you can test the response by just viewing the page with the appropriate query string

1628241mp3	wav
pattern0		
if you ask if a uncompressed wav which contains pcm data is better than mp3 then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data

1630987postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql

1633894postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
if i had to support a huge number users on a reasonably simple application and had the team to build a heavily partitioned and replicated database with eventual consistency i d pick mysql over postgresql for the low level data storage building block

1635130int	chars
pattern4		
i m using strcmp to compare chars arrays in c++ but i get the following error for every occurrence of strcmp error invalid conversion from int to const chars followed by error initializing argument 2 of int strcmp const chars const chars

1637626gridview	repeater
pattern0		
not necessarily better than the repeater suggestion but another option is to use a gridview control and a datatable data structure

1638861bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
pattern4		
i personally prefer git but some people find svn simpler to use and some people like mercuiral bazaar or darcs

1640244monodevelop	sharpdevelop
pattern0		
i like the monodevelop ide even better than sharpdevelop but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language features

1641091free	malloc
pattern4		
you also have to ensure that you do not destroy free the old block if the malloc fails - you just return 0

1643009division	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
the tostring should be slower than parse since division is generally slower than multiplication

1643537int	chars
pattern7	version slower	
i assumed the version using chars variables would run slower than that using int s due to the conversions but on my 64bit dual core ii system the int version is slower

1644071opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
pattern4		
i ve used this in ff2 ff3 ff3.5 safari 4 win opera 9+ google-chrome 2 google-chrome 3 and they all work

1645112calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
pattern3		
your core graphics surface should be cleared to all zeroes before you render to it so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc

1645672bazaar	svn
pattern7		
bazaar seems much more like svn with branches just being separate directories so maybe not

1647078innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

1647114innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

1648539lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern10		pattern10		
beautifulsoup is more suitable for html parsing than lxml

1648619nexus	artifactory
pattern2		
i can clearly state that while nexus is very simple and operative though i sometimes have problems with the installation process on ubuntu its free version cannot compete with artifactory s community free edition

1650091int	double
pattern4		
so the question what s the best way to compare double and int

1653709int	chars
pattern0		
senderid and sequencenumber are both int and will take up more than sizeof chars bytes on most architectures

1654239int	chars
pattern0		
as mentioned in other posts senderid and sequencenumber are both of type int which is likely to be larger than chars so these values will be truncated

1657538websphere	ibm
pattern4		
so to me the choices are actually sun s jvm unless i ve to run some websphere stuff in which case i d choose ibm j9

1658665postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
i would recommend postgresql over mysql

1663230int	boolean
pattern0		
obviously a string can hold far more information than an int or boolean

1664063typedef	typename
pattern0		
they describe intent better than built-in typename do typedef int errcode

1667148atomic	interlocked
pattern0		
but consider this it s literally impossible to do any better than interlocked operations for cross-process communication with atomic updates and no locks are held

1669936bazaar	perforce	bazaar	git
pattern7		
you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce

1670651ironruby	ironpython
pattern10		pattern10		pattern0		
however as things stand right now ironpython is much more mature and has much better performance than ironruby so you may prefer to use that

1670683vxworks	qnx
pattern4		
get a real-time linux distro or grab vxworks or qnx - something purpose-built for io intensive requirements

1672672children	parent
pattern7		
if an element has only 1 child then the child is placed below the parent on the same x co-ordinate if the parent has more than one child then the children are placed with equal spaces apart and the parent needs to be in the middle above the children to two equal length lines join to both the children from the parent

1674236unicode	ucs
pattern7		pattern7	more	
according to wikipedia the bmp of the ucs has 65536 characters the latest version of unicode contains more than 107000 characters and the ucs has more than one million code points

1678683post	get
pattern7		
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post

1678727post	get
pattern7		pattern0		
when post is better than get

1678727post	get
pattern7		pattern0		
when get is better than post

1679092width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
whenever i resize an image to a desired size there whe width is greater than the height the proportions get screwed

1685542int	chars
pattern7		
it takes a pathname and an arbitrary int id uses only lower 8 bits so a chars is usually used and generates a probably unique key_t

1686834junit	testng
pattern10		pattern10		pattern7	more	
junit is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java testng has more features but maybe is more complex

1687594serializable	deserialization
pattern7	bigger	pattern7	bigger	
serializable deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state

1688299implements	extends
pattern0		
if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces

1691050int	chars
pattern7		
normally range of int is much wider than that of chars

1694508interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0		
this is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are interpreted-language slower than compiled-language

1696724int	double
pattern0		
int can hold a smaller range than double

1702833min	max
pattern7		pattern0		
in addition i noticed that you also have a possible exceptional scenario for your full constructor when the min value is greater than the max value

1705367junit	testng
pattern3		
third i d recommend using junit 4.4 or better yet the testng idiom - annotations

1706281strcpy	strncpy
pattern4		
usually when people use strncpy they forget to do this which is why i recommend strcpy

1706506disk	ram
pattern0		
disk io - even ssd - is many orders of magnitude slower than the ram that the hashing is going though

1709198min	max
pattern4		
if this is the case the query could be modified to choose max min etc.

1710652codeigniter	kohana
pattern8		
but if codeigniter has a bit too much bloat for you maybe you can try kohana which is a bit less bloated than codeigniter started as a fork

1712946hex	binary
pattern7		pattern0		
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc

1713083hex	binary
pattern4		
the biggest problem we ran into was constantly annoyingly having binary data show up in the console everytime you type select you hear a million beeps and you have to always do select hex or insert unhex which is a pain

1715710margin	height
pattern7	shorter	
the issue is that without the margin on the bottom the page height is shorter then the window bounds thus your footer div ends and the body of the page bleeds through

1716751arp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time

1717152postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql

1719752ceil	floor
pattern0		
the floor times the ceil are greater than the floor xy...that s very much possible

1722180innodb	myisam
pattern3		
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases

1722910bottle	turbogears
pattern4		
i strongly recommend turbogears or bottle

1723888aptana	rubymine
pattern4		
if you need an ide i personally recommend rubymine although aptana is a worthy offering as well and free

1725214width	height
pattern0		
if set true then it might increase the width or height if the given width and height are bigger than original width and height

1725935int	chars
pattern0		
from portability viewpoint chars cannot be smaller than 8 bits and nothing can be smaller than chars so if a given c implementation has an unsigned 8-bit int type it s going to be chars

1725999versioning	upgrade
pattern4		
strongly recommend upgrade your versioning of memcached

1726749webclient	webrequest
pattern10		pattern10		
update i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of webclient but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying webrequest

1727859gdi	directwrite	gdi	direct2d	directwrite	direct2d
pattern4		
i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net space

1729502phpunit	simpletest
pattern4		
i would recommend phpunit for your testing as it seems to be the most complete package for php imho many are fans of simpletest as well .

1729806innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam

1729806innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts

1730317innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb

1730317innodb	myisam
pattern2		
if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right

1730317innodb	myisam
pattern7		
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully

1731950tinyint	boolean
pattern0		
does tinyint in mysql take up more space than boolean

1732320ant	maven
pattern0		
first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications

1734609gtk	cairo
pattern10		pattern10		
with gtk it s more common to use cairo already mentioned by jeff foster

1734992fseek	ftell
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
unless there is specific reason to do it fopen fseek ftell is a better idea portable staying within the c standard library

1735122division	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
multiplication is less expensive than division so

1737240interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0		
fact is that interpreted-language like php are always slower than a compiled-language

1737864pylons	turbogears
pattern4		
others prefer turbogears and or pylons maybe bfg maybe grok maybe zope maybe plone

1738477appkit	nsapplication
pattern7	better	
the documentation for deactivate method for nsapplication says that i shouldn t call this method directly since appkit knows better how to deactivate stuff

1741448ftp	telnet
pattern10		pattern10		
ftp protocol is more complex than http or telnet form example

1744404post	get
pattern7		pattern0		
the get request is marginally less secure than the post request

1744404post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that arenâ t under the attackerâ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual

1745229int	chars
pattern0		
because int can become arbitrarily large in clojure the resulting number becomes bigger with every chars thanks to the

1746488apache	nginx
pattern4		
for several reasons i would pick nginx as a reversed proxy instead of apache and configure it accordingly

1749841onchange	onkeydown
pattern10	better	
onkeydown although it wouldn t work for pasted data where onchange is probably better

1751849minimum	max
pattern0		
so i use the formula you have in your second query to first calculate the bounds -- the four lat long values at the extremes of the allowed radius then take those bounds and do a simple query to find the matches within them less than the max lat long more than the minimum lat long

1752722post	get
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		
you would allow post get post is more secure to the php file and would then run an http post get request from c#

1753093min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
if i is less than min and more than max

1753093min	max
pattern7		pattern0		
if min is less than is and is is less than max

1753801width	height
pattern7		
when working with a landscape photo the photo width is greater than the photo height

1753801width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
when working with a portrait photo the height is greater than the width

1757465hash	hmac
pattern7		
hmac is better than a plain hash because it is not vulnerable to hash length extension attacks

1758133width	height
pattern4		
var jscommand string window.open win height 200 width 300 toolbar no scrollbars yes

1760867public	protected
pattern3		
personally i prefer putting public methods first followed by protected methods following by private methods

1761942wordpress	joomla
pattern7	much simplier	
me too don t get any advantages for joomla it s big system and it just as good as wordpress for regular projects just wordpress is much simplier

1765712spaces	delimiter
pattern4		
i prefer spaces delimiter since it works nice with unix text tools and with excel

1766649width	height
pattern7		
unless the screen height is less than 580px or width less than 930px

1767979boost	stl
pattern0		
maybe this would have all been better with boost but i m still learning stl and didn t go that way

1768222pull	push
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
i have found that pull is more scalable than push

1768520perforce	svn
pattern10		pattern10		
perforce offers more advanced branching and merging capabilities than svn

1769414postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

1769850min	max
pattern4		
otherwise you couldn t have results for things like select min col1 max col1 .

1772728post	get
pattern7		
sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings

1772948joptionpane	jdialog
pattern0		
usually when people want more flexibility than joptionpane offers it s basically a bunch of static factories for a few dialogs they write their own dialogs using jdialog

1774364haskell	ocaml
pattern7		
haskell has more momentum these days but there are plenty of good parsing libraries for ocaml as well including the peg parser generator aurochs menhir and the glr parser generator dypgen

1774377innodb	myisam
pattern0		
myisam inserts are going to be faster than innodb so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win

1774432integer	unsigned
pattern7	larger	
find the closest 32bit unsigned integer that is larger than x

1776455haskell	ocaml
pattern7		
haskell has higher level bindings to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components

1779317apache	lighttpd
pattern3		
long polling that s the way i ll choose using lighttpd under apache to load static files images css js etc.. and just for this type of long-polling

1780489rational-numbers	zero
pattern0		
is there any way in haskell to get the constant that is the largest and smallest possible positive rational-numbers greater than zero that can be represented by doubles

1785109imperative	declarative
pattern7	finer	
also one benefit of declarative programming is that purpose is usually more easily understood from reading the code whereas imperative gives you finer control over execution

1786428hash	md5
pattern0		
it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5

1786996vim	emacs
pattern10		pattern10		
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is

1790008put	get
pattern4		
just to get closer to the solution write a javahelp.bat or .cmd if you prefer put it on the path and call that from ruby

1790277mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern7	cleaner	
i suggest using hover this instead of binding to mouseenter and mouseleave looks cleaner to me

1790470jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom
pattern4		
there are at least 3 different ways to implement the xml-wrapping part sax xslt and xml libraries like jdom dom4j and xom--i prefer xom but any of them will work

1792196int	chars
pattern4		
public int compare chars x chars y

1792370postgresql	greenplum
pattern0		
greenplum and other similar solutions should work a bit better than postgresql depending on your data sets and use cases

1795117postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		pattern7	better	
now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

1798503google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	bigger	
in ie6 7 8 and in google-chrome text has proper size but in firefox it s bigger

1798628strsplit	substr
pattern7	easier	
usually you use strsplit to break a string in parts but with substr there s an easier solution for your problem

1802010pascal	delphi
pattern10	more	pattern10	more portable	
there is the mono project that aims to allow .net code to run on mac and linux but between the two delphi being pascal is somewhat more portable

1803139memcached	apc
pattern4		
you want to compare apc key-value store vs memcached right

1803139memcached	apc
pattern7		
memcached has more functionality but is intended for distributed environments while apc works on single servers only

1804853union	distinct
pattern0		
keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but it will perform slower than using union all which will not remove duplicates

1808814memcached	apc
pattern0		
memcached around 4-5 times slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touched everywhere in my environment

1808990aptana	radrails
pattern4		
the rails framework is a great setup for doing web development and i would highly recommend radrails as your ide or it s base aptana

1810501strtol	atoi
pattern4		
also atoi doesn t provide any way to detect errors so prefer strtol and similar functions

1811607profiling	instrumentation
pattern3		
i recommend using instrumentation performance profiling tool that is bundled with xcode and the developer tools

1812152free	realloc
pattern7	better	
i know that memory blocks and reallocation are implementation so specific but when there are contiguous free blocks of memory realloc works better than a new buffer allocation and memory copy

1813665postgresql	mysql
pattern2		
i would still recommend checking out postgresql and postgis in comparison to mysql if you intend to do more complex queries in the foreseeable future

1814118equals	compareto
pattern0		
per the page i linked to compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

1816406ant	maven
pattern4		
but instead of ant i d choose maven because it will require less work imho and it has a built-in feature called profiles that is perfect to manage environment specific stuff like here

1817949apache-fop	xhtml
pattern3		
given that xhtml is an extension from xml i d recommend using apache-fop

1819246hide	show
pattern4		
right-click the cell with the comment and choose show hide comment might do the trick

1819483phpunit	simpletest
pattern0		
is there any easy php testing framework and may be simpler than simpletest and not command line based like phpunit

1823057junit	testng
pattern10		pattern10		
if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get it done in junit

1825371udp	tcp
pattern4		
udp makes sense if you want to make your stream multicast otherwise i would prefer tcp because it is more reliable

1825484memcached	apc
pattern0		
a quick googling says that apc is 5 times faster than memcached

1825484memcached	apc
pattern0		
my experience say that apc is nearly 7-8 times faster than memcached

1825484memcached	apc
pattern0		
apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs

1826194subtraction	addition
pattern8		
for the sake of completeness i would like to mention another less powerful algorithm with addition subtraction

1826333union	distinct
pattern4		
a union essentially performs a select distinct so that it can remove duplicate records

1827397colorbox	simplemodal
pattern4		
simplemodal has a similar function but i much prefer colorbox s implementation and documentation otherwise i d use the latter

1829072disk	ram
pattern0		
as disk i o is orders of magnitude slower than ram i o this can cause a very significant difference in query execution times

1830829width	height	portrait	landscape
pattern0		pattern0		
such that a landscape image would have an ideal height of 300 or slightly larger with a width 400 and a portrait image would have an ideal width of 400 or slightly larger with a height 300

1835023mako	genshi
pattern2		
or you can choose between mako genshi jinja2 or whatever you like for your templates

1835614union	distinct
pattern4		
also if you use union all it will be faster if the result you want is all of the rows as opposed to distinct rows and you can still grab distinct rows by selecting distinct from the view if you need it sometimes

1838114notepad++	scite
pattern0		
by the way if you like minimalistic approach there is also scite editor which is my personal preference for doing small bits of code it s even more lightweight than notepad++

1839558button	checkbox
pattern4		
as i have check box in gridview if i dont select any one checkbox and if i click asp button then i have to show message to user to select checkbox

1839854udp	tftp
pattern7	simpler	
tftp is used because it uses udp which is simpler and had a smaller footprint than a full tcp-based ftp server

1840568division	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loop and it s clear that a does not change between two iterations for instance because it s a const variable then the original version can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler moves the computation of 1 .

1840999postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntaxes and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely

1841772postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

1841996gif	png
pattern7		
a 8-bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixel gif and everything will still work as planned

1846862floyd-warshall	dijkstra
pattern7	s worse	
the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v| 3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|

1847205switching	screens
pattern4		
the advantage of this dual-natured solution is that the tabbed approach will work the way you want it to work for the majority of cases but for users with say two screens or who prefer switching between browser tabs they will still have the flexibility to work in multi-window mode

1849303pascal	delphi
pattern4		
i prefer delphi pascal but i can read other languages if the example isn t overly complex

1849455cassini	iis
pattern0		
while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio

1849962post	get
pattern8		
ajax calls using get are more performant than post according to yahoo

1850196post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
get is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as post does

1852321width	height
pattern0		
however this does not take into account the space taken by the notification bar or window decorations so in reality you have less space than width times height

1853219quicksort	heapsort
pattern0		
however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is

1855222int	chars
pattern0		
running the same test on linux with gcc similarly pegs int and long as similar and both faster than chars although the difference is less pronounced

1856019lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
pattern4		
out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup

1859322maven	m2e
pattern4		
i recommend m2e plugin for eclipse maven integration

1859872cpython	ironpython
pattern4		
performance measurements of jython ironpython and cpython show that both jython and ironpython outperform cpython for some cases with large datasets

1860622notepad	textpad
pattern8		
as it happens my choice is textpad but just about anything which is more advanced than notepad ought to be able to do this

1860743post	get
pattern7		pattern0		
you ll hit problems with larger submissions and file-uploads as the size limit for a get is much smaller than a post

1870710photoshop	fireworks
pattern8		
i have fireworks 8 as well as photoshop cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with fireworks

1871301jquery	jqtransform
pattern3		
yes i would also recommend using jquery a very nice plugin is the jqtransform plugin

1872424google-chrome	firefox
pattern3		
we recommend using google-chrome download here or mozilla firefox download here

1872552versioning	upgrade
pattern7		
these locations will convert when they go to windows 7 perhaps or because the application they use internally is upgrade and needs the newer browser versioning

1874031apache	lighttpd
pattern4		
i prefer apache 2.2 however lighttpd can also be deployed if it offers a feature for the implementation

1874682maven	m2e
pattern4		
once you do that open up the console view and select maven console you should see m2e printing out log messages detailing the index download

1879340listview	gridview
pattern10		pattern10		
regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview

1880342gif	png
pattern4		pattern2		
i would recommend gif over png because there are some issues with color profiles in webbrowsers and pngs

1884878firefox	safari
pattern4		
overflow-x and overflow-y are supported by ie5+ win firefox 1.5+ mozilla 1.8+ and safari 3+

1887931zoo	xts
pattern10	better	pattern10	better starting	
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point

1889564georss	kml
pattern4		
the amount of data will vary depending on whether you choose kml or json or georss but if you end up with 20 bytes per line segment that would take 50 seconds to fetch on a 1 megabit broadband connection

1892208inherited	subclassing
pattern0		
this example is a bit looser than the inherited model provided by languages such as java -- an animal instance can have any behaviour at all rather than one of a specific set of behaviours depending on its subclassing

1892562hindi	tamil	hindi	french
pattern2		
i have a doubt is it possible to give text other than english in my latest project i need to support hindi tamil and french so if user selects language as hindi or tamil or french so what ever value the user is giving in the textbox it must be displayed in the corresponding language selected

1896687disk	ram
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
edit true the file on disk is not larger than ram but the in-memory representation can easily become much larger than available ram

1896889setinterval	settimeout
pattern7	easier	
you may want to consider using jquery timers instead which abstracts away many of the ugly details of settimeout setinterval and makes them easier to use in your code for things like what you are describing

1897818unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
pattern4		
if you really mean unix and not linux i would recommend solaris eclipse does run on solaris and it s much easier to understand than aix

1897910r-tree	quadtree
pattern2		
your r-tree approach is the best approach i know of that s the approach i would choose over quadtree b+ trees or bsp trees as r-tree seem convenient to build in your case

1898944udp	tcp
pattern8		
what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability

1900794floating-point	integer
pattern0		
depending on context floating-point code may be as fast as or faster than integer code or it may be four times slower

1902994min	max
pattern4		
write a loop that goes through every element and compares min max values with your arguments

1905090gridbaglayout	boxlayout
pattern7		pattern0		
boxlayout is far easier than gridbaglayout because you don t have to learn how to specify constraints

1906226udp	tcp
pattern2		
then you have to choose between udp and tcp

1907934addition	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loop than you would in the multiplication loop

1907942xslt	xquery
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries

1908733xslt	xquery
pattern10	more	pattern10	more powerful	
the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml

1908876xslt	xquery
pattern10		pattern10		
unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

1910089vbscript	jscript
pattern0		pattern0		
asp with jscript is 100 times better cleaner simpler nicer than vbscript and makes my job a joy rather than a vbscript head ache

1910542integer	fractions
pattern7	lower	
that means that the 16 upper bits of a glfixed represents the integer part and the fractions is the lower 16 bits divided by 65536

1917713division	multiplication
pattern7		
multiplication is far easier and faster for a cpu to do than division

1920516free	malloc
pattern7		
here is a solution which encapsulates the call to malloc allocates a bigger buffer for alignment purpose and stores the original allocated address just before the aligned buffer for a later call to free

1922064lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern10		pattern10		
for starters beautifulsoup is no longer actively maintained and the author even recommends alternatives such as lxml

1922486postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing

1924122ienumerable	ilist
pattern3		
if your method could return either an ilist or an ienumerable prefer returning ilist

1924856getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd dd 0 datediff dd 0 getdate

1925238min	max
pattern4		
the easy option is to use group by and select min max for all other fields

1926885postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql so use it - there are gist gin indexes

1930483udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

1931833eurekalog	madexcept
pattern4		
how would you compare madexcept to eurekalog as an exception handler for your delphi application

1932229hex	binary
pattern4		
i ve used both otool and otx to disassemble various binaries and i ve found the easiest way to edit them is to figure out what the assembly of the new code i want is using nasm or similar then just use a hex editor i prefer hex fiend on the binary file

1933827quicksort	heapsort	heapsort	in-place
pattern0		
heapsort can sort in-place and doesn t have the worst case quadratic behavior but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases

1935145int	double
pattern0		
you re getting the outofmemory because if you declare int 1000 the memory is allocated immediately additionally double take up more space than ints-an int representation will also save you space

1935264memcached	apc
pattern10		pattern10		
memcached is more along the lines of a distributed object cache vs something like apc or xcache which stores php bytecode in memory so you avoid having to parse it each time

1935264memcached	apc
pattern7		
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects

1935994phpunit	simpletest
pattern4		
if you prefer phpunit i think you can fairly easily use simpletest s browser from within phpunit

1936043redmine	trac
pattern7		
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin

1936127ireport	subreports
pattern7		
if your report is complicated and have many subreports and subdatasets its better to go this approach since ireport will make it quicker and easier for you to design and maintain later

1937370postgresql	mysql
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
in my experiance with the two postgresql has shown to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads

1946932udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

1946968for-loop	loops
pattern10	more	pattern10	more appropriate	
i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loops if a for-loop is more appropriate

1948765mouse	keyboard
pattern4		
i find most users prefer keyboard data entry as opposed to mouse click data entry - it is a lot faster

1949361getter	setter
pattern4		
depending on your language you should prefer getter setter up front because you can t introduce them later i m looking at you java if it turns out you do need them

1949368strcpy	strncpy
pattern4		pattern2		
not related to the leak but if you know the length prefer strncpy over strcpy

1949511division	modulo	bitwise-and	modulo
pattern7	slower	
in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower

1951706screens	mdpi
pattern0		
so a g1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screens but this is a very small difference so it s not a big deal

1957876erd	diagram
pattern4		
personally i prefer erd diagram for databaser data models

1958038trie	dawg
pattern7	more	
it combines efficiency of a trie trie can be seen as a special case of dawg but is much more space efficient

1958901redmine	trac
pattern4		
grab redmine or trac and take on the challenge of getting everyone to standardize

1959310mapquest	directions
pattern10	more	pattern10	more accurate	
as accuracy goes i ve noticed that for directions here in north carolina mapquest is slightly more accurate

1959633width	height
pattern0		
my array larger than max height width but not max height max width

1959795innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

1959842switching	screens
pattern7		
when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly

1961714vsts	tfs
pattern10		pattern10		
unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro version of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions

1961894maven	m2e
pattern4		
this has worked tremendously well and doesn t require any additional support or plugins from any of ides out there which is a great plus - number two reason we didn t choose maven was seeing how m2e basically took over eclipse

1962727firefox	safari
pattern7	broader	
using proprietary extensions from firefox is almost as myopic -- you ll have a hard time convincing all visitors to switch to firefox for your site from ie safari or whatever else they prefer and although the range of devices on which you can install firefox is broader than those on which you can install ie you re still cutting off devices such as iphones and android a segment of the market that s growing much faster than traditional pcs

1962928ati	nvidia
pattern8		
4 is nvidia cuda technology is easier more flexible than ati brook+ language

1964701atomikos	bitronix
pattern4		
personally i d choose bitronix or atomikos

1965541division	multiplication
pattern0		
i haven t benchmarked any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using integers division by 2 is shorter than multiplication by 2

1967549launch4j	jsmooth
pattern4		
launch4j - no new development in over a year supports 64 bit but you can t sign the exe created by launch4j so i prefer jsmooth but it does not support 64 bit

1969120addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
of course it is 10 because the addition operator has a lower precedence than the multiplication operator and so 4 + 3 2 always means 4 + 3 2

1969127strcpy	strdup
pattern7		
in general it is nicer in c to have the caller allocate memory not the callee - hence why strcpy is a nicer function in my opinion than strdup

1970160innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

1970176innodb	myisam
pattern4		pattern2		
imho you should always prefer innodb over myisam because of the transactional support which is at the heart of every relational database system

1970258innodb	myisam
pattern4		
i do this all the time because i prefer innodb for the fks but i sometimes need myisam for the full-text search

1971063invokelater	invokeandwait
pattern3		
if so i would recommend using invokelater to build the swing components as i have noticed that opera can sporadically crash at start up with invokeandwait

1972630ironruby	ironpython
pattern7		
ironpython has had more time to focus on performance improvements but ironruby has made significant performance improvements as of late

1978345gprof	shark
pattern4		
personally i prefer shark for mac os x and gprof for linux

1981175width	height
pattern0		
my array larger than max height width but not max height max width

1983147accessor	properties
pattern4		
well your synthesize doesn t match properties declaration - you re declaring properties for mobinfo but generating synthesized accessor for mobinfo

1988545division	multiplication
pattern0		
so division is always a bit worse than multiplication

1989494swt	swing
pattern2		
i m writing an application that has an swt gui currently but would like the end-users to be able to choose between swt and swing

1989900nunit	mstest
pattern0		
various people told me to go with nunit since it s better than mstest apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using

1990334range	minimum
pattern0		
a range is contiguous when there is no value one smaller than the minimum and no value one bigger than the maximum and there is no gap within the range

1995717hash	salt
pattern7		
the more randomness and more characters your salt has the better for the hash but anything that s several characters long and random works

1996484google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox

2000182spweb	spsite
pattern10		pattern10		
since spsite takes a longer url you may also be able to open the right spweb as well using site.openweb

2000205postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern0		
also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql

2000456ienumerable	ilist
pattern7		pattern0		
thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it

2003818hash	md5
pattern4		
however to answer your original question there is really is no way to compare md5 or any hash against any type of encryption

2004718vim	emacs
pattern10	more	pattern10	more productive	
in many cases emacs or vim is more productive than a huge ide that makes coffee

2006698swt	swing
pattern2		
if your only goal is to let users choose between swt or swing drawing their ui then swtswing would have been an option

2006809trac	bugzilla
pattern0		pattern0		
in my experience this is a much simpler sell than trac bugzilla and all the rest

2013301int	chars
pattern7		
and sizeof int is greater than one and the compiler adds padding for the chars member variable - is the compiler-generated code allowed to change the values of the padding bytes

2014241apache	nginx
pattern0		
nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly

2015715config	ini
pattern0		
since json can store arrays i can create quite complex config with it and it parses faster than ini files

2019939django	web2py
pattern4		
i think i prefer web2py because it does more for me that i don t have to do but from the pov of say java frameworks django and web2py may as well be the same thing

2021396reportlab	xhtml2pdf
pattern0		pattern0		
or go a little higher level than reportlab xhtml2pdf - now weasyprint built on top of reportlab

2021716public	protected
pattern4		
so i d prefer public or package protected

2022693range	max
pattern7		pattern0		
basically if you know that your events are never larger than a given duration you can search for a bounded range that s larger than the max duration then add restrictions to get rid of the extra stuff that matched

2022775post	get
pattern7	better	
what i am hoping to get from this post is a better way to do this or hopefully someone can tell me why is happening i know that the latter might be hard since it can be a bunch of reasons

2023144post	put
pattern0		
put is designed for file uploads moreso than post which requires doing a multipart upload but then it comes down to what your server can do as to which is more convenient for you to implement

2023431public	protected
pattern4		
do prefer protected accessibility over public accessibility for virtual members

2023499int	chars
pattern10		pattern10		
i m not an expert in the inner workings of mysql but it intuitively feels that retrieving and sorting int fields is faster than chars fields i just get a feeling that a z is more work that 0 1 and seems to feel much more familiar from a computing perspective in which 0s and 1s are the standard on off flags

2025883ubuntu	linux
pattern4		
hard to beat ubuntu though i personally use mostly macs that s because mac os x still offers a superior laptop experience and my personal machines are mostly laptops by now -- my workstation at work does run ubuntu -- though i m pretty sure other modern linux distros would be shoulder and shoulder with it

2034023versioning	upgrade
pattern7		pattern0		
application expects grails versioning 1.1.1 but grails_home is versioning 1.2.0 - use the correct grails versioning or run grails upgrade if this grails versioning is newer than the versioning your application expects

2034228int	chars
pattern4		
most importantly you would pick int or chars at the language level depending on whether you wanted to treat the variable as a number or a letter to switch you would need to cast to the other type

2037401sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7		
ignoring the cost of providing sorted input the oh of sortedlist is smaller than the oh of sorteddictionary

2037706maven	pom.xml
pattern4		
now to add a dependency either right-click the project and select maven add dependency or edit the pom.xml manually

2040472zen-cart	oscommerce
pattern0		
it seems to be younger than zen-cart and oscommerce

2043996youtube	vimeo
pattern7		
while vimeo is more of a professional site youtube offers html5 h.264 video playback support for all videos so they ll play on iphone

2044311awt	swing
pattern7		
well swing is richer in terms of out-of-the-box components than awt

2044311awt	swing
pattern4		pattern2		
i have used both and i prefer swing over awt

2045608equals	compareto
pattern0		
in the compareto method you can then write the code which will call the getters for the year month and so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than equals to or greater than the object o being passed into the compareto method

2051851struts	stripes
pattern0		
stripes the actionbean approach doesn t look much better than struts

2052095range	infinity	interpolation	splines
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		
splines interpolation is probably more useful for you than polynomial interpolation if you fit a polynomial it must inevitably head off to + - infinity outside your data range

2059539getter	setter
pattern0		
you can do it using rhino 1.6r6 or higher with javascript getter and setter

2063535ord	chr
pattern0		
i simplified the 0-9 case in digit_to_char i think str is clearer than the chr ord construct

2064683phpmyadmin	heidisql
pattern2		
i m using heidisql to manage my databases at work i prefer this over phpmyadmin

2066036komodo	gedit
pattern0		
when i m in a hurry i use gedit purely because it is quicker than komodo edit

2067125int	boolean
pattern0		
relatively speaking the string concatenation in your code is probably going to be slower than the int and boolean comparison operations you have here

2072860ienumerable	ilist
pattern7	less	
another thing that bothers me is why in nhibernate always it is being used ilist and not ienumerable which has less functionality

2075060interpolation	splines
pattern3		
if you are doing more than three points however i would strongly recommend using interpolation as using guassian elimination scales incredibly poorly o n 3 and splines or another interpolation technique are less likely to fail

2076025calloc	malloc
pattern7		pattern0		
calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

2077157tapestry	wicket
pattern8		
click is tapestry-like but much more easy than tapestry and wicket

2079164post	get
pattern0		
using the ajax method really shouldn t take much more than using post get

2080901post	get
pattern8		
i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get

2083832g++	gcc
pattern4		
compare gcc -v file.cpp gcc can work with c++ files and g++ -v file.cpp to see the difference in linker commands that often causes the first to fail for example

2085070struts	stripes
pattern0		
i ve found stripes to be really effective and surprisingly lightweight....it aims to be more lightweight than struts

2089364mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
pattern10		pattern10		pattern7	more	
nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

2089812union	distinct
pattern4		
you d have to probably do a select distinct on the data set produced by the union

2093262min	max
pattern7	easier	
actually for min max it is easier to use which also supports handles lifted operators etc

2096222tortoisegit	svn
pattern10		pattern10		
the compare dialog of tortoisegit is more about file and with git you have to compare two master branches not just two commits of the same branches both pointing to the same svn central repo

2096899mod-alias	mod-rewrite
pattern0		
evidently though mod-alias can be somewhat faster than mod-rewrite all other things being equal of course

2097534udp	tcp
pattern4		
the skype protocol prefers udp where possible and falls back to tcp

2098528for-loop	loops
pattern10		pattern10		
the class of problems you can solve with while loops is strictly more powerful than those you could have solved with the strict for-loop found in pascal

2100226equals	gethashcode
pattern3		
we recommend implementing equals and gethashcode using business key equality

2102058range	max	range	min	min	max
pattern4		
currently i m joining a range of dates that covers the full range of possible dates select min start date max end date

2103122freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally

2104081cvs	svn
pattern8		
it s model it s much more twisted than svn cvs git

2104724lift	wicket
pattern4		pattern2		
why did would you prefer wicket over lift

2105917lift	wicket
pattern4		
even dave pollak once suggested this combination if you prefer wicket to lift or have an existing wicket application you want to retrofit scala with

2108646pascal	delphi
pattern10	more	pattern10	more centered	
pascal and also delphi is more centered on readability than the c syntax languages which are more centered on character power as much information per character as possible

2111585springsource	grails
pattern4		
then in springsource tool suite right-click your project and select grails tools - refresh dependencies

2114537innodb	myisam
pattern0		
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

2115070lisp	scheme
pattern8		
i ve also found scheme ides much more user-friendly than lisp s plt scheme is a good one

2115099lisp	scheme
pattern7	simpler	
i suggest that you start with scheme and then move on to common lisp as scheme is simpler

2120804fossil	git
pattern0		
from the article it sounds like fossil isn t a database any more than git is a database

2121325pull	push
pattern7	better	
before do git pull and git push it s better to make sure that git status result is contain text working directory clean

2126531appfuse	spring	wicket	appfuse
pattern4		
so while you can compare spring web flow + spring and wicket + spring the later combo doesn t offer anything comparable to roo out of the box maybe appfuse or appfuse light but you didn t mention them and they are third-party projects

2128783lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern4		
since beautifulsoup is no longer being actively developed i would recommend lxml since it does all the things that beautifulsoup can do and a lot more

2132643floating-point	fractions
pattern10		pattern10		
and using floating-point values is more realistic - you need fractions values because when you rotate something the new coordinates will nearly always be non integral

2133147min	max
pattern0		
i d just make two properties min max assign them the value of the first item you add to the array then each time you add a new item just check if its datetime is less or greater than the min max ones

2136850width	height
pattern7		
however after rotating a rectangular image its new width and height is much bigger as these two screenshots should help clarify during rotation and after rotating then rotating again -- the little handles show where the images x y width height extends to

2137586phpunit	simpletest
pattern4		
i would recommend phpunit but there is also simpletest which i know some people prefer

2138363children	parent
pattern7		pattern0		
if smallest state of all children is greater than parent s state then update parent

2141417move	drag
pattern4		
i have tried moving the files using the repo-browser right-click drag the files and select move items to here as well in the working folder right-click drag select svn move versioned files here and commit the parent folder

2141762mef	prism
pattern7	easier	
i personally think combining prism with mef makes this type of situation easier though since mef allows for easier dynamic extensibility for roles

2143377post	get
pattern0		
is post safer than get

2143772getdate	datepart
pattern4		
select datepart dw getdate

2148905hash	salt
pattern0		
if their original password was longer than the salt + hash you may have just reduced the security of their password assuming a good password and ignoring hash collisions

2149859floating-point	integer
pattern10		pattern10		
floating-point divide is faster than integer fewer bits to divide assuming your cpu has floating-point unit

2152421webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern7		pattern0		
you can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but in order to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and override the protected getwebrequest method

2153892vim	emacs
pattern0		
i ve used vim for 10+ years but never really into vim scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where vim was weaker than emacs

2154572subtraction	addition
pattern0		pattern0		
source unary + - bind tighter than addition subtraction + - and associate right

2156868width	height
pattern7		
now i want an array which contain those books id s which their height is greater than or equal to their width

2157980mouseover	mouseenter
pattern0		
the mouseenter event is usually a better choice than mouseover

2159239tinyint	varchar
pattern4		
also the regexp only matches tinyint bigint int long and varchar as an example to get you started

2163475free	malloc
pattern0		
garbage-collection may be slower than malloc and free for programs that allocate at once all the memory they need and work with that

2165195ant	maven
pattern3		
i don t know exactly how your sources are structured under jdeveloper but you best option here to automate the packaging and the deployment of this ear is imo to use ant or maven but if all this is totally new for you i would recommend using ant

2165425fadein	fadeout
pattern0		
more detail set the amount of time the animation will take for fadeout and use a delay for the fadein animation that is longer than the fadeout animation time

2167978tinyint	boolean
pattern3		
the mysql documentation recommends using tinyint 1 for boolean values so tinyint 1 is probably the best

2171388gif	png
pattern7	better	
choose the correct type of image extension sometimes gif or png delivers better results then jpg s

2171608prng	random
pattern4		
sqlite contains a high-quality pseudo-random number generator prng used to select random rowids when inserting new records into a table that already uses the largest possible rowid

2172507getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
if i run the query select dateadd d -500 getdate

2173609getter	setter
pattern0		
property declarations are nothing more than compiler-generated getter and setter methods

2173619imperative	declarative
pattern4		
imperative run-time code trumps declarative settings

2183918websphere	ibm
pattern0		
other solution is to upgrade websphere with newer libraries as per ibm websphere upgrade service instructions

2185953min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
2 also i notice that the inverse of the maximum value of a double precision type is bigger than its min value and inverse of its min value is inf way bigger than its max value

2188918latex	katex
pattern4		
as of 5-feb-2015 i d switch to recommend katex - most performant javascript latex library from khan academy

2193943postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
mysql is easier than postgresql but it doesn t really matter either way

2195118client-side	server-side
pattern10	more	pattern10	more reliable	
i ve found that rendering client-side is nice for small controlled internal uses but for anything where you want tight control over the output server-side is more reliable

2198143multiplying	multiplication
pattern7		
multiplication is slightly harder just multiplying two scaled numbers and then divide by your scale factor

2205247min	max
pattern0		
it s interesting that this works since the documentation states that max must be larger than min but it looks like -1 is treated more like an empty or null value

2205637jax-ws	saaj
pattern0		
one could use saaj soap with attachments api for java which runs at a lower level than jax-ws

2207296nuxeo	alfresco
pattern2		
at the moment i am in doubth to choose between alfresco and nuxeo

2211122opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		pattern4		
we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

2211693rss	feed
pattern4		
selects rss feed

2213961google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
i inspected the range object in both google-chrome and firefox and then noticed that firefox s range object is far richer than google-chrome s

2214345hash-collision	key
pattern4		
also as sellibitze says an operator is needed to compare key in case of hash-collision

2215853wadl	wsdl
pattern2		
wsdl 2.0 can be used to describe rest web services and thus competes with wadl

2215853wadl	wsdl
pattern2		
so while wsdl 2.0 competes with wadl as rest web service description languages wdl 2.0 has more but lets forget that for now xrd is a metadata discovery format for any uri openid discovery being one of the primary use case

2221787postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
the question is is mysql somehow more resistant than postgresql to sql injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case

2224831jruby	mri
pattern0		
the jruby runtime alone is already pretty heavy much heavier than mri

2225196getter	setter
pattern3		
i think most people will recommend using setter getter

2225598zen-cart	magento
pattern7		pattern0		
alternatively zen-cart looks simpler than magento but without some of the flexibility

2228203min	max
pattern4		
i need to select max and min of one column accrding to some criteria process this information and remove data according to the same criteria

2230024ant	maven
pattern7		pattern0		
the quotation you brought up just claim that maven does more than ant so that it s not fair to compare the two

2233076width	height
pattern7		
details i wish to resize it to a specified width keep the proportions and if the height is bigger than a specified value to crop it to the specified height

2237879haskell	scheme
pattern2		
haskell and f# are statically typed which is a big advantage for real-life projects but imho they have a little too much syntax and are not as easy to pick up as scheme

2238063strtol	atoi
pattern7		
the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi

2239021wcat	loadrunner
pattern7	easier	
microsoft s free application for stress-testing wcat is underpowered and buggy but the full blown test edition goes up against products like loadrunner but is easier to use better-integrated with vs asp.net and for much less money per virtual user

2242618int	double
pattern7		
using and at the same time to check equality on a int results in slower code because it takes two comparisons instead of one taking the double amount of time

2242654for-loop	loops
pattern7		
further as a for-loop it is easier to read as everything initialization loops condition expression to be executed after each iteration are all on one line

2245273feedparser	beautifulsoup
pattern7	better	
you could use beautifulsoup - but feedparser is much better geared towards rss handing

2248145google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
this alleviated some of our performance issues but even on subsequent refreshes we noticed ie6 taking substantially longer than ie7+ firefox google-chrome etc

2248328put	get
pattern4		
if generated by the matches for this regex was not the whole capture - then a single-call replace would not be possible - and your question would probably be asking why doesn t the whole match get put into instead of the other way round

2251790jar	manifest.mf
pattern7	file more	
putting it in the jar file among the classes or adding its jar-relative path to the class-path entry of the jar s manifest.mf file is more than sufficient

2252782uiview	subviews
pattern0		
if you take a look at the associated guides you ll see core animation and layers does require hit testing though that s relatively easy but it s far cleaner than the uiview doing all the drawing and more efficient than many subviews

2252951set	bag
pattern7	easier	
a set or bag is easier to map in hibernate and requires fewer database columns

2253645wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
pattern8		
now all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standard is a nice feature

2254734javassist	cglib
pattern2		
another similar example is hibernate that lets you choose between cglib and javassist in hibernate-core in the same way

2254966glut	glfw
pattern7		
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle

2254966glut	fltk
pattern0		
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implemented than glut itself

2256282calloc	malloc
pattern4		pattern2		
if you belong to the second camp which apparently you do then you prefer malloc over calloc

2256479tolower	uppercase
pattern10		pattern10		
further uppercase comparison is more optimized than tolower if that tiny degree of performance matters

2258346maven	cargo
pattern0		
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates but that s serious overkill given that we re using jetty

2258513min	max
pattern7		pattern0		
you might want to ensure that max is greater than min

2259414maven	cargo
pattern0		
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates

2259852kde	gnome
pattern4		
in general you can choose gnome or kde with any distro and you can even install both

2260142width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
this code should draw the test rectangles only when the height is less than the width and otherwise the window should remain clear

2261289cos	sin
pattern0		pattern0		
no for-loops or math.pow which is amazingly slow way slower than sin cos etc

2262152division	modulo
pattern0		
if so this should work and it should also be a lot quicker than using modulo and division

2264994freemarker	velocity
pattern7	better	
i suggest using a template engine such as freemarker for this or velocity but freemarker is better imo

2265491rss	feed
pattern3		
i would recommend using rss feed to extract content

2268913min	max
pattern4		
i could find only this one which produces somewhat clean sql still not really effective comparing to select min val max val from table

2269313haskell	ocaml
pattern10		pattern10		pattern0		
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor

2269993haskell	ocaml
pattern8		
you will also likely find the performance characteristics of your ocaml code more intuitive than haskell because of haskell s lazy evaluation

2272341bazaar	git
pattern3		
i would recommend using git bazaar or another vcs which doesn t require you to tell it when you move sources around

2273770post	get
pattern4		
jsf favors post requests but you can still use get if you want -- it depends on your need and if the page needs to be bookmarkable

2275121min	max
pattern4		pattern4		
note this example also demonstrates that it is not safe to use select max id +1 or select min id -1 as the next available unique value if we do it under concurrency

2277052postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
postgresql is older than mysql so it might have influenced them

2277387explode	implode
pattern4		
i have an ugly solution that works explode the search string into an array of words look up each word in the array of stopwords unset them if there is a match implode the remaining words and finally run a regex to add the boolean mode formatting

2277474daemons	systemd
pattern0		
use daemons mode and then simply touching the wsgi script file when an atomic set of changes have been completed isn t that hard and certainly safer than a systemd which restarts arbitrarily when it detects any single change

2278301postgresql	mysql
pattern7	easier	
i ve used both db systems before and while postgresql is great for it s licensing terms and standards compliance mysql is definitely easier to get up and running quickly

2278301postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
i don t want this to be a mysql postgresql is better than postgresql mysql debate

2279388postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
as a developer i prefer postgresql over mysql as the latter behaves different from version to version they re still playing catchup to the sql standard and probably always will

2279388postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
if you actually prefer mysql over postgresql i d lay out a migration plan just to be ready if need arises as a kind of lazy proactiveness .

2280675udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp

2280810integer	unsigned
pattern7	type rank greater	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

2281068swt	swing
pattern10		pattern10		
swt has a more platform-specific look about it but java ships with swing built-in there s no messing about with external libraries as with swt although the use of eclipse may make that much easier i still develop quite a bit of my stuff from the command line unfortunately

2282055x509	openpgp
pattern7		pattern0		
openpgp is simpler than x509 but more limited especially if you wish to have a strong legal meaning behind the certificates

2284148google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		pattern0		
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

2285241width	height
pattern7	easier	
tablelayout gives you a good mechanism for rows and columns managing width and height is easier but you d need more code to change the placement of all controls if you want to remove one from the form dynamically

2285314tcpdf	fpdf
pattern0		
if anyone has some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf

2287642coalesce	isnull
pattern0		
i understand the difference between these functions but my question is when checking for a single null value would isnull be any quicker than using coalesce

2287656coalesce	isnull
pattern0		
isnull will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than coalesce

2287673coalesce	isnull
pattern4		pattern2		pattern8		
to prefer isnull over coalesce when given the choice is that isnull tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than coalesce

2288413wcf	openrasta
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
building restful services with openrasta is much simpler than with wcf in my experience

2288879udp	tcp
pattern10	server faster	pattern10	server faster	
see this reply what happens when tcp udp server is publishing faster than client is consuming

2290354haskell	ocaml
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		
keith pointed out that haskell has a more powerful type system but it can also be said that ocaml has a more powerful module system than haskell

2290354haskell	ocaml
pattern0		
as others have pointed out ocaml s learning curve will be lower than haskell s

2290873udp	tcp
pattern0		
tcp is reliable but slower than udp while udp is not safe and i have to implement my own fault-handling codes

2290931icmp	udp
pattern0		
an icmp packet has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than udp

2292967gentoo	linux	opera	firefox
pattern0		
update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd

2294832opera	google-chrome
pattern0		
also nice to know is the fact that the latest version of google-chrome and also opera don t know since when but longer than google-chrome supports userscripts out of the box no need to install any add-ons

2297317ecdsa	rsa
pattern7		pattern0		
from the central authority point of view ecdsa also allows better performance on my pc using a single core openssl crunches out more than 6500 ecdsa signatures per second in the p-192 nist curve and only 1145 rsa signatures per second with a 1024-bit key

2302260vmware	virtualbox	vmware	esx	virtualbox	esx
pattern4		
because of compatibility with vmware infrastructure esx i would prefer vmware for headless server operations and virtualbox for anything that requires user interaction photoshop gui etc

2305116opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

2305350ant	maven
pattern4		
to echo other sentiments i find there is more configuration to do with ant so i prefer maven

2305597xfce	gnome
pattern4		
if you prefer gnome or xfce gtk qt can also use your gtk theme

2306404multiplying	add
pattern7		
the multiplying operation uses more clock cycles than the add on many processors

2308120gif	png
pattern0		
convert it to png 10-30 smaller than gif on average

2311926width	height
pattern3		
if you re simply trying to resize an image i d recommend setting width and height of the image with css

2315102opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

i think it doesn t work entirely correctly in ie6 but it is fine in ie7-8 firefox safari win opera google-chrome

2315740margin	height
pattern7	somehow bigger	
i used firebug to look at the divs and imgs and both imgs have 0 for margin padding and border yet the computed height somehow is 4.5px bigger in the first instance

2315847udp	mtu
pattern0		
udp uses datagrams chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story

2318331deque	multimap
pattern10	more	pattern10	more impression	
the map set multimap and multiset are normally implemented as binary trees with red-black balancing rules for example and deque is possibly more impression than knowledge a circular queue in an array exploiting an array-doubling or similar growth pattern

2319001kerberos	ntlm
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
but since ntlm is less secure than kerberos why isn t it the other way around

2319482min	max
pattern4		
- the other which does a select min max from flat_file grouping by source into another temp file

2320135udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
udp is a connectionless protocol which has zero error-checking it is that is the trade-off with tcp it is faster than tcp

2321232free	malloc
pattern4		
additionally i try to add the code to delete destroy free as soon as i add the code to create init malloc

2322595ant	maven
pattern4		
i d recommend ant long before maven

2323942width	height
pattern0		
the point is inside the circle iff that value is smaller than the height or width of the box

2324076postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

2324403subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		pattern10	more	pattern10	more expensive	
multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

2327607width	height

there is actually an easy o 2 n brute force solution where n is either the width or the height whichever is smaller

2329664hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

2329892width	height
pattern7		
you do this by dismissing all variations where the width is lower than the depth so for each i w i d i and then dismissing the variation where the height is not the highest nor the lowest of the three dimensions because the other two variations can go one on top of the other and this one can t join in

233176616-bit	64bit
pattern0		
in that case the answer is basically both. normally int won t be bigger than a processor register unless that s smaller than 16-bit but it could be smaller a 32-bit compiler running on a 64bit processor

2336345free	malloc
pattern7		
suppose char p malloc n assigns more than n say n bytes of memory are allocated and free p is used to free the memory allocated to p

2336552gif	png
pattern7		
png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not

2336560gif	png
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
compared to gif png offers better compression larger pallette and more features including transparency

2336727put	get
pattern4		
from the results get all the user_id s that match put them in an array

2338532implements	extends
pattern4		
i recommend extends one of the list classes that has already implements a dataprovider property it s a lot to tackle

2342400accurev	cvs
pattern2		
we still use cvs for some projects and even it is so much better for normal operations and workflow that i d pick it over accurev

2342794width	height
pattern7	smaller	pattern7	smaller	
overall width height is much smaller

2346116hide	show

while i understand the class names parent child - to sort the reply to thread i didn t figure out why the id s are continuous - maybe to choose hide show specific comments

2347286for-loop	loops
pattern10	more	pattern10	more readable	
there s no point in using a for-loop a while loops is more readable

2349523width	height
pattern0		
might make it easier than your width 0|| width 170|| height 0|| height 200

2349847persistent	transient
pattern7		
memcache data lives in memory and isn t persistent so is for more transient data

2350342pull	push

the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow

2350402wordpress	joomla
pattern10		pattern10		
imho wordpress is better do work and customize than joomla

2350959ecdsa	rsa
pattern0		
if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signatures - ecdsa signatures are considerably smaller than rsa signatures of an equivalent security factor

2351273fgets	strlen
pattern0		
read the number in a char array a with scanf s a or better with fgets and output the char array reversed by outputting each character starting from strlen a - 1 to 0

2352738collabnet	svn
pattern4		
i highly recommend collabnet svn use the apache option in the install and tortoisesvn as a nice gui client

2352784collabnet	svn
pattern10		pattern10		
however svn protocol is much faster so i suggest using collabnet svn for performance reasons

2353190memcached	apc
pattern0		
apc access is a bit faster something like 5 times faster than memcached if i remember correctly as it s only local -- no network involved

2353621128bit	64bit
pattern0		
excel cannot process data more than 64bit big it will store it in powers of 10 but in our application i want 128bit data for that i have formatted particular cell to be text format in excel sheet so that i can enter very big number

2354091udp	tcp
pattern4		pattern2		
why would i choose udp over tcp for a serious high-performance server with the added overhead of message

2355827sqldatareader	sqlconnection
pattern0		
once you have this you should be able to have more than one sqldatareader shared on the same sqlconnection in your code and use them independently of one another

2357720int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
i ve always been taught that if an int is larger than a chars you must solve the byte ordering problem

2360256mouseover	mouseout
pattern7	clearer	
also if you re setting these on mouseover and mouseout it is arguably clearer to simply use the hover event instead

2360320ubuntu	debian
pattern8		
anyway for the past year i ve been using fink and apt-get on leopard because i m more familiar with debian ubuntu

2364616udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp

2369434addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
multiplication has higher precedence than addition + which is why 2+3 4 is interpreted as 2+ 3 4 both in c and normal math

2369500innodb	myisam
pattern0		
innodb tables are even slower than myisam tables for inserts and the delayed key write option is not available

2369906sum	coalesce
pattern4		
coalesce select sum other_field from other_table where ... 0 as p3

2374164hide	show
pattern10		pattern10		
it displays things normally on the screen of course but when you go to print preview in ie7 the only thing that show is longer description. so in other words it hide that first column and it also hide the second column

2377467awt	swing
pattern7		pattern0		
in swing has more features than the awt components

2377819preorder	inorder
pattern7	approach much faster	
especially look at the last two results for longer strings for which the preorder inorder approach is much faster than brute force

2378007awt	swing	swt	swing
pattern0		
if you want a java gui that actually looks nice well nicer than swing or awt then you want to check out swt from ibm

2380280integer	unsigned
pattern0		
a cgkeycode is nothing more than an unsigned integer

2380391mbunit	nunit
pattern4		
i would also recommend mbunit which has all of nunit s features along with some good support for the integration tests that you will probably be writing by accident as you are starting out with testing

2382565union	distinct
pattern4		
note in my version of sql union queries automatically select distinct records so the distinct flag isn t needed

2383447fiddler	charles
pattern4		
i prefer charles but any web debugging proxy fiddler included should help out

2384641versioning	upgrade
pattern4		
can anyone verify that i need to upgrade subversion on the client machine to match versioning on server 1.6.9

2385869min	max
pattern4		
use a series of union ed selects each one selecting one of the six columns and then use this as the inner nested select where you then use select max min from that

2386794int	double
pattern7		
the double has a bigger mantissa the int bits of the real number

2389112post	get
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
why everybody here is saying post is more secure than get when used over https

2389888strlen	substr
pattern7	safer	
i heard that in php there are some alternatives for the functions substr and strlen which handles safer bits

2395283inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties

prefer encapsulation over inherited having each of your current subclassing contain a complex properties with all the common fields

2397232piston	tastypie
pattern0		
- similar to piston but i ve had better luck with tastypie

2397466post	get

eventually i went back to post because we needed the fix quick but it has been bugging me because semantically a get is more correct in this case

2398216filesystems	fat
pattern8		
most modern filesystems are also considerably more complex than fat which would add further difficulty to the implementation

2402860richfaces	trinidad
pattern8		
regarding skinning i feel trinidad default skinning to be more basic than richfaces one but i think both have ways to make them as beautiful as your css skills allow you

2402860richfaces	trinidad
pattern10		pattern10		
i think richfaces has a more mature ajax integration and their ajax components and events are more easy to use for me than trinidad ones

2406180cpu	processors
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processors it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encoded in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime

2406721umask	sudo
pattern10		pattern10		
if you forget to use this and your default umask is more restrictive or less restrictive then you will need to re-run the non- sudo

2411687mvp	presenter
pattern7		
i have been searching on the net and i made a couple of examples of both of them but i m even more confused because in some sample web pages mvp uses more than 2 interfaces to communicate the presenter with the view layer some ones even have completely blank interfaces only declarated but in other ones it only takes two interfaces to transport data from presenter to view

my site displays just like in need in ie and opera but in firefox i can t get via css to have font sizes smaller than firefox default minimum-font-size

2422339nunit	mstest
pattern7	better	
he concludes that nunit wins for unit testing but mstest has much better abilities for integration based testing and team testing with team system

2422410nunit	mstest
pattern10		pattern10		
for example nunit offers more assert methods than mstest

2428697strtol	atoi
pattern4		pattern7		
i would recommend strtol which provides better error handling than atoi or sscanf

2428923spaces	delimiter
pattern10	less	pattern10	less likely	
by wrapping the - in spaces the delimiter is less likely to be tripped up and there s no need to trim the result

2429581int	boolean
pattern0		
types narrower than int are widened to int in expressions anyway - so the boolean operators would still work on int operands

2430207width	font-size
pattern7	less	
you can then check if the width of the text is greater than 800px and reduce the font-size until the width is less than or equal to

2430207width	font-size
pattern7	less	
that is repeatedly reduce the font-size by 5 until the total width is less than or equal to 800px

2430575lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern7		
lxml also has more features and offers beautifulsoup too

2431212gson	jackson

i would prefer maven for a new project because i can follow sensible maven conventions but would use ant build scripts for existing projects

2433836hide	show
pattern4		
would i just have different user controls for each page and create show and destroy hide them on request

2435935maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
pattern4		
you already know the answer to the very oriented body of your question there is no ant equivalent to this minimal pom.xml because unlike maven ant does not define a set of standards patterns conventions in other words a lingua franca or shared language for project management that would make it possible so ant can t beat maven on this sample

2435935ant	maven
pattern8		
does this make ant more complex than maven

2435935ant	maven
pattern0		
but maven and ant are so different that there is no real point at comparing them and maven is still much more than ant + dependency management

2436304lisp	scheme
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
common lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure

2438099ati	nvidia
pattern8		
for example i ve noticed nvidia s glsl compiler is a little more picky than ati s and rejects some shader code that otherwise works fine

2440196int	chars
pattern0		
similarly if the score values don t need to be unsigned int make the array smaller by using chars or uint16_t

2443473cpu	processors
pattern10		pattern10		
as soon as you go beyond single processors it s much more effective to add another cpu or two to system than to struggle with gpu calculations

2447484postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
is postgresql better than mysql for such purpose

2448434sorting	grouping
pattern0		
on myisam tables in some cases the subselects tend to be faster than grouping by queries due to the fact that grouping by in myisam is quite expensive due to sorting materialization overhead

2452088width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
my assumption is that the library would take a vertical image see that the height is greater than the width and translate the height width config appropriately so the image remains vertical

2452926postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
postgresql will always be a little bit more mature than mysql

2461383strtol	atoi
pattern0		
all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno strtol is way much better than atoi in any case so avoid using atoi

2465473disk	ram
pattern7		
more ram means less disk access

2467039hash	md5
pattern0		
some common examples are the crc checksums of which crc32 is very common but you can also relatively easily compute 64 or 128 bit or even larger crcs much much faster than an md5 hash

2467567mp3	ogg
pattern7		
ogg vorbis is better quality per meg than mp3 plus no licensing legal issues

2468876profiler	yourkit
pattern4		
now get some profiler with memory profiling capability i prefer yourkit

2469679int	boolean
pattern10		pattern10		
from the link which is mentioned in question my question is that microsoft says the c# type keywords and their aliases are interchangeable but why we need aliases from my point of view boolean is more meaningful then bool and int32 is more meaningful then int then why aliases

2470483crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
pattern4		
if you want to compare hash compare the output of your crypt call with the value in shadow both hash need to be created with the same salt

2472862getchar	getline
pattern10		pattern10		
getline is probably better than getchar in most cases

2474454armadillo	lapack
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
edit in response to the comment armadillo does not require lapack but works better with it and better still with tuned blas

2474666firefox	safari
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
i just tested geolocation on firefox 3.6 and iphone safari os 3.1.3 the result is interesting firefox is more accurate than safari

2476569perforce	svn
pattern8		
and if you just want something faster or more scalable than svn then just buy a commercial product - i ve used both perforce and rational clearcase and they scale up to huge projects without any problems

2478463gif	png
pattern4		
png beats gif on everything except that animations are not supported mng supports them though

2479042actionscript	mxml
pattern0		
what s the deal i thought actionscript would be nicer than mxml

2481595spreadsheetml	presentationml
pattern10		pattern10		
the one thing to keep in mind is that spreadsheetml is more similiar to presentationml than it is to wordprocessingml in file structure inside the package for every sheet there is a seperate file

2481915for-loop	loops
pattern7		pattern0		
i ve done a small experiment as will be shown below and it looks like that a while loops is faster than a for-loop in perl

2482755width	height
pattern7	lower	
however in this case when i have 150px height image the 150 width seems start lower

2482760mockito	jmock
pattern8		
for the record jmock as of today supports more complex scenarios than mockito that s why the initial learning curve is steeper

2483182mp3	flac
pattern7		
if a flac file is newer than the corresponding mp3 file or the corresponding mp3 file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of commands to convert the flac file to an mp3 file and copy the tags across

2483418mp3	flac
pattern7		
if a flac file is newer than the corresponding mp3 file or the corresponding mp3 file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of commands to convert the flac file to an mp3 file and copy the tags across

2489451postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use postgresql a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than mysql via py-postgresql

2492747vim	emacs
pattern4		
although you can look on vim or emacs i prefer emacs - they are hard on the beginning but very when you are experienced user - they give you many cool features

2494386width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
i m not an expert on css but isn t using style a better idea than width height attributes

2499632width	font-size
pattern7		
if the width is greater than the fixed width bump the font-size down and then check the width again

2499632width	font-size
pattern7		
keep on lowering the font-size until the span s width is less than the fixed width

2500838google-chrome	firefox
pattern2		
i really recommend browsing with google-chrome when you re looking to debug javascript it s error console is very useful for not just determining errors like this but also for pinpointing the location in the script that is throwing the error which might be an advantage beyond firebug in firefox

2502963wxpython	pygtk
pattern7		pattern0		
also pygtk is lighter than wxpython but i ended up bitting the bullet and using wxpython for the same purpose recently it is heavy but it didn t have any affect on the script performance

2504224int	chars
pattern0		
in fact quite a bit of i o depends on eof having a value that couldn t originate from the file which basically translates to a requirement that chars have a range that s smaller than int not just smaller than or equal to as the standard directly requires

2504224int	chars	unsigned	short
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
that does leave one loophole though it s one that would generally be quite horrible that chars and short have the same range size_type is the same as unsigned short and int has a greater range than chars short

2504816equals	compareto
pattern0		
the interface defines one method compareto that must return a negative integer zero or a positive integer if this object is less than equals to or greater than the other object respectively

2504896ubuntu	linux
pattern7	much cleaner	
i ve used python on windows and on ubuntu and linux is much cleaner

2507588firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
compare safari or google-chrome and firefox click the tabs

2508351lisp	scheme
pattern7		
if you want to learn lisp paip is a better choice to start with because it will teach you a lot about common lisp and a smallish chunk of scheme

2512461google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
so i wonder the benchmark is also influenced by the installed extensions or google-chrome is really so much higher than firefox in performance

2514778calloc	malloc
pattern2		
compare against calloc instead but also note that malloc and calloc are both available from c++ in the unlikely event that they do prove measurably faster

2514978aim	instant
pattern4		
i like to create a cell like contacts s add instant messages table view with two cells to select aim and home

2516823mp3	wav
pattern0		
i am looking for a good new component that offers more help with wav and mp3 files too but not found what i am looking for yet

2517519addition	multiplication
pattern8		
note that this algorithm avoids any math more complicated than addition and multiplication so will likely have much better performance than something that requires trig functions

2518299ati	nvidia
pattern8		
more useful with nvidia than ati for example

2519625min	max
pattern4		
what if i had two parameters i wanted back from my query ie select max cola min colb into max min.....

2521374int	double
pattern10		pattern10		
by contrast void doitagain int is more specific than void doitagain double because int is a subtype of double according the the jls

2522075width	height
pattern7	smaller	
when the image is resized while maintaining its aspect ratio chances are that either the image s height or width becomes smaller than imageview s dimensions

2523038gif	png
pattern0		
but keep in mind that the gif color palette is way smaller than png

2523083gif	png
pattern0		
note that if you convert your png files to gif images they are likely to look uglier as gif files can only have 256 colors and do not support alpha-transparency

2526615post	put	post	get	put	get
pattern4		
first get request shouldn t be used to alter states on the server so for your vote service i would recommend post put

2526831mp3	speex	wma	speex
pattern0		pattern0		
speex is designed for speech and should perform better than wma mp3 or other audio codecs that are designed to handle music if you are just encoding speech which i assume since you are grabbing from the mic

2529053singleton	facade
pattern0		
can any one tell me which one is better between session facade class and singleton object design patterns in asp.net

2530292int	chars
pattern7		pattern7		
to the best of my memory according to the c standard for example a chars is one byte short is wider or the same as chars int is wider or the same as short long is wider or the same as int and so on

2532564int	chars
pattern0		
i ve written chars counter c extension to python looks like 300x faster than collections.counter and 150x faster than collections.default int

2535143jar	war
pattern4		
you can use eclipse to compare jar war files

2535303lwjgl	jogl
pattern4		
otherwise i would definitely recommend jogl or its competitor lwjgl

2535830ubuntu	linux
pattern7	cygwin smaller	
if you just want the fun of linux command line programs without access to all of ubuntu cygwin is smaller and might be faster

2537898int	chars
pattern0		
if you will have more than a chars 1 can hold go tiny int 0-255 1 byte if you need more go smallint 32k 2 byte if you need more go int 2 147 483 647 4 byte

2538204getter	setter
pattern0		
i generally don t write unit tests for bean classes with little more than getter and setter

2539220post	get
pattern0		
post get method doesn t have the same lenght limit you can use post to send more data than with get

2539525jquery	scriptaculous
pattern10		pattern10		
i have used both prototype scriptaculous as well as jquery in many projects and based on what i am seeing it appears jquery has the more plug-in available so am leaning towards using jquery

2542137draggable	droppable
pattern7		pattern0		
but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable

2542930oursql	mysql-python
pattern7		
i hear oursql is nicer the mysql-python

2547502int	chars
pattern0		
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined

2551657int	double
pattern0		
edit actually my solution does not work because double can be very big much bigger than int and also very small like fractions

2553557width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if the width is wider than the height make your target size 500 x 375 otherwise make it 375 x 500

2555347equals	compareto
pattern7	greater	
if compareto returns a negative int it means less than 0 means equals 1 means greater than

2556364jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	tapestry	wicket
pattern8		pattern8		
in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s ioc container makes it more powerful than wicket

2556671maven	m2e
pattern4		
once generated run mvn eclipse eclipse if you are using the maven eclipse plugin or right-click on your project and select maven update project configuration if you are using m2e

2557897dwoo	smarty
pattern0		
so far it has proven to be faster than smarty and it provides a compatibility layer to allow developers that have been using smarty for years to switch their application over to dwoo progressively

2558762hex	binary
pattern7		
a hex string is significantly longer than the corresponding binary string

2560929folder	directory
pattern0		
obviously in this case the call could return more than one item if there was more than one folder named test in your directory tree

2561800umask	chmod	chown	chmod	chown	umask
pattern7		
but changing the chmod maybe even working with umask is better than dealing with root-access and using chown

2566763postgresql	mysql
pattern7	better	
also if you open to moving away from mysql i ve found that postgresql has much better resolution of deadlocks

2568456exponent	modulo
pattern0		
rsa parameters contains more parameters than modulo and exponent if i remember correctly

2570552free	malloc
pattern0		pattern0		
why new delete is slower than malloc free

2570593free	malloc
pattern0		
if the constructors and destructors are empty like for built-ins new and delete shouldn t be slower than malloc and free are

2571426google-chrome	firefox
pattern2		
button you will notice that the sign in panel fieldset#login-controls is shown improperly compare with firefox or google-chrome

2571643width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
i see that they are squeezed such that the height is more than the width

2576102udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp

2576512udp	tcp
pattern4		
it can be done to beat tcp for stream transfer using udp if you don t have nat to think about

2577829int	double
pattern7		
it should be always string if its int value is greater than 2 32 unsigned simply cast by string uid is not work and sprintf .0f ... will only works when int value less than 2 52 because on 32-bit os when a number is greater than 2 31 32 unsigned php will assume it is double type and default precise is only 14 decimal but fbid is 20

2578122mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
pattern10	event more	pattern10	event more	
mousedown mouseup is indeed the only way you can get notified of middle button interaction so detecting a down-then-up event without intervening mouseout event is more or less the best you can do

2581314jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
pattern0		
the jpopupmenu has this behavior but i need more than just jmenuitem

2581597int	chars
pattern0		
the only reason i can think of is the objective-c designers micro-optimising storage because the chars will use less memory than the int

2582032int	double
pattern7		
double has range more than a 64-bit int but its precision is less dues to its representation since double is 64-bit as well it can t fit more actual values

2583350apache	nginx
pattern0		
tornadoweb and nginx are popular web servers for the moment and many benchmarkings show that they have a better performance than apache under certain circumstances

2588115min	max
pattern4		
assuming you will only have one max huge assumption you can do min tableaid where grade select max grade etc....

2588997udp	tcp
pattern8		
instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp

2593898udp	tcp
pattern7	odder	
to be trying to implement them using different protocols tcp and udp is even odder h323 voip is the only applciation i know of which does this

2596452width	height
pattern0		
even if the text size is far larger than the width or height of the textview

2599270division	multiplication
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
as a general rule division is slow and multiplication is faster and bit shifting is faster yet

2605364stdout	fflush
pattern7		
occasionally the stdout needs more than a write method fflush is another common one which stringio will handle

2605897postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
i personally prefer postgresql over mysql and find it very scalable even with millions or even billions of rows when setup correctly

2611604for-loop	while-loop
pattern10		pattern10		
i have also found that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop

2616927children	parent
pattern0		
as a side note the children can t have a higher z-index than their parent so everything inside .codbg is -1 behind the page then you need to fix the tab images the problem is not that they re behind the background it s that they re transparent and look darker on top of a darker background

2625948int	double
pattern7		
because a double is higher it will merge the int into the 0.0

2640600hash	hmac
pattern10	more	pattern10	more secure	
because you can guess the top passwords and see if they have the same hash but the author points out that hmac is a more secure mechanism

2642719perl	tcl
pattern4		
performance beats tcl perl python ruby

2643216selenium	sahi
pattern4		
even though we have switch to selenium mentioned above as a better tool i still can recommend sahi for testing automation

2645653fseek	ftell
pattern10	solution less	pattern10	solution less syscall	
if you are looking for the size of the file the fseek ftell solution seems less syscall expensive

2649627integer	unsigned
pattern7	type rank greater	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand

2651264maven	m2e
pattern0		
that way of adding dependencies is better managed by maven with m2e

2652547division	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
it s just as fast as going the opposite direction if not faster given that division generally takes longer than multiplication

2652588division	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		
even simpler and probably even faster because multiplication is faster than division is dav s answer which is the most natural algorithm.

2656592x86	mips
pattern8		
a better bet might be to install spim and to learn mips assembly which is more straightforward than x86 anyways

2659365imperative	declarative
pattern8		
as a coder sql is my weakest link since i am far more comfortable with imperative languages than declarative ones - but i want to change that

2668072mockito	jmock
pattern7		
i suggest that you to move jmock which has a better api or even to mockito whose protocol is even simpler

2669409int	chars
pattern0		
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined

2681809for-loop	loops
pattern10	better	
for example you know foreach loops is heavy and if we use for-loop is better

2681920datamapper	activerecord
pattern10		pattern10		
also datamapper is much more ruby syntax friendy and features like lazy loading when doing chainable conditions like activerecord in rails 3 are there from the beginning

2682753int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
it s going to be a performance memory trade-off anyway because writing one int is generally faster than three chars separately

2685687postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
postgresql is a little more strict than mysql about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings

2686734gif	png
pattern7		
gif is smaller because it s based on an colour palette of 256 colours rather than the separate rgb values for each pixel or group of pixels in jpg and png

2687926width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if i have an image whose width is greater than its height rotating that image using this method and then painting it will result in the image being painted vertically above the point 0 0 and horizontally to the right of the point 0 0

2688466calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
pattern0		
my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

2688522calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
pattern7		pattern0		
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset

2688522calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
pattern7		pattern0		
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

2688976trie	tree
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		
finally b+ tree is admittedly more difficult to implement than a trie it s more on a red-black tree level of complexity

2691891post	put
pattern2		
better is to choose between put and post based on idempotence of the action

2692369division	multiplication
pattern7	harder	
for multiplication division it s harder ie more instructions

2694299postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
in other words is mysql better or worse than postgresql to handle unicode etc

2695956vim	emacs
pattern10	more	pattern10	more powerful	
edit going into why vim or emacs is far more powerful in many respects than your typical ide could get quite lengthy and there are already several questions on so which cover that

2696560equals	gethashcode
pattern4		
for .net 2.0 you could implement equals and gethashcode for your class but this might give undesirable behaviour in other situations where you don t want two player objects to compare equals if they have the same name but differ in other fields

2699569dictionary	map
pattern0		
std map though is actually implemented in a way that many operations are slower than dictionary as its size gets large

2699569dictionary	map
pattern0		
for suitably large examples of each dictionary overcomes the constant factor by which it s slower than std map and will actually do operations like lookup insertion etc

2699569dictionary	map
pattern7		
i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations andâ in at least some implementationsâ leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has

2702493printf	strtod
pattern0		
if you re really concerned with portability i m not sure that there s any better option than using printf and strtod and assuming that you may not necessarily have any more accuracy than the absolute minimum required by he relevant specification section 5.2.4.2.2 of the c99 spec.

2703354min	max	minimum	max
pattern0		
the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

2703428cpython	pypy
pattern10		pattern10		
just keep in mind most of the time c is faster than python but then again most of the time pypy is faster than cpython

2707919getter	setter
pattern4		
on the generate setter and getter screen you have select getter button on the right - use it

2708385getter	setter
pattern0		
i added my own implementation not because yours didn t work but to show how you could delegate responsibilities to classes which reflect the problem domain making the code a bit more readable though considerably longer with boilerplate getter and setter

2708621for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
pattern10		pattern10		
my view is that option 1 is clumsy code and involves unnecessary creation of an arrays even though the for-each loops is more efficient than the traditional for-loop in option 2

2711216nginx	lighttpd
pattern0		
according to this benchmark nginx is a little bit better than lighttpd for serving bigger static contents so nginx would be a good choice for static flv video contents

2718168hash	md5
pattern10		pattern10		
obviously md5 is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will hash to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits

2721585serializable	deserialization
pattern7	faster	
if the orb implements local object optimization sometimes collocated objects then it will not open any sockets but it will perform serializable deserialization which is typically faster than marshalling

2722165int	chars
pattern7	greater	
the range of a signed chars is usually -128 to 127 whereas the range of an int is far greater

2725237width	height
pattern0		
you can use different overflow values in css auto should cause a scrollbar to appear when text is bigger than the height width will allow or hidden to cut it off

2727143teamcity	nant
pattern4		
i would recommend teamcity - free for up to three agents 20 projects and 20 users runs a variety of builders nant included and can parse nunit results hudson can do all this too i believe however i have no used it so i can t speak from experience

2731984adplus	procdump
pattern0		
if you have a customer who is willing to work with you a bit it might shed some light on the situation to get a crash dump with adplus or maybe simpler with sysinternals procdump when the error message is showing

2738559fileoutputstream	filewriter
pattern0		
usually better than filewriter already suggested is to use fileoutputstream which also like filewriter has an append parameter in one of its constructors and which unlike filewriter does not silently assume the default charset encoding slightly bad practice imo

2740480width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
which will paint all the text red when the window width is less than its height

2741553lisp	scheme
pattern0		
for a counterexample i think scheme programs ran faster and used less memory than the lisp programs that preceded them mdash

2743437rsa	aes
pattern7		pattern0		
so the 115 seconds will be reduced to 3-4 secs plus the encryption decryption time used for aes which is much faster than rsa

2745292punctuation	words
pattern4		
i m one of those who prefers words to punctuation -- it s one of the reasons i ve picked python over perl for example

2747251freemarker	velocity
pattern3		
i would recommend using freemarker or velocity

2747873gif	png
pattern0		
just press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background png file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a gif file and is as good as a jpg

2750790int	chars
pattern7		
for instance a plain old c-array of 100 000 chars is smaller than the same 100 000 int by a factor of four but if during an enumeration reading out each index involves a cast boxing unboxing of sorts will we see overall lower performance despite the saved memory overhead

2752712pyquery	beautifulsoup
pattern0		
pyquery uses the css selector syntax familiar from jquery which i find more intuitive than beautifulsoup s

2752712lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern0		
it uses lxml underneath and is much faster than beautifulsoup

2753401mako	genshi
pattern4		
for building html pages i prefer genshi over cheetah or mako even if it s quite a bit slower

2755024hide	show
pattern7	more	
are you using the jquery ui accordian or using the jquery accordian which is more or less a series of show and hide which is used more commonly i would think

2756807postgresql	mysql
pattern0		pattern0		
in my cases postgresql was better than mysql mysql do not completely support unicode

2757616innodb	myisam
pattern0		
database performance of the innodb is not necessary faster than the myisam engine

2757869phpunit	simpletest
pattern10		pattern10		
phpunit is more popular and up to date as simpletest hasn t had a new release for some time though for testing webforms it s still very useful as phpunit does not have good support for that

2757943public	protected

it s not perfect but i guess that a protected method that does not check parameters is better than a public method that does not do it

2760426webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern0		
i d rather use webclient because it requires less code than httpwebrequest httpwebresponse

2762721jquery	scriptaculous
pattern0		
i also kind of get the impression that scriptaculous drag and drop is better than jquery ui drag and drop based on the online demos

2764159addclass	removeclass
pattern3		
instead of css i recommend using addclass and removeclass respectively

2769643apache	lighttpd
pattern7		pattern0		
- if you move towards more static content or go the fastcgi way lighttpd is faster than apache

2770804int	double
pattern0		
i am supposed to write and algorithm which uses recursion divide-and-conquer to multiply two arrays.these arrays hold big numbers that are greater than long int 64 or double capacity

2772014hash	md5
pattern7	slower	
it doesn t even matter much what algorithm is used - one could even use md5 or md4 and the passwords would be just as safe there is a slight difference because computing a sha-1 hash is slower

2774501cvs	svn
pattern4		pattern2		
i would recommend svn over cvs but don t confuse versioning system with publishing

2774835lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern4		
i recommend beautifulsoup or lxml

2777894min	max
pattern7		pattern7	greater	
min is always lesser than guess and max is always greater than guess

2778756ironruby	ironpython
pattern7		pattern0		
also i believe the ironruby team is smaller than the ironpython team

2782744implements	extends
pattern0		
why is implements runnable a better option than extends from thread class

2788981gson	xstream
pattern10		pattern10		
gson is more about json-based persistence in the vein of xstream which can do json too and sounds a bit too heavyweight for just an applet

2794083perforce	svn
pattern0		
perforce is soooo much faster than svn because all the check-outs are stored on the server so it doesn t have to check every file on an update

2794083perforce	svn
pattern7		
svn works much better when disconnected from the network - with perforce you have to tell the server when you ve done a checkout

2795807django	web2py
pattern4		pattern7		pattern0		
i prefer web2py because there are more conveniences built into the environment than offered by django but web2py is much newer than django and hindsight always makes it easier make new implementations better

2796836post	get
pattern0		
using post over https is better than using get and http

2797107postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
do you find rails with postgresql is slower than mysql knowing that it produce more query on the background

2797315gif	png
pattern4		
first i use fileinfo for 100 known matches gif jpeg png because i do want to rely on fingerprint detection for certain files

2798892int	double
pattern0		
also long is slightly better than double for int with 63 bits compared to 53 bits of precision assuming positive numbers

2799753x86	64bit
pattern0		
x86 doesn t support higher precision than 80 bits but if you really need more than 64bit for a fp algorithm most likely you should check your numerics instead of solving the problem with brute force

2800533teamcity	nant
pattern10	more	pattern10	more appropriate	
you could use nant to send email but teamcity is more appropriate as it can provide a centralized place for notifications including emails

2801521tolower	toupper
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
so yes - toupper is more reliable than tolower

2804009int	chars
pattern0		
if you re only dealing with arrays of chars or only dealing with arrays of int it s irrelevant because endianness is a property of int and other types bigger than chars

2804311django	web2py
pattern7	better	
anything django does web2py does better

2807310virtualenv	setuptools
pattern0		
development and deployment of python code is made much easier by setuptools in combination with virtualenv and pip

2808353gdal	ogr
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
when all you want to do is jam a bunch of shapefiles together or convert a large series of rasters to a common projection gdal ogr is faster to startup and run as it doesn t need to load the whole arcobjects com library to access one or two functions

2812325ant	maven
pattern8		
alternate build tools ant lots of configuration gradle conventions again less verbose than maven

2813732sorting	grouping
pattern4		
in access 2003 with the report open in design view select sorting and grouping from the view menu

2813827versioning	upgrade
pattern7		
if the most-recent versioning is lower than the running app versioning run your upgrade and bump the versioning

2815555firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		pattern0		
fast clicking on ie has slower response than firefox google-chrome and safari

2816936post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
if a post has a more recent reply i want to get the replies created_on value but also get the post post_id and subject

2816940free	malloc
pattern7	harder	
but as programs grow and structs deepen keeping track of what s been malloc d where and what s appropriate to free gets harder and harder

2817729dlsym	dlopen
pattern0		
on linux it would be easier for you to link to shared library and use symlinks to correct version - imo it s much easier than using dlopen + dlsym

2821186vbscript	jscript
pattern4		
are you stuck with coding in vbscript or can you choose jscript

2821210google-chrome	firefox
pattern8		
google-chrome s parsing may be more strict than firefox is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer

2822390valgrind	callgrind
pattern4		
i can recommend valgrind callgrind tool in conjunction with kcachegrind for visualization

2827513realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
pattern3		
fiddly stuff and this is one case where i d recommend using malloc free realloc rather than c++ memory management

2829462client-side	server-side
pattern4		
first what would you recommend server-side or client-side approach

2831672dictionary	map
pattern7	slower	
for lists containing 1000 elements the dictionary zip version is the fastest the generator and the list comprehension versions are virtually identical and they are 1.5 times slower and the functional map reversed is considerably slower

2833879backtracking	greedy
pattern0		
the capturing group 1 in the first pattern is greedy it first matches everything and takes as less as it backtracking

2839766jboss	glassfish
pattern3		
i wouldn t recommend using jboss glassfish etc for your scenario - the overhead far outweighs the only benefit - no additional setup involved

2840413int	chars
pattern4		
compare chars instead of converting them to int

2840845postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
i recommend postgresql as well especially as an alternative to mysql

2840979calloc	malloc
pattern4		pattern2		
if that s the case perhaps he simply prefers calloc over malloc

2842302springsource	grails
pattern0		
the community is smaller than grails but the project is supported by springsource who is quite active in the community

2842963glut	sdl
pattern7		pattern0		
if you re building a simple demo of a rendering mechanism glut is way better than sdl it takes care of a lot of the details that sdl would otherwise require

2842963glut	sdl
pattern10		pattern10		
however if you re developing a serious application sdl is more likely to be the tool you need to use as glut abstracts more than a real application would normally want to

2845254int	chars
pattern0		
also assuming sizeof int 4 your strings must not be greater than 4 chars as you have now and 1 of those needs to be a null termination

2845258int	chars
pattern0		
you are allocating sizeof int bytes of memory for your strings which is most likely 4 your input strings read by scanf must not be longer than 3 chars

2846574int	chars
pattern0		
note that if you want to do this with strings of arbitrary length you ll need to work with a big int library like gmp or openssl s bignum - the longest type in standard c long long cannot be mapped one-to-one onto the set of c strings that include strings longer than 8 chars because its guaranteed range includes only 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 unique values

2850154width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
documents are most likely to be in portrait format taller than they are wide so if the height is greater than the width then do don t have to do anything

2850154width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if the height is less than the width then rotate through 90 degrees

2850172ant	maven
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment

2852457mouseup	mousedown
pattern7	less	
you ll probably want to add an addition check that the time between the mousedown and mouseup is less than 500 milliseconds say and that the mouse hasn t moved more than a pixel or two between the events

2852664jsf	wicket
pattern0		
i would advise you to try wicket it is very easy to learn much easier than jsf and it let s you re-use many existing components as well

2856593octree	quadtree
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
quadtree is better for big open spaces and octree is better for in-door spaces with many levels

2857721width	height
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more common	pattern10	more common	
i d say width height is overwhelmingly more common

2858375int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
if your int value uses more than one chars and includes the sign as you mention then it is more complex

2859122uploadify	plupload
pattern7	better	
ok after a whole day of trying to get this to work i ve abandoned uploadify and am now using plupload which seems much better

2860246children	parent
pattern0		pattern4		
another gotcha is that you must make sure that an instance cannot be a child of more than one parent or else destroying a parent could also destroy children belonging to another parent

2861613int	boolean	int	chars
pattern3		
all three of the above variables can be used in any different way i choose string int chars float boolean etc.

2864151post	put
pattern7		pattern0		
on the php docs link above they say a put request is much simpler than a post request when uploading file along with this advantage what other advantages disadvanatges do the put has got compared to the post

2868900xna	slimdx
pattern4		
so bearing that in mind would you choose xna or slimdx

2872056bash	zsh
pattern7	better	
however bash has useful interactive features dash does not zsh is still better imho

2872561equals	gethashcode
pattern8		
equals on the other hand can test accross a larger number of fields - ie its test is more specific than gethashcode comparisons

2872566cstdio	iostream
pattern0		
slower than the cstdio ones and extensibility iostream allows

2873865hide	show
pattern4		
3- from opened window select show or hide based on an expression radio button

2874749vbscript	jscript
pattern8		
i am much more experienced with vbscript than jscript but i will give it a shot since not many takers on this question

2874922yourkit	jprofiler
pattern4		
having used both jprofiler and yourkit recently i find that yourkit is far superior for memory problem analysis and strongly prefer jprofiler for performance analysis

2878641put	get
pattern0		
are you expecting some devilishly complex scheme that hold locks for smaller granularity than put or get

2879651profiling	debugging
pattern4		
even though i select debugging i get this a valid provisioning profiling for this executable was not found

2882394lisp	scheme
pattern0		
if you decide to use a language that s larger and messier than scheme try common lisp

2883798xslt	xquery
pattern4		
xslt has proven itself to be both a powerful and adaptable language but now we can also choose xquery

2884286memset	calloc
pattern4		
only use memset on dynamically-allocated buffers and then prefer calloc

2884820spaces	delimiter
pattern4		pattern2		
choose delimiter by spaces

2884915memmove	strncpy
pattern0		
if you know the lengths of the strings memmove is a sensible choice - and nominally faster than strncpy because it does not have to check for nulls as it goes

2886726email	dkim
pattern4		
i d recommend dkim support at the mta level so all your server generated email for a given domain is signed by default

2892573integer	unsigned
pattern7		
as far as the compiler is concerned the conversion from integer 0 to unsigned int is no better than the conversion from integer 0 to pointer

2894515twig	smarty
pattern0		
if your in the market for a templating engine twig a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than smarty imho

2895332arraylist	treeset	equals	compareto
pattern4		
the following snippet illustrates the difference in behaviors between collections that use equals such as an arraylist and collections that use compare compareto such as a treeset

2895389uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
pattern0		
i have a uitabbarcontroller with more than 5 uitabbaritem so the morenavigationcontroller is available

2895761vim	textmate	vim	emacs	emacs	textmate
pattern4		
i d recommend vim emacs or textmate

2896525udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
udp communication is connection less as compared to tcp which need a connection

2896854wxhaskell	gtk2hs
pattern0		
in practice i ve never had resource management issues with wxhaskell although i agree that it s possible and is an area handled better by gtk2hs which uses reference counting in the underlying library

2897814valgrind	glibc
pattern4		
to accomplish what you need you ideally match valgrind appropriately with glibc or use the macros in valgrind valgrind.h to work around them

2899344apache	nginx
pattern8		
in fact nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile it with the --with-select_module option and i bet it will still be more efficient than apache

2900131xsl-fo	xslt
pattern7	older	
i found the xsl-fo designer from ecrion to be good for both programmers familiar with xslt and xsl-fo and old ladies that need to make changes to the templates we are deploying a desktop solution based on xsl-fo that replaces an older proprietary solution and the ladies can make small changes to the document templates

2904283cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
pattern7		pattern7		
a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors

2906064haskell	ocaml
pattern10	more	pattern10	more efficient	
a lot of people seem to say that writing compilers and other language tools in functional languages such as ocaml and haskell is much more efficient and easier then writing them in imperative languages

2908440lxml	elementtree
pattern4		
mostly i have seen people recommend lxml but given my parsing requirements do i really stand to benefit from it or would elementtree serve my purpose better

2910298webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern10	more	pattern10	more control	
also using a separate httpwebrequest or webclient gives you more control over proxies handling redirection authentication etc

2911817sorting	filtering
pattern8		
filtering is a lot less expensive than sorting

2912577apache	nginx
pattern8		
also nginx s configuration is much more flexible than apache and by having it on the front end it gives you a lot of flexibility

2917120rsa	dsa
pattern0		
eugene s suggestion of using ecc is a good one - ecc keys are much shorter than rsa or dsa for a given security level

2917821rsa	dsa
pattern0		
dsa signatures are signficantly shorter than rsa ones

2919461sproutcore	javascriptmvc
pattern7	less	
i know sproutcore is backed by apple and looks like it is getting more popular by the day and it has a nice green website whereas javascriptmvc looks less professional with less of a following and less momentum behind it

2921903min	max
pattern4		
by doing select min ... max ... avg ... from .

2927816exponent	modulo
pattern7		pattern0		
the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt it using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero

2927816exponent	modulo
pattern0		
edit as gregs points out in the comments you cannot be sure that the private exponent of the key you want to encrypt is smaller than the modulo of the key you want to use to encrypt with

2932539int	chars
pattern4		
this creates a list of int corresponding to each letter with 0 if the letter doesn t match chars and 1 if it does and then sums them

2932803virus	botnet
pattern7		
obviously very similar to the virus answer above the difference being that while viruses usually replicate spread do a preprogrammed inconvenient thing a botnet is more of a take control of your machine for a future usually nefarious but dynamic purpose. i think the hosts your agent can more easily change with a botnet too

2933333mvp	presenter
pattern7	better	
imho activity is your controller or perhaps presenter a la mvp is the better architectural analogy layout xml and their constituent views are the view layer and your database is your model

2934157imagemagick	gdlib
pattern4		
i heartly recommend imagemagick check if installed on your server but you can also roll your own thumbnail script using phps gdlib which is bundled with php and most likely available

2935622udp	tcp
pattern0		
in general the tcp protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the udp protocol

2935985postgresql	mysql
pattern10	more	pattern10	more strict	
this works fine on my local and current hosted environment using mysql but postgresql is clearly more strict

2937750opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
pattern0		pattern0		
according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome

2943437innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to innodb if its not innodb because for large number of records innodb is much faster as it caches the table data while on the contrary myisam engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index

2946814google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
ie 8 is much worse than firefox and google-chrome runs smoothly

2952593portrait	landscape
pattern7		
or the tableview is covering it up because the landscape view has less vertical room than the portrait view

2952965inherited	properties
pattern4		
transparent means that the match inherited its highlighting properties from the containing block these rules do not change the way text is displayed

2954659google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
in firefox the input button has more padding than in google-chrome

2955713quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	better	
1- use a sorting algotithm like mergesort or quicksort has better performance with small inputs

2957078domxpath	domdocument
pattern3		
i recommend using domdocument and domxpath

2958396strcpy	strncpy
pattern7	safer	
using strncpy instead of strcpy is normally safer but here you alloc eachtime the right amount of memory needed to store inpoint into mpoint so i cant see what s the point

2961080mouse	keyboard
pattern3		
i prefer using keyboard over mouse and on the interface have a general purpose text box which will act like a command line

2962699spaces	delimiter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
my data is in tabular format spaces delimiter and looks more or less like

2963102for-loop	arrays
pattern0		
it returns a byte arrays of all the pixels which can be iterated much faster than a for-loop with a call to getpixel inside nested inside another for-loop

2966344ironruby	ironpython
pattern3		
it can be done but i really prefer using ironruby or ironpython over this approach

2967306expression-blend	silverlight
pattern3		
if you re looking for an application to create a mock-up design of a silverlight application i d recommend using expression-blend 3 version 3 or greater with sketch flow

2972163addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
for instance in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition

2973943lisp	scheme
pattern0		pattern0		
scheme is also a good language for that purpose and it is simpler smaller than lisp

2975484division	multiplication
pattern0		
bitwise operations are usually significantly faster than multiplication and division operations

2977437addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
the difference is that in the second pattern the concatenation x followed by y in xy has higher precedence than the choice either x or y in x|y like multiplication has higher precedence than addition so the pattern is equivalent to

2977506post	get
pattern7		pattern0		
first off get is no less secure than post

2980839int	chars
pattern0		
in your example the command-line input would be stored in a variable larger than chars such as int and later assigned to chars truncating the bytes

2983099filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	xfs	ntfs
pattern0		pattern0		
although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job

2983944vb.net	vb6
pattern0		
i assume the same control in vb.net would be datagridview and i m fairly sure that you can probably make it look better than in vb6 but if you want really good looking ones you might want to look at thirdparty grid controls

2984015versioning	upgrade
pattern7		
i am wondering what happens when i release a upgrade that has a higher target sdk versioning then the previous versioning of my app

2984133accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
pattern10		pattern10		
there s not much to recommend one over the other except that the direct ivar access is slightly faster the properties version creates a temporary array and sends an accessor message to make the new condition create its copy of that array

2984862.htaccess	httpd.conf
pattern7	better	
this goes in your root .htaccess but if you have access to httpd.conf that is better

2985156vmware	virtualbox
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
the vm mentioned in here is not like in vmware or virtualbox it is more like java virtual machine jvm as well as python and ruby

2985450ubuntu	debian
pattern10	more	pattern10	more user	
both use debian packages and ubuntu is based on debian but is more user friendly

2985450ubuntu	linux
pattern4		
i d recommend ubuntu if your new to linux on a desktop

2985463ubuntu	linux
pattern10		pattern10		
ubuntu is the more user-friendly of the two i think ubuntu is actually one of the most newbie-friendly linux distros so if you are new to linux ubuntu is the way to go

2985533ubuntu	debian
pattern4		
if you choose debian you will have a choice of distribution series unstable testing that may get you newer releases of pre-packaged software a few months sooner than ubuntu

2985713draggable	droppable
pattern0		
the draggable div is 3 times bigger than one droppable

2985899inherited	properties
pattern4		
to include a .vsprops file in a visual studio 2008 project one could right-click the project icon in the solution explorer panel choose properties go to the configuration properties | general section and modify the inherited project properties sheets properties to contain a list of .vsprops paths

2989641webkit	gecko
pattern2		
you will need to choose between webkit and gecko depending on your requirements

2992884int	boolean
pattern10		pattern10		
in language where int that are not 0 represents the boolean value true and 0 false like c i will tend to use because it represents the same meaning as if int whereas represents more the int value being equal to 1 rather than the boolean true

2994324awt	swing
pattern0		
performance swing components are generally slower and buggier than awt due to both the fact that they are pure java and to video issues on various platforms

2997695imagemagick	graphicsmagick
pattern0		
graphicsmagick also seems to be faster than imagemagick using better multitasking

2999921vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
pattern4		
that said i d recommend bootcamp and parallels vmware

3000732postgresql	mysql
pattern0		pattern0		
it s known that sqlite is slower than mysql postgresql excepting very small tiny dbs

3003102min	max
pattern0		
if you need more than just min and max then

3003689superclass	subclassing
pattern4		
i expected it to pick subclassing s value since object won t be created for superclass as it is abstract

3006250filehelpers	linqtocsv
pattern4		
i also decided to compare filehelpers to linqtocsv

3008645google-chrome	firefox
pattern8		
most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie firefox are being a bit more forgiving than google-chrome is

3008890postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
ps you can also migrate to postgresql it s smarter than mysql when choosing right indexes

3011348django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
pattern4		pattern2		
as far as python frameworks go i personally prefer django over turbogears or pylons which i believe also have admin interfaces because it seems much simpler to get installed setup and running

3013338min	max
pattern0		
is it possible to use xml-schema to require the max attribute to be greater than the min attribute

3015992codeigniter	cakephp
pattern7		pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
cakephp is newer more feature rich and heavier than codeigniter codeigniter is designed to have a much smaller footprint so you will most likely find yourself creating functionality in codeigniter to match cake s

3016020mouseover	mouseout
pattern7	more	pattern7	more	
creating elements on mouseover mouseout is much more work on the browser then having those elements created already in the markup with display none

3019036serializable	deserialization
pattern7		pattern0		
deserialization is harder than serializable

3019070interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern7		pattern0		
and perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-language

3024677boost	stl
pattern0		
boost s io stream might be a better solution than stl s own stream

3025706jboss	glassfish
pattern10		pattern10		
afaik jboss is much more adopted in production deployments than glassfish but this doesn t necessarily mean it s better

3027085children	parent
pattern0		
are the nodes in order like in your example where the children have a larger id than the parent

3027395int	double
pattern10		pattern10		
it implicitly converts an int to a double gets the double form of largest int that is less or equal to that double and converts that back to an int

3029158public	protected
pattern7	easier	
if the only purpose is improved testability then exposing methods as protected or public is an easier option

3029676union	distinct
pattern4		
edit union should make each select distinct by default

3030830setinterval	settimeout
pattern7		pattern0		
if so then you can just pop lines off the array using settimeout which is better than setinterval for most animations

3032790uwsgi	cherokee
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
so your app code is actually run via uwsgi and cherokee is more like a proxy server

3033387cpython	ironpython
pattern0		
it s possible that jython and ironpython are much faster than cpython as well as they are backed by heavily optimized virtual machines jvm and .net clr

3035730moq	typemock	moq	moles	typemock	moles
pattern10		pattern10		
moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot

3038863macports	homebrew
pattern4		
i use macports including installing python via port to create a very linux-ish command line environment although lots of python devs seem to prefer homebrew

3038887ubuntu	linux
pattern10	system faster	pattern10	system faster	
i m working with both ubuntu mac but i like staying with the linux system feels faster and more stable for me

3039295ienumerable	iqueryable
pattern0		
there is a very good linq video that i enjoy a lot- it hits more than just ienumerable v iqueryable but it really has some fantastic insight

3039489firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
font looks sharp in google-chrome safari ie8 not as good as other 2 but less fuzzy than firefox

3041407width	height
pattern0		
no distance can be greater than width 2 and height 2

3041805lisp	scheme
pattern10		pattern10		
scheme is intentionally more compact than common lisp and you ll find that you can learn the language very quickly

3042066floating-point	integer
pattern0		
today s floating-point units are pretty fast and may actually divide faster than an integer unit

3042116touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
pattern0		
btw for extra credit if you are using ios 3.2 or 4.0 or later use the uipangesturerecognizer class to handle the drag and drop logic - the drag and drop motion is a lot smoother than overriding touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended .

3046580dotnetzip	sharpziplib
pattern8		
dotnetzip offers native support and has a quite friendly api and is my opinion more flexible than sharpziplib

3055493children	parent
pattern4		
however that does not match children with their parent for some reason

3056869asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
pattern0		
i am using asp.net-mvc 2 and i see more than one html.actionlink method that takes an idictionary as a parameter for the html attributes

3057686lisp	smalltalk
pattern8		
smalltalk methods tend to be more fine-grained than lisp functions so that may be a good place to begin

3063547post	get
pattern3		
if you re using an encryption library to encrypt the data then you can use get or post but this will be an added pain and you might not setup the encryption correctly so i d still recommend using post over https rather than rolling your own encryption setup

3067894hide	show
pattern4		
prefer hide show than remove create

3067921codeblocks	codelite
pattern0		
we sort of settled on it but later found codelite and liked it better than codeblocks

3070103post	get
pattern4		
a header redirect would pass along get variables if using but lose post ones

3075441innodb	myisam
pattern0		
so that means that in practice an innodb write will take 3 times longer than a myisam write

3075629hlsl	glsl
pattern7		pattern0		
opengl is better for playing around and experimenting because you can easily draw triangle without messing with hardware buffers available on larger selection of platforms plus glsl is better than hlsl because it doesn t compile into assembly

3079394mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
i think mouseenter mouseleave is better than hover

3080813coalesce	nvl
pattern7	oracle much pickier	
nvl versus coalesce oracle is much pickier about reserved words

3081636google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
you can view it live on cssdesk this method works in a lot more than google-chrome but breaks in firefox 3.0 and just doesn t work in a number of ie versions

3087164swt	swing
pattern2		
i worked with swing and prefer it over swt as it has a purer component model with swt you have to worry about freeing resources as you re using native widgets is truly multi-platform swt works on windows macos and linux and is not even very well optimized for all three and it s more customizable

3096764coalesce	isnull
pattern7	better	
coalesce is the standard ansi way isnull gives slightly better performance although the difference is probably insignificant in most cases

3099907jrails	ujs
pattern3		
i wouldn t recommend using jrails at this point because it s fairly outdated and as the episode mentions it kind of defeats the purpose of switching to jquery as the rails 2 helpers generate ujs

3100230firefox	safari
pattern4		
that s tolerable for us as we are allowed to limit our users to firefox ie7+ but annoys me on a mac as i much prefer safari to firefox

3107988mp3	m3u
pattern7		
an m3u file is nothing more than a text file listing mp3 and or other format digital audio files to be interpreted by player software as a series of audio files to be played in succession

3108761realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	memcpy	memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc
pattern0		
a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

3110709mouseover	mouseout
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more common	pattern10	more common	
appearing disappearing on mouseover mouseout is a more common practice

3113198children	parent
pattern7		
the heap property that the parent node is greater than it s child nodes 2i + 1 and 2i + 2 using zero-based arrays holds for all nodes that have children

3113442stdout	stderr
pattern7		pattern0		
stderr is better than stdout for errors for a couple of reasons

3114169many-to-one	one-to-many
pattern7		
fifth many-to-one is much easier to use correctly in nhibernate and i assume hibernate than one-to-many collection mapping

3114315hash-collision	key
pattern7		
but if your key space is vastly larger than the number of targets you ll have a sizable number of hash-collision where you ll have to check if the target stored there is really the key you re looking

3125079int	chars
pattern0		
while this is perfectly acceptable its typically how i do it unless there are more than one chars in a row alignment issues will force the next variable to waste 1-3 bytes anyway which could otherwise have been used for free by an int

3127132coalesce	isnull
pattern4		
if you wanted to display a username or their email address if they don t have a username you could use coalesce or isnull for example select isnull username email_address - which gives the value of username unless it is null in which case it gives the value of email_address

3127518mockito	easymock
pattern4		pattern2		
do you see real reasons or shootout criteria to prefer easymock over mockito

3128546mockito	easymock
pattern8		
i m more familiar with easymock than mockito so i had to do a little digging

3129383subtraction	addition
pattern0		pattern0		
not that these are bad granted they tend to be an order of magnitude slower than addition subtraction negation etc. but they aren t needed and if they re present it probably means the implementation isn t really that efficient

3132195free	malloc
pattern4		
writing a fast memory allocator that consistently outperforms malloc free is non-trivial work however and there are issues to consider like memory alignment

3132371google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
oddly enough new array size is almost 2x faster than in google-chrome and about the same in firefox and ie measured by creating and filling an array

3136004google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
is it because google-chrome has much better javascript support than firefox

3137522innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam

3138811super	extends
pattern7	inclusive lower	
yes super and extends gives inclusive lower and upper bounds respectively

3139771range	max
pattern4		
i can never remember which is the best temp table mechanism for sql server sorry - it may be better to go with a table variable and may need to add indexes + keys either way. you can then select max totalallocated from that for a given date range

3141284google-chrome	firefox
pattern2		
google-chrome leads over firefox in my tests but it can still take 5-8 seconds for the browser to render 300 records

3142382screens	tablet
pattern0		
my development environment uses dual-17 monitors which are far bigger than the tablet screens size of 10.4 1024x768

3142607codeigniter	kohana
pattern7	fewer	
is the assumption that codeigniter modules work in kohana or at least can be massaged to without too much effort or is it just that kohana s got fewer modules

3142874getter	setter
pattern8		
even more oop-like with setter getter

3144382django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
pattern0		
compare the very active django tag on stack overflow with that of pylons or turbogears though and i d argue getting started is simply easier with django irrespective of anything to do with code

3144877salt	md5
pattern10	less	pattern10	less sensitive	
hashing with sha md5 or any other algorithm solves the problem of key protection because you don t need to keep any secret value other than salt but salt is significantly less sensitive than encryption key

3144918equals	compareto
pattern10	sooner	
it s not clear to me what you want but i ll mention that the date class also has a compareto method which can be used to determine with one call if two date objects are equals or if they aren t equals which occurs sooner

3146146profiling	debugging
pattern4		
the biggest problem that i m having is that in the targets properties i go to build select debugging or distribution and when i want to select the profiling for code signing for the target xcode doesn t show me anything

3147745public	protected
pattern7	clearer	
there ll be no functional difference between the constructor being public or being protected but making it protected gives a clearer indication of the intended use

3150282html5lib	beautifulsoup
pattern2		
now i m trying to select between beautifulsoup and html5lib modules but i didn t find any simple examples of using html5lib i need just to extract some text from the certain div element with stripping all the other tags inside

3150597inherited	subclassing
pattern2		
we prefer composition over inherited because when we add particularly or change functionality by subclassing we couple that new functionality to the class - so anywhere we need the new functionality we need that class

3152497verilog	vhdl
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
hardware design with vhdl or verilog is more like programming nowadays

3153718hash	md5
pattern10		pattern10		
if the hash function is more complex and cryptographically strong md5 or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible

3154138addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition

3156544udp	tcp
pattern0		
tcp sockets- guaranteed delivery bigger payload than udp cumbersome to setup for web based solutions

3156866google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		pattern0		
firefox is slower than google-chrome in javascript

3158569width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
in the other case when the height is greater than the width then the field at and can be calculated using that arithmetic sum and the rhomboid can be imagined as a rectangle with x-value x and y-value y- w-x-1

3161344disk	ram
pattern7	bigger	
it is important to give additional space to the ram disk that is 10 bigger than the size of the jvm

3162419postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
postgresql supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in mysql and also give better performance

3162604fileoutputstream	filechannel
pattern0		
i don t see any reason why filechannel could be any faster than fileoutputstream in this case

3163098firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		pattern0		
in ie java-script load slower than firefox safari and google-chrome

3163538cpython	pypy
pattern0		
for python there is a pypy project which it includes jit making possible the code to run faster than in cpython in many cases

3164817google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
also firefox 4 has hardware accelerated canvas that is marginally faster than ie9 and a lot faster than google-chrome

3165474wxpython	pygtk
pattern0		
thanks to opencv i managed to rewrite everything with wxpython which i know better than pygtk

3165908haskell	ocaml
pattern8		
go is much more c++ like and low level oriented than c# and c# has only a few functional features while scala allows you to write typical functional code more verbose than ocaml or haskell but similar

3169917flac	ogg
pattern0		
i suspect the computational demands of flac decoding are probably considerably less than ogg and if dsp gets you excited taking the time to figure all this stuff out is 100 worth it even if the flash route possibly leads to disappointment

3172803tinyxml	xerces
pattern7		pattern0		
for more complex xml reading writing you better check xerces which is heavier than tinyxml

3176940int	chars
pattern0		pattern0		
it has one drawback but i believe it s ok with the question as it compute an int divider to make line shorter than 80 chars the longest line is shorter than 80 chars not exactly 80 chars

3180565interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern7	slower	
java seeks to find a compromise between a purely compiled-language with no portability and a purely interpreted-language that is significantly slower

3180672ienumerable	ilist
pattern10		pattern10		
ienumerable is less specific than an ilist that is ilist has functions that ienumerable does not

3180696ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
pattern2		
an ilist has the methods for changing the items like add maybe you want to select between icollection and ienumerable

3181888children	parent
pattern4		
i do fine getting the program to calculate fitness values select parent produce children then mutate the children

3182486int	chars
pattern7		
it s theoretically possible that an has a smaller sizeof than a for example if int has stricter alignment requirements than chars this could be a reasonable thing to do

3184908innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		pattern4		pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
there is a difference between the different storage engines though myisam is faster for a lot of select innodb is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes

3186430swt	swing
pattern0		
give swt a go the api is a lot simpler than swing

3188584qgraphicsscene	qabstractitemmodel
pattern4		
so which approach would you choose qabstractitemmodel authoritative - qabstractitemview- qgraphicsscene or alternatively qgraphicsscene authoritative - qabstractitemmodel- other views

3188934range	max	range	min	min	max
pattern0		
if max and min are independent variables the extra subtraction for max-min will waste time but if that expression can be precomputed at compile time or if it can be computed once at run-time to test many numbers against the same range the above expression may be computed efficiently even in the case where the value is within range if a large fraction of values will be below the valid range it may be faster to use because it will exit early if value is less than min

3189634hide	show
pattern2		
i saw a few things where ie6 sucks with show hide so i tried adding hide show classes to no avail as well

3195726struts	wicket
pattern4		pattern2		
for example for orm you may choose to use hibernate over jpa or toplink for front end you may choose wicket over struts or springmvc and so forth

3195804put	get
pattern0		
if you need to do anything more complex than put file or get file take a look at edtftpj free

3195878x86	64bit
pattern7		
x86 allows easier debugging - edit and continue is not supported when running in 64bit mode

3195891libevent	epoll
pattern4		
create some sort of event loop using select epoll or event framework like libevent libev and get a callback whenever a user hits a key

3196075min	max
pattern0		
setting min higher than the max or vice-versa will cause a 380 error

3197158swt	swing
pattern4		
like eugener i prefer swing to swt but both are rich well-maintained frameworks that will serve the purpose

3200689abc	isinstance
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
the fact that checking with isinstance the membership in a concrete type is not so good while checking the membership in an abc is more often useful lies in a principle that the gang of 4 expressed clearly and intensely in the first part of their wonderful book design patterns in a mostly c++ context but it really applies much more widely than that

3206128fadein	removeclass
pattern7		
for some reason fadein works better than show or simply removing a hidden class via removeclass if you take that approach

3207165google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
i recommend firefox with the firebug addon for debugging ajax issues even though i use google-chrome for regular browsing

3209313addition	multiplication
pattern0		
at the time this was faster because addition was a lot faster than multiplication but that s no longer the case

3210800serializable	deserialization
pattern0		
you ll need to implement serializable to have java handle the serializable or externalizable if you need more control over the deserialization process

3211989disk	ram
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
i m sure there are other holes like that too - but the code above will work on any system which supports paging and where disk access is much more expensive than ram access

3215428scheme	racket	lisp	scheme	lisp	racket
pattern0		
on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations

3215955lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern7		pattern0		
lxml is faster than beautifulsoup i think and has much better functionality while remaining relatively easy to use

3220693firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

3220717force.com	salesforce
pattern3		
i work as a technical lead for cloud development at the daily telegraph and i d highly recommend using salesforce force.com for any crm requirements

3221088gdk	cairo
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	more	pattern10	more flexible	
to draw you can use either plain gdk which is more basic or use cairo which is more flexible drawing library nb

3222095portrait	landscape
pattern7		
without more detail it s hard to say why your approach doesn t work but my guess is that you are seeing the sprite positioning you describe as a result of the fact that if you don t change orientation the lower left in portrait is the lower right in landscape when rotated left it s the same point in gl space 0 0

3223137gitolite	gitosis
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
gitolite is far more advanced than gitosis and is quite easy to install directly from your workstation based on ssh communication with your git repository server

3225877int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
i assume this is because comparison between int is much easier than between chars strings but i was looking for some literature to back this assessment ideally some database structure book

3227242profiling	instrumentation
pattern7	overhead larger	
this is due to the fact that profiling need to instrumentation the code to keep track of invocations - this can interfere with the jit s ability to inline those methods and the instrumentation overhead becomes significantly larger than the time spent actually executing the methods body

3227873charindex	substr
pattern4		
select substr hello 0 charindex o hello 0 would return hell in sql

3228735ienumerable	ilist
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
ienumerable is less specific than ilist ilist implements ienumerable so unless you want something specific from ilist such as .count as you suggest or perhaps add delete etc i d use ienumerable

3229281width	height
pattern4		pattern2		
is there anyway using the resize_to_fit method to tell it prefer height over width

3229550cvs	svn
pattern0		
managing changes that need to be made across these branches is a lot easier with svn than it was with cvs but it s by no means pain-free

3230588hide	show
pattern0		pattern0		
is there a better way than show hide that would be easier on the memory performance

3230996g++	gcc
pattern2		
i thought the file extension decides when the ide chooses between gcc and g++

3231289jxtable	jtable
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
use swing-x components there is a jxtable which is more powerful than jtable

3235535equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

3235535equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values.

3235895subtract	add
pattern7	value less	
of the original length until this add subtract value is less than 1

3237600google-chrome	firefox
pattern10		pattern10		
i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb

3239027jquery	scriptaculous
pattern4		
i ve worked with jquery scriptaculous and mootools and i would highly recommend jquery which seems to trump a lot of the other frameworks in its ease of use

3239652hide	show
pattern4		
is there a way to do a string comparison with touppercase between a given string value and the link text as show above in the span collection and if it doesn t match hide the span

3239856subtraction	addition
pattern0		
if you want to support better than just addition and subtraction you could do it as an eval if you are careful about how data gets into #number

3241030lift	wicket
pattern8		
lift s ajax support is far less verbose than wicket s

3242256integer	unsigned
pattern7	easier	
i was also wondering if there is a way of storing an integer unsigned it s easier on an arbitrary number of bytes

3243541haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
pattern3		
i would recommend learning haskell and a dialect of lisp such as scheme or common lisp if you master either of those you ll gain insight into how things are accomplished with the functional paradigm and it ll help out your python as well

3245750width	height
pattern0		
the width of the timetable is more than the height of the timetable

3247171width	height
pattern7		pattern7	greater	
and if the bitmap s height is greater than maxheight or the width is greater than maxwidth i d like to proportionally resize the image so that it fits in maxwidth x maxheight

3252727richfaces	icefaces
pattern7		
icefaces provides more good looking components than richfaces

3252727richfaces	icefaces
pattern7		
richfaces has better ajax support than icefaces

3256638getdate	datepart
pattern4		
you can get the current year from select datepart yyyy getdate

3261073gson	jackson
pattern7		pattern0		
i ve seen questions like this come up before and the general consensus is that jackson is much faster than gson

3261222min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
if the window is smaller than max width the content fills 100 of the page unless it s smaller than min width which would make the horizontal scrollbar appear

3261756emacs	aquamacs
pattern4		
how can i match aquamacs settings in mac os x emacs auctex

3266486int	double
pattern4		
and because it can not compare int and double it generates type mismatch

3268238single-quotes	double-quotes
pattern3		
also i recommend using single-quotes for string literals not double-quotes

3268905vim	emacs
pattern3		
i prefer using emacs and vim for writing c++ code

3271975swt	swing
pattern4		
i can t really compare swt to swing since my experience with swing is limitted

3271975swt	swing
pattern0		
if you plan for long term i don t see more options than swt or swing for gui development in java

3278151addition	multiplication
pattern0		pattern0		
trig functions should have precedence lower than multiplication and higher than addition

3281759ubuntu	linux	kde	gnome
pattern7		
sometimes a linux distribution contains far more than an operating system but is informally referred to by a single name such as ubuntu and so the line between what the operating system is the linux kernel and standard libraries perhaps and the applications that merely ship with that operating system the gnome and kde environments on linux is pretty gray

3284371exponent	addition
pattern0		
in addition for doing powers of two bitshifting is usually a little clearer than doing exponent though choose whatever works for you

3284731activemq	rabbitmq
pattern2		
our team is in a spike sprint to choose between activemq or rabbitmq

3286643sproutcore	cappuccino
pattern10		pattern10		
like bruz says cappuccino is probably more freeform at the data layer than sproutcore

3286802innodb	myisam
pattern0		
therefore innodb can handle higher levels of concurrency better than myisam

3287564getter	setter	public	protected
pattern7		
if you don t need it to be public it s often safer not to due to getter setter allowing better control over what values can be assigned then you should declare if protected or private

3287645opensuse	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	opensuse
pattern4		
i took the linux distro chooser at and it recommends opensuse mandriva ubuntu

3288456google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
firefox produces more space compared to google-chrome

3289900charindex	substr
pattern4		
select substr column 0 charindex column from table

3292862subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
pattern0		pattern0		
i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

3293341division	addition
pattern0		
i think it is a few cycles slower than addition but yes division is very slow compared to the others

3295996hash	md5
pattern0		
or you could employ a request signing scheme in which certain request fields are hash together with the password of the user basically sending the password without sending the password similar to digest authentication but you can use something better than md5

3296035profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
pattern7		
which java profiler is better jprofiler or yourkit

3309858freemarker	velocity
pattern4		
you can certainly choose freemarker velocity and other cool viewer but if your entire team is already comfortable dealing with jsp you need to take account of your project deadline and all the learning curves when taking on a new technology

3311788implements	extends
pattern0		
i have not found a lot of times when implements an interface would be a better system than extends a superclass

3312089abstract-class	superclass
pattern10	more	pattern10	more general	
you can think of extends from a superclass if the derived class is of the same type.i mean that when a class extends an abstract-class they both should be of the same type the only difference being that the superclass has a more general behavior and the sub class has a more specific behavior

3313279public	protected
pattern10		pattern10		
the theory is that someone extending your class with protected access knows more about what they are doing than someone who is merely using it with public access

3313282d3.js	protovis
pattern0		
the team behind protovis has since created d3.js so this is likely a better option than protovis

3316770postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

3323081aggregate-functions	sum
pattern10		pattern10		
i changed out total for sum which is more consistent with other databases sqlite aggregate-functions

3323594lisp	sml
pattern2		
if you look at a language like sml for example and compare it with lisp the functional core of each is almost identical

3323922opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
pattern10		pattern10		
firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions

3323927tapestry	struts	tapestry	stripes	tapestry	wicket	struts	stripes	struts	wicket	wicket	stripes
pattern2		
if your requirement is for a more traditional web application then compare click with struts stripes wicket tapestry etc

3326639vb.net	vb6
pattern10		pattern10		
biggest of all is that adding new features to your vb6 application is more expensive than it would be if the application was in a better language like c# or vb.net

3327119postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
i would pick postgresql v8.4+ over mysql given the choice

3328317apache	nginx
pattern4		
so i don t understand the meaning to compare nginx and apache with php code

3328864http	spdy
pattern7	lesser	
both s3 and cloudfront allow domain aliases however cloudfront allows multiple aliases so that d1.mystatics.com d2.mystatics.com and d3.mystatics.com could all point to the same location increasing the capacity for parallel downloads this used to be recommended by google but with the introduction of spdy and http 2 is of lesser importance

3329615128bit	64bit
pattern7	integers less	
gcc supports built-in __int128_t and __uint128_t types on 64bit platforms but it looks like formatting support for 128bit integers is less common in libc

3329991width	height
pattern0		
or i can set the width to more than 36 and it appears to grow by width-36 but if for instance i set both the height and width of one of these narrow cells to the same number lets say 60px the height of what gets displayed is greater than the width and it appears as a rectangle not a square

3330132quicksort	heapsort
pattern10		pattern10		
so for instance heapsort is faster than quicksort in the worst case but slower in the average case

3330226r-tree	quadtree
pattern10	etc. better	
if your objects are sparse then a quadtree or related data structure r-tree etc. is probably better

3330818innodb	myisam
pattern3		
the default myisam does not support transactions i recommend using innodb

3331058google-chrome	safari
pattern10	imo better	
the console for safari and google-chrome imo is better

3335808post	get
pattern10	more	pattern10	more appropriate	
post would spring to mind but i think get is a more appropriate method because 99 of the time you only supply a bunch of parameters to these types of actions

3337210min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
this program takes in the max and min that the data can be and throws out data that is less than the min or greater than the max

3337251min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
and throws out data that is less than the min or greater than the max

3337251min	max
pattern0		pattern0

3339070tcpdf	fpdf
pattern3		
i d recommend using tcpdf instead of fpdf

3339409rar	zip
pattern7		pattern0		
i ve heard that rar decompression requires much more memory than zip decompression

3341954google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
they use iframes in firefox which seems better but in google-chrome they do this by putting manually defined span and font tags

3344384hide	show
pattern4		
in linux it is a hide folder and you have to choose show hide files

3345095nhibernate	bltoolkit
pattern0		
update for our purposes bltoolkit ended up being a better solution than nhibernate

3347248min	max
pattern7		pattern0		
when i run the above query the min returned is larger than the max

3347424subtract	addition	subtract	add	subtraction	add	subtraction	addition
pattern4		
the next problem is a compare is a subtract subtract and add go through the same alu and take the same time as addition so for most platforms old and new trading compares subtraction for addition wont save you anything you end up looking at the branch cost pipeline flush etc

3349260firefox	safari
pattern8		
it seems that ie and firefox are less strict than safari

3350828min	max	minimum	max
pattern0		
the syntax is min max where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

3357687int	chars
pattern0		pattern0		
short and chars and other int smaller than an int are weaker types than int

3357911uiview	subviews
pattern7		
do i just create a new uiview that is 4px larger than the selected object and and make the selected view a subviews of it

3360821inherited	subclassing
pattern10	more	pattern10	more valuable	
perhaps the class should be decomposed in other classes or subclassing if in your case inherited is more valuable than composition so every class has a well defined responsibility in the system

3362915imperative	declarative
pattern7	programming easier	
are there any studies on whether functional declarative or imperative programming is easier to learn as a first language

3363108haskell	scheme
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
scheme is perhaps more approachable than haskell however

3365541google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	more	
this all works well and good in firefox but when i try it in google-chrome which supports more html5 features it tries to load the url undefined in whatever directory i m in

3376256daemons	systemd
pattern4		
your daemons could use memory_get_usage and call out out free uptime and friends to throttle the number of workers to match systemd conditions

3376978getter	setter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more flexibility	
hiding state behind getter and setter gives you more flexibility to change the internal representation of the class state without breaking other classes that uses the state

3378621boost	allocator
pattern7	more	
i think that the boost manual could have explained how the allocator is used more explicitly

3379818int	chars
pattern0		
on some hardware platforms it might turn out that int types work faster than chars types so the selection of the specific type becomes a speed-vs-memory trade-off but once again in many cases when the range of chars is naturally sufficient it might make more sense to use chars instead of int

3380000put	get
pattern0		
since most data-storage mechanisms in-ram in a database etc. get a lot slower as you put more data in them you should ensure you re only timing your http access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage

3384233getter	setter
pattern0		
your object literal cannot have more than one getter or setter with the same name

3384918integer	unsigned
pattern7		
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

3385547client-side	server-side
pattern3		
i d recommend exploring client-side ui technologies to use in conjun ction with your java ee server-side stuff

3385600richfaces	icefaces
pattern2		
with jpa ejb and jsf for presentation layer you can choose between icefaces and richfaces as jsf component library both support trees as well as drag and drop

3385687int	chars
pattern10	more	pattern10	more complex	
the case of int versus unsigned chars is more complex

3385835min	max
pattern0		
the trouble is when i enter an invalid value into the textbox the tooltip that appears says exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation instead of max distance must be greater than min distance

3393412calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
pattern10		pattern10		
calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

3400623boost	stl
pattern10	more	pattern10	more widespread	
realised that templates are incredibly powerful and don t need to be slow and use of the stl and boost is much more widespread than 10 years ago

3401151disk	ram
pattern0		
modern operating systems usually get in the way especially if the file is larger than ram you will end up swapping code since the system will treat your already stored on disk data as swappable

3403729primefaces	richfaces
pattern10		pattern10		
richfaces is more developed and tested generally since primefaces came out later than rf

3407164kate	kdevelop
pattern2		
i m using it on linux so i cannot compare it with visual studio and the like but i do prefer it over kdevelop 3 kate which are my main points of reference

3411214getdate	datepart
pattern4		
in sql server do this select datepart month getdate

3411768junit	testng
pattern10		pattern10		
edit it seems junit has more printed books as references compared to testng on amazon

3411951junit	testng
pattern4		
i ve used both and found that for unit testing only junit works very well but in terms of system testing i would recommend testng

3412814junit	testng
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
to be perfectly honest i junit is way more popular than testng at least here where i work and live

3415512int	chars
pattern0		
the raw storage of your array assuming a 4 byte int should only be 60mb but since each chars of an int in ascii is 1 byte any int with more than 4 chars are going to be larger than the binary storage hence your 130mb file

3417323google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
firefox extensions have much more power than google-chrome and have wider access to browser s internal api

3417432post	get
pattern0		
the amfphp library is not only faster than regular post get requests it also allows you to pass php objects into flex objects and flex to php

3418152superclass	subclassing
pattern0		
most likely it ll still be tightly linked with implementations generally a bad thing or if not bad it s not especially good but i think a structure like this is better than a superclass figuring out what all of its subclassing are

3421762visualvm	yourkit
pattern3		
but by all means if you have the budget i d recommend getting yourkit as it provides more sophisticated features and better metrics that visualvm don t have

3422364apache	nginx
pattern2		
but for production i prefer modrails.com where you can choose between apache nginx

3423368division	subtraction
pattern7		pattern0		
because the division operator has higher precedence than subtraction

3424324udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack

3424324udp	tcp
pattern2		
tcp has built in retries and other things so you dont lose reliability with udp directly it is what you do with it that could compare

3424324udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day

3426559getter	setter
pattern0		
in general you need a lot more than atomic getter setter for most kinds of thread synchronization

3430848int	chars
pattern7		
assuming we re discussing a platform in which length of an int variable is longer than or equal to three bytes i want to access third byte of this int and put it in the chars variable with that said i d write it like this

3431955eigenvalue	diagonal
pattern7	larger	
because is singular t can be constructed such that the last element on the diagonal or even more diagonal elements if the multiplicity of the eigenvalue is larger than one is zero

3436202nginx	lighttpd
pattern0		
shortly put running some benchmarks on a page doing some database operations and serving static dynamic content has shown that plain cherrypy was twice as fast than nginx and memcached and about half faster than lighttpd

3436372addition	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		
even if addition is faster than multiplication i think that you will lose more because of the branching

3436372addition	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		
in any case if addition is faster than multiplication a better solution might be to use a table and index by it

3438335spaces	delimiter
pattern4		
then in the dialog box select delimiter then tell excel to use spaces to separate the text to columns

3441584jsf	wicket	struts	wicket	stateless	stateful
pattern8		pattern0		
while this is much less convenient than stateful wicket i still find much better than say stateless jsf or struts

3444436configobj	configparser
pattern7		
i have heard that configobj is easier to use than configparser even though it is not a built-in library

3448926hex	binary	octal	decimal	octal	binary	octal	hex
pattern7		pattern0		
the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal

3449073calloc	malloc
pattern10		pattern10		
malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros

3449169calloc	malloc
pattern7		pattern0		
calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory

3454414octal	decimal	octal	binary
pattern0		
that number cannot be larger than binary 111 which is equal to 7 in both decimal and octal

3455424width	height
pattern0		
sizes of elements in wpf are determined by more than just width and height

3458145fancybox	thickbox
pattern0		
i m using facebox and fancybox both smaller than thickbox

3460152mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern0		
also if you want a hover effect you re better off with mouseenter and mouseleave which jquery provides for browsers that don t already support it

3466083imperative	declarative
pattern10	more	pattern10	more verbose	
what i have understood is that declarative let you do whatever you want as long as the result passes and imperative is more verbose

3466524apache	lighttpd
pattern7	lower	
i have read in a site that another benefit of having lighttpd in front of apache is lower number of child processes

3467818firefox	safari
pattern7		
small in firefox is smaller then small in safari so never ever use them

3471104codeigniter	kohana
pattern0		
you had a better chance with kohana 2.3.4 as it was derived from codeigniter and was similar

3473502uploadify	swfupload
pattern0		
my rails app is coded in jquery but for file uploading i ve yet to find anything better than fancyupload better imho than uploadify or swfupload

3475275nginx	lighttpd
pattern0		
nginx seems to be the webserver getting the majority of the buzz lately it may be able to serve faster than lighttpd maybe not

3478660opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
pattern10		pattern10		
conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

3481367int	double
pattern7		
that wouldn t work on platforms where a double is less than 64 bits but it would work on many platforms without 64-bit int

3483281onstart	ondestroy
pattern10	etc more	pattern10	etc more	
instead of hooking into keypress events and such perhaps working with the built-in events like onpause onstart ondestroy etc is more suited to your needs

3483338union	distinct
pattern4		
we use union all since we re going to select distinct afterwards anyway and this way we have a single distinct operation rather than repeating it

3483462int	chars
pattern0		
does a unique index on an int column perform faster than a chars 5

3483473int	chars
pattern0		
does a unique index on an int column perform faster than a chars 5

3484094lisp	scheme
pattern4		
why would anyone prefer scheme macros over common lisp macros and i genuinely want to know too i m not trying to be a troll

3484307lisp	scheme
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
i suspect that the reason people write scheme style macro systems in common lisp is more for the pattern matching than for the hygiene

3485121postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
however people often argue that postgresql is cleaner and easier to use that mysql

3485164spaces	delimiter
pattern0		
one cannot assume that more than one spaces is delimiter

3485244maven	m2e
pattern0		
the eclipse builder uses simpler logic than maven so sometimes the things m2e does are just not enough

3486208int	chars
pattern0		
does a unique index on an int column perform faster than a chars 5

3488037lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern2		
if you have a bulk of files you want to do this to what you re probably going to want to do is write a script in a hll with a decent html parser i recommend python with lxml or beautifulsoup and then run it over your code

3488049button	checkbox
pattern7	better	
while the differences may seem insignificant at first the correct usage of radio button and checkbox creates a better user experience because the site behaves in a way they expect

3489766skip-lists	tree
pattern10	more	pattern10	more natural	
thus write-heavy data structures are probably better implemented mutably and with something like a skip-lists where you only need to lock locally while read-heavy data structures are probably better implemented immutably where a tree is a more natural data structure

3490575wxpython	pyqt
pattern4		
i personally recommend pyqt a binding to the qt library but many people also like wxpython a binding to wxwindows

3493725firefox	safari
pattern10	prototype faster	pattern10	prototype faster	
it looks like at least on safari and firefox prototype runs significantly faster edit not 20x as stated earlier

3499528google-chrome	firefox

has anyone ever had the chance to check execution time to compare openrowset openquery opendatasource for a very large file import in sql server 2008

3507203int	double
pattern0		pattern0		
if you need to parse very large numbers larger than int double and don t need the exact value then a simple regex based method might be sufficient

3507317width	height
pattern7		pattern7	larger	
solved it will resize only if width is larger than 800px or height is larger than 600px

3508954ironruby	ironpython

pattern0		pattern0		
i would like to split the image into tiles so that each tiles area must be larger than a min tile area eg 1024 bytes and smaller than max tile area eg 2048 bytes

3512286postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
i am aware that postgresql interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than mysql and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject

3513993wordpress	joomla
pattern0		pattern0		
i speak of great experience in this area as i have developed my own cms over a cumulation of years and selling the cms becomes even much tougher as joomla wordpress and drupal have a price point that you cannot complete with

3518755int	chars
pattern7		
an int is a bigger memory area than a chars and when you read you ll pick up other values beside the chars and end up with an effectively random value

3520281disk	ram
pattern10		pattern10		
no trivial support for cache accessing ram is faster than accessing disk

3520921int	chars
pattern0		
for instance on an architecture where the int are 4 bytes and must be 4 byte aligned an int pointer could be two bits smaller than a chars or void pointer

3521290post	get
pattern0		
as a pragmatist i m inclined to use get because implementing it is way simpler than post

3521353post	get
pattern4		
however other application issues might prefer get over post for some state-changing requests and i do not think there is any problem with this

3522746ienumerable	ilist
pattern10		pattern10		pattern0		
yes i understand that ienumerable is much more lighter rather than ilist but anyway there is a lot situations where we need to have ilist instead of ienumerable and in this approach we need to cast ienumerable to ilist isn t it

3524146apache	nginx
pattern0		
it s just a little slower than using apache bench directly against nginx

3524652int	chars

it seems pretty silly that your presumably 16-bit int takes more than twice as many instructions as an 8-bit chars

3526596lisp	scheme
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
my impression common lisp is more for getting stuff done scheme is more for education and fun

3528737lisp	scheme

the class uses scheme a dialect of lisp which is significantly cleaner and easier to use than common lisp yes this is an opinion deal with it

3532995union	distinct
pattern4		
i don t quite understand what is it that you want to get in the results but union selects distinct values so you won t have duplicate values values from #tmptable2 that already exist in #tmptable1

3536007innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
myisam generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions innodb has such as rollback... but it has only table locking

3536043width	height
pattern0		
you can also at this time query the status bar navigation bar and toolbar for their sizes and get the correct post-rotation values although the status bar width and height may be swapped--i just take the smaller value as the height works great

3538251awt	swing
pattern8		
i m more familiar with swing but the article painting in awt and swing distinguishes between system- and application-triggered painting

3538383nginx	cherokee
pattern4		
how do you compare nginx and cherokee in terms of memory usage and performance

3539265quicksort	radix-sort
pattern8		
why quicksort or introsort or any comparison-based sorting algorithm is more common than radix-sort

3539872range	minimum
pattern0		
for example the language standard only mandates minimum range for types like short int and long but they may be wider than the minimum requirements

3541024pascal	delphi

if you prefer tp delphi dialect free pascal is the better choice

3541544int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
a chars is commonly smaller than an int

3541790udp	tcp

normally a server wouldn t need to know the client s address beforehand but udp s knottier than tcp the more usual stream-oriented approach to socket communication in many ways

3543267backgrounding	multitasking
pattern10		pattern10		
btw multitasking is really more fast switching than backgrounding in ios.

3544966post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
post is more secure then get and data transfer size limits are also there

3548478dynamic-languages	compiled-language
pattern0		
because you can determine what code in a compiled-language is likely to do better than a dynamic-languages it has been determined more error free to use a compiled perspective for more things so as you can see with the availability of offset-management and lookup compiled behavior given to you in core perl there is no reason to mess with the symbol table if you don t have to

3551199filesystems	ntfs
pattern10		pattern10		
ntfs is much more complex and time consuming due to the more complex nature of this filesystems

3553157prepare	execute
pattern10		pattern10		
prepare execution is faster than direct execution for statements execute more than three or four times because the statement is compiled only once while statements execute directly are compiled each time they are execute

3553776children	parent
pattern4		
i want to match parent s height with the total height of its children so the content does not flow out from parent s border

3553940postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
you might look at postgresql as i find it a bit easier to manage and maintain as i feel some aspects are more logical than mysql

3559475vaadin	wicket
pattern7		pattern0		
with this in mind customizing the css of a wicket app is significantly easier than vaadin for the simple reason that you control the markup

3559643int	chars
pattern0		
the compiler warning mentions int because the c++ standard 2.13.2 1 says that chars literals that contain more than one chars actually has type int which has an implementation defined value

3562771int	chars
pattern0		
for example a column specified as int 3 has the usual int range of -2147483648 to 2147483647 and values outside the range permitted by three chars are displayed using more than three chars

3563373postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
there is also postgresql its a bit more robust than mysql and is free just the same

3565975udp	tcp
pattern10	more	pattern10	more common	
and wikipedia says that snmp can be run over tcp ip but udp is more common

3565975udp	tcp
pattern4		
that is yet another reason to prefer tcp ip over udp for network monitoring imo

3567637range	max
pattern0		
so if you re getting a step exceeds the specified range error i d guess that the default step value 1 is larger than the max of the range the result of .

3568783udp	tcp
pattern7		
udp is significantly easier do you really need tcp btw

3572799int	chars
pattern0		
if the file is in text format you may be able to fit it in memory just by converting things to int as you read them in since an int stored as chars may take more space than an int stored as an int depending on the size of the int and the type of text file

3573705accessor	properties
pattern3		
beside the advantages of encapsulation we prefer using properties with get and set accessor among many other ways because they provide a clear and practical syntax

3581064for-loop	arrays
pattern0		
is there a simpler way than a for-loop to create this arrays or no

3583267client-side	server-side

how are push notification better than pull notification on iphones

3586654for-loop	arrays
pattern0		
is there a simpler way than a for-loop to create this arrays or no

3591151google-chrome	firefox

this is due to the simple fact that firefox has been in the extension business longer than google-chrome or ie

3591491button	checkbox
pattern0		
i can verify that by unchecking the checkbox it does flip the value because i enable disable the next button depending on the myproperty value - i have more than one checkbox btw

3592441nsstring	nsobject
pattern4		
using to compare nsobject instances in this case nsstring instances is a pointer comparison since objective-c instances cannot be created on the stack

nginx s static file performance is better than apache

3605831lxml	celementtree
pattern0		
as a side-effect of implementing proper parent traversal lxml is a bit slower than celementtree for parsing

3607218setinterval	settimeout
pattern4		
for simple effects like this i always prefer settimeout since it s easier to end the animation sequence compared to setinterval

3609448getter	setter
pattern8		
if you judge that the code is more readable with getter setter after fields rather than after constructor you re free to do it

3614913udp	tcp

3615428sorting	filtering	listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more dependent	pattern10	more dependent	
i think the performance depends a lot on the data provider paging and sorting and filtering the data are easily the most expensive tasks when dealing with databases - so picking a renderer gridview listview repeater is more dependent on your comfort with that particular control

3621243direct3d	direct2d
pattern7	more	
as mentioned direct2d is an option also--it is functionally a layer on top of direct3d that supports more 2d specific functionality as well as excellent text support

3624638gif	png
pattern4		
it depends on the nature of the image if it s a photograph jpeg would give the highest quality compression ratio if it was pixel stuff like writing or clipart or have some transparency then it s gif png to choose gif png8 offers one level transparency while png24 offers a levelled transparency for each pixel

3625438profiler	yourkit
pattern4		
i can recommend yourkit java profiler however its not free

3627970union	distinct

tripledes is generally not recommended because aes gives better security more efficiently you might like to see some comparative timings of block ciphers that i took in java to see just how bad it is

3632503int	double
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
as for the last question floating point arithmetic particularly double precision is much more complex than int arithmetic so on a reasonably modern pipelined processor each instruction will take longer to execute

3633244apache	nginx
pattern4		
nginx is an asynchronous event-driven web-server which outperforms apache by a huge margin

3634198int	chars
pattern7	better	
also if r_smppid is fixed width change field type to chars 40 or whatever the length of the content is or if it can be converted into an int that s even better

3634389union	distinct
pattern0		
however the tables are huge and the union all i read its faster than distinct takes forever to execute even with just two tables let alone 6

bionic the android version of libc is more slightly more limited not by much

3635064union	distinct
pattern4		pattern4		pattern4		
it may be lil dumb select distinct from select distinct from first_column union select distinct from second - not valid sql just logic

3635081apache	nginx
pattern4		
there is no single reason why nginx strictly outperforms apache

3635393redhat	fedora

last version on ibm s website is from 2008 redhat enterprise 5.2 and fedora 9 - has anyone an experience running this ibm sdk on fedora 13 or at least any version higher than stated fedora 9 and is linux available of sufficient testing

3643234hash	salt
pattern10	values more	pattern10	values more difficult	
by using a salt value typically you want this to be a random number the hash won t match the dictionary the chance of them pre-calculating all passwords with all possible salt values is exponentially more difficult

3644563width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
you may want to check if the width is greater than the height

3645034pthreads	usleep
pattern7	higher	
compared to sleep 3 and usleep 3 nanosleep has the advantage of not affecting any signals it is standardized by pthreads it provides higher timing resolution and it allows to continue a sleep that has been interrupted by a signal more easily

3646066django	turbogears
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more out-of-the-box	pattern10	more out-of-the-box	
in contrast to turbogears django is more out-of-the-box

3648664getter	setter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more flexibility	
a public getter or setter gives you more flexibility - when we try and read the variable might not be ready

3655318gson	jackson
pattern4		
aside from gson that some like i would recommend jackson

3657316int	chars
pattern0		
first of all never send int s and other types larger than chars like that - you will ignore endianness and the recipient might be unable to interpret the data properly

3659729querypath	phpquery
pattern10		pattern10		
it is said that phpquery is often faster than querypath because of fewer overall features

3659784strlen	substr

strlen string + matches strlen replacement -strlen substr + 1

3661941int	chars
pattern4		
use the select int int method first to select the last chars

3666957boost	stl

trying to debug on a client machine running xp and vs2008 and the app works ok running on cassini however when i select iis i am getting a 403 forbidden error

3670952google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
i could also use a firefox extension though i d prefer google-chrome

3671879oncreate	setcontentview
pattern7	event better	
so for one time initialization code like setcontentview or initializing variables the oncreate event is a better place

3673278rank	max
pattern4		
alternatively you could use a select max rank from rankings where memberid

3676567int	double
pattern0		
i m writing a c# class to perform 2d separable convolution using int to obtain better performance than double counterpart

3676568getter	setter
pattern4		
to my knowledge it s almost common practice aside from the .designer.cs files it seems to place all global variables at the beginning of a class definition followed by the rest of the code in any order i prefer getter and setter then constructors then events then misc functions

3676586int	double
pattern4		
at least it is not fair to compare int dword 4 bytes and double qword 8 bytes on 32-bit system

3676586int	double
pattern4		
compare int to float or long to double to get fair results

3676764macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports

pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
from what i have read on here i here that nunit is more popular over mbunit

3678783mbunit	nunit
pattern4		pattern2		
why should i prefer mbunit over nunit or vice-versa

3680692int	chars
pattern0		
in you are adding a chars to an int an int can be much bigger than a chars so it chooses the bigger data type int to be the result a.k.a

3681067mbunit	nunit
pattern10	more	pattern10	more feature-rich	
even though nunit now includes the most popular mbunit advanced features mbunit is still more feature-rich for example

3681067mbunit	nunit
pattern10		pattern10		
nunit is more popular because it was there first therefore more articles about it on the web and better tooling and because most programmers don t care about or need the advanced features that mbunit offers

3681779cout	cin
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
well i have written this class wich do this but when use cin cout works no more

3682493post	get
pattern7		pattern0		
after that is done you can go into security details where get is slightly less secure than post - see the comments for details.

3683027getter	setter
pattern7	better	
i think that the accessors getter and setter is far better at least in your example

3683339lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern2		
these days lxml has an html module which the beautifulsoup implementer himself recommends over beautifulsoup

3689813equals	compareto
pattern4		
you shouldnt be using for string comparison if i remember correctly use compare compareto or equals

3690958vim	textmate
pattern0		
it s horses for courses personally i m much happier with textmate or vim and a nice cup of coffee but it s what feels more comfortable to you

3694131int	chars
pattern0		
naturally using chars would result in more operations than int

3697715altera	xilinx
pattern0		
xilinx tools suck but their raw silicon is better than altera

3701025memcpy	memmove
pattern10		pattern10		
is it a microoptimization or are there real significant examples when memcpy is faster so that we really need to use memcpy and not stick to memmove everywhere

3701546post	get
pattern7		pattern0		
from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked

3701959folder	directory
pattern4		
on the open dialog i have set the optionsex to ofexnoplacesbar and that removes the bar that would let them select folder and directory to go to quickly but the user can use the bread crumb address tool to go up a level and type a different directory into the filename text box to change directory

3702732google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more extra	pattern10	more extra	
the vertical spacing in firefox between the real estate search h2 tag and the form input field for san francisco ca #city-field input tag is perfect but in google-chrome google-chrome is applying more extra vertical spacing than desired

3702732google-chrome	firefox

3703953post	get
pattern4		
i don t want to lose get or post values

3704402division	subtraction
pattern7		pattern0		
this platform is probably not representative of your microcontroller but the test shows that on this platform the subtraction is considerably slower than the division

3706276multiplying	add
pattern7		
add is faster than mul but if you want to multiplying two general values mul is far faster than any loop iterating add operations

3707592innodb	myisam
pattern0		
i ve figure out that even though myisam has locking contention it s still faster than innodb in most scenarios because of the rapid lock acquisition scheme it uses

3710379typedef	struct
pattern3		
when programming for ios should i prefer using struct and typedef where the object has no behavior methods basically

3716386children	parent
pattern7		
but its parent is greater than or equal to w so at some level of the tree one of the children of the greatest element is w

3720227facebook	fbconnect
pattern7	success more	
i m not familar with the facebook api but the fbconnect success looks more like an objective-c selector instead of a url

3722370imagemagick	graphicsmagick
pattern0		
graphicsmagick is not that much faster -- and the outputted file sizes are significantly higher than imagemagick

3723013equals	compareto
pattern4		
i am trying to compare two strings in vb but compareto compare equals etc all give compile errors

3725905apl	algol
pattern0		
as far as the syntax goes i guess it s a bit different from the more classic syntax of the algol family languages but it s no more and possibly less weird than apl

3726590nginx	lighttpd
pattern0		
i actually found the setup of nginx much easier than lighttpd not to mention that you can install a macport of nginx port install nginx +ssl that does not contain the ssl-breaking bug that lighttpd suffers from here

3732594direct3d	directdraw
pattern3		
it should be noted that directdraw is old having stopped in dx7 and microsoft recommends using direct3d with textured quads to do 2d blitting

3732683union	distinct
pattern4		
one more thing to mention your union select s should be union all select because without the all the engine has to remove duplicates just as if you d indicated select distinct

3735534post	get
pattern8		
post isn t more secure than get

3737403floating-point	fixed-point
pattern8		
fixed-point can be much more exact than floating-point as long as the number s exponents remain in range

3737518hash	md5
pattern0		
this generally uses a hash algorithm that is much faster than md5

3737567int	double
pattern0		
please note this is not the best version of this program eg. what if the user doesn t pass an argument or doesn t pass a number as an argument or passes a number larger than an int or passes a number that is a float or double instead of an int

3739370min	max
pattern4		
it selects min max interval just fine

3739900int	chars
pattern0		
i want to validate the data contained by value objects before inserting into the database check that php string is smaller than 255 chars before inserting into a column of type varchar 255 or that a string is not inserted in an int 11 table column php date has the correct format etc.

i d recommend emacs or vim but i m sure you ll have your favorites

3743941expression-blend	silverlight
pattern10		pattern10		
expression-blend has much more advanced wpf silverlight visual designer than visual studio including wysiwyg animation editor etc

3745457magento	oscommerce	cart	oscommerce
pattern0		
prestashop is much easier than zen cart oscommerce and magento

3747750int	chars
pattern7		
you should probably always use an id number that way if you change the type name you don t need to update the user table it also allows you to keep your datasize down as a table full of int is much smaller than one full of 45 chars varchars

3750603dateadd	strtotime
pattern0		
that said the date class is much better in php5.3 -- it even has dateadd subtract functions which would also solve your problem much better than strtotime .

3754055gson	jackson
pattern0		
we plan to use gson extensively in the application as it seems safer and better than jackson

3757688getdate	datepart
pattern4		
select datepart year getdate datepart year getdate - 1 datepart year getdate - 2

3759576hash	md5
pattern0		
valid choices for hashing include sha1 or md5 although sha1 is preferable because it produces a larger hash and is considered cryptographically stronger than md5

3762592actionscript	mxml
pattern7		pattern0		
i can see that my skeleton mxml module is slightly larger than my actionscript module 66kb vs

3763043width	height

3770950haskell	agda
pattern0		
another popular language that offers more power than haskell is agda - i don t know agda beyond knowing it is dependently typed on hackage and well respected by people i respect but those are good enough reasons to me

3771408udp	tcp
pattern0		
this actually happens more commonly with tcp connections but i see no reason udp can t have this problem as well

3771477haskell	agda
pattern10		pattern10		
coq is probably the most prominent language of the style but agda has a more haskell-y feel as well as being written in haskell itself

3772619fadein	fadeout
pattern0		pattern0		
jquery might have better methods than fadeout fadein for this job

3776914postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern0		
does that mean perhaps rails team favor postgresql slightly more than mysql

3777454flask	django
pattern0		
if you are looking for the latter then flask is a micro framework that is considerably smaller than django

3781992ant	maven
pattern4		pattern4		
i personally prefer maven as a packaging and building tool although others prefer ant

3782134ubuntu	linux

in .net they have a little bit weird names whereas in scala they have the same standard names they have in other languages select is map aggregate is reduce or fold selectmany is flatmap where is filter or withfilter orderby is sort or sortby or sortwith and there are zip take and takewhile and so on

3787488wxpython	pyqt
pattern8		
two words of warning against wxpython it is not possible to install it via the popular fink package manager on mac os x currently which makes it far less portable than pyqt and tkinter

3789279min	max
pattern4		
select min min num max max num from temp

3789935onkeyup	onkeydown
pattern0		
for browsers that don t support either event you can fall back to onkeydown with a 0ms timer for the check which is a little better than onkeyup

3791405vmware	virtualbox
pattern0		
fwiw i have never gotten freebsd to work properly under virtualbox perhaps if you need that you would be better off with vmware which does

3791525for-loop	arrays
pattern10	faster	
a straightforward solution is to iteratively create each of the arrays using a for-loop or list comprehension or use a higher dimensional arrays where each of these 1d arrays is a row in your 2d arrays which is generally faster

3791591width	height
pattern0		
i want to take an bitmap of a glyph that is smaller than 32x32 width and height are not necessarily powers of 2 and put it into a texture so i can render it

3792915int	double
pattern7	greater	
when you compare a double to a 64-bit int however there will be potential roundoff error if the int is greater than 2 52

3794119innodb	myisam

while the myisam type takes around 10mb average of 15b for each row the innodb type takes more than 30mb average of 44b

3794321hide	show
pattern4		
i want to make the options of select show or hide by program js is it possible

3794813codeigniter	cakephp
pattern7		pattern2		
codeigniter has the lower learning curve overall so i would recommend it over cakephp

3796630width	height

compare memcpy and strcpy function definitions

3815683cpu	processors
pattern7	more	
with current hardware at about twice the number of active threads as execution units cores ht logical processors however the architecture handles multithreaded execution your cpu starts spending more time scheduling thread execution and managing thread states than it is actually executing the threaded instructions

3819159lisp	smalltalk
pattern0		
common lisp is an image base language although usually to a lesser extent than smalltalk

3821775min	max
pattern7	lo32 less	
if the difference between max hi32 and min lo32 is less than about 6 days worth should be enough for a packet capture exercise

3821910range	minimum
pattern7		
if the 32-bit float range is larger than -1..1 then you need to find the minimum and maximum values and calculate a scale factor that gets the samples within the int16 range

3822232fink	macports
pattern7		pattern0		
fink has more packages than macports

3825114websphere	ibm
pattern7		
ibm makes it easier for those who can t afford websphere application developer or rational application developer which are both eclipse flavour to use eclipse

3826469mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more work	
you can simulate an anchor using css cursor pointer and events like mouseenter and mouseleave which is more work but does not break the expected behavior of an anchor tag

3828265datamapper	activerecord
pattern0		
so a question for those who know better is datamapper newer than activerecord

3828562datamapper	activerecord
pattern7		pattern0		
datamapper is newer than activerecord

3835098pdfbox	itextsharp
pattern4		
however i would recommend pdfbox for the parsing a bit more elegant...although itextsharp worked out ok.

3835805int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
that answer is pretty clear a chars is smaller than an int and when objective-c was designed back in the 80s shaving off a few bytes was always good

3837891hash	md5
pattern10		pattern10		
if you don t need the cryptographic properties then a non-cryptographic hash or a hash that is less cryptographically secure md5 being broken doesn t prevent it being a good hash nor still strong enough for some uses is likely to be more performant

3838372min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
then you have to check that beta1 - beta2 alpha1 - alpha2 is greater than min x1_line1 x2_line1 and less than max x1_line1 x2_line1

3842231passenger	thin	passenger	unicorn	thin	unicorn
pattern4		pattern2		
i personally prefer passenger over thin unicorn having run nginx to thin backends for a long while just for the convenience but your proposed setup is fairly standard

3842231ubuntu	centos
pattern3		
if you don t have a favorite distro i would recommend trying ubuntu centos as they tend to be quite friendly to the beginner and have extremely robust community support

3842276cos	sin
pattern0		
so if you re on such a processor and if you have no dependencies in your code you don t need the result of one sin computation in order to start the next one then you probably won t get much faster than using sin and cos directly as they will be fully pipelined achieving an effective rate of 1 per cycle

3842713width	height
pattern0		
the content itself has much more height than width and it would be perfect to have the screen split down the middle horizontally with the content on the left and the virtual keyboard on the right

3844399nunit	mstest
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	faster	
nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases nunit is faster and in other cases mstest is faster

3844399nunit	mstest
pattern7		pattern0		
thus i suspect when people say that nunit is much faster than mstest it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar

3845784quicksort	mergesort
pattern4		
but it would be silly to compare quicksort and mergesort on the basis of the depth of recursion of the mergesort vs

3846475vb6	vba
pattern0		
vba being a whole lot less than vb6

3851309division	multiplication
pattern0		
as hroptatyr mentioned the multiplication is quite fast and it s much faster than division

3853537wordpress	joomla
pattern8		
but drupal i believe is more powerful than wordpress and joomla

3856915subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
pattern0		pattern0		
in other words hardly anything slower than multiplying add subtract but not enough to really worry about

3859836equals	charat
pattern4		
you create an object java.lang.string which inherit some methods which in the java.lang.string class like compare equals contains charat and more

3860490dotnetzip	sharpziplib
pattern0		pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
i used it because it is small 6 kb compiled with just the extraction making it far smaller than dotnetzip which is more than 150 kb and is more permissive than sharpziplib

3863135ant	maven
pattern4		
if you do end up splitting them out i can recommend maven or ant ivy to help you structure this

3865513vsto	add-in
pattern4		
vsto beats add-in express in one area it allows creating so-called document-level add-in

3865596expandablelistview	spinner
pattern7		
you cannot directly use an expandablelistview for the spinner popup any more than you can directly use a listview for the spinner popup

3868099tripledes	aes
pattern8		
i personally would use aes for my encryption as it is lighter and more secure than tripledes in fact i think it is the de facto algorithm at the moment

3869263typemock	moles
pattern0		
i have no concrete figures on that but from my own experience i d estimate that instrumented tests are around 100-400 slower typemock seeming to be faster than ms moles

3869263typemock	moles
pattern7	better	
if you want to cover a brownfield project with tests which was not written at all with testability in mind then you have to use one of typemock or moles in my opinion typemock is the better choice

3869603subtraction	addition
pattern0		pattern0		
that will make it easier to do operations with this value equality greater than less than addition subtraction etc...

3874117spaces	delimiter
pattern0		
more than one spaces should be compressed to a delimiter pipe better

3875160for-loop	loops
pattern7		
they are functionally identical however it can be argued that the for-loop is less error prone because all of loops functionality is right there together

3876058postgresql	mysql
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
but in low traffic sites mysql postgresql is better

3876196union	distinct
pattern2		
you can also choose between union all or union distinct the default where the latter will only send rows that aren t repeats

3877976union	distinct
pattern0		
i am currently using union all and a distinct in the outer query as this proved much faster than using union s for the uniqueness of data

3877986median	percentile
pattern0		
as one good programmer can be more productive than two average programmers i vaguely remember an old ibm study concluding someone in the top percentile was 27x more productive than median it s useful to see the same programmers doing it both ways

3878773int	double
pattern10		pattern10		
a double is a more precise type than an int in a general manner of speaking

3881996web.py	bottle
pattern4		
in particular i d recommend bottle and web.py both of which can be used with more or less finagling with the excellent mimerender library for solid content negotiation

3882058cpython	ironpython
pattern0		
so if you want to use django or something like that it s probably not smart to use ironpython because it isn t really cross-platform doesn t work with some frameworks and it performs worse than cpython

3882214post	get
pattern0		
i don t want to use the get request since it says in the guidelines of a restful api that it should use post for this purpose plus i might want to send more data than get can handle

3884737int	chars
pattern0		
in order for this to work reliably c should have type and unsigned int should be strictly wider than unsigned chars

3887803try-catch	exception-handling
pattern0		
in java you can call option s isempty isdefined and get without any special hassle the really useful option methods such as getorelse are another matter. checking the result of the isdefined method in an if-clause should be faster than checking exception-handling in a try-catch block

3888711opera	google-chrome
pattern10		pattern10		
especially in opera there is much more green in the painting than in google-chrome

3891255firefox	safari
pattern4		
just go into safari open preferences then select firefox as the default browser at the top of the first tab

3892629opencv	emgucv

i do not know any good signal processing libraries in .net but emgucv opencv is wrapper around opencv which can do advanced signal processing

3893175post	get
pattern4		
get has the ability to outperform post requests

3893529set	bag
pattern4		
for your immediate purposes in your inspector view right-click on the jpanel and select set layout - grid bag layout

3893643width	height
pattern0		
most fonts have a character width less than the height so assuming width height will definitely work

3899501interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0		
interpreted-language tend to be but not always are significantly slower than compiled-language

3900417integer	unsigned
pattern7		
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

3900860implements	extends
pattern4		
personally i d recommend implements your own adapter most likely in this case by extends simplecursoradapter and encapsulating the updates to distance text and compass heading rotation within that

3994593postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
some recent tests we did showed that postgresql does perform faster than mysql and we believe the table partitioning feature in postgresql will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production

4001140hash	salt
pattern2		
my reasoning was that storing the salt unencrypted along with the hash password would make it easier to crack the passwords as a hacker that would be able to retrieve the password table and would know or make an assumption about the hash algorithm would be able to find matches between hash of well known words dictionary attack by hashing each word in the dictionary and then salting with the salt he also has access to

4005055multiplication	exponent

i would recommend postgresql for a beginner as it has far fewer surprises than mysql

4074984postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
big sites built around open source software choose mysql over postgresql by a wide margin

4076445int	chars

4147351udp	tcp
pattern0		
udp protocol is unreliable but much much faster than tcp which is most commonly used for communication

4147584getter	setter
pattern3		
i prefer using setter and getter because it allows you to manually wire up the object when you re not running it in a spring context setting mocks in a unit test

4147862versioning	upgrade

4168358xslt	xquery
pattern8		
probably more popular than xquery is xpath which is the basis of xslt transform

4170787width	height
pattern7		pattern7		
i wouldn t scale the image every single time in the paintcomponent method but do it once if the width and height have been changed since the last call and in that case recreate a bufferedimage containing the image which you blit every single time before calling the superclass paintcomponent scaled up to the right size use something like image scaling does not work when original image height width is smaller the scaling height width

4173070gitolite	gitosis
pattern8		
that being said i find gitolite much more complete than gitosis like all those recent blog posts illustrate

4173072xna	slimdx

that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

4192638min	max	minimum	max
pattern0		
which means minimum of min repetitions but not more than max repetitions

4194962int	double
pattern7		pattern0		
note that the double is much trickier than the int s

4196132autocomplete	multi-select	deselect	multi-select
pattern4		
i m aware that there are different styles of multi-select widget eg an available list and a selected list vs a single list with select deselect checkboxes vs autocomplete combobox.

4196925hash	salt
pattern7	much safer	
using the hash value with a salt is much safer if someone breaks into your db no password is there

4197699fontconfig	freetype
pattern7	newer	
we updated freetype in osx 10.6.5 and fontconfig which links against freetype wants this newer version

4203216trie	tree
pattern10		pattern10		
use a radix tree wiki or trie wiki if you are concerned about performance.the radix tree is more memory efficient compared to a trie

4203952for-loop	while-loop
pattern10		pattern10		
and now we know that for-loop is faster than while-loop

4210231kerberos	ntlm
pattern4		
windowsstreamsecuritybindingelement invokes an sspi handshake between the client and the server using the spnego security package in the nettcpbinding this will normally result in kerberos being selected as the underlying security provider if available but will choose ntlm if not

4213247google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		pattern0		
right now google-chrome is faster than firefox sunspider tests so your statement it loads faster in firefox is not really correct

4216633stateless	stateful
pattern4		
they prefer stateless vs stateful sessions to avoid session migration session tracking etc

4217261button	checkbox
pattern7	better	
as such creating a radio button rather than checkbox is a better solution

4218091post	get
pattern0		
while the post method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the get

4218386heroku	engineyard
pattern0		
engineyard does provide application-level support too which is a fair bit better than what heroku does

4218716cvs	svn
pattern4		
even the cvs maintainers as far as i understand don t recommend it for new projects but recommend svn instead

4220469udp	tcp
pattern0		
you ve struck lucky with the requirements - because you re going from udp - tcp it s actually a lot simpler than doing udp - udp

4221272int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
however an explicit cast is required in your second case where there is potential to lose information since a chars is smaller than an int

4223143min	max
pattern2		
will match x between min and max times

4224453getter	setter
pattern0		
depending on the rest of your code you might be better off with getter and setter

4225772folder	directory
pattern7		
test code updated so you can see that both it works identically whether using varargs or not will fail if your home directory has less than 5 sub folder

4225772folder	dir
pattern0		
calculates the size of the first 5 folder in your home dir should work on all platforms fails with an arrayindexoutofboundexception if there are less than five folder in your home dir

4229071cassette	squishit
pattern10	more	
another project you might want to look at is cassette which pretty much does everything squishit does and more

4233091wordpress	joomla
pattern0		pattern0		
bigger better than wordpress you re typically looking at joomla or drupal there are others these are just the most common ones

4233878innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

4233922profiling	debugging
pattern0		
edit i guess release is much faster than debugging but why is this profiling so time consuming

4235054division	modulo
pattern7	slower	
modulo is a bit weird for floating point - it returns negative for negative so you still have to have a branch and it involves a division which is slower on some machines as in i ve not found a machine where is significantly less expensive than going round a loop with a couple of subtractions two or three times

4242499calloc	malloc
pattern4		pattern2		
is there any situation where you would prefer malloc over calloc

4243324rss	feed
pattern7		
when browsing news sites with firefox it will display a rss icon in the addressbar if the site has rss feed which makes it easier to discover feed

4246897innodb	myisam
pattern0		
myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads

4247640subtraction	addition	division	subtraction	division	addition
pattern0		
knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction

4249103equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

4249103equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

4253674arc4random	srand
pattern7		
from what i can gather arc4random generates much better random numbers than rand does however i haven t seen a way to seed it and i would like to just like using srand

4257780innodb	myisam
pattern4		
i am not a mysql expert but its capacity features and performance are very much depending on the table type you select innodb myisam + others

4257838min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
if given value is higher than max or lower than min values then keys holding max and min are given respectively

4258298stateless	stateful
pattern0		
for certain kinds of transactions a stateless session may perform slightly faster than a stateful session

4265154quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	longer	pattern10	longer	
quicksort and mergesort is longer and seems more complicated but it is o n log n

4265710google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
if google-chrome seems to finish earlier than firefox then that is the freezing glitch in action

4265961int	double
pattern0		
then make changes to that choice either as an optimisation float takes up less space than double so if you are storing a very large number of them that might be a reasonable choice to better match some outside-imposed criteria or because it won t suffice when you need to use long rather than int

4266359min	max
pattern4		
comparison throughput of compare min max is 8 operations per clock

4269273hash	salt
pattern10		pattern10		
i get the impression that most people think that hashing salt passwords is the more secure way of handling passwords but i can t figure out a way to comply with current company operations when using hash passwords

4270571hide	show
pattern0		
i had a situation where i needed to do more than just show or hide the one element

4272854uiview	subviews
pattern0		
they re much bigger than the uiview of which they are subviews

4273795post	get
pattern3		
they recommend using get primarily for retrieving information and using post for updating information

4274038daemon	cron
pattern10	more	pattern10	more work	
but honestly cron is fairly lightweight and unless it needs to be real-time or whatever that means to you writing php into a daemon is more work than it s work

4274459django	web2py
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
django turbo gears web2py which is better for what

4276386client-side	server-side
pattern4		
you can use a customvalidator and perform the regex match server-side and also on the client-side as well if you want

4276683mongodb	bson
pattern10		pattern10		
mongodb stores everything in memory anyway and works in a similar vein being a key-value based system however i believe mongodb is more flexible as it allows for storing bson objects within themselves

4282952tax	shipping
pattern0		
if you are sending stuff there are a lot more considerations than just shipping costs you may need to fill in specific tax forms for some countries and depending on what your site is selling you may need special processing for some countries try sending coffee to thailand -- you need to obtain permission from thier ministry of agriculture

4286175range	min
pattern0		
workaround is to use a value lower than the min value in range -2065 here or you can also use -1e9 to have a shorter string

4288557gif	png
pattern7		pattern0		
many people don t know about 8-bit png which is usually better than gif in size.

4289512sproutcore	cappuccino
pattern7		
sproutcore has a better data store api than the one cappuccino has

4289512sproutcore	cappuccino
pattern0		
sproutcore makes use of bindings better than cappuccino currently does

4292392mdpi	hdpi
pattern0		
first of all if you anyhow provide a hdpi graphic adding an mdpi and ldpi graphic which both are less than the hdpi graphic in size there is approximately 3 4 6 scaling ratio will increase the size but far from triple it more close to double

4292700quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort
pattern7		pattern0		pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

4292700quicksort	mergesort
pattern0		
quicksort is implemented well it is typically 2-3 times faster than mergesort or

4294303np-hard	np-complete
pattern0		
it is not easier than the np-complete problem since it can be reduced to it in polynomial time which makes the problem np-hard

4294578post	get
pattern8		
post data isn t inherently more secure than get data

4295387lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern10		pattern10		
it s generally accepted that lxml is faster than beautifulsoup ref

4297436viewdidappear	viewwillappear
pattern10		pattern10		
in this case viewdidappear behaves more like viewwillappear ..

4300142cvs	svn
pattern0		
i donâ t like using git itself though itâ s far better than svn or cvs but github is such an awesome site that iâ ve considered switching just to use it

4300932cvs	svn
pattern4		
as drupal.org is in the process of moving from cvs to git i wouldn t recommend svn

4301621multiplying	division
pattern0		
sure that s probably compiled or jit d away but you should avoid division in performance critical code it s far slower than multiplying

4304902multiplying	add
pattern7	smaller	
this was certainly true 40 years ago when it was first developed but i believe in more modern processors the difference between add and multiplying has gotten smaller

4305069quicksort	heapsort
pattern10	faster	
so normaly you could use heapsort but most times quicksort is faster

4305402ocaml	racket
pattern10		pattern10		
ocaml is faster than racket for most of the benchmarks on languages benchmark game

4308137haskell	ocaml
pattern4		
but according to the the computer language benchmarks game haskell oftenly beats ocaml if only by rather small fractions â there remains the problem that this benchmark takes only very specific samples

4308273wordpress	joomla
pattern2		
i prefer it over wordpress and specially over joomla

4308882haskell	ocaml
pattern4		
but according to the the computer language benchmarks game haskell often beats ocaml if only by rather small fractions â there remains the problem that this benchmark takes only very specific samples

4309687vb.net	vb6
pattern7		
also developing enterprise application is such new languages java c# vb.net rubby is easier that vb6 because they rely on frameworks every body can write c# java code that function but it requires tricks good practices and some of imagination to write vb6 strong and rehusable code

4310587haskell	ocaml
pattern7		
if you want only very coarse parallelism at best and you intend to stick with mostly functional structures then pick based on something else like syntax i think haskell is much nicer here but that s subjective or available libraries haskell wins on quantity availability but ocaml might edge it out in the graphics department nonetheless

4310738textview	imageview
pattern7	more	
i m having a problem displaying the layout when my imageview and textview takes up more than 3 4 of the screen

4317366bash	zsh
pattern4		
why i prefer zsh z shell to bash

4318623width	height
pattern0		
i bet start has negative x or y when error happens or the size.hight + y or size.width + x is bigger than height or width of the image

4319423implements	extends
pattern0		
mvc is the most extensible and if you are familiar with how things work under the covers you ll probably be better off than implements a hard to extends ms thing like odata and wcf

4321266int	chars
pattern0		pattern0		
i understand you re after the security by obscurity but be aware that chars varchar columns larger than 4 chars take more space than int does 1 byte

4321310postfix	dovecot
pattern3		
if you have dovecot running too i can recommend having postfix authenticate via dovecot which is very configurable when it comes to sasl authentication

4327829width	height
pattern7	bigger	
you have to change to 96 pixels per inch then tab off -expression then will then suggest a new width and height which is much bigger

4329527sqldf	plyr
pattern7		pattern0		
in the first example sqldf is 3x slower than data.table and in the second its 200x faster than plyr and 100 times faster than data.table

4332352firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
pattern10		pattern10		
i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

4332537cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
pattern10		pattern10		
since perforce is less commonly used compared to cvs svn amongst bamboo users we generally get less feedback about it and hear less about existing issues

4333375ubuntu	debian
pattern8		
as for debian being more stable than ubuntu for using as server it can be true in very rare occasions where the package is very obscure

4333757hebrew	persian
pattern0		
i am not sure it can satisfy you but hebrew test is 4 times slower than persian

4337136cpython	ironpython
pattern0		
one of the largest benefits of ironpython is that it has effectively no gil - meaning that if you are both writing python code and it is multi-threaded - you can often get performance that is better than cpython without having to spawn multiple process and pickle objects across the boundaries

4337684unsigned	short
pattern0		
an unsigned char is an unsigned value which is typically smaller than and is guaranteed not to be bigger than a short

4338143datamapper	activerecord
pattern7		
from my point of view the datamapper model is much easier to grasp but since activerecord is the defacto standard it feels weird to change the orm just for this little problem

4340396ostringstream	std
pattern0		
on ideone the ostringstream is about 3 times slower than std copy + back_inserter + std vector and about 15 times slower than memcpy into a raw buffer

4343237super	extends
pattern7		
super is a lower bound and extends is an upper bound

4343455postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
this is a weak point that iirc postgresql can handle better but with mysql you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks

4344512google-chrome	firefox
pattern3		
if you re in a browser without a console i d recommend grabbing firefox and firebug to go with it or google-chrome and it s included developer tools

4345097inherited	base-class
pattern2		
normally i prefer encapsulation over inherited but for serialization dto a base-class is usually the simplest option

4345604for-loop	loops
pattern10		pattern10		
a for-loop is more appropriate than a while loops in your code

4346031onclick	onfocus
pattern4		
you will notice i have put select onfocus and onclick but it still doesn t always work

4347068extjs	ext.net
pattern7	easier	
i d rather not use use extjs directly - i m looking to expedite delivery and ext.net seems much easier

4347396cs-cart	magento
pattern4		
if you don t want to start from scratch i recommend cs-cart small site or magento huge site

4347937profiler	yourkit
pattern4		
hard to beat yourkit java profiler

4350103int	chars
pattern0		
if you just have 3 possible values use an array of chars and that will copy 4 times faster than int

4352428django	web2py
pattern10	something more	pattern10	something more	
i have just spent a few days playing around with web2py and really like it and i am wondering if django offers something more that i am missing out on

4352428django	web2py
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
django is also a wonderful framework but web2py is just better in my limited experience opinion

4352656int	chars
pattern0		
however if i call the function once with a file call it again with a nonexistent file then call it one more time with the original file the chars string buffer is larger than the int length

4352956django	web2py
pattern7		
having said that web2py has a lower initial learning curve than django as it was specifically designed as a learning tool

4353033django	web2py
pattern8		
django s admin is better and more customizable than web2py s appadmin

4355037scheme	racket	lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
pattern10		pattern10		
racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development

4355696mongoid	mongomapper
pattern4		
i prefer mongomapper for 2.3.x projects but mongoid has seemed much more stable for me in rails 3 projects

4361629memcpy	strcpy
pattern0		
memcpy is not really any slower than strcpy

4361920jqgrid	datatables
pattern0		
if you don t have someone around to help with jqgrid you are better off with datatables

4361953udp	tcp
pattern8		
http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses udp providing arguably faster reliable communication than tcp

4362006tiff	png
pattern0		
tiff â any bit depth any compression lossy or lossless everything including the kitchen sink â and no better than png

4362064division	multiplication
pattern0		
the reason to do this is because even though there is an integer division instruction div idiv in the instruction set it s typically very slow several times slower than multiplication

4362280translation	localization
pattern0		
this is where i learned that localization is a lot more than translation

4362987hash	md5
pattern2		
now i would like to save some bandwidth so what i have done is made a created a php script that md5 hash the images and then my java captures the output and then compares it against hash stored using the preferences api

4366163getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd year -2 getdate

4366172getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd year -2 getdate

4366172getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd yy -2 getdate

4366172getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd yyyy -2 getdate

4370193appfuse	spring
pattern0		
if you actually need dao s this is something that comes out-of-the-box in appfuse and put partly in spring roo but there is also a great addon for spring roo hades addon that does a great job at this maybe even better than appfuse

4370302division	multiplication
pattern7	quicker	
firstly multiplication and division is actually quicker in some circumstances

4371136getter	setter
pattern0		
it is nothing more than a getter setter for an object

4373083ant	maven
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
also note that while maven is no slower than ant for multi-module projects of this sort importing your maven project into an ide will generally result in far faster builds than maven can perform itself

4376029addition	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		
because addition is faster than multiplication and can be faster than shift

4378721squash	branch	filtering	grouping
pattern4		
if it is just you using the repo or a select grouping of folks that you can easily communicate with then you can safely squash or filtering see below to clean up history and then when they fetch they ll need to manually reset all their branch heads to the new heads

4384579goto	break
pattern7		
but actually break has more resemblance to return both instructions jump out of a block of code which is pretty much structured in comparison to goto

4391609int	double
pattern7		
your upccode int is larger than the long data type so i tried it with double which is a float but works

4393613memcpy	memmove
pattern4		
bcopy 3 while deprecated so prefer memmove 3 handles overlapping memory regions memcpy 3 doesn t

4394396postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
this is ancedotal but the postgresql servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than mysql which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down

4394406postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
postgresql is better than mysql in many ways

4394406postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
though mysql is more popular than postgresql but instagram is using postgresql maybe due to these reasons

4394406postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
i feel postgresql is much more mature and robust than mysql

4394622postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
generally speaking i find postgresql lends itself to 24 7 operations better than mysql

4395104getter	setter
pattern0		
the reflective approach using an existing class like beanutils is less coding but probably an order of magnitude slower than calling getter and setter in a simple way

4396834fink	macports
pattern0		
since i have seen many reports of the macports package manager being less reliable than the fink package manager i would suggest installing fink and then simply doing

4396834fink	macports
pattern0		
on top of that fink gives you access to more packages than macports

4396857nunit	mstest
pattern4		
if you want to compare mstest to nunit you can check this topic nunit vs visual studio 2010 #39

4398883google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	faster	
the latest stable firefox 3.6 is fast but for example google-chrome is even faster

4398883google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		pattern0		
as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than firefox 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than google-chrome 9 at least when using sunspider tests

4400444union	distinct
pattern4		
but here you will be missing ips that are not in day1 unless you first do a select distinct srcip from a union of all days which is pretty expensive

4403366maven	pom.xml
pattern2		
first you need to make sure that eclipse and maven are playing together correctly so that when you add dependency to you pom.xml eclipse will recognize them too and your eclipse project setup and structure match with maven

4406136libs	buildpath
pattern4		
yes you can right click on project -- property -- java buildpath -- and select libs tab and select add jar or add external java into lib folder.

4407968union	distinct
pattern0		
i have experienced situations where union s made a query much slower than union all with a distinct afterwards

4408220boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt
pattern10	faster	
knuth-morris-pratt which is classic or boyer-moore which is sometimes faster

4413860width	height
pattern0		
as part of the method i wanted to enforce that a point should be greater than zero but less than the width and height of the board in other words it should actually be on the board

4414796postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
i find working with php 5.3.1 and mysql i prefer postgresql however comfortable

4416038udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
tcp is much better than udp in terms of reliability

4416278range	min	range	max	min	max
pattern7		
age can be in the range of 0..100 but i want also to validate crossing values i mean that max is greather than or equal to min

4417291int	chars
pattern0		
however i m getting an error when the value i assigned is more than the chars int short range eclipse is showing compilation error

4420987cvs	svn
pattern0		
for internal work i ve found out that fossil uses little bandwidth much less than cvs or svn and is able to synchronize huge projects in a blitz even via an adsl or a 3g connection

4422204gif	png
pattern4		
try to put both of the images background and logo back-page1.png logo5.gif in the same format either gif or png i prefer png and it should do the trick

4422287awt	swing
pattern3		
instead of using awt components like canvas i would strongly strongly recommend using swing or really any other graphical library

4422407clang	llvm
pattern7	much faster	pattern7	much faster	
beyond the license issues clang llvm builds much faster than gcc and in apple s benchmarks and my own experience creates better-performing executables than gcc

4424402floor	sqrt
pattern0		pattern0		
this can be naively implemented by checking if it is divisible by all integers less than floor sqrt n in a loop

4426863lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern4		
as a side note many folks recommend lxml for parsing html xml over beautifulsoup now for performance and other reasons

4427769postgresql	mysql
pattern0		pattern0		
mongodb is fun to toy with and i ve built a few apps using it myself for that reason but it s almost never a better choice than postgresql mysql sql server etc

4429282division	logarithm
pattern0		pattern7	slower	
the reason to go with logarithm instead of repeated division is performance while log is slower than division it is slower by a small fixed multiple

4435582fossil	git
pattern0		
fossil is another one that s easy to use i would say easier than git to learn but it uses an sqlite file to store your code and i m not sure if it scales to really big projects

4437401getter	setter
pattern0		
also note that they are much slower than proper getter and setter

4439206innodb	myisam
pattern4		
if you use myisam as the db engine you will need to keep track of the ids manually but if you choose innodb as the engine you can use foreign keys

4443677width	height
pattern10		pattern10		pattern7	longer	
meaning if s width is longer src_x has to be 0 and if height is longer src_y has to be 0

4445686inline	inlining
pattern10		pattern10		
the keyword inline is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual inlining which the compiler can decide to do or not to do

4456107addition	multiplication
pattern7		
the precedence relationship is the same multiplication is higher then addition

4458445postgresql	mysql
pattern2		
if the primary keys always match up between mysql and postgresql you can just try to save the record setting the primary key explicitly

4459259pull	push
pattern0		
due to the work flow change our qa members would like to have finer control over the push pull operation on the release server they d like to allow only specified user s with user credential s to access to specified repo s

4459983innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
some people have said that for reads myisam is faster but recent improvements in innodb have either alleviated or eradicated this difference

4463906lisp	scheme
pattern4		
although if i was just learning i d choose scheme and have a field-day with continuations call-cc - it s definitely one of the more academic lisp dialects

4463931strophe	smack
pattern4		
you can use combination of smack strophe and openfire to get your java based app work as desired

4465683google-chrome	safari
pattern0		
total width of button in safari web inspector 6px larger than in google-chrome web inspector

4465683google-chrome	safari
pattern2		
- check blue buttons in google-chrome and then compare with safari you can see exact difference in web inspector

4465844int	chars
pattern2		
i would also recommend against int for nrcombinations because with only six chars with your base 36 alphabet you will get in trouble 36 6 2 31

4466018width	height
pattern0		
it can be less than height and width if the scrollbox logical area is not bigger than phisical area scrollbars not visible in that case

4466283button	checkbox
pattern4		
checkbox radio textfield textarea select button imagebutton hiddenfield

4466537post	get
pattern0		
stick with post on any action that does more than get data avoid xss-issues

4468125bazaar	svn
pattern0		
now i want to work on this read-only also i have better experience with bazaar than svn so i want to change this repository from svn to a bazaar repository for working locally how can i do that and one additional thing does svn support local repositories like bazaar

4469925for-loop	loops
pattern0		
really a while loops would probably have been clearer than a for-loop on reflection

4472086width	height
pattern7		
on every image load a call this function with image and resize if its width or height is bigger than my max width and max height

4472205google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
another alternative for javascript ajax is writing a google-chrome add-on easier than firefox or embeding a web browser within your application

4472281scheme	racket
pattern0		
i would suggest you start with scheme and more specifically with racket formerly plt scheme

4474662swt	swing
pattern4		
which technology i should choose swing or swt jface

4479114haskell	ocaml
pattern0		
i assume you re using linux or f# would be a much better choice than either ocaml or haskell

4480128memcpy	memmove
pattern10	better	
however because of additional checks that memmove performs when the buffers are small and surely does not overlap memcpy is better

4480146memcpy	memmove
pattern0		
if you know buffers cannot overlap memcpy is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than memmove

4482785webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern7		
so simply httpwebrequest is better option then webclient

4482879pylons	pyramid
pattern4		
also given that pylons itself was a very successful platform judging from its high-profile deployments do you recommend pyramid as a good replacement

4483174ninject	spring.net
pattern10	more	pattern10	more complicated	
note i do not know much about ninject but i worked with spring.net that is much more complicated

4487496flex	osmf
pattern7		
flex uses an older less capable version of the osmf platform for its videoplayer

4488636querypath	phpquery
pattern3		
hence i d recommend using phpquery or querypath for such occasions

4492941xstream	xom
pattern10		pattern10		
but if convenience is more important than efficiency yes you probably should consider a tree model not dom necessarily xom is better for example or data binding jaxb or xstream

4497793glut	glfw
pattern7		
or if you re really focused on only doing opengl i may suggest using glfw which is the better glut but you ll have to draw the menus yourself using opengl

4499141int	chars
pattern0		
is a search through numbers int faster than chars in an mysql database

4501981int	chars
pattern0		
since unicode is a 21-bit chars set it cannot return anything smaller than an int and it can be argued that technically it should be a long since an int could be a 16-bit quantity

4505641hash	md5
pattern4		
how can i match md5 hash with the grep command

4507414public	protected
pattern0		
protected functions maintain a weaker invariant than the public one before and after each call

4507421pull	push
pattern0		
is there a way to register that user connection and act more as a push if new values exist in the server rather than every user pull new values every 1 sec for example

4507601children	parent
pattern4		
present the user with the relevant information # children confirmation of parent to delete let them select a radio button or whatever to destroy children just parent cancel then destroy the appropriate records

4508736swt	swing
pattern7		pattern0		
fixing bugs in swt is much harder than in swing most classes in swt are final or contain hostile checks in the constructor to make sure no one extends them the package is signed so you can t simply replace classes and so far i tried several times to compile swt from sources - and failed

4508736swt	swing
pattern4		pattern2		
ps i still prefer swt over swing -

4513809versioning	upgrade
pattern0		
you can safely upgrade to trunk its better than last versioning anyway

4515976codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii	cakephp	yii
pattern7		
yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

4518929pylons	turbogears
pattern7	more	
you may want to look at turbogears which is built on top of pylons and has more out of the box things for you to use

4520448pyopengl	pyglet
pattern4		
obviously for 3d games you are going to have to muck around with opengl functions anyway in which case i recommend pyglet over pygame + pyopengl

4520902width	height
pattern10		pattern10		
correct me if i m wrong but if the magnitude of the projection of your point on the height vector is less then the magnitude of the height vector which is half of the height of the rectangle and the magnitude of the projection of your point on the width vector is then you have a point inside of your rectangle

4521727post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
why get method is faster than post

4523120superclass	subclassing
pattern7		
however they are not the same because the subclassing has more specific functions and data members that accomplish a more specific task that the superclass

4526890google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
you can do so by checking out firebug firefox extension or in the webkit dev tools i prefer google-chrome dev tools

4527030filtering	grouping
pattern10	less	pattern10	less efficient	
again this is perhaps more clear than using raw sql and only requires one query but this one query could be very large it will return all items and their categories and doing the grouping filtering yourself is probably less efficient than letting the database do it for you

4527378fink	macports
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		pattern7	many more	
because fink is reputedly more stable than macports and has many more packages

4528292google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
i m not mistyping anything in my input - and the programs i want to kill google-chrome and firefox are open

4528318int	boolean
pattern7		
keep in mind that depending on the use and on the system using it while a boolean takes less space because it s just a single bit depending on the implementation an int is the native word size of the hardware

4528318int	boolean
pattern7	more	
in high-level programming languages the choice between a boolean and an int is really more of code readability supportability than one of efficiency

4530221nlb	iis
pattern10	less	pattern10	less flexible	
i ve got arr in front of a client s ssrs setup right now no difficulties reported and it s 100 modern iis rather than legacy nlb which is less flexible when it comes to web-centric activities

4533720udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
udp is connection less but at the same level as tcp

4535393x86	64bit
pattern4		
and not to forget on the 32 bit machines choose x86 as target platform while on the 64bit machines choose x64

4536716hex	binary
pattern7	better	
well we typically don t do too well reading binary and hex is a better substitute for that

4541290division	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
according to stephen canon modern implementations favor taylor expansion over rational function approximation where division is much slower than multiplication

4543866hash	salt
pattern10	less	pattern10	less secure	
adding a dynamic salt to each user would mean that you will have to hit a datastore to retrieve the dynamic salt and the hash version of the user s password then you will have to perform the cpu intensive hash function in your code twice -- you are hashing a hash which is less secure and more likely to have collisions

4545595int	boolean
pattern0		
also your examples about why int would be better than boolean are kinda flawed

4546410innodb	myisam
pattern0		
in my opinion myisam use to be faster than innodb now they are pretty much the same in speed

4548313innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
i heard correct me if i am wrong that innodb is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to myisam s table locking

4548349innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
myisam is faster for certain queries and supports fulltext and spatial indexes while innodb is transactional and more concurrent

4548419gson	jackson
pattern4		
so you may want to consider other libraries i would recommend jackson gson also works

4549135udp	mtu
pattern0		
note that udp packets bigger than the mtu s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip

4551201udp	tcp
pattern8		
you could get them to do a udp multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use tcp to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than udp

4552297innodb	myisam
pattern7	quicker	
while myisam can be faster for some queries innodb is usually quicker if properly tuned

4553304qlabel	qtextbrowser	qtableview	qpushbutton
pattern0		
i m trying to force the qlabel qpushbutton and qtableview marked by trailing underscores in their names be two times higher than qtextbrowser having below

4556194multiplying	add
pattern0		
a typical implementation of rand is a linear congruential generator which is nothing more than a multiplying and add of some numbers with special properties relative primeness

4559066next	except
pattern0		
in both cases you may also have to shift one or two elements off the start end of some blocks to the end start of the previous next block again at most o n 1 2 times to maintain an invariant that no two blocks differ in size by more than 1 except for the last which is used to take up slack

4561983explode	substr
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
you don t need regular expressions at all you could use explode substr is probably better but i want to show another alternative

4563182postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
i d recommend postgresql mysql or mariadb

4564596children	parent
pattern0		
i have an issue when the player is small the children combine width is greater than the parent width

4565070post	get
pattern7		
using post allows for more data to be transferred since get will append the values to the url itself

4565701qfile	qdir
pattern2		
i d highly recommend checking out qdir qfile and qprocess objects in the qt creator help or online documentation since you are using it

4566361django	web2py
pattern7		
as i understand it web2py supports gae better out of the box than django

4566361django	web2py
pattern4		
personally i prefer web2py because i found myself fighting against the framework more when i used django eg can t write python code in django templates

4568989integer	unsigned
pattern7	type rank greater	
unsigned integer type has rank greater

4569112min	max
pattern4		
select min tran_date + generate_series 0 max tran_date - min tran_date as some_date

4569560union	distinct
pattern4		
select distinct cola from tab1 union

4569560union	distinct
pattern4		
select distinct cola from tab2 union

4571666try-catch	exception-handling
pattern7		
will hide the exception-handling and since dealing with exception-handling is heavier compared to a simple if t why isn t the normal new t not considered less good practice considering we will have to use try-catch to check if a simple allocation succeeded and if we don t just watch the program die

4572424int	chars
pattern0		
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars

4575558nemerle	boo
pattern8		
i read somewhere that nemerle s macro service is more powerful than boo s

4576044allegro	sdl
pattern4		
i recommend sdl small probably exactly what you need allegro similar or qt largeish

4576681codeigniter	cakephp
pattern4		
you need to compare php and ruby or compare codeigniter cakephp etc php frameworks to rails

4577139innodb	myisam
pattern4		
you don t choose innodb or myisam on a database level but instead on a table level

4577824nginx	lighttpd	g-wan	lighttpd
pattern0		
even lighttpd or nginx with natively pre-compiled c++ is slower than g-wan s c scripts

4579113google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	quicker	
a very quick test suggests that the difference is probably negligible in google-chrome but that firefox is substantially quicker with indexof for short strings at least

4581181sorting	filtering
pattern7	less	
the filtering on about 10 000 rows of data and sorting all happens in less than 50 milliseconds

4582514gitolite	gitosis
pattern0		
gitolite is maintained has a dozen features more than gitosis and the author actually responds to emails

4586323versioning	upgrade
pattern10		pattern10		
when later i upgrade to versioning c of my software i have to test the upgrade paths from a- c as well as b- c versioning n+1 requires n+1 more test cases than versioning n did

4586347atof	strtod
pattern0		
the second form is recommended for newer code as atof is deprecated in favor of strtod .

4587140accessor	properties
pattern7	slower	
note that i m caching the length value as the array s length properties is actually an accessor which is marginally slower than an internal variable

4587918lisp	scheme
pattern7		
that said it is a scheme which has fewer batteries included as compared to common lisp

4587918lisp	scheme
pattern7		pattern0		
scheme has fewer libraries than common lisp

4587918lisp	scheme
pattern7		
however gambit scheme has smoother access to c c++ code libraries which far outnumber common lisp s libraries

4589384integer	unsigned
pattern7	type greater	
remember that although the width of an unsigned integer type is equal to the amount of value bits the width of a signed integer type is one greater â 6.2.6.2 6

4589555clang	llvm
pattern7	more	
essentially there s no need for gcc any more llvm + clang is more than enough

4590274kerberos	ntlm
pattern4		
prefer kerberos spnego instead of ntlm

4591554versioning	upgrade
pattern7		
this way the upgrade rule detects older versioning and shows a custom dialog if it does

4594163post	get
pattern0		
this would make things considerably easier as the android library has native support for json serialization and making http get requests to restful urls is much simpler than http post requests it s not a huge deal but just less stuff you have to worry about

4599528rsa	dsa
pattern8		
use dsa it tends to be more compact than rsa

4607168width	height
pattern10	info farther	pattern10	info farther	
as some height width info is farther out in the header

4608126rss	feed
pattern0		
is there any way of better dealing with large rss feed

4610027wtforms	formencode
pattern4		pattern7		
i also recommend wtforms it s much easier to use than formencode and have builtin sqlalchemy extensions

4612392cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
pattern4		
well i just suggest before you make your choice and pick svn or cvs or perforce or god forbid tfs carefully consider mercurial as well

4617930irrlicht	ogre3d
pattern8		
ogre3d seems to be more mature than irrlicht judging by the amount of applications and games that is

4620799int	chars
pattern2		
what it does it loops through the chars using int pointers and compares them as int 4byte at a time

4620872bluetooth	usb
pattern7	connector more	
wifi and bluetooth aren t fast enough for a smooth framerate but the data transfer speed across the usb connector is more than enough up to 480 megabytes second

4623212dictionary	map
pattern10	constructor more	pattern10	constructor more canonical	
generator expressions are generally preferred to map and using the dictionary constructor is more canonical than dict.fromkeys

4623300dojo	dwr
pattern0		
they merged with dojo which in my opinion is a better choice than dwr

4624172phpunit	simpletest
pattern7		
simpletest is slightly easier to grasp but phpunit is the best in my opinion at least so if you want to start learning and using a framework start with the one you re going to use when you ll be a master in tdd

4624577pylons	pyramid
pattern4		
i d recommend pylons pyramid because it s in python and because i agree with the design decisions and thirdly because you can run it on google app engine as well as on other servers

4624837division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		
an addition is faster than a division and a multiplication

4625909phpunit	simpletest
pattern7		
subjective phpunit provides much nicer code coverage reports than simpletest

4628751clang	llvm
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	frontend more	pattern10	frontend more accurate	
llvm compiles code faster than gcc may create code that runs faster and the clang frontend provides more accurate error messages than gcc â so there are definitely reasons for switching

4628880hash	md5
pattern4		
one wonderful way you can check is to compare md5 hash

4628975httphandler	httpmodule
pattern0		
you can have only one httphandler but can plug in more than one httpmodule to examine and handle the requests

4630832hibernate	jdbi
pattern0		
other useful pieces would be jdbi for database access much simpler than hibernate or other full orms async-httpclient for doing calls to other web services

4631310atoi	atof	strtol	atof	strtol	atoi
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10

4632599rss	feed
pattern0		
if i am parsing an rss feed with php and xml how can i parse more than one feed using one fopen statement

4634474google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
firefox generates boxes containing the 4 hex digits of the missing character for the missing symbols but google-chrome just generates empty boxes - i prefer firefox s technique

4635390folder	directory
pattern4		
if you wish to know where those files are actually stored so you can edit them with your favorite ftp editor rather than through joomla login to your home directory with ftp or sftp select the folder templates then the template folder name then edit index.php to edit your html or select folder css and edit template.css usually the default name to edit your css

4636226int	chars	tinyint	varchar
pattern2		
tinyint or int for that purpose is indexed faster and gives better performance in sort or selects than varchar or chars

4638324ati	nvidia
pattern4		
just counting question tags on this forum cuda outperforms opencl 3 1 and nvidia outperforms ati 15 1 and there s no tag for ati-stream at all

4639196perforce	svn
pattern4		
no personal experience but i havenâ t yet spoken to a dev that has used both perforce and svn who didnâ t prefer perforce

4640692for-loop	loops
pattern7	more	
frankly if you need to increment decrement a for-loop makes sense if you don t know the bounds and there is no real increment decrement a while loops makes more sense

4640822jsf	wicket
pattern10		pattern10		
i won t go into the discussion whether wicket or jsf is better this is mostly a religious battle anyway but due to the popularity of jsf there are simply more people experienced with it and there is a large community offering many things for jsf like component libraries and extensions

4641486setinterval	settimeout
pattern7	easier	
you can use setinterval instead but for most animations settimeout is easier to control and more importantly.

4647174opencart	magento
pattern0		
i d have to say i d personally go for either prestashop or cscart as they do have a lot more features than opencart and at the same time also don t cost anywhere near magento to setup and run

4652609int	chars
pattern10		pattern10		
on most machines int is faster than short chars so there s not much to think about there

4654569cpython	pypy
pattern4		
shed skin becomes fastest pypy surpasses cpython

4656716min	max
pattern0		
each time you encounter a number x higher than min a b and not equal to max a b your a and b get the values max a b and x

4657121public	protected	modifiers	sealed
pattern2		
in scala you can choose between public access public package-private access with inheritance package-private access without inheritance class-private access private object-private access inheritance access protected access whatever you may call it and additionally you have some kind of file-private access modifiers sealed

4660742fullcalendar	jquery-week-calendar
pattern7		pattern7	bigger	
in some ways the jquery-week-calendar has more features at the moment but fullcalendar has a bigger following and is closing the gap on features

4661302margin	text-align
pattern7	newer	
the text-align center is for old ie6 whereas margin works for newer browsers

4662203next	except
pattern4		
you d use a similar pattern for ignoring all lines after a given line match except you wouldn t have to process any more lines so instead of using next you d use last

4663977post	get
pattern0		pattern0		
it s much more than post get etc

4664434cobertura	checkstyle	ant	cruisecontrol
pattern3		
if you are interested in improving your coding standards and build systems then i highly recommend using ant junit cobertura checkstyle and findbugs together with a continuous integration server hudson or cruisecontrol and a version control system git

4665391union	distinct
pattern4		
the optimizer may not select this mqt if you still issue select distinct against the union all view so you may need to query the mqt or a view defined on top of it directly

4667116width	height
pattern0		
you can change the width and height attributes on the referenced svg if they are bigger than the width and height on the iframe element you should get scrollbars

4668868shadowbox	lightbox
pattern4		
for a lightbox effect i would recommend shadowbox and it s simple enough to use.

4670846prefuse	jung
pattern0		pattern7		
somehow the layout algorithms in prefuse seem to display a better layout than in jung rendering is also better i think though most of the layout algorithms in prefuse are based on jung implementation

4672239min	max
pattern4		
select min zonemin max zonemin from plant

4674246acs	adfs
pattern0		
it seems possible to have adfs as the ip-sts send an assertion to more than 1 acs url based upon the acs url or acs index in the authnrequest as long as they are listed in the relaying party trust endpoints list

4674677pull	push
pattern0		
tortoise now has an option push new branch that may be safer than force pull or push

4676830octal	decimal
pattern10		pattern10		
bitshifts just go easier with hexadecimal than decimal and is often more convenient to read than octal

4676970mvp	presenter
pattern7		pattern0		
mvp offers greater seperation as your presenter have no knowledge of web centric concepts

4680070width	height
pattern0		
my problem is that an image larger than the width or height of the screen gets squeezed out of proportion in order to fit

4681536hide	show
pattern4		
when you need to switch back to a select hide disable the input remove the id attribute and restore it to the select which you then show and enable

4690184maven	pom.xml
pattern4		
i could deactivate this in the build path and add each corresponding dependency in my pom.xml but i m afraid this would lead maven to deploy them again in my webapp web-inf libs

4696822inherited	properties
pattern10	more	pattern10	more flexibility	
this allows me to keep all of my models from having to inherited from a base class that has a messages properties and gives me more flexibility

4699953fiddler	charles
pattern3		
i recommend downloading fiddler or charles and using that to determine what the server response was

4701184udp	tcp
pattern0		
you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp

4702996jdom	dom4j	jdom	xerces	dom4j	xerces
pattern4		
it compares jdom dom4j exml xpp crimson and xerces

4710605trac	bugzilla
pattern10	better	
if you really want something with php then i guess bugzilla but imho trac is better

4716663pop-up	dialog
pattern4		
when a user clicks on the browse button which is part of the control the control displays a file select pop-up dialog box

4716670int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
the max size of an int is much larger than a chars so your cast may truncate the value

4717381jobs	cron
pattern3		
then run a cron job that kills pending jobs that have been running for a certain amount of time or try to reprocess them

4724125return-value-optimization	nrvo
pattern0		
for instance for this really_trivial class i just assume that move semantics cannot offer anything more than return-value-optimization and nrvo already does when copying around instances of it

4725870textmate	aptana
pattern10		pattern10		
in studio 3 much of this sort of functionality is still coming as aptana is going more of a textmate bundle route for a great deal of their features which i think is really cool

4726327width	height
pattern0		
i m trying to set the dialog to be 180px less than the height and width of the screen.

4726884post	get
pattern4		
can i tell sinatra that i want to use get and not have it implicitly select post

4727430passenger	webrick
pattern0		
phusion passenger is the de facto apache mod and yes it s better than webrick which is really only good for tiny sites or testing

4727889post	get
pattern4		
post better because codeigniter was written to favor post requests over get requests

4731333fink	homebrew
pattern4		
others prefer fink or the newer homebrew

4732381hash	salt
pattern10		pattern10		
prepending a salt is also more powerful than directly setting the seed values because in addition to changing the internal state of the hash if the salt is not a multiple of the digest block size then it can also perturb the alignment with which the input is fed into the hash function

4738784umbraco	dotnetnuke
pattern7	smaller	
while dotnetnuke is a much bigger market it seems to be crowded with a lot of competition versus umbraco which is smaller but it looks like it lacks modules in certain categories

4739146phpmyadmin	mysql-workbench
pattern10		pattern10		
i think you should install phpmyadmin on your server this will allow you to access your database from work school cafe etc mysql-workbench is more advanced and gives you more features so you can deal with changing the structure and editing any rows columns relations and much more look at phpmyadmin s features it has most if not all

4739149apache	nginx
pattern4		
i switched from ms-centric solutions about a year and a half ago and now i m hosting all of my websites and web projects on linux mono apache mysql based virtual servers i was originally using nginx instead of apache but mono-fastcgi-server was randomly causing thrashing so i choose apache as a web server

4739360mayavi	matplotlib
pattern7		pattern10	more	pattern10	more professional	
mayavi makes it easier to visualize the data but matplotlib looks more professional

4741419outputstream	inputstream
pattern7	more	
when i want to write the full contents of a file into an outputstream i usually allocate a buffer as a then make a for-loop to read data from the file s inputstream into the buffer and write the buffer contents into the outputstream until the inputstream has no more bytes available

4745227postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
what is more common is inserting small chunks of data from different connections simultaneously in this case postgresql uses row-level locking - a feature not supported by the default mysql table type which theoretically at least should cause it to outperform mysql

4747099innodb	myisam
pattern0		
innodb table is a bit slower than myisam tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system

4752317punctuation	words
pattern7	longer	
note there are some cases you will have to handle here you may have to split at punctuation characters and hyphens and you may have to cope with a single words that is longer than the formatting width

4753405public	protected

4757905multiplying	add	multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
pattern0		
in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

4757909addition	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		
but in many cases addition is faster than multiplication

4771738client-side	server-side
pattern7	code cleaner	
to that extent i had to make a few changes to my server-side presentation layer but as a result i think my client-side code is cleaner and more focused on processing actual user events

4775203quicksort	heapsort
pattern0		
if i do heapsort i can create the stack while i m sorting but would this be faster than a quicksort and then build the stack afterwords

4778024google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	more	pattern10	more reachable	
the advantage that you have is that unlike upgrading an operating system upgrading from ie7 to google-chrome 8 or firefox 3.6 is a more reachable goal for the average user of your app especially if you provide a link and upgrade instructions

4778449boost	stl
pattern7		
as for not reinventing the wheel like many have said already make sure to first explore the possibilities in the standard template library stl which is much richer than you might think and then look at boost www.boost.org which has libraries for a lot of diverse purposes and they are extremely high quality and some are just works of art like spirit proto lambda and mpl

4778485awt	swing
pattern10	more	pattern10	more robust	
i suggest if possible that you not code in awt but rather code with swing which is much more robust and flexible

4779328groovy	gsp
pattern4		
if i had to recommend something that i would believe would fit you perfectly i d recommend gsp on top of spring mvc using plain java for backend stuff and such but this combination doesn t actually even exist since gsp is the view part of grails a groovy based web application framework

4785808union	distinct
pattern4		
by default union only grabs distinct values therefore your exact result

4788412cos	sin
pattern0		pattern0		
if it s faster than sin cos then you can use the identity

4791130children	parent
pattern0		
manytoone if you plan to have a tree as a parent can have more than one children

4792970width	height
pattern7		pattern7		
essentially what this does is check whether your image view s width height is smaller that the screen s width height and if so create an inset of half the screen s width height you could probably make this larger if you want the image to go out of the screen bounds

4794034hash	md5
pattern4		
do you know of a simple way to have a snapshot of the timestamps and md5 hash of my source files and then for every file of which the timestamp changed compare md5 and rollback timestamp modification if md5 has not changed

4798262int	chars

button height is higher than it s width

4798429width	height
pattern7		
the button height is higher than it s width go to step 2

4798429width	height
pattern7		
if the button contents width is higher than it s height then the binding will force it s width lower

4798601keydown	keyup

while ant is cool maven is cooler

4817661width	height
pattern0		
then since width of your image is greater than height multiply the original width and height by 250 498

4819185quicksort	mergesort
pattern0		
from what i ve read i was expecting quicksort to be faster than mergesort but on my code it is not so i assume there must be a problem with my quicksort algorithm

4819756quicksort	mergesort
pattern10		pattern10		
technically mergesort has a better time-behavior î nlogn worst and average cases than quicksort î n 2 worst case î nlogn average case

4819756quicksort	mergesort
pattern4		
so it is quite possible to find inputs for which mergesort outperforms quicksort

4820514mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern4		
i prefer mouseenter docs and mouseleave docs in this situation as it behaves better when hovering over children

4822877int	boolean
pattern8		
they are much more type-safe than int strings or sets of boolean flags

4823744swt	swing
pattern0		
wpf .net represents more functionality than straight swing or swt but the eclipse netbeans spring rcp projects provide a much more comprehensive foundation for complex and modular gui applications

4832591rss	feed
pattern10		pattern10		
the specification of atom feed offers more value than the rss one with internationalization content types and other things and every modern feed reader supports it

4833700width	height
pattern7		pattern7		
1 the timagelist s height or width property is less than 1 or the height property is greater than 32768 when the timagelist is initially created via the createsize constructor there are no such limitations imposed by the height and width property setters

4834231hash	salt
pattern10		pattern10		
you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique salt is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the hash over username

4834734qmainwindow	qwidget
pattern4		
should i choose qmainwindow or qwidget for this project

4835736awt	swing	swt	swing
pattern4		pattern2		
as i prefer swt over swing awt i d point you at hexapixel s swt based implementation

4835787google-chrome	safari
pattern0		
safari will display fonts without a specified size significantly smaller than in google-chrome

4836689children	parent
pattern0		
then children have one more depth than their parent and children s path starts with the parent path

4837705int	chars
pattern7		
for or int which sounds a simpler case and chars could have been both implemented as member operators or as non-member free operators

4837868inline	inlining
pattern0		
as pointed out you cannot inline which is another speed trick but inlining on the if-then-else tree doesnt necessarily make it faster than without inlining and is generall not as fast as the function pointer

4838043int	chars
pattern7		
to base and the meaning of main changes - it calls base f because int is a better match for chars - it s an int promotion rather than a standard conversion

4839812post	get	post	put	put	get

for example try hiding a dom of of 200+ children in google-chrome vs safari vs firefox you will notice google-chrome takes 20+ sec safari takes 5+ seconds firefox takes less than 1 second

4841806umbraco	dotnetnuke
pattern8		
i also had good result with umbraco cms it s a bit more lean than dotnetnuke but not as user friendly and definitely not as popular

4843183spaces	delimiter
pattern4		
if the values are delimiter by several spaces an or in unconsistent way you can match delimiter with regular expression

4849144int	chars
pattern4		
instantiate a random int number generator and use it to pick chars from the string representing the text

4850967swift	objective-c
pattern7		pattern7		
download xcode free and learn objective-c or swift swift is easier to learn than objective-c

4853850vaadin	wicket
pattern7		pattern0		
wicket probably has more resources than vaadin

4853850vaadin	wicket
pattern0		
this is only a guess and is not based on actual performance testing probably wicket will be doing better than vaadin

4853900mp3	ogg
pattern2		
if you ask people to compare between mp3 aac m4a mp4 and ogg - they will give you different answers

4854101nunit	mstest
pattern4		
we did all the above with horrible mstest but you could use any testing framework i recommend nunit

4865274udp	tcp
pattern4		
on most embedded systems i ve worked with using tcp several different stacks udp is lighter-weight outperforms tcp in terms of code size throughput

4865721vaadin	wicket
pattern0		
i would say vaadin would be easier over wicket as the default ui elements look really good

4866556post	get
pattern8		
you d basically need a set of procedures to act as controllers - parsing vars more likely as get post cookie performing any data lookup building + filling the model and then another set of procedures that at as views - taking what s in the model and rendering it for the user

4868335memset	malloc
pattern7		
it requests memory from the os kernel but the request is not satisfied until the memory is written to with memset . this allows for greater efficiency in the system s memory management but it can result in misleading malloc behaviour

4869611hash	md5
pattern4		
my script compares 2 source trees creates a map of possible changed files compares md5 hash and creates a diff-package

4872117superclass	subclassing
pattern10		pattern10		
the fact that the subclassing is more selective only actually writes about what it writes is new functionality especially in light of the fact that the superclass promises nothing

4874079postgresql	mysql
pattern7	schemas easier	
no cross-database queries if you need something like that mapping mysql databases to postgresql schemas is probably easier

4876826hash	salt
pattern4		
once you add a salt into the mix it becomes practically impossible to compare hash

4878834querypath	phpquery
pattern0		
it s easier with phpquery or querypath

4879080post	get
pattern4		
use json for returning data but prefer get post variables for client- server communication

4879699google-chrome	firefox
pattern3		
i recommend using google-chrome or firefox s firebug

4880422mouseover	mouseout
pattern4		
this posting here on stack overflow addresses the issue of ie and mouseover problems move active element loses mouseout event in internet explorer

4882069uiview	calayer
pattern0		
is calayer better than uiview in terms of performance

4884364udp	tcp
pattern8		
and there are no handshakings required udp are pretty much faster but less reliable than tcp

4885461multiplying	add
pattern7		pattern0		
with extra braces because multiplying has a higher precedence than add - assuming these are both percentage discounts

4885845screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
pattern0		
if in java code the values would be in pixels so 50px on mdpi screens will look larger than on hdpi screens

4890490integer	unsigned
pattern10		pattern10		
in case of unsigned integer division this problem does not arise which is why generally integer division works much faster for unsigned types than for signed types

4891891width	font-size
pattern7		
determine if the span s width is greater than the useable width of the input element and update the font-size accordingly

4894179openrowset	openquery
pattern4		pattern2		
i prefer openquery over openrowset given that openquery does not require the connection-string definition within the proc

4895037uicontrol	uibutton
pattern0		
sounds like you want to use some of the inherited uicontrol methods such as sendaction to forevent this offers even finer control than with uibutton

4899792google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
i built a site and the problem is google-chrome display font-size 1px bigger than firefox

4901460jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
pattern7		pattern0		
the problem is that with the code below the jlayeredpane always expands to fit the size of the jscrollpane and in the event that the jscrollpane is smaller than the jlayeredpane it does not provide the scrolling ability

4905025fiddler	charles
pattern4		
i prefer charles but others like fiddler work fine too

4907141free	malloc
pattern0		
the standard doesn t specify anything deeper than malloc and free which leaves c libraries free to implement them to work in their target environments

4910719getter	setter
pattern0		
but on the comparatively rare occasions where it happens it ll be a lot easier with the getter setter in place

4915058opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
i have the problem in firefox 3.6.13 and have tested against current versions of safari win google-chrome opera and ie where the code all works perfectly

4916041postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
postgresql is also a lot better imo than mysql and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

4916217mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
pattern3		
i prefer using powermockito with mockito but if this is not possible i have no problem with using easymock instead

4916856for-loop	loops
pattern7		
using for-loop is much simpler if you use condition as limit for breaking loops

4917802isotope	masonry
pattern0		
in its stead you can use isotope - which does filtering a lot easier than masonry

4924571ubuntu	linux
pattern7	better	
however linux pretend i said ubuntu is even better environment for ruby on rails development and it installs great in vm

4925111centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
pattern7		
one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it

4925945uilabel	uitextview
pattern0		
also consider using uilabel instead of uitextview if you don t need to edit information inside since uitextview take longer to allocate and init and are generally slower than uilabel

4926459requestfactory	gwt
pattern8		
with requestfactory you pay an up-front startup cost to accommodate more complicated systems than gwt rpc easily supports

4927035punctuation	words
pattern4		pattern2		
i would match words between words boundaries with a regex to avoid affecting punctuation or whitespace

4929144for-loop	loops
pattern7		pattern0		
the reverse while loops is generally faster than a for-loop as well

4938048pop-up	dialog
pattern4		
my problem happens when the user returns to the main screen before the confirm to purchase dialog pop-up then cancels

4938414post	get
pattern8		
get requests are no less insecure than post requests

4945992setinterval	settimeout
pattern3		
i prefer using settimeout than using setinterval

4946039folder	directory
pattern4		
without cygwin on windows you can right click on the root directory select search type .svn in search for files or folder named check type in the search options and then select folder in the drop-down menu

4947205int	chars
pattern0		
so if you know that the word will never be more than 50 chars and the offset will fit in a four byte int you can create record entries in the index file that are 54 bytes assuming ascii for the words adjust accordingly

4948393salt	md5
pattern4		
so instead of finding anything that matches md5 foo they need to find something that when added to the known salt produces md5 foo.salt which is very much harder to do

4948393hash	salt
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
hash password + salt is better but still not good enough.

4948661button	checkbox
pattern4		
the user is able to select checkbox the rows he wishes to print then clicks the print button

pattern7	less	
the above code fills black color if the source image width and height is less than 50

4952787google-chrome	firefox
pattern10		pattern10		
in ie8 and google-chrome it runs even faster than firefox in general and this slow down never happens

4952958cos	sin
pattern7	easier	
if you re after a plain parametrization using sin and cos it s way easier

4957587lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern4		
people tend to prefer lxml these days over beautifulsoup

4957786min	max
pattern4		
if i want to select min and max values from a whole table i can use this

4957786min	max
pattern4		
but how to select min and max values from just a part of a table

4957786min	max
pattern4		
i want to select min and max values from first ten rows then from second ten rows and then form the last 10

4960978coalesce	isnull
pattern10	more	pattern10	more standard	
you could also use isnull but coalesce is more standard

4967166implements	extends
pattern7	runnable better	
we can either extends thread which will implicitly implements runnable but then we can t extends any other class so implements runnable is better approch

4970153ant	maven
pattern0		
also maven projects come with a different directory structure and seems to be doing much more than what ant does in the spring source tutorial

4970153ant	maven
pattern10		pattern10		
but as i checked-out some example apps from spring source repo and it seems that maven is more preferred and powerful than ant

4973674querypath	phpquery
pattern0		
that s easier with phpquery or querypath

4973933width	height
pattern7		pattern7		
again a uiscrollview will not scroll in height width unless the contentsize property s height width is larger than its frame property height width

4975635width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if an image s height is greater than the width i want to switch to the height crop else keep the width crop

4977395getdate	dateadd

4987260bazaar	git
pattern4		
people recommend bazaar hg and git - which are the three i believe have critical mass these days - and which one fits you best is up to you to find out

4987325verilog	vhdl
pattern8		
by these numbers and only these numbers vhdl seems to be more widely-used than verilog

4989768int	double
pattern0		
i have a similar problem to this question only i am not learning generics so want a practical solution and my method is returning more than an int or a double

4994475getter	setter
pattern4		
go to generate getter and setter and click on select setter

4994806activemq	rabbitmq
pattern10	more	pattern10	more complete	
lot s of free stuff available look for anything implementing amqp for example and not limited to apache s attempt - activemq zeromq as listed above rabbitmq which is more complete than zero and even red hat are in the game with red hat messaging

4996740unsigned	short
pattern7		pattern7		pattern0		
btw on some processors unsigned short is much slower than unsigned int because the c standard requires that operations on unsigned types wrap

4999069memcached	apc
pattern10		pattern10		
apc is more an opcode caching system than a key value memory database like memcached altough it can be greatly used for both purposes

5004946octal	hex
pattern4		
html encoding strings and passing them into javascript variables can cause problems specially if you use hex codes as js i m told prefers octal

5005191bitarray	bitset
pattern0		
1 might not yet be sparse enough to make this better compared to just a plain bitarray assuming longs storing 64 bits each it doesn t take more than 2 longs to have more than one bitset on average but if the sparsity increases beyond that the space and time savings will show

5009964ubuntu	debian
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
ubuntu is far less conservative than debian so you will get closer to the bleeding edge

5010119freebsd	solaris
pattern7		
both systems have large suites of available software packages available freebsd is likely larger and there s a better chance something may have been ported to freebsd over solaris depending on the niche of the package of course

5012987kohana	yii
pattern7	easier	
depends i came from php4 and didn t really touch the level of oop needed for the php5 kohana framework i ve used classes and functions but the hmvc is a process on it s own to learn when it comes to kohana vs yii i d have to say kohana is easier to pickup

5014806children	parent
pattern4		
sub-selectors matches children of the parent match

5017248curb	httparty	typhoeus	httparty	typhoeus	curb
pattern7	everything easier	
instead of net http i can use httparty curb rest client or typhoeus which makes everything easier but i can t find any similar solutions to replace enhance net ftp

5017773int	chars
pattern2		
if you compare as int you will need to check alignment and check if count is divisible by sizeof int to compare the last bytes as chars

5019157innodb	myisam
pattern0		
i currently have myisam and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than innodb in my case but i heard that innodb has acid transactions

5019981hash	salt
pattern7	better	
putting the salt at the beginning is better than putting it at the end as more randomness at the beginning of hash is better than randomness at the end

5020686google-chrome	firefox
pattern8		
no and there won t be any time soon because google-chrome s add-on api is more restrictive than firefox

5023512superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
pattern7		
if i have a class hierarchy in which subclassing require use of more specific types than those specified in the superclass ivars is it better to declare the superclass ivar as id or to type it and then cast where necessary in the subclassing

5024166coalesce	isnull
pattern7		
sql server is probably smart enough to translate isnull into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then coalesce is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with isnull and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in isnull

5024264screens	tablet
pattern0		
there is more than one screens size in android and what fits on a qvga 2.8 screens and what fits on a 10 tablet will not be the same

5024874getdate	dateadd

grails upgrade if this grails versioning is newer than the versioning your

5032892datamapper	activerecord
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
so far the only legitimate reason i ve found to use datamapper over activerecord is that datamapper is better in terms of the single responsibility principle -- because the database rows are not the actual objects being persisted but with propel that doesn t really concern me because it s generated code anyway

5032917inline	inlining
pattern0		
early inlining is the compiler s ability to inline a function early on when it sees the call costs more than the inline

5033598width	height
pattern0		
i would expect that the output width would be 200 and the height would be something greater than the height of a single line however it produces

5035943width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if the height is greater than the width just reverse the width and height variables

5037001cvs	svn
pattern4		
you go to view- filename filters or ctrl-i and select cvs and svn directories under the local filters

5038387getter	setter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more idiomatic	
like i describe in the first paragraph use of accessor methods getter and setter is a more idiomatic approach and easier to understand for someone else using your code

5040281min	max
pattern7		pattern7		
you re comparing every value from min with every value from max until you hit a value of min that is greater than a value in max and 55 from min is greater than 22 from max so test will be set to true

5040906button	checkbox
pattern4		
add column ----- name the column || type select checkbox button image or link || give column header name

5049036button	checkbox
pattern4		
how about select checkbox and radio button

5049314disk	ram
pattern10		pattern10		
basically ram is more expensive than the disk storage

5050497libs	buildpath
pattern4		
the solution here is to export external libs from the original project configure buildpath - order and export - select libs to be exported instead of adding them to the buildpath of the test project directly

5051796width	height
pattern7		
or if you know that its max width is smaller then the width of the sprite then make it a rectangle with the max width and height of your element

5053509tunnel	packets
pattern10	more	pattern10	more difficult	
tunnel udp packets is somewhat more difficult

5056167happy	alex
pattern8		
if i don t have a grammar i ll use parsec it is more flexible powerful than happy and its more fun to work in haskell than generate code with happy and alex

5057179inline	inlining
pattern7		
the inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units but using the keyword doesn t mean the compiler has to inline the function and not using the keyword doesn t forbid the compiler from inlining the function

5058998versioning	upgrade
pattern7	smaller	
when the user wants to check for an upgrade download the version-file if the currently installed versioning is smaller than the most recent one then download the apk and install it

5060785vb6	vba
pattern7		
vba is in fact a superset of vb6 not a subset -- vba has more functionality built in than vb6 itself

5061538width	height
pattern0		
the image is placed in a correct height but the width could be bigger or smaller than the height constraints

5062597robocopy	xcopy
pattern8		
if your batch file only needs to run on windows vista or later you can use robocopy instead which is an even more powerful tool than xcopy and is now built into the operating system

5063216width	height	portrait	landscape
pattern7		pattern0		
if the height is longer than the width the screen is in portrait mode otherwise it is landscape

5064817int	chars
pattern0		
but for 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors data alignment and bulk data access is key int accesses are frequently much faster than chars accesses and long long 64 bit may be faster still for some systems

5064925setinterval	settimeout
pattern7	better	
instead initiate all the settimeout s you need for the entire animation at the same time with increasing delays in a loop and let them run their course or better yet use setinterval which is the better way of doing animations and how for instance jquery s animations work

5069628floating-point	integer
pattern10		pattern10		
generally integer math is faster than floating-point math

5069643floating-point	integer
pattern0		
historically floating-point could be much slower than integer arithmetic

5069643floating-point	integer
pattern0		
on somewhat limited processors like those in high-end cell phones floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally within an order of magnitude or better so long as there is hardware floating-point available

5069828pull	push
pattern0		
a little more pull than push style that s because there is no duplicate item.

5070199quicksort	mergesort
pattern7		pattern0		
quicksort generally runs faster than mergesort but under some circumstances it can degrade to quadratic running time

5071314int	chars
pattern0		
if chars or short happen to be smaller than int on the current platform they are implicitly promoted to int which is a major source of bugs

5076397getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
from select dateadd year -1 getdate as today aa

5080180x86	64bit
pattern4		
in practice i would like to link a 32-bit library when i choose x86 as platform but the 64bit version of it when i choose x64

5082524hash	whirlpool	hash	md5	whirlpool	md5
pattern0		
at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like whirlpool that for example is five times slower than md5 and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to md5

5085203vim	emacs
pattern4		
i suggest using the editor or visual environment variables people set those to preferred editors for programs to use ie if someone prefers emacs and can t even exit vim they won t get confused

5088054integer	unsigned
pattern7		
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

5091110int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
however chars 36 and int 10 are far away from being equal because a int 10 is much smaller than chars 36

5091110int	chars
pattern7		
this does not only mean that int consumes less space it also means that chars 36 has about 4 times more different keys

5091466webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern10	less	pattern10	less flexible	
while webclient may appear to be easier to use than httpwebrequest it is less flexible and will automatically perform it s callback on the ui thread and if you re downloading files in the background you almost certainly don t want this

5093093int	chars
pattern7		
so for example the value of the chars 3 is 3 greater than the value of 0 so when you subtract these two values you get the int 3

5093790google-chrome	safari
pattern10		pattern10		
i read somewhere that safari has more stringent requirements on cross domain scripting - it and google-chrome share the same code base

5095500int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
a narrowing conversion like int to chars if int has a larger range than chars yields some implementation-defined conversion

5099892children	parent
pattern0		
also the inner children div have to be wider than the parent div for the scrollbars to work

5104579tolower	toupper
pattern7		pattern0		
and if you have to convert to the same case to make comparisons toupper is better than tolower

5111547hide	show
pattern0		
it can be even shorter with show and hide

5112059multiplying	division
pattern7		
division typically uses more resources.â to avoid division we multiplying rather than divide

5113033disk	ram
pattern7		
for the stand of file operations writing to memory ram is always faster than writing to the file on the disk directly

5113541directx	gdi
pattern10		pattern10		
directx is way faster than gdi

5114332udp	rtp	udp	tcp	rtp	rtsp
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
http streaming servers will in most cases use tcp as their network transport rtsp servers usually offer rtp over udp which is more suited to multimedia streaming where some errors packet loss can be tolerated with the benefit of lower latency and less network overheads

5117256getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd wk datediff wk 0 getdate 0 w firstdaythisweek makes a single-column table where the column contains the pivotal date for this query being the first day of the current week using datefirst setting

5126061opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
i did one design which works for opera win firefox win + mac ie9 safari win mac ipad google-chrome win

5130551profiling	debugging
pattern4		
if you do that just go back to your project select debugging under configurations and select the appropriate developer profiling to compile with

5134831gif	png
pattern7		
also if i change all to png is not bigger and alos i am using prawn pdf outputting these images so cant use gif

5138055udp	mtu	mtu	ppp
pattern0		pattern0		
when udp data size is smaller 1452 than ppp mtu no error

5141758int	chars
pattern0		
if i remember correctly int take up less storage than chars so you should go with int

5143568swt	swing
pattern0		
probably you should start with something simpler than networking swing swt and android

5147030profiling	instrumentation
pattern4		
if you are experiencing performance issues i would highly recommend profiling with the time profiling and core animation instrumentation

5147176getter	setter
pattern0		
anemic domain is when a product or other class doesn t really implement anything more than data setter and getter - no domain behavior

5148488gnupg	gpgme
pattern3		
i would recommend calling gnupg the gnu privacy gaurd in c via gpgme

5149958interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0		
while ruby and python are both interpreted-language and operation-for-operation slower than compiled-language the reality is in executing an application only a small portion of cpu time is spent in your code and the majority is spent into the built-in libraries you call into which are often native implementations and thus are as fast as compiled code

5150147opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

5152261getdate	datepart
pattern4		
select datepart month getdate -- gets month number

5154489tunnel	vpn
pattern7		
if you absolutely must connect to a database hosted on the cellular network end i would suggest you try setting up a vpn openvpn is a good product available on many platforms or using a reverse tunnel it s simpler but you will need to setup the reverse tunnel everytime you want to access remote database

5157917strophe	smack
pattern4		
since fb support xmpp protocol u can set an xmpp chat client using lib lik smack strophe asmack etc.

5158072coalesce	isnull
pattern3		
i would recommend using coalesce function instead of the awfully named sql server-specific function isnull

5158613union	distinct
pattern4		
you can union two full sets in a subquery and then select distinct col from that

5160151width	height
pattern10	more	pattern10	more important	
i d like the height pixels back too while i m at it though the width is more important

5165338xslt	xquery
pattern7		
as dimitre says xslt is much better at this class of problem than xquery

5171988cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
pattern0		
on a system with more than one processors or processors cores you can normally assuming you do have a smp-enabled system cpu affinity doesn t prevent it expect those two processes to use both processors but you do not strictly have a guarantee

5174511google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
win firefox google-chrome

5176961uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
pattern0		
basically you are implementing a view container much simpler than uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller

5182499ienumerable	iqueryable
pattern0		
the ienumerable side of linq which works on in-memory objects that are already in the heap will almost certainly perform better than the iqueryable side which exists to be translated into a native query language like sql

5186505fgets	fgetc
pattern0		
if not multiple fgets calls will still be faster than multiple fgetc calls because the overhead of the latter will be greater

5191346ocaml	sml
pattern7	more	
more generally sml tends to be rather more elegant while ocaml has some more advanced features quirks and users

5192159width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
i m using gallery located on sd card when i pick the horizontal image width greater than height it loads the image in image view perfectly fine but the problem is with vertical image height greater than width it show the image in image view rotated on the left side or saying -90 degree from original position

5195665processors	hyperthreading
pattern0		
first step would be to investigate why a processors with hyperthreading simultaneous multithreading could lead to poorer performances than a processors without this technology

5198299wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
pattern3		
i would recommend using svcutil.exe instead of wsdl.exe

5198877swt	swing
pattern7		
swt community is smaller and it doesn t provide that many tools as swing does

5199626min	max
pattern0		
numerical algorithms that need gradients will probably do more than max and min and other complexities can come up

5199763post	get
pattern0		
other than the fact that get has one character less than post i doubt there is any performance difference

5199917inherited	properties
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
if you want to use inherited properties it works more like this

5201993facebooker2	koala
pattern0		
is fb_graph or koala gem better than facebooker2

5204325google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
in my experience google-chrome has better javascript performance than firefox

5205777children	parent
pattern0		
an item can have multiple children and can also have more than one parent

5205838google-chrome	safari
pattern4		
since both safari and google-chrome run on webkit the browser.safari actually selects google-chrome as well..i definitely do not consider this an optimal solution

5207652beanstalk	amazon-web-services
pattern4		
for generic java applications i would recommend amazon-web-services if the costs associated with beanstalk and rds are not too high

5213886ienumerable	ilist
pattern10		pattern10		
an ienumerable is less specific than an ilist

5216193width	height
pattern10		pattern10		
if the image height is less that the window height start resizing the height and remove the width property to keep the aspect ratio

5217389hide	show
pattern4		
the if statement is necessary because the tooltip function will be called with arguments such as init destroy show hide update which refer to the functions defined in the methods hash

5218029lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern0		
note that lxml is probably a better option than beautifulsoup for this kind of task nowadays for the reasons given by beautifulsoup s author

5226064width	height
pattern4		
the answer given above favors width change over height change so if you adjust the height a lot but because of mouse positioning the width also changes a bit the user will still see pretty much the same window

5226464isapi	iirf
pattern4		
i would recommend iirf ionic s isapi rewrite filter which is a rewriter for iis that unlike isapi_rewrite is completely free for the full functionality

5232782bash	zsh
pattern3		
i recommend using zsh instead of bash

5233662int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
your int is larger than your chars - you get the a value + some random data following it in memory

5233750disk	ram
pattern10	less	pattern10	less performant	
when your working set exceeds the amount of ram then it will carry on working but with noticeably degraded performance as things will then be constantly having to go to disk which is far less performant

5234430ring	hiccup	ring	enlive	enlive	hiccup
pattern4		
select the right overall web framework - clojure has quite a few already but i d strongly recommend ring - see this excellent video one ring to bind them plus either fleet or enlive or hiccup depending on your templating philosophy

5234591range	minimum
pattern0		
how about for integer values you specify a range and a predicate that specifies the value must be greater than minimum less than maximum instead

5234849coldfusion	railo
pattern7	better	
not sure why you just accepted a terribly biased answer like best solution stick with coldfusion or railo from coldfusion is just better

5235559rss	feed
pattern10		pattern10		
you d gain compatibility and durability because rss is more defined things will change less but if the feed doesn t include what you need it won t help you

5238108hide	show
pattern4		
if i select hide image requests under rules images still show up in my sessions list

5240694addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
usually multiplication has a higher precedence than addition but the grammar you have posted has the reverse that might be part of your problem

5240835min	max
pattern4		
sql_query_range select min nid max nid from node where nid 0

5240835min	max
pattern4		
sql_query_range select min nid max nid from node where nid 0

5244202kerberos	ntlm
pattern7		pattern0		
i understand that kerberos has better performance than ntlm

5244789apache	nginx
pattern0		
also nginx uses a lot less memory than apache

5246183ant	maven
pattern3		
i d recommend trying ant first and grokking it before tackling maven

5248641innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
you can also use compression on the tables to keep them smaller but innodb is vastly better than myisam at data integrity

5249804checkbox	dropdownlistfor
pattern2		
as administrator i want to create user account and based on selected role from dropdownlistfor refresh form to select by checkbox specific accesses bool connected with role

5252563int	boolean
pattern8		
they are much more type-safe than int strings or sets of boolean

5253082children	parent
pattern0		
and since the children in your home block start their own stacking context one level higher than the parent your home li can never be above the items inside it

5260641post	get
pattern7	safer	
of course as a general rule it s highly recommended to wrap your ajax calls in a unified method that concatenates the csrf token to the request be it get or post although post is safer and much more correct from architectural perspective so when you make ajax calls you focus on the business input values only and don t need to worry about csrf

5262420google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
if you want to inspect elements i recommend google-chrome and it s built in console i like it much better then firefox + firebug

5262635postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
just select mysql from the dropdown instead of postgresql

5263165spaces	delimiter
pattern0		
moreover i cannot use more than 2 spaces as a delimiter when using sed since sometimes there would be only one spaces between the item name and the second column like in the last line in the example between c and 5

5265916ecobertura	eclemma
pattern7		
the eclemma plugin is nicer and more mature then ecobertura

5268095int	chars
pattern0		
meanwhile chars can be more than a chars -- you can also treat it as an int type

5269766multiplying	subtract
pattern0		
similarly if you skip the five first elements your loop takes o n-5 time but that too is the same as o n because adding or subtract a constant is even weaker than multiplying by a constant

5271450hazelcast	terracotta
pattern7		
we started with ehcache terracotta server array cause it s well-known backed by terracotta and has bigger community support than hazelcast

5281653min	max
pattern4		
another option would be to just select max year min year to find out the first and second year

5282164post	get
pattern7	easier	
if your form is meant to create modify data you ll use post instead of get but get is easier to test

5285838id3v2	id3-tag
pattern7	utility more	
i simply want to get the genre id3-tag of an mp3 file but the id3v2 utility returns more information than i require and i don t understand what this data represents

5287145post	get
pattern0		
using post prevents this particular attack but is this actually any more secure than using get

5291159innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
oh and just incase you were thinking innodb is slower than myisam - the myisam implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts

5299127google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
but i guess google-chrome i have version 10 should be much faster than firefox 3.6

5302408db4o	eloquera
pattern7		pattern0		
i think that eloquera www.eloquera.com is better than db4o and additionally has better licensing

5302507fossil	git
pattern0		
as the comments already mention if you are starting out with version control you would be well advised to choose a newer system than rcs git mercurial fossil subversion ...

5303425quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	in-place	mergesort	heapsort	heapsort	in-place
pattern2		
of course you just asked for advice about sorting on stack overflow so i feel compelled to ask you if you need an in-place sort what kind of big-o performance you re looking for and then ask you to choose between quicksort introsort heapsort mergesort and stoogesort for what will work best for you

5304423range	min	range	max	min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
ie the range includes min but excludes max and values greater than max or less than min wrap around in a circle

5304423min	max
pattern0		
note that the min param can be assumed to be always numerically less than max

5305482sorting	grouping
pattern4		
then for each grouping you have double click the grouping select sorting and then add as many sorting fields as you need for the info contained at that grouping level

5306026profiling	debugging
pattern4		
then select profiling item on the sidebar then make sure build configuration is set to debugging

5308176getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd dd datediff dy 0 getdate -1

5308947post	get
pattern0		
though all data is usually unsafe basically user data sessions are safer than the post or get or cookie or simply request and some server variables since you set it yourself

5309949voip	sip
pattern0		
almost all sip voip providers allow you to forward calls from an attached did telephone number to more than one sip device so your request could be satisfied by a basic account on your friendly neighbourhood voip provider

5309957redmine	trac
pattern0		
redmine handles multiple projects and sub projects far nicer than trac

5314740folder	directory
pattern7	older	
in 1 directory it removes folder older than 30 days and the other removes files older than 30 days

5316089addclass	removeclass
pattern4		
if you want to toggle css style easily i recommend addclass removeclass or toggleclass

5318157cpython	pypy
pattern0		
pypy s jit can make python code execute much faster than cpython

5318450int	chars
pattern0		
first int arithmetic is never performed with operands smaller than int so in the case of both the short and the signed chars operands are promoted to int the two int values are multiplied and then the result is an int

5324691chameleon	jinja2
pattern7		pattern0		
template engines are rarely the cause of performance problems even if chameleon is slightly faster than jinja2 i doubt the effort of learning a new template language etc

5327862hide	show
pattern0		pattern0		
is there a better function than show hide which looks as nice as the accordion does

5327986jquery	scriptaculous
pattern0		
i ended up using scriptaculous for most of my animations simply because it provides smoother animations and more configurable than what jquery ui provides

5327986jquery	scriptaculous
pattern10	more	
scriptaculous can do what jquery provides plus more

5328381subtraction	addition
pattern0		
of course the relative overhead will be smaller for functions that do more work than one addition and one subtraction per iteration

5329644swt	swing
pattern7		
so in my view using swing is simply easier unless you have more experience in swt

5336489carrierwave	paperclip
pattern4		
i recommend paperclip or carrierwave

5340394clang	llvm
pattern4		
try to grab top-of-tree llvm llvm-gcc which is deprecated by now btw and try to reproduce the issue or alternatively grab clang

5340641primes	modulus
pattern7	larger	
hypothesis the first n powers of two each have a different modulus when divided by p where p is the smallest primes that is larger than n

5341671google-chrome	firefox
pattern3		
i would recommend using firefox or google-chrome with the web developer toolbar to make html css validation easier

5343779xfce	gnome
pattern4		
open suse lets you select xfce as your desktop environment and xubuntu is an ubuntu variant that uses xfce instead of gnome

5343779xfce	gnome
pattern7		pattern0		
you might want to look at one of these options if you re running in a vm since xfce is slightly lighter weight than gnome although not all that much lighter these days

5347445trie	tree
pattern10		pattern10		
recursive is usually used for traversal and binary search tree but this tree is more similar to trie of only 2 character in alphabet

5348842ftp	telnet
pattern0		pattern0		
http is not the internet any more than ftp telnet or world of warcraft are the internet

5349641width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if the width is greater than the height of an individual page add a dictionary entry to that page and explicitly set it s rotation

5351338datamapper	activerecord
pattern7		pattern0		
datamapper idea is definitely better than activerecord

5351338datamapper	activerecord
pattern10		pattern10		
datamapper is much smarter then activerecord

5352064strftime	strtotime
pattern0		
this is better than strtotime and strftime because it does not try to guess what is the format of the date but rather use the date format you provide

5352175width	height
pattern7		pattern7	greater	
and if the image s height is greater than maxheight or the width is greater than maxwidth i d like to proportionally resize the image so that it fits in maxwidth x maxheight

5353513disk	ram
pattern0		
my assumption in the question above is that disk is as fast as ram or faster than ram

5353574disk	ram
pattern0		
because disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

5354083serializable	deserialization
pattern0		
however i can t tell you right now if this cost is higher than the serializable and deserialization cost

5354805notepad++	gedit
pattern4		
i vastly prefer gedit + gnometerminal + nautilus filezilla to the sluggish cygwin + console2 + notepad++ setup i have in windows7

5357102gmail	hotmail
pattern2		
the kind of mail server that could compete with gmail and hotmail in a near futur - say two years.

5358242visualvm	yourkit
pattern4		
i prefer yourkit which costs but there s visualvm which is free

5358250getter	setter
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
a boilerplate setter getter is no better than a public member

5360306openmpi	mpich
pattern2		
which benchmark program should i pick to compare between mpich and openmpi implementations

5365998client-side	server-side
pattern10		pattern10		
as a general rule of thumb at least in security you should trust no user so i think it would be the wise choice to validate the data client-side it s also faster and then if the first validation passed validate it server-side to double-check or to have a safety net if the user has javascript turned off something you don t see that often

5372482scheme	racket
pattern8		
there are various object systems you can load as libraries when you want to do oop but integration with existing code heavily depends on the scheme dialect and its surrounding culture chicken scheme seems to be more object-oriented than racket for instance

5372482scheme	racket
pattern10	more	pattern10	more static	
mit scheme is known for strong interactivitiy support while plt racket feels much more static

5372482lisp	scheme
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
overall common lisp is much more uniform than scheme and more radical language experiments if done at all are usually embedded as a portable library rather than defining a whole new language dialect

5375742post	get
pattern0		
the usual wait time of the post is not too long not too larger than get so i don t think that should be an issue and post always gets back with a 200

5375747vim	emacs
pattern4		
i can choose vim or emacs

5375848google-chrome	firefox
pattern10		pattern10		
maybe google-chrome is more lenient when it comes to illegal characters in the url than firefox or something like that

5377967exponent	modulo
pattern7		pattern0		pattern7		
i must also add that designing the rsa key so that the private exponent is substantially shorter than the modulo to speed up operations is a security risk if the exponent is smaller than 29 of the modulo length then the key can be cracked

5381240jsf	wicket
pattern0		
i m in the hate it part so anything i said is biased plus in our test prototypes developing in wicket was faster than jsf

5384469ready	each
pattern7	more	
that way each thread can pick up a link when it s ready which makes more sense than partitioning in advance

5384879jmonkeyengine	ardor3d
pattern4		
for 3d gui s i recommend ardor3d or its parent jmonkeyengine

5387860symfony	kohana	codeigniter	kohana
pattern8		pattern8		
the documentation sucks but it s very lightweight there s a good community even on so it s more simple than symfony and more powerful than codeigniter the first version of kohana was based on codeigniter

5388425boost	stl
pattern3		
most people recommend using boost or stl but there are cases where this is not possible on operating system development embedded systems with limited resources etc.

5398982tcplistener	tcpclient
pattern2		
i need to choose between tcplistener tcpclient and wcf

5400275hash	md5
pattern4		
the faster the better as this function will get called roughly 20 billion times during the execution of the program i m running it is the performance-critical code at the moment. it doesn t need to be written in c it really just needs to outperform md5 somewhere in the realm of the built-in hash for strings

5400792postgresql	mysql
pattern0		pattern0		
sqlite is very fast in many trivial cases it performs faster than mysql postgresql or firebird and supports a good subset of sql-92 syntax but there is extra overhead to populate the data-set sqlite db and building any indices etc

5401619getter	setter
pattern0		
this way is better than having getter and setter in base of performance not to have reduntant code of two methods getter and setter

5401758google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
request status is 0 when i chose google-chrome if i choose firefox then another error occurred the error obviously tell me a php scripts dose not work well but it seems really well

5402018swt	swing
pattern7	more	
into swing application i like to avoid using it with swt but is its more easier its ok

5403437rank	max
pattern4		
select rank of first second record and highest max rank in table which offhand will probably require a union

5406811put	get
pattern2		
you mustn t change the relevant values within a key after adding it to a map - it will potentially cause false positives and even false negatives you could use the same key reference you used in put and not find a match with get if you ve made a change which affects the hash code for example

5409041google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	broader	
the next text is an overlay between firefox und google-chrome - firefox is broader

5409181width	height
pattern4		
using this parameter selects the mode that most closely matches width and height values even if doing so adversely affects performance by reducing the frame rate

5409906lwjgl	jogl
pattern7	better	
i think lwjgl has a implementation too but the jogl one is better

5418052mockito	jmockit
pattern0		
comparison between mockito vs jmockit - why is mockito voted better than jmockit

5422253post	get
pattern2		
replace match with post or get if you only want one specific http verb

5422279invokelater	invokeandwait
pattern10	better	
you can simply create a new thread runnable or futuretask to run on an executor and call invokeandwait only when necessary to update components but if you can get away with it invokelater is better

5422525children	parent
pattern0		
you need to just change the siftdown function so that the parent is always the smaller than the children

5423061udp	tcp
pattern0		
tcp is subject to higher latencies than udp as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations

5428091screens	hdpi
pattern0		
edit - now that i think about it i m not sure why your image would appear smaller unless your screens had a greater dpi than hdpi

5430944superclass	subclassing
pattern7		
first of all wouldn t that relate to it returning an object that is a superclass which contains less data than requested because a superclass is not a subclassing but a subclassing is a superclass

5430989width	height
pattern0		
i brute forced it a bit with forcing the height of the box to always be larger than the width

5431498inline	inlining
pattern10		pattern10		
templates will be inline in the standard meaning of inline which is more related to the one definition rule than to actual code inlining

5431991udp	tcp
pattern8		
tcp is certainly going to be more reliable than udp since udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive

5436282integer	unsigned

5463735strcpy	strncpy
pattern0		
strcpy could be better replaced by strncpy which does some bound checking

5465769width	height
pattern0		
if you look at your code you always use i + - 1 width + j + - 1 so everything will be ok for the lines where i is less than the height but everything else is going to be out of range

5465976salt	md5
pattern4		
select md5 concat id salt from table where .

5467603width	height

the key to it all is that box-sizing border-box is less susceptible to browser differences in padding and border calculations on form inputs

5483704subclass	abstract-class
pattern7	nothing more	
write the application differently - create a matching interface and write the service provider implementation against it testing that and also write a minimal subclass of the abstract-class that does nothing more than forward calls to the interface

5484378width	height
pattern0		
what i need is for the wrap1 to only be if they make it smaller than the width of the content then it automatically increases the height of the div so it doesnt go outside the wrap1 div at present it is forcing it down onto second line correctly but div height is a wrong

5485831udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
also note that it is easy to implement your own stack on top of udp that performs worse than tcp

5487679imagemagick	graphicsmagick

graphicsmagick provides more extensive api documentation than imagemagick

5489259memcpy	memmove
pattern4		
use a copy operation to correctly copy the contents rather than assign the addresses as suggested use std copy - or others such as memcpy prefer memmove - it s a little slower but is well defined for overlapping blocks etc.

5489922for-loop	arrays
pattern7	easier	
also for printing arrays i recomend to use the enhanced for-loop it is easier

5491094mdx	dax
pattern7	more	
using the powerpivot excel 2010 addin i believe its possible to effectively create this kind of function using dax and mdx has more built-in functions such as median

5491589children	parent
pattern0		
if your tree is not binary that is a node can have more than 2 children it might be worthwhile to introduce a virtual parent node that has all the real roots as its child nodes

5492028for-loop	loops
pattern7	better	
whether writing the for-loop like that is a good idea or why is it not just using the erase-remove idiom are different issues as a matter of fact the previous loops is arguably better than erase-remove for a list the concrete situation is that the semantics have changed and because the type is syntactically compatible with the previous one the compiler will not notice that the code is wrong it will not point you to that function and chances are that you will not review rewrite it

5493317range	minimum
pattern7	greater	
for each low end of the range find the minimum high end of a range that is greater than or equal to the low end or in sql

5494046width	height

5537484coalesce	isnull
pattern8		
- coalesce should be more portable than isnull

5537586width	height
pattern7		
the problem is that layer.bounds still returns 200x200 for the layer but because of the perspective transformation the actual visible width is less and the height more than 200

5538394uiview	calayer
pattern0		
i am using calayer s because as suggested in documentation calayer s are lighter than uiview and i have hundreds of them

5539496addition	multiplication

5561233firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	less	pattern10	less testing	
if you are trying to support all users on all browsers then you will certainly need to do testing on those browsers although actively developing on those browsers may not be necessary whereas if you only need to support webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari or webkit-based browsers and firefox that is less testing that you need to do

5561668udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
so assess the situation the development cost of a udp transport is higher to significantly higher than tcp and to some degree you are re-inventing tcp

5562628postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
i prefer postgresql over mysql any time

5563623implements	extends
pattern4		
if you need to use columns that show images a lot i recommend implements a custom imagecolumn that extends mx advanceddatagridcolumn has some kind of imagefunction as property and uses a custom itemrenderer which would use the column s imagefunction to show the appropriate image

5564259for-loop	loops
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
it works as i want but it looks a bit messy and i ve read that sometimes breaking from an outer for-loop within a .each loops is more neatly achieved with javascript

5565423updatepanel	scriptmanager
pattern10		pattern10		
i have found that using jquery javascript inside an updatepanel is more hassel than it is worth as you always need to output the jquery javascript using the scriptmanager or the scriptmanager.registerclientscriptblock

5567919memcpy	realloc
pattern7	size larger	
it wouldn t do a memcpy -- that s only necessary when the realloc size is larger and there s no room to expand

pattern4		
i checked my apache s error log on my wordpress site and every time i update a post select post and click update i get this error

5579675min	max
pattern8		
i guess my point is that the numeric_limits template is more useful beyond max and min .

5584036min	max
pattern0		
the vm can use less than or more than the max and min heap sizes

5588019cairngorm	mate
pattern8		
i m more familiar with mate than cairngorm but what i do in this situation is to back up my pop up with a model and dispatch the events off of the model

5590858maven	m2e
pattern4		
when using the m2e you should update your project configuration by right-clicking on the project and select maven - update project configuration

5594103width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
as you can see if image width is greater than height the script first makes image 128 px height

5594195udp	tcp
pattern7	slower	
the speed for tcp in comparison with udp is slower

5594213udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
udp is faster than tcp because packets are sent without guarantee of delivery nor order

5598904postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
may be postgresql takes less time than mysql

5605226width	height
pattern0		
let s consider i only want to allow 4 lines in the following example you can t go higher than a height of 84 pixels with the given font in a given uitextview with a width of 200

5606021width	height
pattern0		
if you want a pure css option i believe an absolute positioned div inside the body with width and height of 100 overflow auto and right padding larger than the width of a scroll bar will replace the normal scrollbar without shifting the content to the left on long pages

5607953x86	64bit
pattern0		
64bit code is not actually faster it is usually a bit slower than x86 code

5608850quicksort	mergesort

check if object 1 s y + height is greater than object 2 s y + height and that object 1 s x + width is greater that object 2 s x

5615208printf	strlen
pattern4		
if you only need to determine how big would be the concatenation of the two strings i don t see any particular reason to prefer printf since the minimum operations to determine the total length of the two strings is what the two strlen calls do

5615287printf	strlen
pattern3		
i wouldn t recommend using printf instead of strlen though

5616958innodb	myisam	innodb	tokudb	tokudb	myisam

pattern7	type rank greater	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

5635264ant	maven
pattern3		
i personally recommend using maven over ant since the dependency management is wonderful for larger projects

5641994hash	salt
pattern7		
the lack of salt is harder to expoit here than with password hash since the hash is not directly known

5645603google-chrome	firefox

if you re using mvc i recommend tinymce or if you re using webforms freetextbox is great

5653498aggregate-functions	sum
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
as an added answer there is also the aggregate-functions which is more general than sum

5664650for-loop	loops
pattern0		
is the foreach loops slower than the for-loop

5664944postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
no doubt i would prefer postgresql to mysql for an application with a lot of data fine security levels a lot of replications and a lot of data checks and automatic updates

5667009for-loop	loops
pattern7		
this is a use case where a for-loop is cleaner to use than a while loops

5669810min	max
pattern4		
select min score max score sum score from table group by buckets score 3

5670055opera	firefox
pattern7	many more	
firefox and opera unfortunately fires many more keypress events than others ie and webkit which have the most sensible implementation the one the w3c is about to standardize in dom 3 events afaict but in that case getcharcode is 0 so you can safely ignore them

5670283interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0		
that being said a compiled-language like c will almost always be faster than an interpreted-language like javascript

5670862put	get
pattern0		pattern0		
for some years now i ve just stuck to the thought that since directbytebuffer s are a direct memory mapping at os level that it would perform quicker with get put calls than heapbytebuffer s

5673252google-chrome	safari

i guess i m looking for a cross between describe select distinct col select min col max col and other summary statistics

5689727xslt	xquery
pattern10		pattern10		
saxon-ee supports streaming of large xml documents using xslt or xquery streaming is better supported in xslt than in xquery

5690589next	except
pattern7		
for me they serve pretty same purpose to hide complexity except accordion is imho better for continuous-reading it s easier to quickly go to next section while tabs seems to be more random-access

5690867post	get

i don t see why sbcl should be so fast - scheme is a far simpler language than common lisp

5691542innodb	tokudb
pattern0		
i use tokudb on tables of up to 18 billion rows and nothing else comes close it s at least 100 times faster than innodb for random inserts on big tables

5692895integer	unsigned
pattern7		
... otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

5693478int	double
pattern7		
double has a greater value range than int

5693480int	double
pattern0		
because double can contain larger numbers than int or long

5694078int	double
pattern7		
also given that double has a wider range what would one return for those out of range int values

pattern4		
i just want to match surf s from a query image to those with an image set by applying flann

5695139ati	nvidia
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
for example on ati cards you ll want to manually vectorize code using float4 int4 data types or accept a nearly 4x performance penalty while nvidia works better with scalar data types

5695969udp	tcp
pattern10	more	pattern10	more reliable	
on the foundation you have either udp which is unreliable but incurs almost no overhead but very well suited for broadcasts and tcp which is more reliable therefore has more overhead but is easier to use

5697000google-chrome	firefox
pattern8		
google-chrome is a bit more strict than firefox here

5697009aggregate-functions	sum
pattern2		
group by should only be used if you have an aggregate-functions in your select such as sum or count

5699024google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
if we remove the font-size it appears properly in google-chrome but shows up smaller in firefox

5704086httpclient	jersey-client

5704658jsf	wicket
pattern4		pattern2		
reasons to choose wicket over jsf and spring mvc

5705341notepad++	jedit
pattern7		
i have found that jedit has better plugins for providing some of the more ide-oriented capabilities but like boltclock said notepad++ is really just a powerful text editor and does not try to be a one-stop-shop ide

5717621client-side	server-side
pattern4		pattern2		
long story short my question is why should i prefer client-side over server-side hashing

5720202for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
pattern7		
if it s a very deep inner loops however and you need to squeak out every last nanosecond my experience has been that with release build code a for-loop indexing over an arrays is measurably faster than a foreach loops with a slightly smaller performance loss for using delegates with linq vs

5722822int	chars
pattern0		
an int is usually 4 bytes i m thinking i don t really need more than 10 chars so a varchar 10 would do.

5728630post	get
pattern4		
basically i m trying to see if there is an option to choose get or post while calling sendredirect

5729100decimal	ieee
pattern0		
the third line displays the data with the maximum useful precision - an ieee 754 64bit floating-point number has slightly less than 16 decimal digits of precision so all those digits of the literal in math.h are pointless perhaps they can be seen as future-proofing against a possible future redefinition in a format with more precision

5729680qgraphicsview	qwidget
pattern0		
plus the performance was much faster than on qwidget because of qgraphicsview optimizations

5729844dbcontext	objectcontext
pattern7		
the problem with dbcontext api is even worse because dbcontext api doesn t offer methods to change state of independent association so you must revert back to objectcontext api and use objectstatemanager.changerelationshipstate

as you can see i am using coalesce to replace null with 0 but its not returning negative value incase of coalesce sum r.reg_fee+r.tut_fee+r.other_fee 0 is greater than sum i.amount - coalesce sum i.discount 0 how can i get negative value instead of getting 0

5746611google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
i use google-chrome for development as i find it runs faster than firefox and ie so it is a bore to guess where the icons are

5747934redmine	trac
pattern0		
i wound up going with redmine and it s way better than trac

5748827listview	gridview
pattern3		
if you are concerned about the performance of your page s i would also recommend using listview instead of gridview

5750294inherited	subclassing
pattern0		
creating the views with code only i think one is better off with subclassing if it comes to more than one level of inherited or many ancestor classes for just one base view

5752734vb.net	vb6
pattern10	overloading more	pattern10	overloading more elegant	
the style was common in vb6 with optional parameters but imho and according to microsoft in vb.net overloading is usually more elegant than optional parameters

5756128bmp	png
pattern0		
not only do png files have natural support for transparency they are also smaller than bmp files

5758456geany	gedit
pattern4		
in addition to the vote for eclipse above if you are looking for an alternative for gedit i d recommend geany

5763931vmware	virtualbox
pattern0		
i am not sure if vmware server will be much better than virtualbox

5765284codeigniter	cakephp
pattern4		
i recommend cakephp or codeigniter due to their fil structure simplicity

5768284ppl	tbb
pattern8		
since you already learned c++ you should use something more serious such as tbb or ppl

5768406ocamllex	ocamlyacc
pattern4		
i choose ocamllex ocamlyacc to parse python ast to c ast

5769381twig	smarty
pattern0		
if you use twig which i like better than smarty - although i still prefer self-restraint+plain php most ide s that support django templating should work with it since the syntax is nearly the same

5769943postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
we choose postgresql as our database because oracle and mysql are just too expensive

5772309cvs	rcs
pattern4		
unless you get warped into the past and trapped there i wouldn t recommend rcs or cvs

5772391int	double
pattern0		
these conversions promote float to double and anything smaller than int to int or unsigned int

5772543memcpy	strcpy
pattern4		
moral 1 always prefer memcpy to strcpy if possible

5772543memcpy	memmove
pattern4		
moral 2 always prefer memmove to memcpy

5778559lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern0		
regarding beautifulsoup lxml is more efficient and in my experience can handle broken html better than beautifulsoup

5780617integer	unsigned
pattern0		
in general floating point types are stronger than integer ones and unsigned are stronger than signed.

5780924firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

5784358lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern0		pattern0		
speed isn t important here but in other applications it is good to know that regexes are very fast 100 times faster than lxml and 1000 faster than beautifulsoup

5784610quicksort	mergesort
pattern0		
mergesort may use more space than quicksort i m not entirely sure and merge may be better for linkedlists

5787578int	double
pattern0		
if you use int between -128 and 127 you will get much better results than double from -128 to 127 because the former uses caches values the later does not

5787646gson	jackson
pattern7		pattern0		
gson is not particularly fast but the jackson library can almost compete with most binary serializers jackson is 2-4x faster than gson in most situations and 10-20x faster on utf-8 because it has special code for utf-8

5787844serializable	deserialization
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
the transmission size is bigger using datacontractserializer but during serializable and deserialization it is faster to use datacontractserializer

5788942soappy	suds
pattern7		pattern0		
finally if soappy just isn t working for you try suds it s better documented than soappy

5791318min	max
pattern4		
does anyone know of a slider control with 2 sliders on it so that you can select min and max values

5791782jmeter	soapui
pattern4		
i can recommend soapui or the jmeter application

5792495cstdio	iostream
pattern7		pattern0		
yes iostream is slower than cstdio

5793935subtract	addition
pattern7	more	
when the alu gets a command to subtract it is given 2 numbers - it makes a not to every bit of the second number and makes a simple addition and adds 1 more because 2 s complement is not to every bit +1

5794296opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		pattern0		
much better than opera firefox and google-chrome

5796139jxtable	jtable
pattern0		
also is jxtable better than jtable for such an application

5797770post	get
pattern7		
one reason post is worse for security is that get is logged by default parameters and all data is almost universally logged by your webserver

5804015gitolite	gitosis
pattern10		pattern10		
gitosis which is no longer in active development and you should be using gitolite but this answer applies to both of them stores each user s public keys in in your case gitosis .ssh authorized_keys

5804790firefox	safari
pattern0		
in particular a font may be rendered quite differently between the various browsers and operating systems in current use - safari and macos use more anti-alisaing than firefox or ie but ie9 has a new feature called cleartype which also affects font rendering

5806081error-handling	exception-handling
pattern4		
some users prefer exception-handling others prefer error-returning and if all of them work on the same project they make project s error-handling practice a total mess

5807542int	boolean
pattern7	easier	
skipping a simple type like boolean or int is easier since you can just call readboolean or readinteger without bothering with the readlist functions

5808019bionic	libc	toolchain	bionic
pattern8		
unless you particularly need to build against a more standard libc than bionic you can just use the ndk s toolchain either by copying the hello-jni example and changing build_shared_library to build_executable in the jni android.mk or using the script to generate a stand alone toolchain

5810549ubuntu	linux
pattern4		
all you have to do is install linux i prefer ubuntu and select php apache and mysql

5810913prerequisites	uninstaller
pattern4		
it will install and uninstaller quicker because it doesn t run all the launch logic of the setup.exe checking any prerequisites checking the installshield engine unknown installshield stuff - god knows what they are doing in all the slowness and it will provide users with a context menu in explorer so then can right click the msi and select uninstaller for easy uninstaller of the package

5812981awt	swing
pattern7	more	
the article painting in awt and swing goes into more detail

5815939nunit	mstest
pattern7		pattern0		
from my experience mstest is much slower than nunit

5817400int	double
pattern7	bigger	
passing an int is easy to imagine passing a double is just bigger and passing a struct or class could be very big indeed

5819202pygobject	gio
pattern7		
pygobject is nothing more than a thin layer of glue making gobject gio .

5819345freebsd	netbsd
pattern4		
with low load as you mentioned in the comment netbsd will probably outperform freebsd

5821002min	max
pattern4		
edit to clarify the situation this query select min categoryid max categoryid from dbo.tblcategories returns -2147483647 2147483647.

5826597hash-collision	key
pattern7		
it will only really matter if you have lots of hash-collision since then the get key call gets slower than o 1 - it gets o k with k being the number of entries in the same bucket the number of key with same hash code or a different hash code which gets still mapped to the same bucket - this depends on the capacity size and load factor of the map as well

5830907printf	strtod
pattern0		
a fairer comparison would be comparing stringstream to the printf sscanf line of functions which would be slower than strtod but still faster than stringstream

5833867datediff	difference
pattern7	less	
for example if the start time was 8 55 and the end time 9 05 datediff hour ... would return 1 although the actual difference is much less just 10 minutes

5834312width	height
pattern0		
my image has the width bigger than the height so i want that the minumum zoom is the width

5834826int	double
pattern7	smaller	
the largest int that can be stored reliably in double is much smaller than dbl_max

5837140resharper	justcode
pattern0		
together resharper was finding more than justcode

5840254width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
so problem is images are display more than width size and some lower than width then i won t set dynamically set height and width

5840551postgresql	mysql
pattern7	worse	pattern7	worse	
i am using postgresql before which i tried mysql mysql is even worse

5840630bash	tcsh
pattern4		
i prefer bash but csh tcsh korn shell etc

5842118width	height
pattern4		
to store this information in separate columns of the database or is just cheap enough performance-wise to grab height width calculate orientation on the fly

5842674post	get
pattern4		
do you i have to prefer post or get method for seo

5843950cpython	pypy
pattern10		pattern10		
judging from the benchmarks posted on the pypy speed center it appears as if pypy is faster than cpython for all but two of the tests presented

5843950cpython	pypy
pattern10		pattern10		
cpython is faster than pypy on the two tests slowspitfire and waf

5843950cpython	pypy
pattern4		
can pypy be expected to catch up and beat cpython also for those two tests

5844031profiling	benchmarking	rspec	minitest
pattern7		
minitest has much more than most people know for example minitest spec has bdd matchers akin to rspec minitest mock is a mocking system and minitest benchmarking is for performance profiling

5844765google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
for the client side i recommend google-chrome s developer tools integrated or the firebug add-on for firefox

5846368nsview	ikimagebrowserview
pattern0		
while i haven t used nscollectionview myself my gut feeling is that there s probably going to be a greater overhead with numerous nsview s compared to ikimagebrowserview which uses the standard coupling of an nsview with an nscell -like reusable drawing mechanism to help improve performance

5847506istream	ostringstream
pattern10	more	pattern10	more suitable	
if further stream will not be used to read values from it it s istream part won t be used ostringstream is more suitable

5849881xslt	xquery
pattern10		pattern10		
xslt is significantly more appropriate to use than xquery for such kind of tasks

5850324innodb	myisam
pattern0		
it is said that if you have a mostly read based application you should use myisam as it is better than innodb

5851846for-loop	arrays
pattern0		
having seen a question here on so about joining strings i have done some testing and came to knowledge that joining a string in a foreach is slower than with a for-loop and using the indexes in the arrays

5856222jar	war
pattern7	higher	
like remove the jar s from your war in case the version of your jar is same or lower than that of jboss s or replace the jar s of jboss and remove that jar s from your war in case the version of your jar is higher than that of jboss s

5862179vb.net	vb6
pattern0		
fortunately vb.net finally ended all that and is completely pixel based you can still alter you viewport scaling but .net seems to handle that much better than vb6

5862704udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with

5862945minimum	max
pattern2		
matches a-za-z with minimum length of 2 and max length 6

5863716swt	swing
pattern4		
it is hard to give a rule-of-thumb where swt would outperform swing or vice versa

5863716swt	swing
pattern4		
hosting windows swing and its redraw optimization outperform swt significantly

5866471moq	moles
pattern4		
i recommend moles because it s free efficient and use lambda expressions like moq

5868039cfstring	nsstring
pattern0		
cfstring has some slightly better functionality than nsstring but is a bit harder to use

5868759rsa	dsa
pattern8		
the third operation is made much faster is the client uses a rsa key pair rsa signature verification is very fast whereas dsa signature verification is expensive actually somewhat more expensive than dsa signature generation

5868759rsa	dsa
pattern0		
a dsa signature generation could be somewhat faster than a rsa signature generation maybe up to twice faster

5869634udp	tcp
pattern0		
udp port scanning is possible but it is harder than tcp scanning

5873732qiodevice	qdatastream
pattern7	easier	
instead of using the endian conversion functions you could use the qdatastream functionality with any qiodevice which is much easier and more intuitive in my opinion

5874948hash	md5
pattern4		
the 2nd to last line of this query compares md5 d hash of text fields

5875201dbcontext	objectcontext
pattern10	api more	pattern10	api more issues	
the description is related to objectcontext api but dbcontext api is just wrapper suffering same issues actually dbcontext api suffers even more issues in this scenario and because of that i will skip solution with manually setting relationships

5875940svnkit	subclipse	subversive	javahl
pattern2		
i like subclipse because it allows me to choose between svnkit and javahl while subversive uses javahl only

5877054post	get
pattern4		
that would select post id 4 and also get you the title of post id 2 stored in the field parent_title

5883113strcpy	strncpy
pattern10		pattern10		
the best solution is to write a custom version of strncpy that is less weird or if you know the length of the input just use strcpy

5884242post	get
pattern0		
also post is generally considered better than get for ajax calls as it doesn t have the same string length limit slightly more secure too

5885329maven	pom.xml
pattern4		
if you right click on the pom.xml you can select maven - add dependency - which will search the default repositories

5885968int	double
pattern0		
that means if you pass an int type smaller than int it ll be promoted to int before being passed and if you pass a float it ll be promoted to double

5888351gitolite	gitosis
pattern4		
rather than gitosis i would recommend gitolite for fine-grained authorization coupled with ssh-based authentication

5890829lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern0		
one of the things that makes lxml better than beautifulsoup is support for proper css-like class selection or even supports full css selectors if you want to use them

5894452vim	emacs
pattern8		
but it s a lot less powerful than vim emacs

5896356nofollow	noindex
pattern4		
we ve got a module that you can select noindex index follow nofollow on the admin section of each page

5896369innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties

5903481stdout	fflush
pattern7		
i guess that these lines have shorter output so the fflush frequency is lower i used the stdout line to print a deliberate help message

5905750min	max
pattern4		
the expression select max date - min date from test might be off by one

5910435utc	isodate
pattern4		
as split date i choose isodate 2011-05-06t10 55 00z create this with the differences come since the month starts at zero and the time is utc time zone

5912160webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern0		
httpwebresponse and httpwebrequest are a little bit lower level than webclient

5913844ant	maven
pattern7		
maven is more of a meta-program that can use ant scripts and run your junit tests

5914539int	double
pattern0		
the floating-point unit fpu on modern x86 is natively double in fact it s even bigger than double not float the 32 in 32-bit describes the int register widths not the floating-point width

5916815children	parent
pattern0		
after determining the location of our element we move our element up in case it has a greater priority than its parent in a similar manner to insertion or down if it has a lower priority than one of its children in a similar manner to deletion and update the modified elements locations in the hash map

5917483width	height
pattern0		
so if is larger than the width should be set to maxwidth and the height should be calculated based on it

5919293jboss	weblogic
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		
i had worked on jboss for a year and on weblogic for more than a year now my experience with the web logic is good compared to jboss weblogic is more stable and robust it can handle more than 3000 concurrent requests without throwing a single exception where jboss failed to do so and admin console for the weblogic is excellent but i think weblogic is more complex then jboss

5920296turbogears	pyramid	pylons	pyramid	pylons	turbogears
pattern10	more	pattern10	more api	
the difference between pylons and pyramid are the merge of repoze.bfg and turbogears which brings more api resources

5923232cpython	pypy
pattern7		pattern7		
the waf benchmark has less of a pronounced difference in performance and i d guess that the answer would be more complicated some factors pypy does better some factors cpython does better and overall cpython comes out slightly ahead

5924309cpu	processors
pattern0		
the operating system will give your program all the resources it needs the reason your process is not consuming all the cpu is probably because it s waiting for the io sub system more than the processors

5924568width	height
pattern7		
the problem is when the window s height is larger than it s width the grid inside the window gets clipped

5925692innodb	myisam
pattern4		
innodb outperforms myisam in many situations until it can t keep the indexes in memory then performance drop drastically

5926886postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
i did some benchmarking 3 years ago may be stale... which showed that on large datasets basically postgresql fulltext is 10-100x faster than mysql and xapian 10-100x faster than postgresql but not integrated

5928368int	chars
pattern10		pattern10		
well the int uses more slots since chars are usually only one byte

5929317postgresql	mysql
pattern3		
would you recommend using postgresql over mysql for this scenario

5929317postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
well i don t know why mysql barfs so much on queries 1 and 3 which are pretty simple and easy in fact it should even beat postgresql using an index only scan but apparently not eh

5936395post	get
pattern0		
it seems some operators do better with post s than get s - this is a feeling i get from what some nigerian users mention

5941669strlen	strcpy
pattern0		
if strcpy is anything like strcpy it will write one byte more than strlen returns to zero terminate the string

5943033google-chrome	safari
pattern10		pattern10		
edit what particularly interrests me is if desktop safari is closer to ios safari than google-chrome is

5944995int	chars

5945785sum	datepart
pattern4		
select datepart week my_date sum quantity

5952010width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
in onsurfacechanged you can check if your width is greater than your height and if it is you can query the orientation using the technique shown here

5952264vim	textmate
pattern4		
i like this vim feature but generally prefer textmate

5953369trie	tree
pattern10		pattern10		
a trie is better suited to this kind of thing because it lets you store your symbols as a tree and quickly parse it to match values or reject them

5955637google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
in ie and google-chrome the table ends up under my image while in firefox it takes more that 100 an horizontal scroll bar is displayed

5960350for-loop	loops
pattern10		pattern10		pattern7		
loops in c++ are most basic than python the for-loop is more simpler it is based on the three expression initializer expression loops test expression and the counting expression

5960828x86	64bit
pattern10	more	pattern10	more costly	
register spilling is pretty cheap on x86 cpus due to fast l1 caches and register shadowing and other tricks and the 64bit only registers are more costly to access in terms of larger instructions so it may just be that gcc s version is as fast or faster than the one you want

5961988textmate	sublimetext
pattern4		
i would recommend textmate if your hopefully on a mac if not get sublimetext 2 beta

5965234rodbc	rjdbc
pattern0		
rjdbc may also be a more stable option in the linux environment especially now that the fetch code has been re-written in java as of development release 0.2-0 on r-forge its performance is on par with if not better than rodbc

5966362asterisk	ivr
pattern10		pattern10		
microsoft has the microsoft speech api sapi however if you want simple ivr it is better not to reinvent the wheel and customize an asterisk implementation which i guess falls under the great ivr library for c++ category it s c not c++ but if you know c++ you should be able to understand the c . using asterisknow you may not even need to write any custom code it may do what you want already

5968957getdate	datepart
pattern4		
example select datepart hh getdate

5976346button	checkbox
pattern4		
when i select checkbox option and click on some action button id s of the selected records should pass to view and perform execute logic on the selected records

5978352udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
the reason udp is faster than tcp is because there is no form of flow control or error correction

5978352udp	tcp
pattern7	connection less	
1 tcp is connection oriented and reliable where as udp is connection less and unreliable

5978352udp	tcp
pattern7		
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not

5978406udp	tcp
pattern3		
for video streaming i would recommend using udp instead of tcp as it has less overhead and packet confirmation is usually not needed as the retransmited data would already be obsolete

5979357wordpress	joomla
pattern0		
i mean it came as a surprise to me that drupal is so much faster than wordpress and joomla

5990009qtcpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager
pattern7		
qnetworkaccessmanager is higher level than qhttp and qtcpsocket so they have abstracted away the sockets connection state

5991990for-loop	loops
pattern10		pattern10		
thus your for-loop is probably better expressed as following while loops

5992152stringr	stringi
pattern10		pattern10		
stringr provides more human-readable wrappers around the base r functions though as of dec 2014 the development version has a branch built on top of stringi mentioned below

6012511mef	prism
pattern7	cleaner	
using mef for the add-in architecture over prism can be cleaner because the reasons for each project are vastly different and mef has a cleaner model i think it can also act as a basic ioc container

6016574width	height
pattern7	greater	
the content will be scrollable as soon as its width or height goes greater than 300px

6018469cakephp	zend-framework

pattern4		
anybody please help to focus the file select dialog to the current pop-up window

6020740inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
pattern10		pattern10		
i generally use interfaces are too enforce a common behavior that a group of classes share whereas subclassing is more appropriately used in cases where you can achieve serious code re-use through inherited functions properties

6021229codeigniter	cakephp
pattern0		
i personally use codeigniter which probably falls in to the heavy framework category but is at least much lighter than cakephp and lighter than zend too i think

6021813apache	nginx
pattern0		
why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

6033905public	protected
pattern10		pattern10		
reason i once heard that protected is better for hibernate performance but all i can find on the web is hibernate can access public private and protected accessor methods as well as public private and protected fields directly

6039850apache	nginx
pattern4		
instead i suggest taking a look at mod_xsendfile if you re using apache or it s equivalent for your web server of choice i prefer nginx and would use xsendfile for this

6040762sum	coalesce
pattern4		
select sum amount - coalesce sum due 0

6046512hash	md5

however if you want to use the sha256 hash alogorithm which is better than the md5 then here s a code sample

6047860primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
pattern2		
for the view layer we have to choose between primefaces icefaces 2 since we definitely want jsf2 and richfaces

6048084folder	directory
pattern0		
i would recommend placing the common files in the same directory as the solution file or no more than 1 folder deep

6049305for-loop	loops
pattern0		
and the results is that foreach loops is 5-6 times faster than the for-loop

6050302int	double
pattern0		
i think the problem is this value is bigger than an int or a double

6050820carrierwave	paperclip
pattern10		pattern10		pattern7	more	
seems like paperclip is more file oriented and carrierwave is more object oriented

6051255children	parent
pattern0		
this children height can be greater than the parent container

6053870codeigniter	kohana
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
overall kohana is more flexible than codeigniter and a great base to build a web application and api on

6056262multiplying	division
pattern0		
these can be compared to multiplying by 2 x left-shift or divinding by 2 x right-shift but it should be noted that a binary shift is much faster than a division operation

6061010serializable	deserialization
pattern0		pattern0		
the question is a bit wider than serializable deserialization and applies to any situation where some object could be uniquely rebuild from jpa persistent data and vice versa

6061406addition	multiplication

based on the order of operations e.g where multiplication is evaluated with higher priority than addition push the operators and operands onto a stack

6064685disk	ram
pattern0		
but if your shared file system is a raid 5 or 6 array exported to the nodes via nfs over gige ethernet that will be slower than ram to ram transfer via gige using rpc or mpi because you have to write and read the disk over gige anyway

6070609google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
i believe the error might be how firefox and google-chrome handles these multiple times included jquerys and it might be that google-chrome uses the older and firefox newer version

6071295inherited	properties
pattern0		
however i could not find it the documentation so it may inherited more than properties

6072962ant	maven
pattern4		pattern4		
some people prefer ant as it is more flexible powerful for custom task builds where as some people prefer maven as its a lot more succinct and simpler

6078158versioning	upgrade
pattern0		
you do want to upgrade no further than versioning 2.1.6 at the moment as it s the latest one that supports rails 2.3.x

6078560addition	multiplication
pattern0		
the direction of evaluation does not affect the results of expressions that include more than one multiplication addition + or binary-bitwise | operator at the same level.

6079275firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it

6079323vim	emacs
pattern0		
for example emacs s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than vim s qq and q

6080696visualvm	yourkit
pattern3		
i would recommend getting yourkit visualvm has limited information and use this to profile your application in production if possible

6086671ant	maven
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more natural	pattern10	more natural	
i feel like using scripts ant maven is more natural for this task whereas java needs to work hard to read all the files folders to heap and write them to another folder

i feel like using scripts ant maven is more natural for this task whereas java needs to work hard to read all the files folders to heap and write them to another folder

6095787innodb	myisam
pattern7	better	
you can change your database to myisam -- i m guessing you re only reading from the tables in the database otherwise if you have read write transactions innodb is the better choice

6097438children	parent
pattern7		pattern0		
what if a parent has more than 100 children

6103317google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
it works fine even for italics but i m aware that the user s browser is being asked to make a best-guess here and have noticed that google-chrome will make individual chars appear slightly fatter than firefox when i do things this way

6104661udp	tcp
pattern0		
if you can t afford lost packets then tcp is probably a better option than udp since it provides that guarantee out of the box

6105489portrait	landscape	switching	screens
pattern0		
switching between landscape and portrait changes nothing the width is still larger than the screens

6105989libs	buildpath
pattern4		
this is my issue to solve the problem right click your project and select buildpath next select add libs and add your private jars

6112701folder	dir
pattern0		
things like cmd c dir don t know why - and yes i do cmd c dir in cases i am in some kind of shared network folder with thousands of files and ls is significantly slower than dir

6113785superclass	subclassing
pattern0		
these relations naturally arise when you impose restrictions on what you can handle--then if a subclassing means that the method can handle less acts as a superclass of since can handle everything that the subclassing can handle and more

6114085control-structure	break
pattern0		
e.g. break with labels as in java or even a more generic goto. continue does not seem more special than other control-structure mechanisms except that it is present in more languages

6117389int	chars
pattern0		
if an symbol along with a random word is detected while being read i want to drop the symbol and replace the word with the int 16 and if a different string of chars is being used along with the symbol i want to set the number 1 higher than int 16

6118832ssl	https
pattern7	more	
the ssl handshake overhead associated with https is more than 50 of the bandwidth currently

6120017width	height
pattern0		
something traveling faster than the width height of your collidable area won t be reliably detected

6120579zend-framework	codeigniter
pattern7	better	
in codeigniter and zend-framework which is the better option

6130037subtraction	addition
pattern0		
if one of the numbers is a constant your compiler might optimize by doing some combination of bit shifts and subtractions mostly for powers of two since hardware div mod is slower than addition or subtraction but on modern processors the latency already only a few nanoseconds is hidden by tons of other performance tricks so you needn t worry about it

6131971profiling	instrumentation
pattern0		
so my question is beyond instrumentation and the profiling using memory leaks which tells you the location of creation of the leaky object but not the root cause are there any other tools i could run that could give me any more info than instrumentation re tracking down the root cause point

6132672int	chars
pattern4		
int compare chars op1 chars op2

6133179udp	tcp
pattern2		
when i have to pick between tcp and udp i make the decision more on how i want my networking logic to flow

6139398width	height
pattern0		
i tried changing the screen resolution in a virtual machine orientation change is really just a screen resolution change that results in width being larger than height or vice versa and could not trigger any layout events

6151409postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
it seems very unlikely that you would want this behaviour for a real application so i recommend mysql postgresql or similar instead

6152611coalesce	isnull
pattern7		pattern0		
isnull is marginally faster than coalesce

6156749archetypes	dexterity
pattern3		
i d recommend using dexterity 1.0 with plone 4.1 if you want a site that mixes dexterity and archetypes content

6163058postgresql	mysql
pattern0		pattern0		
nosql solutions are better than mysql postgresql and other rdbms techs for this task

6166137haskell	ocaml
pattern8		
i m more familiar with ocaml than haskell so type constructor may not be the right term

6173696min	rank	min	max	rank	max
pattern4		
or you will be able to select max min rank for any user with aggregation

6174246innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
in some benchmarks i see that myisam is faster than innodb but seems i have a little improvement

6178094flot	highcharts
pattern8		
highcharts is svg and as such it is much more dynamic than flot you can restyle graphs with css attach events perform animations etc..

6180742opera	firefox
pattern4		
click ok select firefox if it exists and remove it then check opera and click ok

6181929vim	textmate
pattern7		pattern0		
i like the idea of the of editing inside the terminal and like the key bindings of vim but the text highlighting in my vim is much worse than in textmate

6182326post	get
pattern3		
since you re updating i d recommend using post over get

6184510sorting	filtering
pattern10	more	pattern10	more versatile	
sorting in java is a little bit more work than in sql on the other hand filtering is more versatile when implemented in java

6184893getter	setter
pattern0		pattern0		
this is slower than getter setter

6185146int	double
pattern4		
you need to select double not int s

6185441post	get
pattern3		
i would recommend using post get arrays like so

6186100coalesce	isnull
pattern10		pattern10		
isnull is better then coalesce because of how datatypes are handled

6186726webkit	gecko
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		
so the easiest way is to use one either webkit or gecko webkit has probably better support for svg these days plus i can t find package of gecko right now

6188783fast-forward	merge
pattern7	easier	
or whatever you branched from so the resulting history will appear i started from later version and the merge back will probably be fast-forward it s easier to work with especially since you are rewriting the actual history to logical changesets anyway

6189937libs	buildpath
pattern4		
so after thath right click on your project under eclipse than select buildpath add libs then select junit next select junit version tehn continue

6190937width	height
pattern7		
you could adjust the height of the iframe if the scrollbars are present just check the iframes scrollwidth against it s offsetwidth and if the scroll width is higher increase the height of the iframe by the height of the scrollbar prolly 5-10px i d have to check to be sure

6197415getter	setter
pattern0		
the setter complexity can be higher than the getter and thus validate a unit-test

6203205fgets	strtok
pattern4		
prefer fgets to read the input and parse the lines in your program using for example sscanf or strtok

6203393post	put
pattern10		pattern10		
post is also more commonly used for partial updates as put generally implies sending a full new representation of the resource

6205509emacs	aquamacs
pattern10		pattern10		
on unix like environments emacs is more native and you can use slime which is usually available as a os package or as a separate download for aquamacs

6207234django	turbogears
pattern4		
i would recommend django or turbogears

6207337inherited	subclassing
pattern2		
also consider favor composition over inherited unless the base class is specifically designed for inherited as a change to the base class might break the subclassing

6207837qlist	qvector
pattern0		pattern0		
operations like prepend and insert are usually faster than with qvector because of the way qlist stores its items in memory see algorithmic complexity for details and its index-based api is more convenient than qlinkedlist s iterator-based api

6216983junit	testng
pattern0		
isn t testng supposed to a better than junit

6217113width	height
pattern0		
the big.jpg has more width than height so when it s resized the wrapping containers get the correct new height but they still have the old width

6217744junit	testng
pattern8		
i actually picked junit over testng for android testing i thought it was more lightweight than testng for on-device testing

6218120d3.js	protovis
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
the result is that using d3.js can feel a little lower-level - you have more control but you have to be pretty familiar with svg syntax to do some of the things protovis does much more easily

6218120d3.js	protovis
pattern7		
finally i haven t done much with animation but i think you re entirely correct - d3.js provides more animation support than protovis especially in terms of animated transitions

6218146listview	gridview
pattern7	better	
it will produce the desired layout with a gridview but indeed the asp listview is a better choice

6219147post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
however a post request is less efficient as a get request - bear that in mind and only use post if you really need to

6222562firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		pattern0		
i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

6226905int	chars
pattern7		
you will get your data faster comparing chars strings is much longer than comparing two int

6227193wcf	openrasta
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
though openrasta looks more mature than wcf web api i m still a bit confused

6227583wcf	openrasta
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
openrasta is much more mature than wcf web api

6230268qstring	qmap

6233037charindex	substr
pattern3		
select mystring substr mystring charindex deliminator mystring 0 + len deliminator len mystring - charindex mystring 0

6236110width	height	portrait	landscape
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
if you think about a moment this is exactly what you want - to know if width is smaller than height portrait the opposite landscape or if they are the same square

6238250interpolation	splines
pattern4		
the n-dimensional interpolation routines i have found are not quite good enough i would prefer splines over linearndinterpolator for smoothness and i have far too many data points often over one million for a radial basis function to work

6238274width	height
pattern0		
so if i set height attribute to 40 i might find myself with images larger than 120 width

6240028children	parent
pattern4		
i d like to select parent rows and the children of those rows

6244792width	height
pattern0		
then in the javascript you just check to see if the height or width of title is greater than the height or width of main

6249751width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
i have a gallery with different image sizes the custom layout is below for gallery its working correctly if the image width is les than height but if image height is less than width its not working correctly

6251539cassini	iis
pattern8		
perhaps you will have a more pleasant experience with iis 7.5 express as a replacement for cassini

6255426width	height
pattern0		
if image is bigger than screen width android adjustviewbounds true works correctly and adjust height to keep aspect ratio of image

6256397stateless	stateful
pattern4		
if you want to develop high traffic distributed apps that can scale tens hundreds thousands of nodes prefer stateless frameworks over component based stateful ones

6258409macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
pattern4		
macports or fink may have something similar but i prefer homebrew

6262121uibinder	smartgwt
pattern10		pattern10		
while smartgwt has much more sophisticated widgets than gwt you still can t use uibinder in conjunction with it which is why i rejected using smartgwt

6265840subtract	add
pattern0		
quick idea - go through the roman number from right to left if value of more to the left is smaller than then subtract it from the result if larger then add it

6267012addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
for example multiplication is of higher precedence than addition so 2 + 3 x 4 is equivalent to 2 + 3 x 4 not 2 + 3 x 4

6268880bluetooth	usb
pattern10		pattern10		
interfacing with usb is more difficult than it sounds it would be harder to build something which would interface with that and measure millivolts than with bluetooth because the pic processor you use for analog to digital sampling and usb client would in fact have to either act as usb host or usb otg on a phone which is far more complicated than being a usb peripheral

6273537getter	setter
pattern7	more	pattern7	more	
defining getter setter makes more sense when you prefix the variable to get set

6275623uiview	subviews
pattern0		
of course uiscrollview can have more than one content view just as any uiview can have more than one subviews and this case it will be more difficult to render its layer

6278011versioning	upgrade
pattern7	newer	pattern7	newer	
this will force to upgrade if the upgrade versioning is newer

6280055int	double
pattern4		
or more general how do i compare two types so that compare double1 double2 will evaluate to true and compare int double will evaluate to false

6280801tcpdf	fpdf
pattern7		pattern0		
i suggest you to give a look to tcpdf which is far better than fpdf also because it is actively developed

6282736disk	ram
pattern0		
that means that without caching a hit against disk will be 200 times slower than accessing ram

6283024memcpy	memmove
pattern8		
as an aside my c c++ is rusty but is not memcpy more efficient than memmove if you know you don t have overlapping memory

6283676width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
as-is it maximizes the width and assumes that the height is not greater than the height of the screen

6284598x86	64bit
pattern0		
64bit amd and later intel machines run faster than 32-bit x86 machines because when amd designed the new instruction set they added more cpu registers and made sse math the default

6285401post	get
pattern0		
regarding your question about safety -- the answer is post is absolutely no safer than get

6296133post	get
pattern7	simpler	pattern7	simpler	
it can be with post or get get is simpler

6297409cpu	processors
pattern10		pattern10		
if the processors is loaded enough then my thread works fine but when the processors is more or less free i rich quickly my cpu limitation 50 and finally the pool terminates and needs to be recycled

6297636int	double
pattern0		
you should be using math.ceiling which will return the smallest int value that is greater than the double passed in

6298354g++	gcc
pattern4		
note i think there was also a good reason to prefer g++ for c++ targets rather than using gcc

6301067children	parent
pattern4		
this has been boggling my mind all afternoon how do i get my jquery statement below to only select parent who have children

6301137google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	more	pattern10	more cool	
you forgot to open the so no more css after this line is considered in firefox and ie google-chrome is more cool on the error

6305055uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
pattern0		
the ardalahmet solution is not the right one if you need different backgrounds for each uinavigationbar when you have more than one uinavigationcontroller such as in a uitabbar because it using uinavigationbar categories

6305117screens	hdpi
pattern0		
2 layout-hdpi uses layout-mdpi because it s the best candidate it is the folder that theoretically should fit better with the hdpi screens because layout it s totally generic

6306704vim	emacs
pattern4		
i always recommend vim emacs to anyone because

6308840piston	tastypie
pattern4		
though piston wasn t updated for a long time now so i d recommend tastypie which is actively maintained.

6310575int	chars
pattern4		
my results so far have got me splitting the string up and putting them into an array of chars but this is where i ve stopped since i am trying to figure out how to compare chars to operators and chars to int

6313197opera	google-chrome
pattern0		
the animations are slower than google-chrome and opera

6313470int	chars
pattern0		
please note that fgetc requires an int well something larger than a chars -- int is customary for its return value eof is a possible return value in addition to any of the values that chars might take

6314981innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma

6316222icmp	tcp
pattern10	more	pattern10	more complex	
ping is just low level icmp protocol defined in internet layer whereas tcp is more complex protocol defined in transport layer

6316299hide	show
pattern4		
select show or hide based on an epxression

6318309addition	multiplication
pattern7	easier	
we have now turned our multiplication into an addition which is much easier to do

6318525prepare	execute
pattern4		
if i try to run a straight select execute on con it works fine so the connection is being made but this prepare statement does not work it s not even recognizing prepare as a valid method it seems

6322270int	chars	int	double
pattern4		
if you want to being able to compare double float int int and chars then use ord

6326419width	height
pattern0		
works fine but the problem is that if i resize the window to less than the width 1400 or height 900 of the photos the scrollbar appears

6328128opencv	emgucv
pattern4		
since i don t know emgucv i would recommend opencv

6330726folder	directory
pattern4		
verify working directory section check selected working directory all required files should be present in there - if not click on workspace button and select folder from workspace

6332114codeigniter	yii
pattern4		
i have worked with codeigniter and yii i prefer yii for developer time and for speed

6333466width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
but you only want it to be negative when x is greater than the width or y is greater than the height

6337024post	get	post	put	put	get
pattern8		
you got at least put and delete although they are used much less frequent than get and post as in hardly ever

6338747django	web2py
pattern10		pattern10		
django s is better web2py s appadmin is for administrators only

6342651post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
this post is more to get advises and ideas rather than solving a problem

6345331post	get
pattern4		
i m not sure how to get at that intermediary table without deleting all clubs or all post or all post associated with a club as opposed to just select post

6348127innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
generally speaking innodb is slower than myisam as innodb is atomic while myisam is not

6349659junit	testng
pattern0		
if you re doing non-unit testing testng might be a better option than junit

6350111express	node.js
pattern4		
i plan to use express backbone.js mongodb redis if i choose node.js

6352272int	chars
pattern0		pattern0		
be sure c is declared with a datatype larger than chars int is usual

6356299equals	gethashcode
pattern4		
when you define equality for a type by overriding equals you have to override gethashcode as well and guarantee that objects that compare equals have the same hash code

6358266superclass	subclassing
pattern10	further	pattern10	further	
subclassing collections is dangerous because for example you don t know whether or not addall delegates to add inside the superclass this is explained further in effective java p.71

6361528interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0		
writing in a compiled-language java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an interpreted-language like php

6363473union	distinct
pattern4		
the beauty of union is that there is no need make a select distinct user_id since union merges the result sets into unique values

6364373post	get
pattern0		
usual way with tagging is to get objects by tag but if tags are used by few applications it may give more than post

6366076screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
pattern0		
even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio

6368250post	get
pattern0		
post requests are no safer than restful requests which are no safer than get requests

6370762apache	lighttpd
pattern8		
they both are able to handle much more current users than apache lighttpd or nginx.

6370773button	checkbox
pattern4		
the form is questionnaire for a user test including radio button combo-boxes multi select checkbox test areas and a button for submit

6371223g++	gcc
pattern10		pattern10		
g++ compiler is more strict then gcc compiler

6372185nhibernate	massive
pattern0		
i have noticed that ef is slower than linq2sql massive petapoco ado.net and possibly nhibernate

6375108int	chars
pattern4		
then your inner loop only has to look up 1 index number for each chars in the string and compare int

6377582jsf	seam
pattern10		pattern10		
well for that you ll need jsf that is better integrated with seam and jsf does not handle file uploads that actually everyone use so you have to put also icefaces that actually are better managed by maven that you currenty are not using... neverending story

6378263nunit	mstest
pattern4		
as a side note i prefer nunit because of the fluent syntax but also things like assert.throws and its opposite assert.doesnotthrow as well as convenient assertion classes such as collectionassert and stringassert none of which are present in mstest

6384442division	multiplication
pattern10	less	pattern10	less expressive	
strange bitshifting code implementing multiplication or division is far less expressive of what you were conceptually trying to achieve so other developers will be confused by that and a confused programmer s more likely to introduce bugs or remove something essential in an effort to restore seeming sanity

6385312int	double
pattern7		
on a 32-bit machine doing addition and comparison on 64-bit int types takes more instructions than doing the equivalent on double s

6385419codeigniter	yii
pattern8		
2 yii a bit more structured than codeigniter but you have a basic app up within 10 mins and if your familiar with mvc design its a great way to develop portals incredibly quickly

6385419codeigniter	yii
pattern0		
personally i d say yii might have the edge as it encourages convention more than codeigniter would

6386745width	height
pattern7	higher	
he only animates the margin-left margin-top width and height and sets a higher z-index for the block

6388361getter	setter
pattern7	methods more	
having getter and setter methods gives you more power as a developer over the class

638879916-bit	64bit
pattern10		pattern10		
most machines now end up with sizeof int sizeof long because 16-bit is no longer convenient but we have long long to get 64bit if needed

6392569filtering	grouping
pattern4		
scroll down to filtering options highlight all filtering grouping except super aministrator and select filtering type of blacklist default as shown in the screenshot below

6393027int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
since chars is smaller than int it would be the same

6399115rss	feed
pattern4		
if you want to query all nodes that match feed entry or rss item then you can use feed entry | rss item

6399867google-chrome	firefox
pattern3		
i would also recommend using firefox with firebug or firefox google-chrome with the inspect element context menu so you can see what styles are being applied to the various elements on your page when they don t act like you expect

6403035codeigniter	cakephp
pattern7	smaller	
i have installed both cakephp and codeigniter and it seems that codeigniter is much smaller a little less overwhelming and documentation is clearer

6403035codeigniter	cakephp
pattern7		pattern0		
why do people say cakephp is somewhat harder than codeigniter for people new to mvc

6409986fontfamily	font-size
pattern0		
the actual visible size is determined by the font-size and to a lesser extend by the fontfamily

6413391fiddler	charles
pattern4		
i would recommend using a web debug proxy to work out exactly what is going across the pipes i personally prefer charles but something like fiddler should work too

6414002octal	hex
pattern10	more	pattern10	more compact	
of course you could do the same with octal but hex is even more compact than octal.

6414208freemarker	velocity
pattern4		
likewise many people used to choose freemarker for better performance or more advanced features but velocity fixed a lot of the performance issues and velocitytools provides a huge wealth of features

6420272apache	nginx
pattern4		
if this plugin crashes it seems it could entirely kill nginx or apache respectively

6425647listview	gridview
pattern7	better	
btw if this hyperlink is not in a databound control like listview or gridview it is far better to set the property from the code behind

6426536sorting	grouping
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more useful	pattern10	more useful	
for more day-to-day end users having canned reports that might be modified by the end user via a simple user interface that allows them to modify restrictions grouping sorting is more useful

pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
again though the time profiling instrumentation is far better suited to the job and it definitely works

6432678google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
you might be able to avoid asking this sort of question in the future if you start using a google-chrome s inspect element context menu command or b firebug for firefox which is more or less the same thing

6432870nant	cruisecontrol

6684918cufft	fftw
pattern0		
i am working on a code which needs to be time efficient and thus using cufft for this purpose but when i try to compute fft of a very large data in parallel it is slower than cpu fftw and the reason i find after finding the time for every line of code using high precision timing code is that cudamalloc taking around 0.983 sec while the time for rest of the lines of code is around 0.00xx sec which is expected ..

6685743memcpy	malloc

in this case i found while loops is better than for-loop because if i want to achieve the same in for-loop i have to assign the value of counter to another variable

6710601for-loop	loops
pattern7		pattern0		
but is there any specific situation when while loops is better than for-loop

6710643for-loop	loops
pattern7		pattern7	better	
as for your question a for-loop is usually better when you want a piece of code to run a certain number of times and a while loops is better when the condition for the code to keep running is more general such as having a boolean flag that is only set to true when a certain condition is met in the code block

here is what it would look like with testng it s a little more contrived with junit since you can t pass parameters directly to test functions

6727374directx	gdi
pattern0		
if you are talking about someone else s there is no promise that they will render larger than the screen since would be wise to clip their painting to what is visible and they may be further constrained by other factors such as the size of a directx surface which is smaller than the gdi limit

by using 2l and 1l instead of 2 and 1 you keep the result as int instead of forcing a coercion to double which is slower and takes more memory

6738770junit	testng
pattern7		pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
testng has more capabilities and can be helpful with integration tests junit is more focused on unit tests

6739756client-side	server-side
pattern10	more	pattern10	more important	
at this point i m putting off worrying about client-side validation since server-side is more important

6746105width	margin
pattern0		
the box is never too small infact the margin of the adjacent div is bigger than the width of ul div

6748785range	max
pattern4		
if the product ids are a consecutive range of integers and there is a non-trivial number of rows then it will much better to select max id from products generate a number of random integers between 1 and the result in php and do as a second query

6751367postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
looks like postgresql is a little more compliant than mysql so try this instead

6752293mp4	h.264
pattern3		
for full hd video i would recommend using h.264 video mp4 or f4v

6756801uiview	subviews
pattern0		
change the contentsize of your scrollview.your uiview size and uiscrollview size is same if the uiscrollview contentsize is more than its subviews size then scroll will happen change the line overviewscroll setcontentsize cgsizemake screenframe.size.width screenframe.size.height-25

6759961jqplot	flot
pattern7		
by looking at the google groups for qjplot and flot the support for jqplot is better lot s of unanswered questions at the flot group

6760393autoresize	scrollbar
pattern4		
select autoresize to get rid of from the scrollbar

6761293hash	md5
pattern4		
btw i suggest to do not store password in database in plain text use simple md5 helper to store md5 hash of password and just compare hash instead of password itself

6765663int	double
pattern0		
i understand that the compiler isn t happy because a double might be larger than an int can hold but this particular control is guaranteed to be a value from 1 to 10 so i know that it will be okay

6767487getdate	datepart
pattern4		
select datepart iso_week getdate

6769912cpu	processors
pattern0		
i have a quad core processors and the threadpoolexecutor is set to 4 core threads but when i submit my callables hundred or so to the threadpoolexecutor java never uses more than 25 cpu

6770897put	get
pattern0		
if you want to do more than just get the uniq output you could put your own java class or command line program rather than use usr bin uniq

6774018google-chrome	firefox
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
it s just a matter of preferences and browser implementation eg firefox works faster with brackets while google-chrome works faster with the dots

6777202post	get
pattern7		pattern0		
i believe post is better than get

6781282quicksort	heapsort
pattern7		pattern0		pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
heapsort has a better big-o than say quicksort yet quicksort performs much better in practice

6783355apache	nginx
pattern7	better	
if you have long-running requests i think the performance will be pretty bad because apache use one thread per connection nginx performs much better

6786838jruby	mri
pattern4		
if you are set on using ruby you might want to compare mri to jruby from my experience with the latter and profilers like jvisualvm i wouldn t be surprised if jruby fared better

6787237width	height
pattern7	taller	
i also want to make it where when the width of the box gets wider and the height gets taller it will re-center

6791797oursql	mysql-python
pattern3		
as one of the best practices i would recommend using oursql over mysql-python

6791931lxml	elementtree	lxml	libxml2
pattern7		
lxml uses libxml2 and provides a nicer interface the elementtree so you get most of the benefit of libxml2 s speed and all of the benefit of it s xpath evaluation

6795418width	height
pattern0		
if the image is larger than the height it will only put the height to 350px and ignore the width that i ve set to 350 too

6796483ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
pattern4		
so i need to choose ienumerable icollection ilist or may be even list

6798177partcover	opencover
pattern7		
opencover is newer and is also on github opencover on github it has 64 and 32 bit support and overcomes some of the limitations that partcover has memory and results delivery

6798673cvs	svn
pattern0		
i need to prove that git is better than cvs and svn to my team.the only thing git lack is a standard server

6799457width	height

gl_invalid_value is generated if width or height is less than 0 or

6800330jobs	cron
pattern0		
google app engine does not allow us to schedule more than 20 cron jobs

6801431addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
multiplication is higher precedence than addition and addition is left-associative so this is equivalent to but knowing that only tells you that the first addition will happen before the second addition and that the multiplication will happen before the second addition

6801546width	height
pattern7		
my current code will rotate but will crop the edges if the height is larger then the width

6807138jsf	seam	jboss	glassfish
pattern7	easier	
spring security is fine too but if you plan to use jsf 2 you probably also use cdi provided by seam weld which is integrated into the java ee 6 profile from glassfish and jboss it is easier to use shiro as spring heavily relies on its own dependency injection methods although spring security does not need that much injected classes but you should stick to one way of doing things

6810774hash	md5
pattern4		
you need to make it more specific to only match md5 hash value -- which is easy

6811052int	chars
pattern7		
the default display width for an unsigned int is one fewer than that for a non- unsigned int simply because you will never be displaying a - chars

6811531gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
pattern0		
i haven t worked with any more than jpg png and gif so there might be some more image types out there that can fit into this function bmp

6817093google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		pattern0		
google-chrome is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however firefox is worse than google-chrome in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than google-chrome but the innerhtml test runs much faster than google-chrome

6817388onclick	onchange
pattern8		
here s something that should get you started - this is all based on the assumption that there are only 3 checkboxes on your whole page and that you re interested in all of them - you ll want to make a method like this respond to your checkbox elements onclick events - i ve found that to be more reliable than onchange

6817512integer	unsigned
pattern4		
you have to explicitly select unsigned else it is a signed integer by default so your values can be negatives as well

6818221typedef	struct
pattern10	less	pattern10	less	
c++ allows you to define struct without the struct keyword so the typedef is used less often

6819467swt	swing
pattern0		
i find swt to be an uglier api than swing in general though but not really a deal breaker

6823252jlist	jtable
pattern0		
i think jtable would be better jcomponents as jlist because there you can implements tablecelleditor maybe example with similair output here

6824099microchip	avr
pattern10		pattern10		pattern0		
microchip is more successful in industry and has better tools than avr

6824099microchip	avr
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
as far as easy goes they are both equivalent in terms of difficulty both provide assembly and c except that the gnu toolchain for avr is more complex than microchip because it requires use of unix command line etc

6831617multiplying	addition
pattern7		pattern0		
you can try x1 c1 and then x1 + c1 but i don t think the addition is much faster than multiplying on todays cpus

6833952hash	md5
pattern3		
another way would be to compare using md5 or sha-1 hash of the certificate data

6836365asihttprequest	cfnetwork
pattern7		pattern0		
you can use asihttprequest which is quite better than cfnetwork

6839494for-loop	loops
pattern7		
update i made some changes to my code but was already suspecting what others here have already pointed out sure the enhanced for-loop is slower but outside of very trivial tight loops the cost should be a miniscule fraction of the cost of the logic of loops

6841928ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
pattern0		
generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course

6842468button	checkbox
pattern4		
and when i select checkbox and then unselect the same checkbox i can t get back to add button state

6846575hash	salt
pattern2		
during user login rather than retreive the salt from db create the hashpasword in my code and then compare with hash in db i am told i can do this straight in my stored procedure

6850613profiling	instrumentation
pattern4		
if i m opening xcode choose profiling and choose one instrumentation let s

6850687gif	png
pattern0		
it will always be a web format which basically comes down to jpg png and gif with gif being very unlikely because of its limitations gif can contain 256 colors at most and is generally larger than png

6851760division	subtraction
pattern7		pattern0		
in this case division has higher precedence than subtraction parenthesis around the division or not

6854093range	minimum
pattern0		
the maximum length is only one more than the minimum length abc de fgh i jkl mn opq has seven sub-lists as well but the range of lengths is two here

6856123teamcity	jenkins
pattern4		
it would be nice to compare teamcity extensive notifications setup with the same of hudson or jenkins

6860521post	put	urllib	httplib
pattern0		pattern0		
the requests library can handle post put delete and all other http methods and is significantly less scary than urllib httplib and their variants

6864308integer	unsigned
pattern4		
warning implicit conversion loses integer precision clock_t aka unsigned long to unsigned int

6864746min	max
pattern4		
i have the following code which i wrote with the help of the following thread how to select min and max values of a column in a datatable

6868939postgresql	mysql
pattern10	count faster	pattern10	count faster	
copied from comment below i m looking for a statement like in mysql and postgresql count is faster for short queries exists is faster for long queries and use queryset 0 when it s likely that you re going to need the first element and you want to check that it exists

6869485textview	imageview
pattern7		pattern0		
the imageview is bit taller than the textview and so what i do is add padding margins to the bottom of textview to get it align and look like the imageview and textview horizontal centers are aligned

6872157swing	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swt	windowbuilder
pattern4		
for eclipse i recommend windowbuilder you can build swt and swing applications with wb

6873777rss	feed
pattern10	longer	pattern10	longer	
the content of the text is set from an rss feed that is usually longer that that can be displayed in the text box

6876818as.date	posixct
pattern4		
i prefer as.date for dates and strptime for posixct objects dates and times

6877294hash	salt
pattern7		
personally i use sha-512 with a salt because a bigger number in the hash name means a better hash

6879159hash	md5
pattern0		
use hash and choose hashing algorithm that suits you well if possible something stronger than md5 but don t go all the way to sha512 either

6880451children	parent
pattern7		pattern10		pattern10		
children is faster than find for example just like parent is faster than parent

6881575ati	nvidia
pattern4		pattern0		
another reason to choose nvidia is because that s what the hpc system builders have been building systems with since nvidia made a huge push for gpgpu computing where as it s less backed by amd ati

6881820post	get
pattern2		
if there s match with post it takes priority and action under post is executed else get

6883410quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	better	
quicksort is generally regarded as mutable and may therefore be less useful in a functional setting but mergesort is generally better suited for a functional setting

6884809pull	push
pattern2		
in short this is what we refer to in order to compare against pull or fetch from and push to

6885534innodb	myisam
pattern4		
i am using mysql server and i came to know that mysql uses both innodb and myisam engine.so i want to know for any big project which engine should i choose innodb or myisam

6888665mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern7		
mouseleave div becomes thicker which will cause an almost automatic mouseenter

6894530width	height

pattern4		
textmate or macvim as the ide gvim or vim for the linux folk usually though some prefer emacs

6905409xuggle	vlcj
pattern2		
so after my research and findings i d recommend going with vlcj but definitely using out of process players if you just want to play record stream video stuff and xuggle if you want to do any low level video work with the codecs themselves

6910173ssl	https
pattern3		
in the case of phpmyadmin - if this is running on a webserver on your network then you ll need to forward port 80 too - although i d recommend using https ssl port 443

6912364robocopy	xcopy
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
use robocopy it s much more powerful than xcopy

6916614google-chrome	firefox
pattern10		pattern10		
firefox has a more advanced plugin than the google-chrome extension but both work

6922589matlabpool	parfor
pattern7	easier	
in general parfor with matlabpool is an easier combination to use than dfeval

6922589matlabpool	parfor
pattern7	less	
also when you open a matlabpool the workers are launched and ready so the overhead of parfor is much less but still not zero as the body of the loop needs to be sent to the workers

6922874disk	ram
pattern0		
it won t do anything to change the fact that disk io is orders of magnitude slower than ram

6937090mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern0		
take a look at mouseenter and mouseleave events they are better than mousemove and mouseenter combinations

6941020concave	convex
pattern10		pattern10		
but determining a concave hull is far more difficult than a convex hull

6942102apache	nginx
pattern0		
4 i d like to understand why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

6943212getter	setter
pattern3		
i would prefer using setter and getter that way if way your change some implementation details for example introduce validation on value assign you jest have to change that in one place in setter.

6946769children	parent
pattern4		
i m trying to write a sql query in ms sql server 2008 that will match parent rows where the parent match and all their children match

6951865ubuntu	centos
pattern7	better	
i would however argue that ubuntu or centos is a better option when it comes to server installations

6953704min	max
pattern4		
you need to tell if it needs to select min max average sum or something else

6953978width	height
pattern10	more	pattern10	more appropriate	
the purpose of using a percentage here for me was in using one gradient to support large and small containers with size appropriate stripes while also auto sizing to either height or width whichever is more appropriate for the specific element

6955700width	height
pattern0		
i interpred this to mean that for example the width will be 5 8th of the width of the working area unless this results in the dialog which is taller than the height of the working area in which case it will use a wider width

6957715requestfactory	gwt-rpc
pattern0		pattern0		
go with gwt-rpc or better newer with requestfactory

6960666django	web2py
pattern4		
i also prefer web2py s templating language to django s as it allows pure python and does not require one to learn a separate templating language at all

6963013xuggle	vlcj
pattern0		
apart from that you might want to give xuggle a try - it works on a much lower level than vlcj but this should give you much more control over what s happening and unlike jmf it s a good actively maintained project.

6965355for-loop	loops
pattern7		
to my mind a for-loop is simpler to understand than traversing the list backwards with a while loops

6967869int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
since int is normally wider than chars truncates the value of int being assigned

6975743postgresql	mysql
pattern10	more	pattern10	more strict	
mysql does a lot of implicit type conversions postgresql is rather more strict and requires you to say exactly what you mean

6976914fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter
pattern7		
for a few bytes passed in just one call probably the bufferedwriter is even worse because it problably later calls fileoutputstream

6977614cos	sin
pattern0		
after reading a question related with the performance of sin cos why is std sin and std cos slower than sin and cos

6984826nltk	lingpipe
pattern7	easier	
lingpipe probably also has something built in but nltk is much easier to use

6985935int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
the basis being that an int is larger than a chars and as such there is no chance of loss of information in the conversion

6988219partcover	opencover
pattern0		
you may also find that opencover will work better than partcover as it has 32 and 64 bit support as well as supporting .net2 and .net4 - and copes much better with target processes that spin off more processes to do the actual testing

6989690ant	maven
pattern7		pattern7		
maven can t be compared with ant as in maven vs ant maven is more than a build script than ant is

6990821width	height
pattern0		
if they do that could be adding more space beyond the width and height of #bob forcing scrollbars to appear

6997297width	height
pattern7		pattern7	greater	
button width is 2px greater in ie7 and button height is 4px greater in ie7

7003476hash	salt
pattern0		
most attacks involve generating hash for common passwords so for reasonably complicated passwords it becomes harder especially with salt some people use usernames as salt others use randomly generated numbers

7004001pop-up	dialog
pattern7	better	
however if you re making a pop-up dialog it s better to detect if the user is not on a mobile device then use the css position fixed

7007053des	aes
pattern0		
des is usually substantially slower than aes on modern hardware and has keys that are far too short for modern use

7008024strtol	atoi
pattern4		pattern2		
strings to integers hint prefer strtol over atoi

7008770apache	nginx
pattern4		
i would like to ask which server to choose apache or nginx to host the application in ror

7012987google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
in google-chrome it is appearing higher than the original in firefox

to return a random integer equal or greater than min smaller or equal to max with chance probability of the result to equal x and 100-chance probability spread uniformly among all other results in the given range

7017638vb.net	vb6
pattern10		pattern10		
especially as vb6 is becoming more and more of a distant memory and the vb.net language takes on a life of its own in conjunction with the core .net framework advancing

7017815children	parent
pattern0		
as for inheriting opacity - children cannot be less opaque than parent but could be more

7022434button	checkbox
pattern10	more	pattern10	more appropriate	
edit since you say you can t add a none option and want to use a checkbox even though i strongly disagree on checkbox where a radio button is more appropriate - a common ui error .

7025166marmalade	bada
pattern0		
cocos2d-x already works with marmalade so if you want to take your cocos2d game to ios android symbian webos bada rim qnx and more check out marmalade

7027926jar	war
pattern7	files easier	
accessing and dynamically reloading non-class resources inside jar war files is way easier

7028094width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
i m trying to figure out why the java print api can t handle paper sizes where the width is greater than the height

7028094width	height
pattern7		
the mediasize class and all of it s inner classes only have sizes where the height is greater then the width

7028094width	height
pattern0		
i ve found some things online that state that the height must always be greater than the width and have seen in the java source checks for this with accompanying messages that this is the case but cannot find a reason why

7029421pbkdf2	hash
pattern0		
key strengthening techniques such as bcrypt or pbkdf2 are generally considered better than plain hash since cracking them requires more resources

7031837ant	maven
pattern4		
i also prefer ant script over maven

7033356min	max
pattern4		
i can inject a hook into running processes to catch when they create destroy max min

7036748gridview	onclientclick
pattern3		
either way i lose getting onclientclick events for my gridview

7037601int	chars
pattern0		
in some cases it will be exactly defined in java or c# an int is exactly 32bits and a long is 64bits while in others like c c++ only the relationships among the types are defined long is not smaller than int which in turn is not smaller than short then chars ...

7037608int	double
pattern7	more	
in case of primitives memory comes into play.if you are going to store double into int as in your example double takes more memory as compare to integer.so there is chance of data lose.so compiler throw error.if you cast yourself then you know what you are doing so compiler let that do

7037750int	double
pattern7	slower	
it s that or generated code be it the fact that you can fit less 64-bit int in a sse register or round a double to a 64-bit int is slower

7041278width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
its height is greater than width

7044157activemq	rabbitmq

7045984opera	firefox
pattern4		
i have validated the html and the same page tests fine in ie9 win firefox win and opera win

7049206union	distinct
pattern4		
the union operator will throw out duplicate rows between the two result sets much like select distinct does for a single result set

7049468onkeyup	onkeydown
pattern10		pattern10		
usually onkeydown is more preferable then onkeyup for such combo

7052046google-chrome	safari
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
here ajax form breaks after adding html5 attributes in google-chrome safari is a better description and workaround

7056431for-loop	loops
pattern7		
in theory the while loops is quicker because the for-loop looks up the length attribute of foo every time though loops but in real-world use it s going to make an immeasurably small difference

7057154innodb	myisam
pattern10	more	pattern10	more advanced	
i don t want to use myisam because innodb is more advanced

7057368google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
as google-chrome s v8 is dramatically faster than firefox s spidermonkey at the moment these things are constantly in flux pick the forward loop as it s faster on the slower engine

7059384int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
this does implicitly at least sort of assume that chars has a smaller range than int so the conversion to int allows at least one value to be represented that couldn t have come from the file

7061343udp	mtu
pattern0		
to send large blocks of data via udp you need to chop them up into pieces smaller than the mtu for the network segment across which you re transmitting them

7062618jsf	seam	richfaces	icefaces
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
seam is more powerful with jsf but not necessarily richfaces or icefaces for they mostly just extend the component set which is anyway fall down to standard html components when rendered by jsf

7063356salt	md5
pattern0		
bcrypt is considered the most secure way to implement password hashing with salt because it is slow - much slower than an md5

7065060width	height
pattern4		
after clicking on add to cart the customer can choose width and height

7067001cpython	pypy

pattern0		
i d like to have the view tehnology be jsps i find them much easier than freemarker or velocity

7069978awt	swing	swt	swing
pattern4		
you should not use awt except you are confined to an applet otherwise prefer swing or swt

7069984awt	swing
pattern7		
note first there is no combobox item in awt there is jcombobox in swing which is better to use than choice of awt

7070048gitolite	gitosis
pattern0		
for this the best option is gitolite better than gitosis

7070907bottle	flask
pattern4		
i d recommend bottle or flask both of which are very minimal and impose no constraints on you whatsoever

7073940goto	break
pattern10		pattern10		
it is the equivalent of a goto but is more restrictive in that labels may be used only in break or continue statements

7074248post	get
pattern4		
for example when i choose post how do i get a set of post that made traffic from that post or set of post that trafficked to that post etc

7074620drawimage	putimagedata

that beeing said putimagedata is much slower than drawimage at least when i tested them earlier this year

7078126sorting	grouping
pattern10	more	pattern10	more efficient	
alter how i am joining the tables together so that the sorting of the results for the grouping by is more efficient and then hopefully remove the tmp table as well

7079643kerberos	ntlm
pattern8		
it seems a little bit more straight forward than kerberos but provides good ntlm sso capabilities

7080853addslashes	multibyte
pattern0		
as mysql_real_escape_string escapes characters according to default charset so it is better than addslashes function and it properly sanitizes sql injections arising out of abuse of multibyte character sets but in another article here a workaround-scenario is shown that explains that injection can still be done

7083852pop-up	dialog
pattern7	user	
however when i run my program on windows 8 dev preview it always pop-up dialog that asks user to enable .net 3.51

7088326firefox	safari
pattern0		
then ie seems to be reasonable but cant be faster than firefox or safari

7089327gmail	hotmail
pattern7	less	pattern7	less	
newsletters in email campaign tools like outlook gmail hotmail has less css support

7089680int	double
pattern7		
the problem is that the precision of the data type int is smaller as the precision of double the function pow returns double therefore the value of binarychar i will be implizit converted to double and so on.

7093990width	height
pattern0		
because the width was bigger than the height of the pictures the img element was too small and the rotated picture overlaid some of the text above and below

7094415width	height

likewise if we change img and #clock to have a defined width instead of a defined height then we have a clock that can scale properly but only if the viewport height is greater than the width

7094585division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern0		pattern0		pattern7	worse	pattern7	worse	
it is well-known that the processor instruction for multiplication takes several times more time than addition division is even worse upd which is not true any more see below

7094585addition	multiplication	multiplication	exponent	exponent	addition
pattern0		pattern0		
so ideally i want to have approximate relative times of elementary operations execution like multiplication typically takes 5 times more time than addition exponent is about 100 multiplication

put and delete are often not used leaving get and post to map to select get and create update and delete post

7119590int	chars
pattern0		
chars is just another int type usually 8 bits and smaller than int but still an int type

7121938distance	altitude
pattern10		pattern10		
a negative verticalaccuracy signifies that altitude is invalid whereas normally a smaller but positive value of verticalaccuracy actually means that altitude is more precise since it s the vertical distance that it may be off by - i ll leave the discussion as to why this measure is called verticalaccuracy and not verticalinaccuracy for some other time

7123723qhash	qmap
pattern10		pattern10		
qhash is faster but qmap values are sorted by key if you iterate through them

7125220children	parent
pattern10		pattern10		
as harypyon suggests storing the children is a more efficient way of viewing this problem than storing the parent and then computing the children

7125453width	height
pattern4		pattern2		
what i m building is a slideshow of images that occupy the full viewport recalculating the image s width height and left properties on resize so that the image is always centered favors width over height except when the viewport is taller than it is wide resizing does not reload the page just fires a function to resize the image

7127313minimum	max
pattern0		
look-up in the case of failure should be constant time if the current element is less than the minimum element of the heap containing the max m elements we can reject it outright

7128116children	parent
pattern0		
this is a very simple case which will do that asuming your children always have a higher id than their parent

i know tlistbox renders like this but i require the use of tlistview for the data property also the tlistview handles icons better via a timagelist

7132951post	get
pattern3		
i would recommend using post or get depending on the variable size - cookies come with a lot of limitations and conditions

7134141setinterval	settimeout
pattern7	slower	
this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right

7137105pull	push
pattern7	simpler	
you can do this either in a push or pull based fashion pull is probably simpler just poll for changes

7138980google-chrome	safari
pattern0		
i think safari renders the moves better than google-chrome

7138980google-chrome	safari
pattern8		
the safari controller bar is the quicktime bar which is smaller and dark so the movement is less noticeable than google-chrome which has a big blue progress bar

7141487min	max
pattern4		
doesn t say anything about swapping the start_expression and end_expression to match min and max values

7141688width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
the layout s height is less than the height of everything else and the width of the layout is the same as everything else but when i use layout.getheight and layout.getwidth in my onresume they always return 0 so i can t really use that

firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie

7161481des	aes
pattern3		
personally i would recommend using aes as its very easy to implement and with it being sensitive personal data would provide enough encryption to keep people out unlike something like des

7168482getdate	dateadd
pattern4		pattern4		
for example select getdate + 1 returns the same as select dateadd day 1 getdate and cast 40777.44281 as datetime is the same as 2011-08-24 10 37 38.783

7169035for-loop	loops	google-chrome	firefox

dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does

7188249gdal	ogr
pattern7	more	pattern7	more	
fdo provides those features too interestingly thanks to integration with gdal ogr in some places like fdo provider for gdal but it feels more like a framework whereas gdal ogr feels more like a library

7188551realloc	malloc
pattern7		pattern0		
realloc is worse than malloc in that you will need to have the old and new pointers valid during the realloc

7188551realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
pattern7		pattern0		
i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free

this particular jboss runs in a vm with 4gb of ram and 2 cpu s and more than enough disk space it has never has less than 5gb free at any time

7205747post	get
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
get is more appropriate than post for queries because of its safe semantics

7207166profiling	debugging
pattern0		
another thing to try is the excellent entity framework profiling - has saved us many headaches in debugging performance issues like these - gives you a lot more than sql profiling and you can see what queries objects are created per objectcontext and method source line etc -

7208454primes	modulus
pattern0		
it wouldn t be especially likely that they d occur an exact multiple of 257 bytes apart but it s a risk which can be avoided by using a primes modulus provided at least that the number of bytes in the file is smaller than the modulus

7209324apache	nginx
pattern4		
to start nginx usr local nginx sbin nginx note i had to kill apache first sudo etc init.d apache2 stop

7212715post	get

i normally use something like this tag.object.annotate num_post count post .filter num_post__gt 2 to get tags with more than 2 post

7214433postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
but in mysql it is ok and in postgresql it is wrong and ask for the other fields besides site_id either in a group by clause or in a aggregation function i know that postgresql is stricter on sql than mysql so i must select the site_id in the query object of msg_published but in pure sqlalchemy i can do like this

7217307postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
this is one of the primary reasons i prefer postgresql over mysql for new development

7220022macports	homebrew
pattern4		
most people i know use homebrew or macports i prefer macports because of its clean cut of what is a default mac os x environment and my development setup

7221963int	boolean
pattern8		
i always assumed that boolean were more efficient than int at storing an on off value - considering that s their reason for existence

7221963google-chrome	firefox

on google-chrome it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on firefox it s slightly faster to do this using bool

7222395codeigniter	cakephp
pattern7		pattern0		
cakephp is considered slower than codeigniter but you can tweak it to enhance speed

7222776guard	autotest
pattern0		
i recently moved from autotest to guard for a reason it works better than autotest and it has a lot of available guard

7222776guard	autotest
pattern10		pattern10		
in other words guard is more a generic framework for every process which needs to do something triggered by a file change autotest is restricted to running tests

pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	less	
find out if the height is less or the width is less

7251797viewmodel	caliburn
pattern4		
for wp7 apps i prefer caliburn micro because it does a lot of work for you like making it easy to navigate pages in the forced view first approach but then makes using the viewmodel first approach on sub pages easy as well

7257570uinavigationbar	uitabbarcontroller

7258066wordpress	joomla
pattern7		
imho creating templates for joomla is the easier than most other cms i know typo wordpress modx as you simply have to replace parts of the static version with joomla tags menu content etc. it still needs some time to get used to the system but its not that hard

7263012mktime	strtotime
pattern0		
you d be better off using mktime for this as it s dumber than strtotime

7264181swt	swing
pattern4		
you can directly compare swing and eclipse rcp swing equivalent is swt and they have comparable features

7264303jasmine	qunit
pattern4		
i recommend jasmine because it fits the way i like to write tests but if you are looking for more of an xunit clone qunit is also very well made

7264312urwid	ncurses
pattern0		
easier than ncurses would be to use urwid

7265454bellman-ford	floyd-warshall
pattern0		
because bellman-ford runs in time o mn the overall asymptotic runtime is still o mn + n 2 log n so if m o n 2 note that this is little-o of n this approach is asymptotically faster than using floyd-warshall

7269126ethernet	wireless

it will continue to be available but since opus is better than speex in all aspects users are encouraged to switch

7271789qtkit	quicktime
pattern10		pattern10		
you can do it with qtkit but works better in 32bit quicktime framework

7274114sorting	filtering
pattern0		
but right now the sorting step is taking way longer than the filtering step so i would like to combine them in some way

7274258sorting	filtering
pattern0		
if almost all elements fail the filtering then it s considerably slower than just sorting everything since you ll end up selecting thousands of times

7275914children	parent

an unsigned integer is a better choice for a value being treated as a set of bits anyway.

7280126int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
since chars is smaller than int it has to be converted to an int

7280929disk	ram
pattern7		
access to disk is slower so when you ve written to a file it will be flushed to disk and no longer reside in ram which means that next time you need the file you might be going to get it from disk slow whereas in memory mapped files you know the file is in ram and you can have faster access to it then when it s on disk

7287150udp	tcp
pattern0		
the problem with using tcp is obviously that it is a lot slower than udp

7290220switching	screens

do be careful of boundaries and prefer strncpy to strcpy -- the later is unsafe

7313024mdpi	hdpi
pattern0		
when you put images into hdpi folder their appearance is smaller than from mdpi and ldpi

7314774disk	ram

safari behaves better than firefox but an error message â œone error in opening the pageâ â shows up in the status bar if you remove the iframe during the load event

7322907post	get
pattern4		
you can send them via get or post--though i highly recommend post since it changes data so using a get would technically be against http specs

7328194gridview	repeater
pattern7		
repeater has fewer templates then gridview

7328933jsf	seam
pattern8		pattern0		
cdi is so much more mature than seam 2 bijection jsf 2 is so much easier than jsf 1.2 that any kind of application development will simply be much more fun with seam 3

7329214udp	tcp

7332444google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s

map your image servlet on an url pattern of and get the image id or filename by request.getpathinfo and finally select it as inputstream from the db and write it to outputstream of the response

7335774innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
as you are no doubt aware from your searches innodb is primarily better than myisam for high volume inserts not counting non-comparable features like foreign keys or full text searches which are exclusive to innodb and myisam respectively while myisam is primarily useful for tables which are read more often than they are written to

7341789post	get

qnx is most famous for being the real time operating system of which there are two versions qnx rtos v4 is an older product but is still used in many existing systems and still supported by the company

7372734quicksort	mergesort
pattern10		pattern10		
that s hard to say.the worst of mergesort is n log2n -n+1 which is accurate if n equals 2 k i have already proved this .and for any n it s between n lg n - n + 1 and n lg n + n + o lg n .but for quicksort its best is nlog2n also n equals 2 k .if you divide mergesort by quicksort it equals one when n is infinite.so it s as if the worst case of mergesort is better than the best case of quicksort why do we use quicksort

7373489int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
the compiler may generate warning messages for such conversion as sizeof int is greater than sizeof chars

7374426udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp

7377302google-chrome	firefox
pattern8		
firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such

7377521notepad	textpad
pattern0		
on windows machine i would probably go with textpad personally i now use programmers notepad 2 however it does not support a spell checker and i don t really thinks it s better than textpad by any measure

7379026hash	md5
pattern8		
you didn t elaborate on that point but if you were simply looking for a more secure algorithm than md5 take a look at hash coupled with an algorithm like sha512

right now putimagedata is much slower than drawimage as you can see here

7380818eigen	ublas
pattern0		pattern0		
from my own experience mtl4 is much faster than ublas and it is also faster than eigen

7381501disk	ram
pattern0		
also keep in mind that once ram is exhausted your program will start running in virtual memory on disk which will probably cause far more disk i o activity than the program itself so if you re concerned about disk i o your best bet is probably to make sure that the batch of data you re working on in memory doesn t get much greater than available ram

7381842post	get
pattern0		
instead i m using post which isn t exactly bullet proof but still a better choice than get in this case

7381844post	get
pattern4		
you can still mix and match post and get data on this form using the and php super globals respectively

7382971gridview	radgrid
pattern7		pattern0		
each tab contains multiple radgrids as radgrid is heavier than asp.net gridview

pattern7		pattern0		
since it s an exported method clients should get an exception on their abstraction level so illegalargumentexception is better than nullpointerexception

7392125apache	nginx
pattern10		pattern10		
apache is more flexable then nginx but it comes with a high price in performance

7397043free	malloc
pattern4		
you can almost certainly get away with not free ing allocated memory when your program terminates since it will be reclaimed by the operating system but just as a matter of style and good practice you should still match malloc s with free s.

7400055udp	tcp

your normal sized image should be optimized for mdpi 160dpi while the ldpi image is 25 smaller 120dpi and the hdpi image is 50 larger 240dpi

7418727django	web2py
pattern4		
imho it is harder to learn how to create fast and simple web apps with django which is why i recommend web2py

7419491mp3	ogg
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
firefox doesn t support mp3 on html5 they support ogg which is better anyway

7419841filesystems	fat
pattern7		pattern0		
since the filesystems is more than likely fat or fat32 protecting it permission based way would be more convoluted

7419895put	get
pattern4		
i always get errors such as no route matches put galleries 1 photos

7421214cpu	processors
pattern0		
should i just look for more than one cpu core and how do i detect that or maybe the processors speed or total system memory

7423844postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
also would prefer mysql over postgresql based on my experience level with mysql

7429147recv	epoll
pattern4		
there is a scheduling delay between the time when data becomes available in the kernel socket buffer and the time when the receiving process is woken up from a blocking read recv select epoll etc

7432356firefox	safari
pattern7		pattern0		
the service is still in beta trial and firefox conversion is working better than safari one

7435111primefaces	tomahawk
pattern4		
if you re not on jsf 2.2 yet or if you don t like primefaces ui grab tomahawk which renders the same plain html output as but supports a attribute so that you can position the items by the way you want

7435579profiling	debugging
pattern4		
there s lots of profiling and also win debugging that will let you see details of memory allocation and deallocation as well as fragmentation

7435596google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	lighter	
however with this method image in firefox appears to be blurred at least if resized and in google-chrome it looks lighter sic

7438383children	parent
pattern4		
this way you don t have to select children parent etc.

7448874cng	cryptoapi
pattern7	more	
however it s important to recall that most of .net cryptography is based on cryptoapi even if cng is being more and more exposed in recent fx releases

7449937opera	google-chrome
pattern8		
since you noted thoughts on other browsers would be helpful opera s kiosk mode seems more powerful than google-chrome s

7453617matplotlib	scipy
pattern7	clan better	
the scipy numpy matplotlib clan is much better at dealing with huge amounts of volume data than matlab or at least gnu octave in my experience

7453679int	double
pattern4		
now if i choose a double as a type of primary key then it will store unnecessary 6 bytes since double is 8 bytes and int is 2 to only support two double numbers and i can t choose int

7454181mdpi	hdpi
pattern0		
ideally the hdpi version of your button should be 1.5 times bigger than the mdpi baseline version

7454757division	multiplication
pattern0		pattern0		
it can be used for speed being significantly faster than division multiplication when dealing with operands that are powers of two but clarity of code is usually preferred over raw speed

7456787sorting	filtering
pattern4		
if user wants to filtering the list he can choose sorting order cocktail s starting letter and strength

7457664innodb	tokudb
pattern4		
there s also tokudb engine that surpasses innodb in terms of scaling both better than memory engine

7458116equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
however these two instances will not compare as equals because they are different instances and you haven t overridden equals and gethashcode by necessity

7458183equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

7458411width	height	gif	png
pattern7		pattern7	greater	
so this script will take a jpg gif of png image resize it to 110px width if width is greater of 110px height if height is greater

7458988onchange	onkeyup	onchange	onblur	onkeyup	onblur
pattern10	more	pattern10	more sane	
also onchange won t work you ll need to use onkeyup although onblur is probably more sane

7459618division	multiplication
pattern0		
yes division is usually much slower than multiplication

7460115children	parent
pattern0		
in case of min heap when you insert the element which is less than some nodes in the tree the data structure now doesn t follow heap condition in case of min heap value of parent should be less than its children so you have to shift up and up

7460216division	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
on most processors division is slower than multiplication for the same data types

7461536hash	md5
pattern10	more	pattern10	more likely	
or will this result in an md5 hash that is more likely to collide than if i would concatenate the content of all dependent files together

7462460children	parent
pattern0		
i know mysql has to choose for either mandatory or optional but mandatory seems the illogical choice for me as this is 1 much more difficult to implement in sql and 2 less common than a parent with optional children

7462682apache	nginx
pattern8		
i m significantly more comfortable with apache but learning to use nginx has been pretty exciting or as exciting as learning to configure a new webserver can be

7463387apache	nginx
pattern0		
nginx uses an event based non blocking single thread and the memory usage is relatively much lower than apache

7464279multiplying	addition
pattern7		pattern0		
we don t actually multiplying it s slower than simple addition and as you can see we destroy temporary register t0 but don t touch s0 s1

7465290memcached	apc
pattern7		pattern0		
memcached is faster than apc as zend_cache backend but you still need apc extension installed even in development mode to get a great speedup of your code

7472356int	double
pattern7		pattern0		
you can also use math.floor double to get the closest int that is less than the double

7472356int	double
pattern10		pattern10		
or math.ceil double which returns the closest int that is more than the double

7474411min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
another idea was after im done all the inserts then just delete the rows where the schedule_time is greater than the min value in the schedule_time column and the schedule_time is less than the max value in the schedule_time column

7475721salt	md5
pattern7	better	
so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + super-extra-cool_hash and quite enough

7477202mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
pattern8		
some browsers implement the mouseenter mouseleave events that i ve noticed are more accurate than mouseout

7480271prng	random
pattern10		pattern10		
then you use it as seed in random which is less good that one is a non-cryptographic prng and its output may exhibit some structure which will not register in a statistical measurement tool but might be exploited by an intelligent attacker

7482113hide	show
pattern4		pattern4		
it means that i can click on the diagram background and select hide dependencies and then select show associations etc...i can also click on a class and see all related classes having dependencies associations etc...with this class

7483364ord	chr
pattern3		
also i think you should prefer using chr and ord instead of the casts

7489122selecteditem	selectedindex
pattern4		
a better option is to have the list box databound to a list or observableobject collection then also two way databind the selecteditem or selectedindex i prefer selecteditem to a property

7491267vmware	virtualbox
pattern4		
you have to buy vmware 64bit or you can use virtualbox from oracle for free

7491536openssl	gnutls	nss	gnutls
pattern10		pattern10		
nss is more strict than either openssl or gnutls

7492861innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern7	better	
there may be some exotic corner cases where myisam performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be innodb unless you can prove you have a case that myisam does better

7492861innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam

7495299margin	height
pattern0		
the margin will be greater than the height of the iframe

7496460visualvm	jprofiler
pattern4		
the major free one is visualvm and as a commercial solution i recommend jprofiler disclaimer my company develops that tool

7497275children	parent
pattern4		
i think i d prefer children over parent as that s the way the hierarchy is set up in those .xml files admin user user visitor

7501430multiplying	add
pattern0		
moreover i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

7501702multiplying	add
pattern0		
i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

7504168disk	ram
pattern0		
in other words the operating system is using some of your hard disk space to satisfy your 13 mb allocation request at great expense of speed since the hard disk is much much slower than ram

7505114button	checkbox
pattern4		
the web page checkbox radio button select lists custom html form elements shows how to use js and a little css to achieve styled select checkbox and radio fields

7505789urllib	httplib
pattern7		
basically - httplib is lower level while urllib is high-level

7508613superclass	subclassing
pattern4		
right click on project name on package explorer + add new class + type package name name subclassing name and superclass or click on browse to choose superclass

7510119lift	scalatra
pattern8		
it fills the gap between scalatra and lift more powerful than scalatra and easier to use than lift

7512745children	parent
pattern4		
so far i ve done this but it only selects children who are dead not parent status 5 is deceased

7513445width	height
pattern0		
this is for the case when the height of the image is larger than the width

7514203gridbaglayout	miglayout
pattern8		
look at the quick start guide on the miglayout site it s a lot less difficult than gridbaglayout and much more powerful

7519297quicksort	heapsort
pattern7		pattern0		
after several tests i found out that my heapsort is way quicker than quicksort i think it should be the other way around my selection sort is also faster than insertion sort

7519470int	double
pattern7	larger	
most commonly it will be exactly 8 bytes more generally sizeof int or sizeof double whichever is larger but compilers are permitted to add unnamed padding to structs and unions

7521113width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if width is bigger than height print image-horizontal else print image-vertical

7525434width	height
pattern0		
so the image can t go larger than the height or width

7529473cpython	pypy
pattern7		pattern0		
i saw that pypy is generally faster than cpython

7529678width	height
pattern0		
it also has a padding equal to could also be higher than the width height of the border images to make up for the room they take up

7532292quicksort	heapsort
pattern0		
when you say something like heapsort should be faster than quicksort what makes you say that

7533484margin	height
pattern7		
it is treating the floated ul as position absolute but only when its height is less than or equal to the negative top margin on its containing parent

7533837fold	combinators
pattern8		
i m also looking for more examples and explanations of complex combinators more complex than fold in common programming languages

7535983domxpath	domdocument
pattern3		
i would recommend using domdocument to parse the html and domxpath to query the document tree

7536686disk	ram
pattern0		pattern10	faster	
memory is thousands of times faster than disk so if something gets read often having it in ram is drastically faster

7536851filtering	grouping
pattern4		
this gives you a functional way of dealing with collections of data in a very sql-like manner select grouping filtering etc.

7537352getter	setter
pattern7	method quicker	
if you are not notifying or doing anything else then the automatic getter setter method is the quicker to develop that is not claiming it is the fastest or slowest to execute though

7538579int	chars
pattern0		
for example for types smaller than int if two types chars and short int are added they are promoted to int before any arithmetic operation and result is an int type

7541324cpython	pypy
pattern7		
pypy has a higher recursion limit than cpython normally

7541844shadowing	named
pattern0		
i believe the reasoning behind it is that it allows the parameters to be named nicer by preventing shadowing of member variables

7543024gson	jackson
pattern4		
i m only interested in a small subset of properties of the json so gson was nice because of its very concise syntax but i m losing an internal battle to continue to use gson as jackson is already used elsewhere in our application and it has documented better performance which i concede are both good reasons to lose gson

7544060mouse	keyboard
pattern7	slower	
there is an addon that can even remove the menu bar â you ll need to learn keyboard shortcuts this is a good idea anyway moving a hand to from the mouse is much slower

7548458disk	ram
pattern10		pattern10		
ram is much faster then disk io

7549951hide	show
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
in my opinion using jquery show hide is a better solution at this point in time

7551417hash	salt
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
even though they re hash salt it s still better that attackers do not see them

7554853division	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
or is there something about multiplication that is more convenient than division in programming

7554853division	multiplication
pattern7		pattern7		pattern0		
on many machines particularly those without hardware support for division division is a slower operation than multiplication so this approach can yield a considerable speedup

7555572pull	push
pattern0		
is the performance of pull better than push in this scenario

7556748addition	multiplication
pattern2		
multiplication wins out over addition as demonstrated by the corresponding parse tree

7558548junit	cactus
pattern7		
junit is older and have more extensions dbunit cactus etc

7558597innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam

7558745innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
myisam uses less memory than innodb and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for innodb

7561657onchange	onblur
pattern7		pattern0		
onchange is a better choice than onblur or focusout because blur and focusout also fire when the contents of the text field hasn t changed

7583971vaadin	smartgwt
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
thus i think vaadin is more suitable for intranet and takes less time to develop your app while smartgwt is better for more complex gui or unstable connections where additional roundtrips matter

7586355shapefile	geojson
pattern4		
shapefile beats geojson for large not mega data

7587624postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
if you want to use sql i strongly reccommend postgresql it seems to deal with large databases and frequent writes a lot better than mysql

7590072gson	jackson
pattern0		
i found jackson better than gson performance project activity better docs ...

7590072gson	jackson
pattern4		
take a look at this related question that compares jackson vs gson

7593049hash	salt
pattern2		
the first which would retrive the salt associated with the user in the db - use salt to prepare password to match with hash

7596704mp3	wav
pattern7		
i understand that mp3 is much smaller but it has worst audio quality when is compared to wav files

7597168qdir	qregexp
pattern0		
there is certainly no need to call grep or ls because the same can be done easier with qregexp and qdir

7600921glut	sdl	glut	glfw	glfw	sdl
pattern4		
you can use glfw sdl or glut for getting those personally i recommend glfw if you need only one single window

7602595single-quotes	double-quotes
pattern3		
i prefer using single-quotes instead of double-quotes unless quoting something with a single-quote inside it s a bit more javascript-y

7603612min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
than for each element if it s larger than max update max if it s lower than min update min

7603776udp	tcp
pattern0		
from experience i can tell you udp is about 10-15 faster than tcp on dedicated and udp-tuned networks

7608578umbraco	dotnetnuke
pattern0		
consider umbraco its architecture is definitely better than dotnetnuke s

7610958xslt	xquery
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
this kind of processing is most easily done with xslt which is more expressive than xquery

7611278innodb	myisam
pattern4		pattern2		
i d recommend innodb over myisam because of better transactional properties

7616319width	height
pattern0		
if i set the editor to 300 width x 500 height and you type more than the height it should not apply a scroller and you should be unable to write more

7616566google-chrome	firefox
pattern10		pattern10		
firefox is more technically correct in this case as it outputs the state of the object at each point in the loop whereas google-chrome is apparently waiting until the end of the loop to output each console.log but i m not aware of a standards specification that covers the console host object

7618381single-quotes	double-quotes
pattern4		pattern4		
obviously json is not javascript but still that s a reason why a some might prefer double-quotes in their javascript so that object literals look like json and b some might prefer single-quotes so that they can manually encode json without having to escape the double-quotes

7618704satellite	altitude
pattern7		
quote from the third link - the altitude error is much greater because it is a satellite based system

7620414post	get
pattern0		
i did something like this in java me and performance was way better than doing post get

7623344imagemagick	graphicsmagick
pattern0		
for me graphicsmagick is performing far better than imagemagick

7628932jar	war
pattern0		
i recently got this error with tomcat 7.0.21 on windows 7 when a war contained jars which had duplicate class definitions a class was defined in more than 1 jar within the war s web-inf lib directory

7633705listboxitem	textbox
pattern4		
select listboxitem if textbox in itemtemplate gets focus

7637968width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
it applies to window objects but also to scrollable frames and elements with the overflow css property set to scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is less than the height or width of its contents

7638114trie	dawg
pattern10		pattern10		
use a dawg which is more efficient than a trie in terms of space waste

7639612children	parent
pattern0		
you could do something similar using the score values in sorted sets giving children a score just lower than the parent

7649499children	parent
pattern0		
can children have more than one parent

7652047post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
i also found a post that suggests a less brute force method to get the urlroutingmodule to catch the combres.axd route

7652236case-sensitive	case-insensitive
pattern0		
this tiny overhead on add is vastly outweighed by the savings on lookups since all programmers should know and understand that case-insensitive compares are vastly slower than case-sensitive especially with unicode - the cpu can t just do a block compare of data but must check each pair of characters specially even using a table look-up this is vastly slower

7656982.when	each
pattern4		
i am using an user defaults which contains array of dates .in this array i am storing all the dates selected from the date picker.i now want to compare each of these dates with the current date .when the date matches with the current date the notification should be shown .i have done the code for traversing array but it is not working it does not match the date with the current date.and does not display the notification at the proper time

7657138jboss	glassfish
pattern7	easier	
i tried jboss too but i think glassfish is easier to use

7658837width	height
pattern7		
if width is more than 150 i will reduce the width to 150 and i will calculate the height

7658947width	height
pattern4		
which matches width of xxxpx and height of yyypx where xxx is captured as a named group width and yyy is captured as a named group height

7672369button	checkbox
pattern4		pattern2		
i choose button over checkbox in this case because i think they are handier and faster to work with

7675024min	max
pattern0		
problem i dont want to allow user to enter max value less than min value and so on

7676281google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
the position of the list in firefox is always higher than that of google-chrome no matter how i padding or margin the list

7676798ant	maven
pattern3		
i would recommend using ant or maven

7678099integer	unsigned	implements	extends
pattern7		
here is how gcc does it it sign extends if the integer type is larger than the pointer type this ll happen regardless of the integer being signed or unsigned just because that s how gcc decided to implements it

7678511imagemagick	magick++
pattern8		
now i m trying to do the same thing with imagemagick to be more correct with magick++

7678974quicksort	mergesort
pattern0		
it s not a question of is map reduce better than mergesort or quicksort because map reduce is just a tool for implementing a sorting algorithm like mergesort or quicksort in a parallel way

7681113width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
there is an image restriction that is not documented or at least i couldn t found anything the aspect ratio limit is 1 3 when the height is bigger than the width on the image

7688412webclient	webrequest
pattern7		
webclient is a shorter and more concise syntax but behind the scenes it uses a webrequest so in terms of performance it won t be faster it will be equivalent

7694050integer	unsigned
pattern7	greater	pattern7	greater	
not that i think this is a good idea but in c at least you can check if your unsigned integer is greater than int_max for two s complement anyway not so sure about the sign magnitude and one s complement variants but they re probably rare enough that you could safely ignore them until a problem pops up

7696277winpcap	pcap.net
pattern10	more	pattern10	more efficient	
pcap.net uses c++ cli to wrap winpcap which is considered more efficient than pinvoke

7700192bash	zsh
pattern4		
note that you ll never get behavior that exactly matches zsh one with bash only

7704706pow	sqrt
pattern4		
one naive way to do this would be to select sqrt pow tablename.x - x 2 + pow tablename.y - y 2 + pow tablename.z - z 2 as distance for each row in the table and then select the row that has the smallest distance

7705184macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
pattern3		
i recommend installing homebrew to manage installing nix tools on os x i d stay away from macports fink

7707814postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
db is irrelevant but id prefer postgresql sql server mysql in that order

7711124integer	unsigned
pattern7	type rank greater	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

7717332mockito	jmockit
pattern0		
mockito s a much older library than jmockit so you could expect that it would have many more features

7720193guard	autotest
pattern4		
is there any reason to prefer autotest to guard

7720907division	multiplication
pattern0		
multiplication is usually significantly faster than division

7722892drawimage	putimagedata
pattern7		pattern0		
as of right now drawimage is much faster than putimagedata

7723152inherited	properties
pattern7	higher	
in essence an object inherited all properties of its prototype but an object s own properties has higher precedence than those of its prototype

7724127int	double
pattern4		
you can t compare int and double

7725180free	malloc
pattern10	less	pattern10	less extensible	
this avoids malloc free but is less extensible and more prone to buffer overflow issues so i rarely ever use it

7725351children	parent
pattern0		
pushing and popping any item on a heap simply updates the elements in it in such a way that there is no node where its children are larger than the parent for max heap

7730288division	multiplication
pattern0		
division is about 20 faster than multiplication

7736941gson	jackson
pattern7		pattern0		
after searched in google found that jackson has better performance than gson i plan to replace gson with jackson in my project but i got a diffrent result when run test code

7736941gson	jackson
pattern10		pattern10		pattern7		pattern0		
it seems gson is more faster than jackson the average time of gson is about 2ms while jackson is about 16ms does i make mistake when using jackson

7739169tcpdf	fpdf
pattern0		
i ve used tcpdf in the past and found it a lot better than fpdf

7742259pull	push
pattern0		
pull subscriptions perform much better than push subscriptions in a wan scenario

7746990cairngorm	puremvc	cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	robotlegs	flex	robotlegs	robotlegs	puremvc
pattern4		
any large scale flash flex app can get pretty unwieldy without a micro-framework adobe has pushed cairngorm but i personally prefer robotlegs there s also puremvc which i used before robotlegs i prefer rl because it uses native as3 events as well as dependency injection which is easier to test

7747319children	parent
pattern0		
just remember in a nested set all children s left values are greater than and right values are less than the parent

7747856subtraction	addition
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more costly	pattern10	more costly	
spoiler its namesake may betray why addition subtraction is more costly

7752076portrait	landscape
pattern0		
because in landscape your height is smaller than in portrait you need to have a value smaller than 1.0

7753041mouseout	mouseenter
pattern7	cheaper	
mouseenter and mouseout afterwards is cheaper for what you are doing and fires it s event only once

7754188x86	mips
pattern7	less	
if you pick up something like mips and get the hang of it x86 is less of a monster to learn

7762023realloc	calloc
pattern7		
the various alternatives calloc realloc work roughly the same way calloc is easier to use when dealing with arrays and zero-fills the data while realloc is useful when you need to resize a block of memory

7764101ubuntu	debian
pattern7		pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
ubuntu has nicer frontend and could be more suitable for windows emigrants while debian is more for backend guys

7764124centos	linux
pattern4		
others might prefer centos or some other flavour of linux but my opinion is that it is best to choose something that matches your production environment

7767450int	chars
pattern4		
note that there is no need to convert anything to hex - you can just compare chars or int values directly since a hex constant such as 0x3f is just another way of representing an int value

7768396min	max
pattern4		
or to show the first time they ordered that product choose min instead of max

7769186sorting	filtering
pattern0		
being queryable the data tables produce faster results with sorting and filtering with their defaultview dataview

7769339nsurl	nsstring	nsurl	nsfilemanager
pattern4		pattern2		
generally for path related operations you should prefer nsurl over nsstring because the path information can be stored more efficiently in nsurl according to the class reference for nsfilemanager

7770477quicksort	timsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	timsort
pattern0		
this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so

7773684addition	multiplication
pattern10	more	pattern10	more efficient	
in addition to the other answers usually simple multiplication is way more efficient than using pow

7776000innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern7	older	
innodb is newer while myisam is older

7776000innodb	myisam

7781814hash	md5
pattern4		
md5 hash as done in how to compute and compare hash values by using visual c#

7782234googletest	gmock
pattern3		
i strongly recommend using googletest and gmock both used extensively at google for your testing

7786782translation	localization
pattern0		
i don t need more than 2 localization now english and portuguese but i might need more later so it should be easy to add a translation if my app gets used by an russian site it should be able to send welcome emails in russian and with the name of the site brand that uses my app so i supposse what i want to do is something like a whitelabel product

7786914quicksort	timsort
pattern7		pattern0		
if that is so you might find that timsort runs faster than quicksort

7791066ienumerable	iqueryable
pattern10		pattern10		
i have read about ienumerable and iqueryable i have read that iqueryable is better with linq because when you use where clauses it creates the exact query it needs but with ienumerable it retrieves all rows from database and then filters on memory

7793515jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
pattern7		pattern0		
here is a recent benchmark of jython 2.5.2 running on jvm 7 where jython is slower than pypy but faster than cpython

7798213jqgrid	datatables
pattern7		
datatables has better customizations as far as clientside bells and whistles where as jqgrid is a little harder to make look as pretty but can do some pretty good serverside interaction from what i understand

7798324pascal	delphi
pattern4		
ps i prefer delphi pascal but tutorials in any language are welcome

7798686punctuation	words
pattern4		
using instead of will also match words surrounded by punctuation or the beginning end of the string

i have an imageview that is bigger than a textview and i want to center the textview on top of the imageview both vertically and horizontally

7800876int	chars
pattern0		
it will destroy your memory if there s more than 100 chars on a line or more numbers than array can hold but you won t get a faster routine to read in lines of unsigned int

7801957cpu	processors
pattern0		
to the operating system a single thread which i assume is what you mean by java process essentially cannot use cpu on more than one processors which may or may not mean a physical core-- see below simultaneously

7804518calloc	malloc

memory allocation in java is 5x to 10x faster than malloc calloc etc

7805204button	checkbox
pattern0		
everything is better than a checkbox or a button with autopostback set to true nowadays in year 2011 2012 soon

7810180button	right-align	width	height
pattern7		
instead of figuring out the individual positions for each image button it is easier to simply right-align them by modifying the anchorpoint to 1.0f 0.5f and then position the images button at exactly the screen width and variable screen height position screen width 100

7811814int	chars
pattern0		
guids works much better than chars or binary they are fixed size and are often used as keys indices instead of int when more bits are needed due to their very high speed and low space consumption

7813178uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
pattern7		
the framespace for the uiviewcontroller becomes smaller because uinavigationcontroller manipulates the view by adding a uinavigationbar which is 44.0f in size

7814027google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
however some of the users using the system prefer google-chrome or firefox

7818843quicksort	mergesort
pattern10		pattern10		
you can also see that for smaller collections quicksort is faster but then mergesort takes the lead but all of this is case specific so take your time to study all 4 algorithms

7820004devise	cancan
pattern4		pattern2		
i personally prefer devise with cancan

7823160udp	tcp
pattern7	tunneling easier	
you could probably also configure snmp to run over tcp instead of udp which makes tunneling easier

7823163jquery	curvycorners
pattern0		
i know another plugin named jquery corner is available however it s file size being massively bigger than curvycorners i decided to with curvycorners

7825563getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select getdate dateadd hh 4 getdate

7829181int	chars

there are many free open source ones i recommend artifactory or nexus

7835481exponent	modulo
pattern0		
the private exponent must not be longer than the modulo

7837996getter	setter
pattern3		
developer s guide doesn t recommend using getter when you can use direct field access avoid internal getter setter

7839896super	abstract
pattern7	method clearer	
i could just throw away customsetup and put all the custom code after super but having that abstract method makes clearer what you re supposed to put there

7845016force.com	salesforce
pattern4		
in fact no matter which user license i select force.com chatter free or salesforce platform i still can t see the recruiter profile in the profile dropdown

7846959visualvm	jprofiler
pattern4		
apart from the free visualvm that comes with the jdk i can recommend jprofiler for profiling any kind of application that is running on a jvm

7849680int	chars
pattern0		
c99 6.4.4.4p10 the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined.

7851837division	subtraction
pattern7		pattern0		
that s because the division operator has a higher precedence than the subtraction operator -

7852059post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
the post get may fix the problem - get is much more lax with security than post

7852341memcpy	strcpy
pattern4		
at which point strcpy becomes safe because you know it s not too long although i prefer memcpy because it makes it obvious to future readers of the code that i ve thought about this

7855698expander	itemscontrol
pattern7	larger	
basically what is happening is that when i expand one of the expander items and that itemscontrol contains a larger amount of items 25 the rendering of the list appears to be truncated

7857108trie	tree
pattern7		
for example the patricia trie or the radix tree that is far more space efficient than an hash table for strings but of course being a tree lookup computational complexity is o log n and building it is o n log n

pattern7		
the upgrade sequence is much simpler i have a hard link in the app that points to the latest versioning of the apk the donwload starts and automatically laucnhes the install

7860040magento	oscommerce
pattern0		
there are many more out there magento oscommerce zen etc.

7864199int	chars

i guess that the original exercise would ask you to get two different int of probably more than 1 chars each

7866699post	put
pattern4		
prefer put over post

7868590qsort	bsearch
pattern7	better	
i ll add that if this is the first time you use bsearch and qsort it s better you look at the samples you can find around

7868608folder	directory
pattern10		pattern10		
but my directory structure is more organized its more like app lib mypackage folder

7869872cvs	svn
pattern4		pattern2		
i wondered if there were still any reasons to prefer cvs over svn or git nowadays

7870895cvs	svn
pattern7	better	
many say that svn was build to be a better cvs and in almost all aspects svn is better and is widely used

7871646cvs	svn
pattern0		
i can only guess at the reasons and i don t worry much about the occasional downvote but perhaps some readers think i m advocating cvs as a better system than svn or git

7874956ssd	sata
pattern0		
as compilation is mostly reading small files i wonder if buying a fast usb key to work on can speed up compilation time compared to a standard sata drive and with a lower price than an ssd drive 16gb keys are 30

7875763libs	buildpath
pattern4		
this is my way to solve the problem right click on your project and select buildpath next select add libs and add your private jars

7876912google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
the google-chrome apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under firefox

7879883google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
get google-chrome or firefox use the developer tools i personally prefer google-chrome and play around with the css of that element - you d want a margin-top rule similar to this

7881142width	height
pattern10	more	pattern10	more important	
try setting just either height or width whichever is more important to you

7882544goto	break
pattern10	harder	
branching around whether it is with goto or break just makes it harder

7882614rss	feed
pattern10	more	pattern10	more ideal	
if necessary i am willing to use the twitter api directly to do the search instead of using rss but for my purposes using a feed is more ideal

7883651post	get
pattern4		pattern2		
i prefer post over get because 1 it can hold more data and 2 it s not so easy for the user to tamper with

7884259subtract	add
pattern0		
then while the temp value is greater than 99 subtract 100 from it and add 1 to the counter

7884259subtract	add
pattern0		
then while the temp value is greater than 9 subtract 10 from it and add 1 to the counter

7885442int	chars
pattern0		
the real sha1 algorithm uses blocks larger than a single chars and state larger than an int but basically that s how it goes

7886264gson	jackson
pattern7	more	
no hate against gson but in my experience jackson has been more featureful and the lead dev is very good about addressing bugs feature requests

7887458innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
myisam is actually better than innodb for spatial data btw because it also supports r-tree spatial indexes but not as powerful queries as postgis. if you just need points though innodb or myisam b-trees are adequate

7891151union	distinct
pattern4		
and then created a query to check if a group by of one column was greater than 1 ie not unique and the group by of then next column was 1 unique and that the previous column was a substring of the next then just union together the result of each pair of columns and finally did a select distinct across the whole lot

7892772svg	vml
pattern7		
ie s vml is slower than other browser s svg

7893217int	chars
pattern0		
is there memset that accepts int larger than chars

7893594int	chars
pattern10	more	pattern10	more tricky	
for int and chars it s often more tricky to pick a good value

7895961udp	tcp
pattern2		
don t reinvent the wheel and choose between udp and tcp until you re completely sure you need something more sophisticated but not simpler

7896213int	double
pattern7		pattern0		
with it is nub on and comparing big int is slower than comparing double

7896619udp	tcp
pattern4		
it makes more sense to compare tcp vs udp vs other transport layer protocols -- and http vs ftp vs other application layer protocols

7896827google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	cleaner	
this works in latest google-chrome and firefox and seems cleaner than bind to me

7897617hide	show
pattern0		
if you have more than one show hide box you ll need to create more tables

7898066firefox	safari
pattern0		
i saw that the discrepancy was because in safari the text element is taller than in firefox and includes a slight amount of whitespace on top that doesn t show up in firefox in firefox the top of the text element is exactly when the text starts

7900728move	drag
pattern4		
the correct solution to this problem is probably to implement a kind of handle on top of the table or something that users could grab drag drop to securely move the whole table at once

7907383width	height
pattern7	lower	
after the dialog is created set the new width for the dialog wrapper and start an animate if the current height is lower then the calculated

7911156rsa	dsa
pattern0		
dsa has signature that is independent of key strength and is much smaller than rsa signature for equivalent security rsa 1024 1568 vs dsa 192

7911156rsa	dsa
pattern0		
however dsa verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than rsa verification

7913630django	web2py
pattern7		pattern7	more	
web2py has more focus on simple is better than complex but django has more focus on explicit is better than implicit

7914509maven	pom.xml
pattern4		
it asks me to select maven projects and has a file structure as it should be-parent project pom.xml and 3 child projects poms with a checkbox beside all 4 items

7916181gridview	repeater
pattern10	more	pattern10	more control	
alternatively use a gridview though i find that repeater gives you more control over the emitted markup

7921967division	modulo
pattern0		
bit operations are usually faster than division or modulo calculations

7923617vim	textmate
pattern10		pattern10		
vim is more powerful and textmate is worth the price tag

7934400swt	swing
pattern4		
swing is a pretty good gui framework architecturally although some prefer swt

7934577jsonb	hstore
pattern8		
json jsonb fields support any json-encodable data type not just key value pairs but also tend to be faster and for jsonb more compact than hstore

7935324bottle	flask
pattern0		
if you re looking for small implementations you might get better results with bottle or flask

7935618system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
pattern7		pattern0		
agreed that using odp.net is better than deprecated system.data.oracleclient

7935724division	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		
first of all multiplication is faster than division

7945934integer	unsigned
pattern4		
is computed as an unsigned integer because promotion and conversion rules favor unsigned types when binary operations are applied to a signed type and an unsigned type

7945935ubuntu	debian	versioning	upgrade
pattern0		
this also might be fixed solved in the git add mechanism in more up to date versioning i vaguely remember them adding their own .gitignore files to empty directories so i d really recommend trying to upgrade to the highest git versioning you can for that and other benefites your distro may provide by default an older versioning as ubuntu and debian do

7945958multiplying	division
pattern7		
while working with integer division it s better to multiplying first and divide later to minimize the rounding error

7946862udp	tcp
pattern4		
this is a noob question but how do i allow a user this option to choose tcp or udp protocols

7949072clang	llvm
pattern4		
i heartily recommend llvm for statical analysis see also clang static analyzer

7949658integer	unsigned
pattern0		
this means in effect that types cannot be demoted to a type with lesser precision by the integer promotions it is possible for uint64_t to be promoted to int or unsigned int but only if the range of the type is at least that of uint64_t

7949706lxml	elementtree
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		
but in general you will find that lxml is faster more effective and has an api which adheres closely to a python standard the elementtree which comes with the python standard library

7950760int	chars
pattern7		
i.e if we use int and chars then union will allocate space for chars which has the bigger size and the int too ll be stored in the same space overriding the last one

7950970alloca	malloc
pattern0		
while alloca gives you automatic de-allocation on function exit the stack is usually a smaller resource than the malloc heap and if you exhaust the heap it gives you back null

7951705mouse	keyboard
pattern4		
edit note that adding a save button can disrupt the edit flow of users click table cell edit grab mouse aim click save click next cell go back to keyboard edit ...

7953935weka	mallet

which product mallet or weka is better for text classification task

7961881min	max
pattern0		
the bounds are inclusive ie 2 5 and min must be less than max in the above example

7965305post	get
pattern10	less	pattern10	less susceptible	
note also that in general it is best to follow the pattern of reloading pages with get after post which makes you less susceptible to form resubmitions in which case using sessions for storage is the better solution

7972324screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
pattern0		
in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app

7974735apache	nginx
pattern0		
apache s design is thread per client while nginx uses the reactor pattern meaning - nginx can handle much more traffic than apache as a web server about 50 times the number of requests

7975143translation	transliteration
pattern0		
the issue here is that an automatic translation from sql to linq will often have to perform more transliteration than translation - generating examples of how not to write linq queries

7975182xrange	enumerate
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
enumerate is also more appropriate than xrange

7977319public	protected
pattern7	constructors easier	
be aware that guaranteeing immutability by having no public or protected constructors is easier to break than making the class final

7980658profiling	instrumentation
pattern4		
if you just run your application in profiling mode click and hold the run button and select profiling or do command-i it will open instrumentation and you can choose to profiling memory allocations from there

7982486jerkson	jackson
pattern8		
this is not to say this is more official than jerkson just that there are many useful jackson extension modules that many developers are not familiar with

7987382jruby	mri
pattern0		
and it sounds strange but jruby scales very well and it s faster than mri with java 7

7987874udp	tcp
pattern7	better	
i ve been messing around with different ways of implementing this and would like a bit of advice on whether tcp or udp is a better protocol to implement the communication between client and server

7987892geocoding	geocode
pattern0		
can the geocode gem support more than one geocoding step

7988597children	parent
pattern7	more	
without adding any extra complexity to the rockauto site it appears to structure it s tree view as make-year-model-variant but year doesn t really have any attributes or children or parent it s more like an attribute of model

7989690skip-lists	tree
pattern0		
in a single thread world is different you can use a sorted set a binary tree or your custom data structure that would perform better than concurrent skip-lists

7991345cpython	pypy
pattern0		
i presume it s why is pypy faster than cpython some of the time

7991733googletest	cppunit
pattern0		
if you use older version of gcc compiler or if your code under tests runs on vxworks or vxsim you might have a better chance with cppunit than googletest framework

7992371versioning	upgrade
pattern4		
i would prefer upgrade of profiles to newest versioning first due maintainability

7993308interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0		
this makes interpreted-language generally slower than compiled-language due to the overhead of running the vm or interpreter

7995559mouse	keyboard
pattern2		
it s the most common and expected behavior just like windows explorer when you select files with mouse and or keyboard the information panel shows their properties

7995749lisp	scheme
pattern4		
i would definitely recommend scheme macros over cl macros if you haven t deal with any sort of lisp macros before

7997125postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
i would need a scalable database so probably postgresql would be better than mysql

7998350int	double
pattern8		
if you want the modulus use as it gives an int and would be more efficient than double arithmetic

7999353postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
postgresql is way better than mysql in nearly every respect

8000104moq	moles
pattern7		
personally i think moles is much better suited for mocking the unmockable and i prefer a combination of moq for my own interfaces and classes and moq for framework and externalities like file i o gui db connections etc

8004971innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
put another way let s say i start with a new innodb table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess innodb stuff i realize data stored in innodb is larger than myisam then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data

8005925rspec	capybara
pattern7	better	
using capybara instead of rspec is a better solution for request intergration tests

8007466doc	rtf
pattern8		
there s a post on the subject on the birt world blog here specifically relating to xls emitters although the tribix emitters mentioned should also enable output to rtf a microsoft format readable by word that is much more concise than doc

8013282onchange	onsubmit
pattern4		
onsubmit event can silently kill onchange event if called simultaneously

8013367range	max
pattern0		
i have this grid each coordinate in the grid can be either closed or open i m tying to using an open coordinate find all the open coordinates around the first that are valid and the walk range between then is equal or lower than the max walk range

8013367range	max
pattern0		
at first i tried a solution using a where i would select every coordinate in range check if they were valid if they were i would call a from them to the center position and count the number of steps if they were higher than my max range i would just remove the coordinate from my list

8021206innodb	myisam
pattern0		
innodb is much much stricter than myisam

8021213innodb	myisam
pattern7		
generally innodb is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to myisam there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that

8022554thin	unicorn
pattern0		
i m running unicorn which is about 40 faster than thin on celadon cedar

8023378outputstream	inputstream
pattern0		
are writers and readers faster than outputstream and inputstream

8024863udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
tcp is faster for when using a few connections the important difference is that modern nics perform significant amounts of acceleration on tcp and not really that much for udp

8026144glut	glfw
pattern4		pattern2		
opinionated note i prefer glfw over glut

8026900margin	height
pattern0		
i assume margintop can t be solved since im setting margin top to -820 in order to get at a point of top 275 therefore screens smaller than 1200px height the div will go much higher...

8029524width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
right now what this code is producing is the right image doesn t look like a square the width is larger than the height

8030055width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
the right image doesn t look like a square the width is larger than the height

8032509implements	extends

extends makes more sense to me here than implements maybe it s a typo in the book

8036734width	height
pattern0		
now this works on my desktop machine in firefox if i make the width smaller than the height

8040666addclass	removeclass
pattern0		
that s pretty broad though depending on what you re doing you may be better off with removeclass and addclass

8042489direct3d	directx
pattern7		
directx has a wider scope than opengl in that directx is composed of directsound directplay and direct3d etc

8043853webclient	webrequest
pattern0		
and for rest if you need more than the webclient webrequest

8048254width	height
pattern7	greater	
also i need the most outer div to have 100 height and width cover the whole page and the descendants to calculate their height accodringly except for those divs whose content height is greater than theirs they should show a scrollbar

8052193postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
postgresql is far more powerful and scalable and doesn t have mysql s silly limitations and gotchas

8056133int	chars
pattern7		
the firs one is more common and works on all systems where the size of an int is greater than the size of a chars

8059790udp	tcp
pattern0		
udp packets are easier structured than tcp packets but sacrifice security for their size

8060841mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
pattern0		
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

8062956pop-up	dialog
pattern7	more	pattern7	more	
if i do not touch the screen letting the screen dim off and then turn the screen on the pop-up dialog is no more there

8063047width	height

portrait orientation is that one where the width smaller than the height

8063047width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
landscape orientation is that one where the width is bigger than the height

8063108mp3	wav
pattern0		
now i assume you are worried your techno might not read a compressed mp3 which should be smaller than a wav from my memories

8065072int	chars
pattern10		pattern10		
storing data in the int form is always more reliable than the chars or string

8066149int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
chars 1 takes substantially less space than an int

8066280nunit	moq
pattern4		
in terms of tools i recommend nunit and moq

8070899maven	cobertura	cobertura	emma
pattern7		pattern0		
if you re going to stick with maven and want a plugin for maven that will do the code-coverage job i think cobertura is a better choice as emma stable last build is from 2005

8073648google-chrome	safari
pattern0		
it s not even a webkit issue unless google-chrome s got a newer version than safari

8081937maven	pom.xml

pattern4		
seems your movie is not in focus so you need some mouse click on movie before it will grab keyboard events

8087758int	chars
pattern7		pattern7	greater	
what i need is a jsp using jstl that will output column labels as chars a b c... instead of int 1 2 3... and just for fun when the int is greater than 26 it should output aa ab ac...oh and when the int is greater than 52 it should be ba bb bc.

8087950qtcore	qtgui

you will need more include paths in here if you are dependent on more than just qtcore and qtgui but i just put those too for simplicity

8088885jlabel	jinternalframe	jscrollpane	jinternalframe
pattern7		pattern0		
my problem is this i don t want the jlabel or the jscrollpane to stretch to the size of the jinternalframe if the jlabel is smaller than the jinternalframe

8091310expression-blend	silverlight
pattern4		
if you re aiming at using silverlight or wpf then i d recommend expression-blend as you can produce a rough working gui design and quickly transform it into working code

8091758int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
int needs more memory than what chars occupies and the conversion cannot be done in a safe manner

8092564calloc	malloc
pattern2		
from what i understand i have to choose between calloc which will allocate zeroed memory and malloc which can allocate memory on demand

8094117mouse	keyboard
pattern2		
to solve this i made textboxes readonly but i want a better solution for this issue so that user can enter the date with keyboard as well as pick with mouse

8099711width	height
pattern10		pattern10		
height is slightly more tricky for it to work you need to have the parent of the overlay div to have a known width

8103092gson	jackson
pattern3		
i highly recommend abandoning gson in favor of jackson whenever possible.

8103162width	height
pattern0		
you can define more layouts with different width and height.then check the height and width and density of device and use that specific layout for that device

8103414int	double
pattern0		pattern7		pattern0		
in vararg functions such as printf int smaller than int are promoted to int and floats smaller than double are promoted to double

8103674apache	nginx
pattern0		
if you want to use something in front of it though i suggest you use something like nginx better than apache since nginx is also asynchronous like node and it s performs really well at serving static files

8103931apache	nginx
pattern0		
now back to the question my guess based on reading tests published here would be that the proper multi-thread apache architecture should scale better than nginx on multi-core cpus

8103931apache	nginx
pattern10		pattern10		
paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx it just means that on 1 2 3 .

8103931apache	nginx
pattern0		
16 cores apache would scale better than nginx while nginx would process more client requests

8104401pull	push
pattern7	changes things easier	
you do not need to set up these remotes but having them for all the repos that you frequently work with push or pull changes makes things easier for you

8107202google-chrome	firefox
pattern8		
i worked on it to make it more consistent between google-chrome and firefox

8107257vmware	virtualbox
pattern8		
virtualbox free but less powerfull than vmware

8110762udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
i don t think you should make the assumption that udp is faster than tcp

8111865mouse	keyboard
pattern7	more	
but when i press page down button from keyboard it works fine but when i scroll using mouse takes bit more time to load data and scrollbar of gridview displays abnormal

8118396extjs	sproutcore
pattern4		
if you compare extjs to other comparable ria frameworks dojo yui sproutcore then things like footprint css html complexity debugging etc

8120047opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

8120946qwebview	qtextbrowser
pattern7	faster	
unless you need javascript flash css or something like that you can replace qwebview with qtextbrowser which is both faster and free of static leaks

8123876pdfsharp	itext
pattern10		pattern10		
as noted in the comment by quandary the pdfsharp library offers a more relaxed license mit compared to the commercial or agpl license offered by itext

8128017hide	show
pattern4		
so for example - you have a dropdown that has members select show hide

8132236division	addition	division	modulo	addition	modulo
pattern0		
division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition

8132481innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
you insert in there but never select from there as far as i know today myisam is better than innodb in this case

8133175g++	gcc
pattern7		pattern0		
so using g++ is better than gcc

8136079swt	swing
pattern8		
i m not too eager for using swt though since i m more familiar with swing

8137020postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
and a wiki for why postgresql is better than mysql

8140284lxml	elementtree
pattern7		
although lxml has better documentation better xpath support and better code for technical reasons i cannot use lxml so i am forced to use elementtree

8143223udp	tcp
pattern0		
tcp is a bit slower than udp but more failsafe

8145964int	chars
pattern0		
basically i am trying to be able to get a string of digits that can be longer than an int which is why it uses chars to insert into the myint object using the overload for

8149747width	margin
pattern7		
image s width is less than div s width i can use margin auto here

8153417innodb	myisam
pattern0		
myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads

8154855union	distinct
pattern7		pattern0		
using union all is quicker than using union since a distinct check does not need to be done

8157408udp	tcp
pattern7	higher	
the first possible issue i can think of is that because udp doesn t have the overhead inherent in the transmission control that tcp does udp has higher data bandwidth and lower latency

8165120atof	strtod
pattern7		pattern0		
edit basile starynkevitch mentions that strtod is better than atof for this job as it gives the ending character

8166981openssl	gnutls
pattern4		pattern10	more	pattern10	more preferable	
speaking about usability personally i would prefer gnutls api but at the time openssl looks more preferable to use

8169572datamapper	activerecord
pattern7		pattern0		
the level of abstraction of datamapper is way higher than the activerecord s

8171849innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use innodb but there are still some areas in which myisam is much faster than innodb

8173442free	malloc
pattern3		
actually on linux systems allocating a big chunk of memory using the mmap system call is fairly quick but malloc implementations try to avoid mmap and prefer reusing free -d memory

8173799google-chrome	safari
pattern0		
safari comes in at just under 41ms performing better than google-chrome but still not great

8181293width	height
pattern7		
also if the image width or height is smaller than displaywidth scale you might want to cap it to be image width instead

8182649cos	sin
pattern0		
polar is well-suited to rotation operations and scaling i guess but sticking with cartesian where a rotation is four multiplies see below is probably going to be cheaper than using cos sin acos asin every time you want to do a vector addition

8183143for-loop	loops
pattern0		
however the while loops remains a little slower than the for-loop

8200633rpm	yum
pattern4		
i know the recent system prefer yum but want to know if there is need for rpm also

8201051rpm	yum
pattern10	more	pattern10	more intelligent	
to expand on the udo s answer there is the program rpm which manipulates specifically the packages it is asked to manipulate and there is yum which is a more intelligent management system that can find dependencies and download .rpm files even if they re not in the system

8201375button	checkbox
pattern4		
you have to use javascript to style select checkbox radio button

8202001public	protected
pattern7		
protected is closer to public than private

8203841innodb	myisam
pattern0		
innodb is also being developed more than myisam

8205192memcpy	memmove
pattern0		
it is entirely possible that in most implementations the cost of a memmove function call will not be significantly greater than memcpy in any scenario in which the behavior of both is defined

8205268int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
on your platform a int is bigger than a chars so you are walking off the end of the array and undefined read really bad things are allowed to happen when you do that

8206312width	height
pattern7	larger	
if the bitmap is larger in height or width is larger then canvas size displaywidth displayheight how can i use the camera class to autozoom to fit the bitmap and center it to the canvas

8206491profiling	instrumentation
pattern4		pattern2		
in xcode rather than running the app select profiling with instrumentation open

8207079cruisecontrol	teamcity
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
between cruisecontrol and teamcity teamcity is faster and easier to set up but you may need to check on licensing for it

8209732post	get
pattern4		
if user selects post 2 it get highlighted twice

8213500innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
innodb is relatively newer than myisam and is transaction safe

8213711int	chars
pattern0		
moreover int must be wider than chars hence it can accommodate more than 8 flags which you re not gonna need

8214222opencv	emgucv
pattern0		
the results end up very close but the emgucv image comes out a little bit blurrier than the opencv image

8215676jtextpane	jeditorpane
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
jtextpane is more high level as jeditorpane strange naming

8217165width	height
pattern7		pattern7	less	
that means fit width when the height is less than the ratio and fit height when the width is less than the ratio

8218375octal	hex	octal	decimal
pattern0		
hex or maybe octal depending on the machine being emulated will be clearer than using decimal since similar opcodes tend to vary in bits not digits

8219726filesystems	fat
pattern7		
granted fat is an easier problem but they claim to support many filesystems and it would be my first choice

8221055setinterval	settimeout
pattern0		pattern0		
then again it s better than settimeout setinterval which fires only once per second if the tab is not active in google chrome a common use case for audio file listening

8221055setinterval	settimeout
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
if however in your app you can ensure that the tab is active while listening then settimeout or setinterval is better as it can fire as often as 100 times per second

8222708boost	stl
pattern0		
i don t want to use boost because that s a library i haven t used extensively yet and i m doing this partly as an exercise to gain greater mastery over the stl

8223812int	double
pattern0		
first with any variadic function such as printf all int values of a type shorter than int are passed as int or unsigned int in some cases on some platforms and all float values are passed as double

8223840ssl	https
pattern4		
is it enough to buy ssl certificate and install it into iis7 to get secure https connection

8225690uiview	subviews
pattern0		
you could put a smaller uiview as subviews of your selectionview and change tha background color of that view

8229439nsscanner	nsstring
pattern10	more	pattern10	more powerful	
use the floatvalue nsstring method or a nsscanner which is more powerful and flexible

8231017versioning	upgrade
pattern7	more	
you can also upgrade to django development versioning it has more versatile list_filter implementation see which can be used for providing advanced admin filters including or-queries

8231535boost	stl
pattern7		
c++ s stl is getting better and better yet it s not nearly as huge as boost and is not intended to

8237716width	height
pattern0		
in english when a page is initialized look through every image on the page that has a width and if it s larger than the width of the device erase the height and set the width to 100

8245186createelement	classname
pattern0		
on the other hand passing an element and its attributes like maps to a call to document.createdocumentfragment which is slower than createelement followed by a write to the classname property

8248588cos	sqrt
pattern0		
in term of speed square rooting is easy a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method but it is not clear what asin does probably quite costly cos is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than sqrt and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls

8249123width	height
pattern7		pattern7		
in case your form contentpane s width height is smaller than the images width height than a better option would be use

8249123width	height
pattern7		pattern7		
in case your image s width height is smaller than form contentpane s width height you might as well do not scale it since the image will fit the screen

8250125width	height
pattern7	shorter	pattern7	shorter	
obviously you need to make sure the height width is not shorter then the div_wrapper otherwise the background will show

8254004min	max
pattern4		
we can select max id min id avg id .

8262827postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
is postgresql a better option than mysql for partitioning tables by date

8264054google-chrome	firefox
pattern8		
so why is google-chrome less efficient than firefox and ie

8265382width	height
pattern7	bigger	
now my requirement is if my table s height or width is bigger than that of image i do not want the image to repeat current situation

8268449apache	nginx
pattern10		pattern10		
very fast static assets nginx is faster than apache at serving static assets css js images ... and uses very little memory to do so

8272444vertica	greenplum
pattern0		
the storage costs in hadoop are much cheaper than vertica netezza greenplum and the like

8277166button	checkbox
pattern4		
select checkbox and click button after that again unselect and click

8277796post	get
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
standard post request is not more secure than get one

8287594setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
pattern3		
i d also recommend using settimeout rather than setinterval clearinterval since it doesn t need to be run on a recurring basis

8292035implements	extends
pattern4		
i would also recommend implements runnable instead of extends thread - or quite possibly using a timer instead given that you want periodic execution

8293752subtract	addition	subtraction	addition
pattern10		pattern10		
strict addition is rare but subtraction is more common like when you subtract one image from its filtered one

8297272post	get
pattern4		pattern2		pattern10		pattern10		
maybe i would mostly always choose post over get it s more tidy and refreshing and going back issues with post method are a thing from the past in any major browser they just ask you if you want to resend the data don t they

8299437away3d	papervision3d
pattern3		
preface papervision3d is close to unsupported closed as a library so i highly recommend using away3d or another actionscript 3d library

8301650folder	directory
pattern4		
is there any way to tweak select file dialog to make it able to select directory on win-pc and folder on mac

8301955wav	flac
pattern7		pattern0		
flac is smaller than wav

8303321directx	gdi
pattern4		
i m new to graphics programming and i m wondering why i would ever prefer gdi over the hardware accelerated graphics of directx opengl

8309515multiplying	add
pattern4		
you need the functions to compare add and multiplying c double type values respectively __eqdf2 __adddf3 and __muldf3

8309782children	parent
pattern7		
if there are two rectangles and the parent is wider and than it is high then the children should be placed next to each other

8311174gif	png
pattern0		
since you don t need animation and want to stay with loss-less compression you would get somewhat better compression with png instead of gif and png is patent-free

8311230quicksort	heapsort	heapsort	in-place
pattern0		
but heapsort is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard in-place quicksort

8318670calloc	malloc
pattern4		
or if you prefer malloc can be re-defined in terms of calloc

8325701postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
in my opinion it s silly to compare mysql and postgresql in terms of speed if there are variables unknown such as - what s your budget what s your target system output and what s your load rate

8329927trie	dawg
pattern7		
a dawg has better memory performance if the strings have many common suffixes but they are more expensive and difficult to build and update so start with a trie

8330765int	chars
pattern4		pattern4		
you can compare chars to chars just fine the same way you can compare int to int and floats with floats

8331606charindex	substr
pattern4		
select substr filepath 9 charindex filepath + 9 - 9

8332683setinterval	settimeout
pattern3		
i prefer using setinterval over settimeout

8335325division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small

8337382width	height
pattern7	greater	
visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero

8337936cpu	processors
pattern0		
parallel processing is by far a more strict mode of execution of the code-units tasks threads... than just a concurrent run of code-execution simultaneously just by coincidence using more than one cpu or processors core and other shared resources to execute a program or multiple but mutually absolutely independent computational units

8339423division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern0		pattern0		
on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition

8344063width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
the best i could come up with would be to scale the line to fit inside paper based on the width of the path assuming that the width is more than the height

8345962for-loop	arrays
pattern0		
when i try to access it with a for-loop where its index is less than the arrays length i get the following error message typeerror function object is unsubscriptable

8348995int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
java will allow you to assign chars s to int s since int has a larger domain than chars

8349825innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
innodb is more concurrent than myisam since it provides row-level locking

8354246subtract	add
pattern4		
i could implement my own reduced class for a given scale 1 or maybe 2 decimals and a reduced method set compare add and subtract basically but you know i d like to have a more generic solution and not just a quick workaround

8355244width	height
pattern0		
media screen and width greater than height

8355244width	height
pattern0		
media screen and height less than width

8358251background-color	transparency
pattern7	element black...rather	
for example setting the background-color on a transparency element turns it black...rather than the intended color.

8360853range	min	range	max	min	max
pattern2		
now it s a simple select with min and max to turn it back into range

8363606lwjgl	slick2d
pattern10	more	pattern10	more adaptable	
on one hand slick2d is fast and simple but it seems lwjgl is more adaptable in the sense that it has both 2d and 3d capabilities

8364562min	max
pattern4		pattern4		
postgres- from generate_series select min id from message select max id from message as aid

8366409width	height
pattern7	greater	
returns a nil context if width or height is greater than 320x480

8367507width	height
pattern7	less	
now when i maximize the frame and the click the button the dialog opens up with a proper width that matches that of the frame but with a height that is less than that of the jframe

8373087postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
i totally understand the error and assume that the mysql implementation is less sql conform than the postgresql implementation

8374673maven	pom.xml
pattern4		
when work in sts springsource tool suite open pom.xml file and check dependencies in dependencies tab add select maven dependency will give 0 result found

8375194min	max
pattern4		
for i min l 1 .x r 1 .x to max l size of l .x r size of r .x choose max l i .h r i .h

8375240xslt	xquery
pattern7		pattern0		pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
my usual rule-of-thumb is that xquery is better than xslt for simple tasks whereas xslt is better for complex tasks

8375720jobs	cron
pattern3		
i recommend using cron jobs for this kind of work

8377835config	ini
pattern10		pattern10		
because spring s xml config is slightly more powerful than shiro s ini spring users are encouraged to use full spring config instead of shiro ini

8377850int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
while shifting the types are automatically promoted to int which is wider than chars most often

8377863simulink	labview
pattern2		
given how much image processing work is done in block-level dataflow languages such as labview i would recommend starting with simulink

8379140vtk	paraview
pattern3		
i would recommend using vtk files see www.vtk.org vtk img file-formats.pdf which are read by both paraview and visit paraview is built on the vtk graphics library

8382400google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
it depends on the browser its definitely true for ie and firefox but seems slower on google-chrome

8387408postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
first of all you will have to install something other than sqlite i recommend postgresql not mysql

8388057innodb	myisam
pattern0		
newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly

8388711post	get
pattern0		
post is not any more secure than get

8388767unix	aix
pattern10	sort more	pattern10	sort more superior	
nawk alas aix don t have sort and unix sort is far more superior then any hand-made sort in awk

8392125division	addition
pattern7		pattern0		
it could be done via division which is much slower than addition or it could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version

8393678imagemagick	graphicsmagick
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
graphicsmagick is a fork of imagemagick that is faster and has fewer bugs this is what flickr uses internally so it should be good enough for you

8395720versioning	upgrade
pattern10		pattern10		
the dbi versioning is less likely to be the source of the trouble but it would still be good to upgrade to the most current versioning

8396060cassini	iis
pattern0		
iis express would only be used by people who don t have access to iis or want something that is lighter than iis but more like iis than cassini

8396521codeigniter	yii
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10		
i have found one benchmark in which yii is faster than codeigniter and another benchmark in which codeigniter is faster than yii

8396571codeigniter	yii
pattern7		pattern0		
so latest codeigniter 2.0 is better than yii according to this benchmarks

8397706tostring	string.format
pattern3		
i recommend using string.format or just tostring 0.00 when you only need to round for decimal display purposes and decimal.round if you need to round the actual number for example using it in further calculations

8401272mktime	strtotime
pattern0		pattern0		
much nicer than strtotime mktime etc

8405435punctuation	words
pattern4		
b will match words boundaries a space a newline character punctuation character or end of string

8409027getter	setter
pattern4		
benefits are multiple when given a choice choose setter getter for the benefits of data encapsulation and more control

8410913width	height
pattern0		
in java we have a restriction that width should not greater than height

8410913width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if i set the page format with height is smaller than width it is treating it as a4 paper and feed the bottom of the paper

8413449screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
pattern7	smaller	
if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

8416936width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
but a workaround could be to detect the size of the viewport if the width is greater than the height display normally

8418207width	height
pattern7		
just check if the height is bigger then the width thus portait

8418207width	height
pattern7		
if the width is bigger then the height landscape

8422898typedef	struct
pattern7		
struct foo is easier to parse then typedef d foo as the name-lookup is simpler

8423600cassini	iis
pattern4		pattern2		
some prefer cassini over iis or want certain projects to be hosted

8424026int	double
pattern0		
a double variable can hold larger values than an int and is able to store an approximation of the value 4000000000

8425110carrierwave	paperclip
pattern7		pattern0		
carrierwave is a newer gem than paperclip and it looks a lot more flexible

8425832mxmlc	compc
pattern0		
the flex compiler shell fcsh compiles code faster than mxmlc and compc by keeping all the partial build objects in memory

8425833mxmlc	compc
pattern10	faster	
it works similarly to mxmlc and compc but compiles faster

8430279google-chrome	firefox

i tried here but google-chrome doesn t show any styling except font color while firefox shows some more

8430879firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
whether you use a plugin or write your own code css only is a no go for google-chrome safari and as you said firefox is better at dealing with it

8432226prepare	execute
pattern3		
it should be noted that doctrine2 uses pdo as a base thus i would recommend using prepare statements over plain old execute

8436642set	bag
pattern4		
since you stated in your comments that the array is a result of a db query you can simply include the bag value in your result set by adding select bag as type to your sql statement

8437497min	max
pattern0		
the idea is that any number less than min or more than max is removed

8439451union	distinct
pattern4		
select distinct and union intersect except no longer always produce

8440747division	subtract
pattern4		
in normal integer division you do it using a series of compare subtract steps

8443178setinterval	settimeout
pattern0		
this is also one of the few places i think you d be better off with setinterval rather than settimeout

8444146innodb	myisam
pattern0		
innodb scales better than myisam

8445110moq	fakeiteasy

2 since superclass is smaller than subclassing one should use memory object carefully

8477591addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
that is if you have then you are guaranteed that a happens before b and that b happens before c regardless of the fact that a is involved in an addition which is lower precedence than a multiplication

8481916scipy	pyfftw
pattern0		
i found that numpy s 2d fft was significantly faster than scipy s but fftw was faster than both using the pyfftw bindings

i was reading the yahoo best practices for speeding up your websites some day back and they have very well explained why we should prefer get over post and here is the post snippet for your reference

8490195width	font-size
pattern0		
i initialize the loop with this value and increment the font-size with 1 until the string is wider than the width of the containing element

8495955width	font-size

i am curious to know from web developers point of view what do you prefer firefox or google-chrome

8504693post	get
pattern3		
nb using post does not preclude the use of variables in the url - indeed i recommend using get variables to indicate the data you wish to manipulate and post variables to show how they should be manipulated

8507479websphere	ibm
pattern4		
alternatively i think you should also be able to write something that uses jmx to read specific things about websphere state and there is at least one sophisticated monitoring tool you could purchase ibm tivoli composite application manager itcam for application diagnostics which can monitor websphere internals

8515020post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
get is faster than post

8515028post	get
pattern4		pattern4		
you have to choose get method especially when you want to read and choose post when you want to write update database or file etc

8518758int	chars
pattern7		
now why chat to int works because every chars is represented as unicode in java so you can think of it as at backend chars is a smaller version of int

8518769free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc

ie8 is the same and firefox is much better but i ve migrated away to google-chrome now so would like to stick with the one browser if possible

8526430int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
regarding the last portion of your question the number of bits of int is always more than chars so it won t cause a problem

8526859equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each

8526859equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not

8527305post	get
pattern0		
i think i generally agree with your summary - it makes sense that postandasyncreply is slower than post so if the caller doesn t need to get a notification from the agent when the operation such as putting value into the queue completes it should definitely expose a way to do that using just post

8527360pop-up	dialog
pattern0		
i realize this is an older post but we just ran into the same issue and resolved it by setting the z-index of the bubble pop-up to something higher than the dialog window

8528899equals	compareto
pattern0		
or is it compareto returns negative numbers 0 and positive numbers respectively indicating whether the calling object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

8532096codeigniter	yii
pattern8		
in looking into different frameworks the routing mechanisms they have and the different alternatives employed to make them go faster such as with codeigniter wordpress yii and symphony with alternative caching options how would you do a like-for-like is it possible

8532710imagemagick	graphicsmagick
pattern4		pattern2		
in terms of performance you should compare imagemagick with graphicsmagick some useful links here

8535540quicksort	mergesort
pattern7		pattern0		
i have read that quicksort is much faster than mergesort in practise and the reason for this is the hidden constant

8539223google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
if forced to pick a required browser i d prefer firefox or google-chrome

8541764folder	directory

i would recommend using google-chrome s dev tools cmd+alt+i on mac or firefox s firebug extension to inspect the http request

8546487jlist	jlayeredpane
pattern7	slower	
the listener to the jlayeredpane component makes fast successive calls the listener to the jlist calls significantly slower

8546694for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays

to use this in a loops you can write a simple for-loop which always checks if the index stil is smaller than the arrays length

8547612min	max
pattern4		
select min zonemin max zonemin from plant as linq to sql

8548265udp	mtu	vlan	packets
pattern0		pattern7		
udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500

8548454sorting	grouping
pattern0		
in my experience hashing is always faster than sorting for joining and for grouping

8549715int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
chars and int are two distinct types but this works because an int has more precision than a chars

8555832getter	setter
pattern7	more	pattern7	more	
sometimes a property getter setter does more work then just hold a value

8556332width	height
pattern0		
but is it dangerous to assume that while working in landscape mode the window height will always be less than window width and therefore making it the main constraining factor

8556995width	height
pattern0		
judging by these i would assume that in landscape orientation the window height will be less than window width

8566105inherited	properties
pattern2		
favor composition over inherited give each class that needs the data one properties of a common type

8566225firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
pattern0		
i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome

8566523post	get
pattern8		
some people say get can be less safe than post -- but to the seasoned user this doesn t make any significant difference because they can intercept and modify headers of the request

8574598g++	gcc
pattern0		
g++ seems to work better than gcc in my experience

8576114getter	setter
pattern0		pattern0		
public static field access would cost you less resources than setter getter methods

8576380installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade

it might help to reduce your gif file sizes smaller oh and i believe -depth 8 can only be used for png images

8598156google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
the number of ie addons seems to be far lower than firefox and google-chrome extensions - why s that

8598358jlist	jtable
pattern0		
a jlist would probably be better than a jtable

8605300packets	multicast
pattern4		
keep in mind that firewalls installed on pc can sometime silently kill packets i ve see that under windows especially if you use multicast or loop back addresses

8605329ceylon	kotlin
pattern8		
if scala 2.10 s reification turns out to be more limited than kotlin and ceylon

8607166mockito	easymock
pattern4		
like brice i prefer mockito to easymock but here s the easymock version that is closer to your original example since your example was easymock

8607166mockito	easymock
pattern4		
i think you can see from the two examples why many people prefer mockito but if there s some reason you prefer or are mandated to use easymock you can do just about anything you can do with mockito just with more lines of code

8607666versioning	upgrade
pattern7		
if the code doesn t run on php 5.2+ then you can t use a current phpunit versioning which is definitely more of a concern and my first general recommendation is to find any issues an php 5 upgrade might bring

8615205innodb	myisam
pattern0		
since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario

8615317innodb	tokudb	innodb	myisam	tokudb	myisam
pattern0		
from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb

8617791for-loop	arrays
pattern7		
but for the arrays it is better to use for-loop as shown by alnitak than for-in

8617989screens	tablet
pattern7	larger	
because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a handset there s more room to combine and interchange ui components

8618000google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
try your current setup in google-chrome google-chrome typically has a narrower minimum viewport width and try something like min-width 600px in firefox and your styles should be applied as expected layout.css will be applied when the viewport is at least 600px wide

8618987accessor	properties
pattern3		
prefer using properties accessor to directly accessing instance variables in methods other than init.

8622710fadein	fadeout
pattern0		
the while executes much much faster than the fadeout fadein calls so you only see the last result

8625428g++	gcc
pattern0		
the g++ version is a little larger than the gcc version but not 100x larger

8630885for-loop	loops
pattern7		pattern0		
because i heard that for-loop is much faster than foreach loops

8640295memcpy	strcpy
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
the proper way to copy strings is using strcpy or strcpy_s on windows the difference is memcpy is faster and used in other situations such as pointers buffer management

8641730width	height
pattern7	greater	
it is however still possible that either the width or height is greater than the maximum set

8642394awt	swing	swt	swing

due to that swt looks more native than awt swing

8642900imagick	gmagick
pattern10		pattern10		
imagick is more resource hungry than gmagick but when i tried to use gmagick it is not working properly

8643410division	addition
pattern0		
in addition to that the crossing off may be less work than a division don t know about python it is for c arrays

8643574imagick	gmagick
pattern7		
gmagick is newer version of imagick with more set of features it is less resource intensive and fast but the problem is there is very few discussion about this wonderful tool on web i recently came across this on

8644344mouseup	mousedown
pattern4		
from the new modal dialog box select mousedown or mouseup as message type and click add and edit

8644931linefeed	delimiter
pattern0		
i ve taken the example of two linefeed here but the same is true for any character string i could subvert the problem by maybe taking a longer string as the delimiter but that would have two undersirable effects

8646455crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
pattern10		pattern10		
so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords

8646550crypt	hash	crypt	md5	hash	md5
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

8650771disk	ram
pattern4		
actually prefer ram not disk since it s temporary for a period anyway and recreating it only costs much time

8654903disk	ram
pattern0		
so while the writes my be sequential on disk for datasets larger than ram these random reads will quickly become the bottle neck

8658217division	multiplication

personally i prefer swing but you can do the same thing with swt

8668486freemarker	velocity
pattern4		pattern2		
i prefer freemarker over velocity due to fm s better error handling

8669246udp	tcp
pattern3		
if you re looking to build it from the ground up i would recommend using udp rather than tcp because the messaging is lightweight and it is trivial to implement automatic peer discovery using udp broadcast if needed

8669928post	put
pattern0		
put does not mean update any more than post means insert

8675877cpython	pypy
pattern0		
i know many of pypy s data structures are actually smaller than cpython s but again that has nothing to do with the jit

8675877cpython	pypy
pattern0		
if the dominant memory usage is program data structures then i wouldn t be at all surprised to find pypy using significantly less memory than cpython whether or not the jit was enabled

8676360imagemagick	graphicsmagick

note that imagemagick is the most powerful exactimage is the fastest and graphicsmagick is a folk of imagemagick which is faster but a little less powerful and has some bugs

8677111range	min	range	max	min	max
pattern2		
to do this i suggest to bind to keyup event for range input and store value to internal field i used lastvalue within input itself then bind to change event to compare lastvalue with min max value

8687084java.util.calendar	java.util.date
pattern10	more	pattern10	more flexible	
additionally using java.util.date is not good practice at all since most of its method are deprecated so i suggest you to use java.util.calendar which is more flexible

8688361width	height

there you can choose width and height for your applet

8689227post	get

i don t think it get s simpler smaller than http get post and json unless someone can correct me

8690995extjs	ext.net
pattern4		
to answer point #2 i highly recommend ext.net for working with extjs in visual studio assuming you are using asp.net

8691039vb.net	vb6
pattern4		
in conclusion you can build your browser in either vb6 or vb.net however i would recommend vb.net as microsoft has retired vb6 as a product and a technology

the value sizeof chars is less than sizeof int

8696797min	max	minimum	max
pattern4		pattern4		
you can pull the minimum select min and the maximum select max you can determine how many results are in a set select count

8698357lxml.html	beautifulsoup

swt is claimed to be faster than swing although in modern versions swing is also fast enough

8701954union	distinct
pattern4		
in mysql union selects distinct rows by default

8701974google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
this sample rate might be lower as only google-chrome and firefox are supported

8704228hash	md5
pattern7		
but if you still wish to figure out the phpbb password encryption hash it is no longer md5 in version 3.0 or higher and is a custom hash

8705144aptana	radrails
pattern0		pattern0		
i have to say that this combination is much better than aptana radrails 2 or aptana 3 for developing ruby on rails apps

8709044width	height
pattern0		
then you can safely pass in negative values or values greater than width or height

8709321ubuntu	centos

i was also going to recommend nginx + fastcgi as i prefer nginx to lighttpd it s better mantained or at least that s been my perception the last few years

8715966phpunit	simpletest
pattern7		
subjective phpunit provides much nicer code coverage reports than simpletest

8721350width	height
pattern7	larger	
instead think of the image residing in the left upper portion of a large square the length of the square s side will be the image s width or height whichever is larger

8722485vsto	add-in
pattern0		
if you spreadsheet file has to be downloaded from server you can use epplus on server to generate spread sheet it will be much faster than vsto than you can use wcf from add-in in excel app to upload the data

8724503width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
check that panel width is bigger than oval width and the same with height

8727891versioning	upgrade
pattern4		
however i since added a full versioning to market along side this and sales of that are massive compared to in-app purchase upgrade

8728329rvm	bundler
pattern4		
i would recommend bundler for this purpose over rvm gemsets

8728744jdom	dom4j

in addition there are third-party libraries for xml manipulation which you may find more convenient such as dom4j suggested by duffymo or jdom

8730857width	height
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
since table layout have the ability to break the assigned css width height it is better not using it unless it is table-like structure or you want to contents expand the container - so your

i have just spent a lot of time working with tlistview in view style mode vsreport and i find it is even more limited than tstringgrid for example it provides no in-place edit support

8732514translation	localization
pattern0		
i d have one project team responsible for localization which may well involve more than just translation - different countries have different legal requirements currencies payment providers etc. and one team for improving the code base

8734211glut	glfw
pattern4		
i also prefer glfw before glut mainly because glut isn t maintained actively

8735874avro	thrift

maven definitely has better integration with flex than ant

8743173prop	each
pattern7		pattern0		
needless to say each product has more than one prop which is kept in the producthas table

8746434int	chars
pattern0		
certainly faster than iterating chars by chars if not you can try r.matches s index to find matches occuring after index with index being a random int less than s.length

8748476postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
postgresql has better support but the support by mysql depends on the used storage engine

8749161postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern10	better	
there are workloads where postgresql is better and there are workloads where mysql is better

8749161postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise

8749161postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
personally i d always prefer postgresql over mysql because of the much better sql feature set and the overall quality of the product

8750030width	height
pattern7		
the orientation media feature is portrait when the value of the height is greater than or equal to the value of the width mdash

8752389vim	emacs
pattern3		
in fact i d recommend learning vim or emacs even if you wind up mostly using a more modern editor simply because they exist when nothing else does

8754632udp	tcp
pattern4		
in your case i would personnally choose tcp because you will probably end up reimplementing tcp in some form inside of your udp packets otherwise ask for block syn answer i have block syn ack ok send it to me ack ...data push ack .

8756988hash	md5
pattern0		
thirdly use a better hash than md5 for passwords

if you want them to compare equals use compareto

8763651wordpress	joomla
pattern7	easier	
yes but if joomla is any example of how hard it is to implement a complex custom website with oop then wordpress is far easier and quicker and time is money

8763722for-loop	arrays
pattern7	higher	
the for-loop just initializes the arrays which that each slot in the arrays is .211 higher than the one before it

8764160scrollable	panels

i prefer notepad++ myself after using textpad for many years but always keep textpad on my system for multiline regular expressions and a few other things it does well

8765198width	height
pattern7	greater	
if the height of your page is less than 1024px and the width is greater than 768px the native zoom functionality does not work as expected

8765874equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

8768860width	height
pattern8		
from my experience background images tend to load faster altough images with height and width specifed can load faster but i don t think you have that option

8769826xslt	xquery

i m interested in gradle too but the industry does still favor ant and maven

8779290codeigniter	cakephp
pattern8		
in my opinion it will probably be easier to integrate with codeigniter although someone more experienced with cakephp might prove me wrong

8779881int	boolean
pattern4		
how do i compare boolean or int though

8779950width	height
pattern0		
if requested width or height of a window is larger than width or height of a screen desktop the function shrinks the values to the screen sizes

8783507udp	tcp
pattern0		
udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient

8789679for-loop	loops
pattern7		pattern0		
so we can see that an optimised while loops is faster than a for-loop by 2 operations however it uses more stack space

8791721switching	screens
pattern0		
switching to 2.2 framework which has better compatability with screens resolutions and densities

8792019persistent	transient
pattern0		
my intuition is that transient properties would incurr less overhead than persistent properties because they do not need to be persistent and read from the database so converting them to persistent properties will likely only make things slightly worse

8796382udp	tcp
pattern0		
this is one of the trickier differences between tcp and udp

8796401udp	tcp
pattern0		
as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services

8796504interpolation	splines
pattern7	better	
whether splines or linear trapezodial interpolation is a better fit will depend heavily on your problem

8797731cpython	pypy
pattern0		
so how is it possible for pypy to be faster than cpython also becomes fairly obvious

8801031int	chars
pattern0		
so in this case it s free to use a smaller type than int such as chars

8802693width	height
pattern2		
there is a workaround for this in which we need to get window s available width and height and compare it with width and height values stored previously

8804066bluecloth	rdiscount
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
consider rdiscount which substitutes for bluecloth but is faster and better maintained

8805725post	put	post	get	put	get
pattern8		
from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

8810580range	minimum
pattern0		
the -7 argument is less than the minimum allowed range of 0

8811106union	distinct
pattern4		
union all is to union what select distinct is to select.

8811894calloc	malloc
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
edit i m not a java expert but i think that in java members of new array are initialized to 0 or null so calloc is more correct than malloc in my code

8813553udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster data	
tcp is slower assures data arrival udp is faster data corruption may be possible

8815078min	max
pattern4		
select max your_time_column min your_time_column from your_table

8815180button	checkbox
pattern4		
when selects checkbox and clicks the delete button according to selection the rows will be deleted from database and return the same list page

8817800google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		pattern0		
that happens because pixels size in google-chrome is bigger than in firefox

8820157filesystems	fat
pattern10	less	pattern10	less complicated	
for fat filesystems that s less complicated but still you ll have to study the fs for a while

8820972min	max
pattern4		
select min id max id from tablename

8822558hash	md5
pattern8		
other hash functions such as sha-1 also have hash collisions although it is much less likely than md5

8825662nhibernate	massive
pattern4		
i would choose massive if you want simple fast but unsupported ef if you want easy and ms support but limited in some ways or nhibernate if you have the time to learn a proper orm

8826847trac	mantis
pattern2		
try the mantis it s free and easy php solution.i cannot compare with trac or others because mantis is good enough

8830628http	spdy
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
anything that you do with http is more or less equivalent with spdy and neither is really anything but an implementation detail of your soa work

8833033put	get
pattern7	highter	
if you are uncertain you can always put an if statement and check if the number you get back is highter then int.maxvalue

8834917webchromeclient	webviewclient
pattern10	more	pattern10	more configurable	
note that you re using to different clients webviewclient and the webchromeclient you need to know the difference between them the main difference is that the webviewclient is more configurable

8836906post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
this blog post provides more info to get started

8837833vbscript	jscript
pattern2		
certainly it has pretty much all the advantages of interpreted in this case compare with vbscript or jscript used in classic asp along with much of the advantages of compiled

8838478firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
pattern7		pattern0		
because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

8838606rss	feed
pattern7	better	
edit .net servicemodel.syndication - changing encoding on rss feed this is a better way

8838690kde	gnome
pattern0		pattern0		
the motivation is that font size 12 under kde seems to be much larger than under gnome

8839295apache	nginx
pattern0		
i ve heard it suggested that i use nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache and node.js is that a better solution than just nginx

8840940google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
i am checking it in firefox and google-chrome and see that in google-chrome spacing between letter is larger than in firefox

8842737width	height
pattern4		
ability to select height width selection of desktop or entire desktop and stream live to that channel as if i was using flash media live encoder

8842957vbscript	jscript
pattern4		
to let you compare jscript and vbscript code dealing with the same problem

8843436for-loop	loops
pattern7		
in example sendp method included in for-loop which is slower than making other loops to send packets

8845691rss	feed
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more comfortable	pattern10	more comfortable	
processing rss feed is more comfortable

8850307google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
if i remove this code the width of green image in firefox becomes smaller but it s still bigger than necessary about 100px the google-chrome images keeps unchanged

8852182mocha	jasmine-node
pattern4		
i recommend mocha highly or jasmine-node as good starting places

8852502inline	inlining
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
i have no problem with methods declared inline in a header in some cases - a struct s constructor a simple method where inlining measurably makes it faster we have some math functions like this etc

8854134kde	gnome
pattern0		
i am trying to explore kde a bit but many of the tools i rely on have fonts that appear so much bigger under kde than gnome even though the chosen font size is the same and the resolution is the same 1920x1200

8854366fgetc	getline
pattern7		
i confirmed that in debug mode the getline version is slower about 130 âµs vs 60 âµs for the fgetc version

8854366fgetc	getline
pattern0		
the fact that using getline with iostreams is faster than fgetc at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away

8855505submit	submission
pattern4		
so if data is not ok it must destroy submission the form because if returns false but it doesn t and the form submit as usual and even alert doesn t appear

8855887lisp	scheme
pattern7	rarer	
most lisp dialects have this concepts in scheme it is rarer since hygienic macros are supposed to reduce its usefulness

8856179floating-point	integer
pattern7		
there exist processors on which using an integer vector load movdqa to load data that is consumed by a floating-point operation requires more time than using a floating-point load to get data for a floating-point operation and vice-versa

8857056division	multiplication
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
iirc floating-point multiplication is much less expensive than division so this might be faster than both

8857297int	chars
pattern10		pattern10		
this is largely due to the fact that comparing int values is much faster that comparing chars values

8859053cpu	processors
pattern10		pattern10		
not only is it more expensive in terms of developer costs designing a cpu is vastly more difficult than writing user-space assembly code but it would increase the transistor count of the processors

8859332mp3	ogg
pattern0		
of those three ogg would usually be smaller than mp3

8861922profiler	yourkit
pattern4		
for commercial profilers i will recommend yourkit profiler

8866910vim	emacs
pattern7	easier	
one of the primary distinction betweeen vi vim and emacs is emacs is designed and supposed to be run at times without quitting where as given the quick load time of vim it is easier to quit and start for editing tasks

8867930for-loop	loops
pattern7		
a becomes 10 while it is still inside of the for-loop and gets larger than 10 when the while loops goes for a second run

8869636innodb	myisam
pattern0		
if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to myisam its quite faster than innodb with much less overhead

8870812accessor	properties
pattern10	more	pattern10	more accessible	
you only need to specify a private access modifier for your set accessor when the properties is more accessible

8876494getter	setter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more expensive	
using getter and setter is more expensive because first the vm will lookup the method from a virtual method table and then make the call

8879692apache	nginx
pattern4		pattern2		
i d rather recommend nginx than apache as proxy

8881046qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
pattern0		
by default when you scale a qgraphicsscene larger than the qgraphicsview in which it is displayed it will show the necessary scroll bars

8883535width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
since the height width is calculated on the visible viewport the soft keyboard apparently causes the orientation to flip now that the viewport width is less than the height

8883535width	height
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
this makes it more flexible across devices regardless of orientation not to mention width height is more widely supported than orientation

8886384division	multiplication
pattern8		
division is always much more expensive than multiplication

8890288rsa	aes
pattern4		pattern2		
for encrypting large files i d recommend aes over rsa any day

8893726innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
myisam is better for high read volumes innodb for high update volumes due to table vs row locking

8894972postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
run phpinfo on your local and production servers and compare mysql postgresql mssql whatever-database-you-use driver versions

8907404background-color	transparency
pattern4		
why is the html select background-color black in chrome when set to transparency

8907753qhash	qmap
pattern10		pattern10		
qhash provides faster lookups than qmap

8909591imperative	declarative
pattern7		
while it is possible to explore non-imperative computer concepts it doesn t seem to be worth the effort at the current time - building a declarative machine as an interpreter on top of an imperative machine is much cheaper and faster than a true declarative machine

8913109udp	tcp
pattern4		
with tcp this problem doesn t exist but i prefer udp

8913477opera	google-chrome
pattern7	slower	
after running a modified version of esailija s jsfiddle test to include the documentfragment it doesn t seem to make any difference in google-chrome or opera for that matter so it appears as though google-chrome is simply slower

8914667division	modulo
pattern0		
using an extra variable to avoid the costly division and the resulting time was 18.9s so significantly better than the modulo with a statically known constant

8915421getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd hour 1 cast cast getdate as date as datetime

8918824free	malloc
pattern4		
the reason is that you must match malloc and free not malloc and delete

8920123jruby	mri
pattern10		pattern10		
jruby is faster than 1.9 mri matz ruby interpreter the standard in certain areas

8920723ip-camera	rtsp
pattern4		
i m trying to grab rtsp mjpeg stream from ip-camera realtime as described in boehme using_libavcodec.html but ported to newer version

8924965coalesce	isnull
pattern7	simpler	
coalesce case can add implicit data type conversions whereas isnull has simpler rules

8928034postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
i am using postgresql btw which can do more than mysql incase that changes things

8930717udp	tcp
pattern0		
is sending packets via an established tcp connection after all hand shaking has been done a method to be faster than udp

8931375next	except
pattern7	item smaller	
it compares every item except the last - it will be checked by the second last item and checks whether the next item is smaller

8931660ubuntu	debian
pattern7		pattern0		
since ubuntu 10.10 is newer than debian squeeze if you can do it on squeeze you can certainly do it on ubuntu

8931800disk	ram
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
using a ram disk is even better though often more of a challenge to get it to implement for you

8932414width	height
pattern0		
the width of the papplet is 100 less than the width and height of the jframe

8932659google-chrome	safari
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
i have had issues with dynamically created nodes that use filters and animatemotion has been a bugged in google-chrome for way too long... we use ff5+ as our interactive interfaces for this reason safari is getting better too

8933183width	height
pattern0		
so i have an image placeholder and i want to load the first image from the html within a div element that is larger than 70px width or height

8935836min	max
pattern4		
your question is at heart a select min max date per group and associated fields question

8940209lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern0		
lxml enables you to search for elements using xpath which i think is easier than using beautifulsoup s api

8947847udp	tcp
pattern0		
in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp

8947997put	get
pattern2		
the go language datastore reference states that the actual types passed do not have to match between get and put calls or even across different app engine requests since entities are actually just a series of properties and can therefore be stored in an appropriate container type that can support them

8949555division	addition
pattern0		
for example an addition is typically much faster than a division

8950449nerdtree	netrw
pattern0		
vim includes netrw which is already a filebrowser and i like it a lot more than nerdtree

8951744gedit	sublimetext
pattern0		
i have tried with sublimetext 2 and it work very very good better than gedit p

8953059nexus	artifactory
pattern7		pattern0		
nexus looks better choice than artifactory because of using filesystem instead of database to keep repository

8953187width	height
pattern7		
but the video height and width is smaller then then device screen height width

8955601ienumerable	ilist
pattern10		pattern10		
ienumerable is more abstract and is generally preferred to list or ilist if possible

8956020post	get
pattern8		
edit2 seems as if i m wrong re post being more secure than get

8956998iboutlet	ibaction
pattern7	nothing more	
as stated by mark adams iboutlet and ibaction is nothing more than a void typedef and will only be used by compiler

8957972allegro	sdl
pattern0		
i was also looking at sdl allegro sfml i didnt see much tutorials help on this but heard its better than sdl

8960030int	chars	int	double
pattern10		pattern10		
since every possible byte short chars int float double can be represented as a double its is much more efficient as its a primitive instead of any object and simpler to use double instead of number you would need specific types if you need long accurately or bigdecimal or biginteger

8964861width	height
pattern7		pattern7		
if the width is greater than 320 or the height is greater than 480 it should scale in a way so that it becomes as close to 320x480 as possible but by keeping the proper proportion of width to height

8971830gridbaglayout	miglayout
pattern4		
for more complex layouts i lean towards gridbaglayout although there are others who prefer miglayout

8975328width	height
pattern0		
as the user types if the text is longer than the width i need the height to grow

8975862openfeint	scoreloop
pattern0		
further to this i m still opting for scoreloop and i can confirm this behaves the same regarding one score per user but it offers a lot more functionality and does seem to respond much quicker than openfeint did for me

8977162width	height
pattern0		
this will check if the width of the browser window is greater than the height orientation landscape will do the opposite

8977356width	height
pattern0		
i m sure if we did these same calculations with an image which had a greater height than width we d have the same problem with it having black space at the bottom of the image instead

8979838width	height
pattern0		
when the screen in wider than its height set the image in css to width 100

8980501min	max
pattern0		
i have a table as outlined below and i m trying to get the max and min values for a specific id but only if the max entry date is greater than the min entry date

8980501min	max
pattern0		
so what i m trying to do is grab the max price and min price when the max price entry_date is greater than the min price entry_date

8980854min	max
pattern0		
it would still work if p3 was joined to p only but the extra condition prunes out rows we re not interested in there s no point looking for the min price on rows for which the price is greater than the max

8981895cpython	ironpython
pattern10		pattern10		pattern0		
ironpython is faster than c# in certain areas but not faster than cpython however you can link ironpython to any language thus over coming problems but then again you can do the same with cpython

8985289bazaar	git
pattern4		
the main problem with bazaar you will have is almost everybody who uses git or hg will ask you every time why did you choose bazaar when all guys in their company use git or hg

8985967post	get
pattern0		
post method are generally consume more secure than get because when we use get method than it can display the data in url bar.if the data is more sensitive data like password then it can be inggeris

8986862inherited	properties
pattern2		
yes you will have to create the constructors but that doesn t make inherited pointless although it is actually a good design practice to prefer composition over inherited that is generally not always it is better to have a cat that has-a animal properties than a cat that is-a animal

8989515verilog	vhdl
pattern7	more	
verilog and vhdl allows for more optimization

8991295google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
dialog and select firefox og google-chrome the page is using the correct culture on first view

8993541opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
pattern0		
incidentally the scrolling on the windows version of safari is fine albeit a little slower than ie opera and firefox

8997771s-function	simulink
pattern4		
right click on the s-function block in your simulink project - choose s-function parameters

9000297tcpdf	fpdf
pattern7		
somewhat good news you could move to tcpdf which is much better at handling utf8 and is more modern in general than fpdf

9003490width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
i need to resize an image so that if its height is smaller than its width i ll set its height and vice versa

9006491hash	md5
pattern0		
if you want the fastest encryption algorithm then there s no substitute for testing it yourself - somewhat strangely php s sha1 implementation is significantly faster than its md5 i know these are hash - this is to illustrate that performance depends on implementation as much as algorithm

9009156awt	swing
pattern7		
swing is better and few people remember how to use awt components

9011854unsigned	short
pattern0		
firstly though we tend to use signed more than unsigned values which would lean us toward short but also ushort is not a cls-compliant type and there s hardly any point introducing an incompatibility with other .net languages in obtaining compatibility with com

9012293width	height
pattern7	less	pattern7	less	
clone the div incrementally strip words out until the clone s height width becomes less than the original s

9012526mouseover	mouseout
pattern4		
i would recommend mouseover mouseout

9014069metaphone	soundex
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
general consensus including the php docs is that metaphone is much more accurate than soundex when dealing with the english language

9015987xslt	xquery
pattern7	better	
setting the xhtml namespace as the default namespace might be useful though sadly in xquery this also makes it the default namespace for the output - xslt does this better

9017529width	height
pattern7		
note also that if you change the height when resizing an event will still fire even if the width is smaller than 300px but the reported width remains the same

9020083nsurl	nsdata
pattern7	bytes greater	
so if i modify the nsurl path with a new image because nsdata bytes is already greater than 0 i don t make the additional call to fetch the new image

9021144width	height
pattern7	whichever smaller	
if i could find a way to incrementally increase the width or height whichever is smaller of the button and then resize it so it re- wraps_content then this could work

9021228postgresql	mysql
pattern0		pattern0		
mongodb is fun to toy with and i ve built a few apps using it myself for that reason but it s almost never a better choice than postgresql mysql sql server etc

9021556width	height
pattern7	smaller	pattern7	smaller	
it respects both width and height while widht 100 or height 100 works unless the window width height is not smaller then image itself

9023139width	margin
pattern7		pattern0		
then give it a width that s less than the width of your li and add margin auto to center it

9023456quicksort	mergesort
pattern4		pattern7		pattern0		
for instance quicksort can outperform mergesort although mergesort is provably better than quicksort in the worst case

9028251splinter	selenium
pattern7		
consider taking a look at splinter which is a simpler webdriver api than selenium

9036643memcached	ncache
pattern2		
ncache expresse would work fine too there is no mistery on it but i recommend going with memcached because ncache express has the 2 servers limit so if you ever need to add an aditional node you ll have to change anyway

9036984jsr168	jsr286
pattern7		
the posts you see seem to be logical as jsr286 is a newer spec and there are some features that make jsr268 portlet not a jsr168 portlet

9038874width	height
pattern0		
anyway i checked your code ..your mistake that you always calculate knopafmeting based on width that is correct if height is equal or greater than width

9039033width	height
pattern7	less	
specifically the height must be at least 120px and if the width is less than 100px then the aspect ratio must be no greater than 3.0

9039622xlib	xcb
pattern7		pattern10	more	pattern10	more dated	
xcb is simpler to use has a better response to a multithread environment but lacks documentation while xlib is a more dated complex tool better documented and fully implemented

9046725cpython	pypy
pattern4		
for example you can compare cpython 2.7.2 with pypy 1.7.0 using the example of praveen gollakota

9047258udp	tcp
pattern7		
the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

9047315udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

9048239charindex	substr
pattern4		
select substr address_col 1 charindex address_col -1 as address_col

9048742mapping-by-code	fluent
pattern4		
i m trying to see what is supported and to compare mapping-by-code possibilities with fluent nhibernate

9050531google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
use firefox rather than google-chrome - google-chrome with dev mode is much slower than firefox

9050577hex	binary
pattern7		pattern10	more	pattern10	more data	
if we use hex because it s a simplification of binary that makes things easier on the programmer is easier to read than binary and carries more data etc. why do we not jump to the next logical step base64

9050675trie	dawg
pattern7	less	
if you re interested there is another data structure called a dawg directed acyclic word graph that is similar to the trie but uses substantially less memory

9050865geany	gedit
pattern4		pattern10	more	pattern10	more fully-featured	
if you re fine with moving to another text editor then i would strongly recommend geany which does the same thing as gedit but is more fully-featured and can allow for execution of code in the same application

9052491codeigniter	kohana
pattern10	more	pattern10	more flexible	
in kohana for example also codeigniter but kohana is more flexible you can build internal requests with

9052760des	aes
pattern0		
aes will indeed yield a considerably faster result than des

9053123union	distinct
pattern10	much faster	
that s one reason why omitting distinct and replacing union by union all is much faster

9055493cassette	squishit
pattern4		
i have a small article on using squishit with mvc3 though i prefer cassette

9055653keystore	jks
pattern0		
instead you can support more than the jks and try the default keystore type and if it fails try the #pkcs12

9056249junit	testng
pattern4		
i would recommend testng instead of junit as it will easily allow you to run tests in parallel in any number of threads

9057271disk	ram
pattern0		
that s basically possible but it would take hours as hard disk access is so much slower than accessing ram caches

9058050int	chars
pattern0		
however in int expressions types smaller than int are promoted to int so you can don t need a cast to convert a chars to an int

9058050int	chars
pattern0		
the last thing that you need to know is that whatever the int equivalent of the chars 1 is the actual value is unimportant it is 1 more than the int equivalent for 0

9061732treemap	linkedhashmap
pattern0		
a treemap costs a lot more than a linkedhashmap and adds nothing to your project if you only need to keep original insertion order

9062987postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
with django it is easy to use postgresql instead of mysql so i tried it with the same query and same data in db postgresql is much faster that mysql x10 more faster while using inner join analyse shows it uses indexes unlike mysql

9065359fancybox	colorbox
pattern7		
i ve had to replace lyebox with colorbox which is much faster and seemingly has less problems conflicting with other scripts lightbox fancybox and others wouldn t work for me

9066028google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
select firefox or google-chrome

9071299int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
although note it s not safe since an int is larger than a chars

9072260namedtuple	dictionary
pattern0		
namedtuple have a lower overhead than dictionary since the duplicate keys don t have to be stored per item but have the convenience of named access

9073333width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if the width is greater than the height of the image you can safely assume that it was taken in landscape mode

9078062domcontentloaded	onload
pattern7		
sometimes it s preferable because onload event takes longer to fire then domcontentloaded

9080288magento	expressionengine
pattern10		pattern10		
thinking you can format magento blocks any better in a cms such as expressionengine and use magento just for the backend will put you on a hiding to nothing to end up with a fairly useless setup that isn t going to go anywhere

9081126int	double
pattern7		pattern7	part less	
the int part is less than 2 and the double part is less than 3

9082113int	chars
pattern3		
one digit per int in which case i d recommend using chars rather

9085526swt	swing
pattern0		
even though i liked many design aspects of swt and it is simpler than swing imo swing is the one to learn because imo it has far far better documentation examples etc

9088358disk	ram
pattern0		
if the table is larger than ram you will likely have a single disk io per access the intermediate index levels will be cached

9094207subtract	add
pattern4		
both are good in that they give you a set of convenient arithmetic operations to compare add and subtract times

9095311width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
i need to force the width when i am adding the image to the layout i mean that the image must be keep the aspect ratio but the image must be higher than the height of the screen and the image must be shown incomplete if the height of the image is higher than the height of the screen

9096093width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
i need to force the width when i am adding the image to the layout i mean that the image must be keep the aspect ratio but the image must be higher than the height of the screen and the image must be shown incomplete if the height of the image is higher than the height of the screen

9099227inherited	properties
pattern0		
if you were planning on doing this for more than one properties i d recommend making car inherited from dependencyobject or implementing it from inotifypropertychanged instead of creating events for each

9103655width	height
pattern7	less	
t he height must be at least 120px and if the width is less than 100px then the aspect ratio must be no greater than 3.0

9108031width	height
pattern0		
while setting it to the imageview check if the width of the image is greater than height or not and rotate it to 90 if needed

9108209titlebar	window
pattern7	bigger	
the reason i ask is i am running proficy ifix 5.0 and when i run aero it adds annoying scrollbars to everything as the titlebar of the window is bigger than it normally is

9108430crypt	hash
pattern7		
the second hashing function is hash which supports many more algorithms and variants than crypt but does not support some algorithms that crypt does

9113046flask	django
pattern2		
i do prefer sqlalchemy over django orm for projects where django.contrib.admin is not important i tend to use flask instead of django

9113669division	multiplication
pattern0		
most optimizing c compilers optimize it out to a multiplication operation which is much faster than division it can be done only if the divisor is constant though

9114209innodb	myisam
pattern0		
the script was tested using myisam and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than innodb

9114209innodb	myisam
pattern0		
why is innodb so much slower than myisam in my case

9114289pdcurses	ncurses
pattern10		pattern10		
i ve found pdcurses which is more like the ncurses but it lacks a lot of ncurses libraries

9114324innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
innodb provides more complex keys structure than myisam foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in innodb

9116482post	get
pattern7	better	
my questions are am i right to want to use json and use a php file on the remote server that will accept it as get or is post better and what issues should i be aware of when submitting this for review through itunes

9120912margin	height
pattern7	easier	
should i just target each images and count the container height and use the remainer as top margin or is there easier solution

9121334free	malloc
pattern7	faster	
avoids n calls to malloc free it s faster and simpler to allocate deallocate

9123106int	double
pattern2		
the float class knows how to compare itself with int bignums double etc etc

9126839width	margin
pattern0		
anyway i just set the margin to a value a little bigger than the width of the image and overlap is eliminated only in the very specific case we want

9131691gridview	objectdatasource
pattern0		
from what i ve read the gridview control plays a lot nicer with the objectdatasource

9132458charindex	substr
pattern4		
select substr f.filename 0 charindex . f.filename as last_segment

9133312children	parent
pattern0		
by giving .artist-container a higher z-index you are placing it higher in the stacking order than the child image though children always have a higher z-index than their parent

9137307next	except
pattern7	c smaller	
moving iterator from one element to the next is an o c operation both in the list and in the multi map except c is slightly smaller for the list so it is unlikely you ll gain much by combining the two

9140945width	height
pattern0		pattern7		pattern0		
what i was looking to do was to assign a width property of 100 if the height of the images is greater than the width and the height if the width is greater than the height

9143119int	chars
pattern4		
and in this example you can see that i compared two chars just like i would compare int egers - with simple

9143497for-loop	loops
pattern7		pattern0		
the other advice i have is that a for-each loops is faster than a for-loop

9143874for-loop	loops
pattern7		
i personally think the while loops looks less clean than the nested for-loop

9153437uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
pattern0		
the code you presented will never pass more than one uiviewcontroller to the uipageviewcontroller

9155303g++	gcc
pattern4		
i don t believe ios has any kind of compiler built-in so you ll want to try to grab gcc or g++ from cydia

9155819sorting	filtering
pattern8		
xml files have none - so sql databases are a lot more efficient with sorting and filtering

9157094quicksort	heapsort
pattern0		
in theory insertion sort and quicksort are worse than heapsort

9161130memcpy	memmove
pattern7		pattern0		
note that memmove has more overhead than memcpy because it has to determine which direction of copying is safe

9161296apache	nginx
pattern3		
the context of this question is that lots of people recommend using nginx to serve static media files and apache to serve the python which beckons the following questions

9163056apache	nginx
pattern4		
apache can be just as good but requires building from source and knowing exactly what configuration to use to match nginx

9163130inherited	properties
pattern0		
for the vm layer i like the containment pattern more than inherited and at this layer i also implement inotifypropertychanged which is also a properties of the vm and not the data model

9163426disk	ram
pattern7		pattern0		
so even ignoring practical considerations like disk is slower than ram it will be slower

9164607mxmlc	compc
pattern0		
compilers but it compiles faster than the mxmlc and compc

9164948postgresql	mysql
pattern10	closer	pattern10	closer sql	
also which database syntax postgresql or mysql is closer sql mssql syntax and structure

9165283put	get
pattern0		
is there any easier way than put all in set and get set size

9167436bcel	cglib	javassist	bcel	javassist	cglib
pattern7		pattern0		
here in so i found a lot of questions asking something similar and the answers normally said you can use cglib or asm or javassist is better than cglib or bcel is old and is dying or asm is the best because it gives x and y

9167763hive	hdfs
pattern0		
plus the overhead of doing it is extremely costly- hive queries against hbase are on my cluster at least an order of magnitude slower than against plain hdfs files

9169782gif	png
pattern2		
you could do the alternative if you need the image to be animated but using a 32-bit png instead which you should prefer over gif regardless

9171746jqplot	flot
pattern0		
bluff charts get really weird when scaled to more than 800px flot has a very limited api and the tooltips on multi axis dont work plotkit and jquery visualize doesnt have tooltips and i couldnt find any good documentation on gpraphael my best shot was jqplot which was meeting all my needs until i tried to print it on paper they print unaligned

9171795width	height
pattern7		
rather than using fixed width height it is better to create a layout which allows the textblock to adjust its width

9174795client-side	server-side
pattern0		
are client-side binding grids better than the server-side ones

9175355ssl	https
pattern3		
i recommend using ssl https in all cases

pattern4		pattern2		
although i prefer wordpress over joomla the acymailing solution is great and has worked successfully for several clients of mine

9192904nfa	dfa
pattern0		
regex is a nfa and is as such in most cases slower than a dfa or hand-written parser

9195786primes	modulus
pattern0		
it is perfectly possible to use rsa with a modulus n that is composed of more than two primes factors p and q but two things have to be noted

9203505maven	m2e
pattern4		
if you are using m2e be sure to right click on the project select maven and then update project configuration

9207542cakephp	kohana
pattern4		
little bit slow thing is we can t compare kohana hello world application and cakephp hello world application if u tried to write hello world application cakephp automatically loaded orm support validations etc

9209810csc	vbc
pattern10		pattern10		
so yes at least in this respect csc is smarter than vbc

9211300portrait	landscape
pattern4		
i want to create a dynamic widget for ibooks 2 but i can not dynamically resize the widget to match portrait or landscape mode

9211731innodb	myisam
pattern8		
innodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisam

9211898min	max
pattern4		
there are probably other special cases you want to deal with to constrain it -- just pick min and max radians and check them before using in a transform

9213299maven	pom.xml
pattern4		
type in maven in the filter field and select maven pom.xml file

9213578calloc	malloc
pattern7		pattern0		
also calloc is slower than malloc from operating system memory allocation perspective

9216497inherited	properties
pattern7		
this should handle all cases of setting the properties makes them easier to implement in your inherited classes and cleans things up

9219871x86	mips
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
mips is much more orthogonal than x86 could ever dream of being

9220557hash	salt
pattern10		pattern10		
however using a salt offers more protection against rainbow tables precalculated hash tables so they re still worth using

9220735innodb	myisam
pattern0		
innodb delivered 4.6x higher throughput than myisam while achieving

9221263width	height
pattern10		pattern10		
issue is that user may link to an image that is of extremely large height and width which is more than the height and width of the div it is in causing some overflow layout issues

9224507dbcontext	objectcontext
pattern7		
and dbcontext is much simpler to use than objectcontext and will serve the most common development needs

9225634apache	nginx
pattern4		pattern2		
one thing to consider is the magento environment tuning the php the web server favor nginx over apache and mysql

9233921subtraction	addition
pattern0		
converting between time zones runs in constant time as there is nothing more involved than simple addition subtraction

9234172octal	hex
pattern8		
from what i understand octal was more popular than hex among users of 18-bit architectures since a word would be exactly 6 octal digits

9235592udp	tcp
pattern0		
for this particular application sending simple data chunk to the client from an index given by the client tcp will not perform any better than udp

9235592udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

9236157floating-point	integer	floating-point	fixed-point
pattern7		pattern0		
but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic

9236542innodb	myisam
pattern10	faster	
i considered changing them to innodb to make the database 100 the same but then read the myisam is faster

9236625width	height
pattern0		
i want to maintain the aspect ratio so in doing the width resize the height of the image becomes greater than the height of the screen

9236782json.net	jsonfx
pattern4		
i have used json.net extensively in the past and came to prefer jsonfx over it a few months ago

9236886ubuntu	linux
pattern3		
sometimes people recommend installing ubuntu linux on top of windows in a virtual machine for rails development

9237803rsa	aes
pattern7		
like you heard asymmetric cryptography like rsa is much slower than symmetric cryptography aes but it does have it s advantages simpler key management a single private key to protect

9239838debian	linux
pattern7	package smaller	
in linux the git-core debian package is much smaller and the process is much quickier

9241990autoresetevent	manualresetevent
pattern10	more	pattern10	more sensible	
when things get complex an autoresetevent or manualresetevent is usually more sensible as they are less time critical you get through the gate regardless of ordering

9242136width	height
pattern10		pattern10		
when i want to draw a rectangle in c# using pen tools if the rectangle width and height is less then the pens width then program draw nothing in from if pens alignment property inset .but when i set alignment center then it print a rectangle

9243100websphere	ibm
pattern4		
if you work for big enterprise company - i would recommend ibm websphere 7 portal otherwise i recommend you to consider jboss and liferay

9246022ienumerable	iqueryable
pattern10		pattern10		
i m not familiar with the infeasability of iqueryable but this blog post seems to indicate that iqueryable is much more preferable to ienumerable because iqueryable allows access to the underlying expression

9248755ati	nvidia
pattern0		
ati seems to tell more than nvidia

9248897udp	tcp
pattern2		
it mean what should i choose between tcp and udp

9248926int	double
pattern4		
i m pretty new to java but as you can see in this example int follows buy double

9249063udp	tcp
pattern2		
it mean what should i choose between tcp and udp well there s a fair difference between tcp and udp connections you usually use udp connectionless when you have peformance issues like voip apps real time games video chat and so on while in onther cases you use tcp so in your case tcp should suit you good

9251272for-loop	arrays
pattern7		
looping with a for-loop is nothing more than a basic iteration of an arrays using a for-loop

9253030profiling	benchmarking
pattern0		
as svick said it s no better way than profiling your program identifying hot spots and optimizing them using concrete benchmarking

9253210opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

9255729quicksort	mergesort
pattern7	less	pattern7	less	
compared with quicksort mergesort has less number of comparisons but larger number of moving elements

9257884visualvm	jprofiler
pattern4		
apart from visualvm i recommend jprofiler whose servlet probe will show you all invoked urls

9262850profiling	debugging
pattern4		
this is help to route to defined controller but i lose debugging profiling in dev environment still i can not detect a cause

9264190dbcontext	objectcontext
pattern7	easier	
from what i have read the dbcontext is a simplified version of the objectcontext and makes it easier to work with

9266162children	parent
pattern4		
i have a similar requirement as this select parent record with all children in sql

9267163hash	md5
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
the hash cake generates are more complex than md5

9268752mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern0		
and the second problem is that i want to use hover or hoverintent method better than mouseenter and mouseleave but im not sure how to use fadeto to get the same effect

9269051cpu	processors
pattern0		
the simultaneous use of more than one cpu or processors core to programmatically execute a program or multiple computational threads

9275270xpo	openaccess
pattern4		
i think we re going to buy xpo or openaccess

9277526google-chrome	firefox
pattern2		
surprising win by google-chrome by a huge margin vs firefox and ie9

9277886imperative	declarative
pattern7	better	
what s bad about this is that when microsoft were designing asp.net mvc they opted for declarative validation logic using data annotations instead of imperative which is much better suited to validation scenarios and can handle just anything

9286808udp	tcp
pattern0		
for instance zeromq can leverage udp multicast to run faster than any tcp protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api

9287416udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
udp is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the tcp reliability stuff

9287841apache	nginx
pattern10		pattern10		
nginx is better suited than apache as it is light and single threaded vs apache thread per request in most normal setups

9287843apache	nginx
pattern10		pattern10		
you don t want to use apache because nginx is better suited since nginx is built for async i o

9295198gif	png
pattern0		
png and gif are better than jpeg gif probably better than png

9296657gson	jackson
pattern10		pattern10		
jackson is faster but the api is 37x more complex than the gson api

9296813maven	pom.xml
pattern4		
and when i run maven with -f pom.xml2 option as reactor with projectb specified as module it looks like that it picks pom.xml2 from the projecta and it picks pom.xml from projectb

9298262addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
and has higher precedence than or just like multiplication has higher precedence than addition

9300555udp	tcp
pattern0		pattern0		
i assumend that the transmission using udp have to be much faster than using tcp but in fact my tests proved that the udp transmission is about 7 to 8 times slower than using tcp

9300555udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
maybe one of you guys already sees a problem in the code snippets or have any other suggestion or hint for me why my udp transmission is slower than tcp

9306245client-side	server-side
pattern0		
since you don t want to repeat yourself it s very tempting to put all your validation on one side or the other but there are tradeoffs either way and it is true that server-side validation is going to be slower than client-side

9311821subtract	addition
pattern4		
is there an api which handles decimal arithmetic compare subtract and addition in javascript

9314732width	height
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
if i want an inline list to be a certain height width is it better to use display inline

9317842width	height
pattern4

9318108atan2	sqrt
pattern10		pattern10		
with typical libraries on common modern hardware sqrt is faster than atan2

9318444128bit	64bit
pattern10		pattern10		
in a few more years there might be an architecture where 128bit math is faster than 64bit but i don t think any exists today

9319538google-chrome	firefox

9322103ada	vhdl	verilog	vhdl
pattern4		
the choice of language is somewhat arbitrary - i code in vhdl syntactically similar to ada most of the time but some of my colleagues prefer verilog syntactically similar to c

9322946post	get
pattern7		
post has a higher overhead marginally if we re honest but it all adds up but it doesn t become part of the url so can t be seen by say a casual observer over the user s shoulder - whereas get can

9325404atan2	sqrt
pattern7		pattern0		pattern7		pattern0		
indeed sqrt is better than atan2 and 1 sqrt is better than sqrt

9325951tunnel	vpn
pattern7		
and between we are just looking to send and receive data over tunnel there is nothing more or need to control computer on the network all we need is to route data through corporate firewall and should support multiple vpn servers such as cisco microsoft etc

9326919for-loop	loops
pattern10		pattern10		
is for-loop is faster than while loops

9329982.htaccess	httpd.conf
pattern10		pattern10		
using apaches httpd.conf is faster since accessing the .htaccess adds a small overheadâ apache checks every directoryâ and parent directoryâ for the file and it will be loaded for every request

9330797post	get
pattern8		
post is absolutely not more secure than get as to man in middle attacks

9333610swt	swing
pattern7		
in my opinion swing is easier to learn and to use but the results of swt are often nicer - you can often feel that a swing application behaves not completely right

9333783int	chars
pattern10		pattern10		
assuming you are trying to create a 32 bit int out of 4 chars there is probably more checking you can do but at a minimum i would turn this into two methods convertchararraytouint and another one that does each shift shiftcharleft chars numbits and hide all the casting ugliness in there

9334237clang	llvm
pattern8		
frankly i care less and less each day as i become more and more impressed with clang llvm

9335077width	height
pattern0		
alternatively you can use jquery filter method to filter all the images which have width greater than height and then add the required class at once

9337556postgresql	mysql
pattern2		
i m thinking about postgresql to store the data because i ve already used it and i like it also if a nosql would be a good choice -since not all data needs to have a relation- i like the postgresql support and community and i feel better knowing that there s a big community out there to help me mysql innodb is also a good choice tbh i ve not a real reason to choose it over postgresql and vice-versa is maybe mysql easier to create shards

9337734ember.js	backbone.js
pattern4		pattern7	less	
there are many options for client-side mvc or mvvm code organization such as knockout.js and ember.js but personnally i prefer backbone.js which has less magic but offers more control

9340618cos	sin
pattern0		pattern0		
note that + and - are much faster than cos sin etc

9342678vb.net	vb6
pattern7	stronger	
vb.net seems to think lots of things are objects one way or another but vb6 has stronger typing in this case

9351767scalacheck	quickcheck
pattern0		
scalacheck s api is also a bit richer than quickcheck s api

9352970post	put
pattern10		pattern10		
i think that in that case the put verb is more appropriate because post really means i want to create something new

9354052int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
my original solution was naive - it didn t deal with the case when the int hash is less than 100 base 36 - meaning it would print less than 3 chars

9356573factors	matrix
pattern7		pattern0		
however it still performs worse by initially a factors of 3 but as the matrix size increases asymptotically worse by a factors of exactly 2

9356850listview	gridview
pattern7	control better	
templating rows like this is possible in a gridview but the listview control is much better suited to this type of data

9361583xlsx	xlsm
pattern0		
they also tend to be smaller than their xlsx or xlsm counterparts

9369269cstdio	iostream
pattern0		
iostream is said to be slower than cstdio but i suggest you use a profiling tool here to find the best set of options here

9372583hide	show
pattern4		
there s really not much too it on the change event for the select hide all any of the masterpreview s child divs that might currently visible and then show only the one with the class name matching the value of the selected option

9378676width	height
pattern7		
if you rotate the device the width becomes the height and we can ignore the change but if the height gets dramatically smaller while the width remains the same it is safe to assume there is a keyboard being shown and we throw a show keyboard event

9378676width	height
pattern7		
when the height gets dramatically larger while width stays the same we throw a hide keyboard event

9378699post	get
pattern7		
following my comment on your original post here s some more information that will help you get through this

9381223children	parent
pattern0		
since parent have a higher z-index than its children you need to change the default browser stacking behavior

9381223children	parent
pattern0		
the z-index for the children should be higher than the parent

9384963min	max
pattern0		
however during debugging i discovered that the min x values area always lower than the max x values regardless of positions and sizes of the rectangles

9386661uiview	calayer
pattern0		
this does not work because the uiview you are subclassing i assume it is a uiview already is the delegate of its own calayer it cannot be the delegate of more than one calayer at once

9389913uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
pattern0		
the app uses a uinavigationcontroller that never has more than 1 uiviewcontroller on it s stack

9394358int	chars
pattern2		
this is the same as -ascii except a case is ignored except as a tie-breaker and b if two strings contain embedded numbers the numbers compare as int not chars

9398955for-loop	loops
pattern7	less	
what i want to do is to check how many seconds the time is after loops and then if the time taken to finish the for-loop is less than 60 sec than run the mysql update

carrierwave seems to be gaining more popularity than paperclip but most people seem to be on paperclip

9409379udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability

9410986packets	multicast
pattern7	simpler	
as for streaming it s better to use udp first because it lowers the load on servers but mostly because you can send packets with multicast it s simpler than sending it to each connected client

9413819width	height
pattern4		pattern2		
if your prefer height over width means that you want a given height 300 and the width should be calculated by the picture ratio you may use resize_to_fit 1000000 300

9417319super	self
pattern2		
one quick solution to this might be to subclass nsslider nsslidercell and override the mouse dragging machinery to call super then post a custom nssliderdidchangetemporaryvalue or whatever name you choose notification with self as the object

9420697requestfactory	gwt

from gwt 2.1 requestfactory is better counterpart than gwt rpc when you use db4o together

9422310post	get
pattern7		
to answer part of your second question with .net if the post is larger than maxrequestlength part of the .net configuration but smaller than maxallowedcontentlength part of the iis configuration you can create a custom http module to get at the portion of the post that came through

9422814vmware	bootcamp
pattern0		
i ve found that bootcamp was slightly faster than vmware non bootcamp image but i still use vmware the majority of the time because i like using the host os for things like mail chat browsing

9423769int	chars
pattern2		
also please compare with chars values t instead of int

9424505gif	png
pattern7		
png gives you better alpha result than gif

9424540innodb	tokudb
pattern4		
one reason that we choose innodb tokudb is we need partition support and maintenance friendly

9425100width	height
pattern0		
but there s has got to be a better more elegant way i m taking the length of the wider value between height and width of the rectangle and using every number in between that and 0 and testing that against each of the 4 sides of the rectangle and see if it s in it

9425154children	parent
pattern4		
as in you can select children but not parent

9427335for-loop	loops
pattern0		
the for-loop is using i as a global variable so if your instance.set_marker function is also using i as a global variable and sets its value to something greater than 6 loops will exit

9429223disk	ram
pattern0		
at any rate disk speeds are orders of magnitude lower than the ram speed and i wouldn t be too much concerned about the mode here unless of course it turns out that caching is different in the two modes

9430683documentfilter	jtextcomponent
pattern10		pattern10		
for listening changes into jtextcomponent is there documentlistener if you have to need control over inputed char sings whitespace chars or word s you have to implements documentfilter

9436201int	double
pattern4		
i need to match int and double

9440180ninject	linfu	ninject	spring.net	autofac	castle-windsor	linfu	spring.net
pattern2		
how am i supposed to choose between castle-windsor unity structuremap spring.net autofac ninject funq linfu etc etc

9447869int	double
pattern7		
as soon as the int needs more than 29 bits the atom is changed by the vm into a number type which is really represented as a 29 bit pointer to the actual 64 bit double precision float

9450179google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
i d recommend google-chrome s inspect tool or firefox s firebug inspect tool to help you understand and modify element s css

9451567scons	autotools
pattern0		
edit i was hoping not to turn this into another flame war but i guess that s inevitable so i will just say that i have considerably more experience with autotools and no desire to learn cmake or scons or imake or ant although i seem pretty much stuck with the latter when working with java these days or whatever new tool is invented next year or the year after

9451682button	checkbox
pattern4		
now each of my has multiple controls like select checkbox button but not fixed for every row and column

9453145children	parent
pattern0		
you may need to also add another bit to the child2 join to remove the possibility of parent having a higher rating than the children

9454016int	chars
pattern0		
the damerau-levenshtein algorithm includes many comparisons and int compare much faster than chars

9456024disk	ram
pattern0		
if the worker processes do other things than just calulations read from or write to disk they will have to wait a lot since a disk is a lot slower than ram

9460169disk	ram
pattern0		
so bandwidth was probably viewed as cheaper than server ram and disk storage

9460541children	parent
pattern0		
in other words if a parent row can have more than one children when sending the fields to each child the parent data will be duplicated in each children

9460541children	parent
pattern4		
2 kill children and keep the parent in this case you remove all the children and send all of their attributes to the parent

9460541children	parent
pattern0		
disadvantages again if a parent can have a row that relates to more than one children data will be duplicated as there will be one row per each of them so there is a limitation in this solution

9460541children	parent
pattern0		
in this case a parent row can be linked to more than one children without duplicating data

9460742width	height
pattern7	greater	
for example an image of 126x39 pixels will not be displayed as the ratio of width divided by height is greater than 3.0 126 39 3.23

9462159innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern7	older	
innodb is newer while myisam is older

innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

9462159innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

9462159innodb	myisam
pattern7		
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

9465081width	margin
pattern7		pattern0		
the body width is smaller than page width left margin right margin which according to this link can be an issue how to get rid of blank pages in pdf exported from ssrs

9468484union	distinct
pattern4		
union as opposed to union all already returns unique items only so you won t need group by or select distinct

9470241junit	mockito
pattern4		
i recommend junit and mockito for this although there are other frameworks you can use

9475005versioning	upgrade
pattern4		
i highly recommend upgrade to the latest versioning of spree currently 1.0.0 as spree-conference was just announcing it

9478037hash	md5
pattern0		pattern0		
this might look a little nicer than md5 hash but you would have to ensure url strings are not used several times

9485123apache	nginx
pattern4		
even using nginx under the hoods you can still choose apache or nginx to maintain your webservers domains using sockets

9488511width	height
pattern4		
window.open url select width 600 height 600 status 0 resizable 1 scrollbars 1 toolbar 0 location 1

9490636junit	easymock	junit	mockito	mockito	easymock
pattern4		
for unit tests single bean tests not run within container i d recommend junit and easymock mockito

9492029google-chrome	firefox
pattern10		pattern10		
you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both google-chrome lines up perfectly but firefox seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or google-chrome dev tools

9497805inline	inlining
pattern0		
while function calls can be a little worse than inline code for very simple operations repeated inlining of non-trivial functions can create arbitrarily worse code bloat

9500858width	margin
pattern0		
it seems a good idea to set the width of the body a little less than page width - left + right margin

9505347mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern0		
finally if you want to optimize your program to number of lines - trading off engineering practices - you ll have a shorter program with mouseenter and mouseleave events

9508840couchbase	couchdb
pattern7		
couchbase looks more like a memcache server with a persistence layer powered by couchdb and maybe it does not fit your needs

9512512min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
your code take all the td s which their values are bigger than the min value and all the td s which their values are smaller than the max value this mean all the td s

9517785sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7	better	
sorteddictionary offers same advantages than sortedlist but performs better if values to insert are not already sorted

9519571multiplying	multiplication
pattern0		
if i make a mistake and multiplying a number by 1.0 instead of 1 and i do not use any compiler optimization then my multiplication will last much longer than multiplying a number by 1

9521280free	malloc
pattern3		
i would prefer using malloc and later free it so that i dont have to worry about when the read only string literal get destroyed

9524411notepad++	sublimetext	notepad++	scite	sublimetext	scite
pattern4		
i prefer sublimetext 2 but notepad++ or scite might suit you better

9526369width	font-size
pattern0		
from there on the width slowly increases again as the part of the string still on line 1 linearly gets wider as the font-size increases

9533650profiling	instrumentation
pattern4		
1 start instrumentation from finder and choose profiling zombies

9536915postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
mysql is ok choice bit if you re expecting vast amounst of data i would prefer postgresql sql imho best free db avaliable

9542764hash	salt
pattern4		
and secondly to thwart rainbow table attacks that match hash against a precompiled list because none of the precompiled hash used the salt you have used so a new rainbow table would need to be generated for each salt hash

9542772salt	md5
pattern0		
encrypt the passwords with one-way encryption algorithm with a random salt like the common opinionï¼š sha-256 is stronger than md5

9545528post	get
pattern0		
or in case there are less than 5 post you will get an error

9548179folder	directory
pattern4		
select folder of jdk as jre home directory

9550924apache	nginx
pattern0		
although this thread is more than a year old it still merits from the fact that no one mentioned about the not so recent innovations of nginx lighty and other web servers which scale much better than apache at higher concurrency and consume lesser resources

9552483udp	tcp
pattern0		
what s currently baffling me is in my results tcp finishes almost 2x faster than udp

9552715integer	unsigned
pattern7	bigger	pattern7	bigger	
as an unsigned integer is bigger than 1

9556280webapp2	cherrypy
pattern4		
and i would prefer cherrypy to the webapp2 which is in the gae example

9557460post	get
pattern0		
i want to get all the users that has more than one post but

9570228ready	each
pattern2		
your threads are cpu-intensive it is they don t block waiting for some slow resource to be ready so threads compete with each other for cpu

9572003range	max
pattern4		
query the table once to get the highest imprints column value to use for your maximum random value range like so select max imprints as max from my_table

9572031hash	md5
pattern0		pattern0		
because sha256 hash are much longer than md5 hash you can detect the hash algorithm by looking at the length of the hash

9572536django-userena	pinax
pattern10		pattern10		
i was thinking of using the accounts app but django-userena seems better so i created a project zero with pinax and tried to integrate django-userena with it

9573984int	chars
pattern4		
tablea id int match chars 15 multiple chars 10

9575967width	height
pattern0		
the above scaling assumes that the height of the grid location is always smaller than the width of the grid location

9578272scheme	racket
pattern3		
if you want to get started i recommend downloading racket a highly popular implementation of scheme

9578359setinterval	settimeout
pattern10		pattern10		
setinterval is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since settimeout only runs once and you need to keep on calling it

9581376floating-point	fixed-point
pattern7		pattern0		
it s not necessarily true that the matlab fixed-point arithmetic provides less precision it can be used to provide more precision than ieee floating-point types

9583021ant	maven
pattern3		
also if you are just now starting the project i will recommend using maven instead of ant

9589929ordinals	difference
pattern7	dates more	
the difference between the maximum and minimum value of the set of ordinals dates is one more than the length of the set

9591286switching	screens
pattern7		
but when the screens is smaller than 900px we switching from fixed to liquid via media query switching to a liquid width will allow our images to scale down our text to wrap and a whole bunch of other great things

9592792webchromeclient	webviewclient
pattern7		pattern10	more	pattern10	more configuration	
to sum up the webchromeclient is easier to use but the webviewclient allows you more configuration

9593569children	parent
pattern0		
if you need to do more with the parent like paging or fetching the children you could split this problem into a sub query note that the line is not required it s just an example what you can further do with the query

9594035button	checkbox
pattern4		
i am trying to click a checkbox that enables a purchase button to appear

9594107xrange	enumerate
pattern10		pattern10		
enumerate is more pythonic but xrange is fine here too

9596138carrierwave	paperclip
pattern3		
and would you recommend using paperclip or carrierwave here

9596844gprof	callgrind
pattern4		
i think you will very much prefer callgrind to gprof

9596890velocity	rythm
pattern0		
the benchmark shows rythm is 2 to 3 times faster than velocity on a normal page

9599391min	max
pattern4		
for example select min salary max salary is most likely going to pull values from different records

9600557mybb	ipb
pattern7		pattern0		
the ipb one has less queries used only 14 on average but it runs slower than mybb with more queries used average on 20

9600557mybb	ipb
pattern7		pattern0		
the ipb which has less queries runs slower than mybb with more queries

9603048vim	emacs
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
i am starting to understand that even though emacs is more powerful than vim vim is at least 10 times easier to use less keystrokes and requires way less modifications

9606511post	get
pattern7		
another reason but rather a minor one is that get is easier to exploit that post as there are more ways to trigger get request than to trigger post request

9608101tcplistener	tcpclient
pattern7		
on the server side you re using tcplistener which is nothing more than a socket or tcpclient factory

9609477apache	nginx
pattern0		
apache made a claim that apache 2.4 will offer performance as good or better than nginx

9609619ordereddictionary	sorteddictionary
pattern10	more	pattern10	more appropriate	
it might not be the most efficient way to do it but i ve used ordereddictionary though sorteddictionary is probably more appropriate for handling the out of order issue in the past

9613707division	multiplication
pattern10	more	pattern10	more complicated	
multiplication and division is even more complicated but it s possible to do using a similar system

9617762width	height
pattern7		
if browser width is less than 1670px and height of div.banner is less than 1253px then let div.title and div.social s parent be div.banner else let the parent of div.title and div.social be the body or browser window

9627280udp	tcp
pattern0		
because of tcp requires connection and provides security it is slower than udp and therefore it should not be preffered during a video streaming

9627831width	height
pattern10	less	pattern10	less	
the scrollbar should appear at the side when the width or height is less then the limit just like a scrollbox and can be scroll also

9631207width	height	screens	mdpi
pattern2		
i put my pictures in the drawable folder which on a xhdpi screens like mine will cause android to upsample everything twice to match xhdpi against mdpi and will result in a 400 memory usage twice the width and twice the height so 4 times as many pixels

9632036union	distinct
pattern4		
so my suggestion is after you inserted run a select distinct id from all sources and put them together on a structure table temp table view union whatever.. and run a merge from this source into destination on the ids with only a when not matched then delete

9634984google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
in my testing google-chrome is nicer it pops-up the unresponsive alert whereas firefox apparently doesn t care

9641524union	distinct
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
union all performs better than union union works like distinct first order by then remove duplicates

9644621post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
why get method is faster than post

9647275onresume	onpause
pattern0		
and you should not access vehicledataprovider before onresume in the life cylcle and no more after onpause

9647879spaces	delimiter
pattern0		
you are using the wrong delimiter since your text file may contain more than one spaces character between tokens

9649651getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
pattern10	more	pattern10	more simple	
it would be slightly more sensible to bind the click to an element closer to the form and if you use getelementbyid rather than getelementsbytagname it s more simple since you don t have to worry about the index of the number you re binding to

9649834addition	multiplication
pattern0		
why with this grammar multiplication have higher precedence than addition

9650260int	chars
pattern0		
if you copy int larger than chars like short or long you have to make sure to correct the byte order depending on your cpu architecture

9651759post	get
pattern3		
i would strongly recommend using post rather than get as get requests are assumed not to change any data

9652038min	max	minimum	max
pattern0		
the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

9653437children	parent
pattern0		
as a general rule of thumb i keep the parent bigger than the children

9654375mvvm	delegatecommand
pattern7	better	
for mvvm scenarios a relaycommand or delegatecommand is a better fit than the routedcommand which is provided with wpf

9655339vbo	normals
pattern7		
when i use vertex array model looks perfect but when i switch to vbo model looks worse because of vertex normals

9655736rvm	bundler
pattern4		
you could grab rvm have rvm install ruby use bundler for your gems and then launch the script

9656926width	height
pattern7		
the only way i found to be sure that the view is in landscape mode is to test that the view height is less than the view width

9657647sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
sortedlist appears to use less memory and is technically a binary tree where sorteddictionary is faster with unsorted data

9661458piston	tastypie
pattern2		
also tastypie is amazing and i highly recommend it over piston after using both

9664407int	chars
pattern0		
if you have no more than 16777216 chars of underlying string data 120 000 strings times an average length of 10 chars 1.2 million chars you can take the low-order 24 bits of each int and store the starting offset of each string into your backing array of chars data and take the high-order 8 bits of each int and store the size of the corresponding string there

9666529min	max
pattern7		pattern0		
this function should check of a series of integers that there are four they are all different and that the min is 3 less than the max - thus that there are four in a row

9670832getter	setter
pattern3		
generally i would recommend using getter and setter as it is cleaner more organized and more readable

9671122innodb	myisam
pattern0		
i did a search online comparing myisam and innodb but all of the articles i read judged myisam being faster than innodb on select queries

9671726innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
it is possible that the config of your innodb engine is more efficient for your searches than the way you have myisam set up

9675447innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam

9681963fink	macports
pattern3		
i would recommend using macports or fink as a package system

9682121karatsuba	strassen
pattern10	algorithm faster	
i think karatsuba algorithm is best to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers.for sufficiently large n another generalization the schã nhageâ strassen algorithm is even faster

9684008union	distinct
pattern4		
the union operator selects distinct values by default so you should not need to use distinct in your select statements

9687303jasmine	qunit
pattern2		
i want to introduce js testing in a project and i want to choose between jasmine or qunit or something third

9689844prepare	execute
pattern7	safer	
using a solution such as a prepare statement where it is not possible for a user to directly influence the actual sql query being execute is a safer alternative

9693604gif	png
pattern7	better	
png does everything except animations unless enhanced with apng that gif does and better

9696236tstringgrid	tdbgrid
pattern10	more	pattern10	more appropriate	
use an in-memory dataset clientdataset as teran suggested in the question comment thread you can still present your large data to a tstringgrid if using it is compulsory but a tdbgrid is more appropriate

9697442width	height
pattern7	greater	
i have a div tag with height set to 800px i want that when the browser width is greater than 600px it shouldn t stretch the div but it should bring it to the middle of the page

9698875public	protected
pattern2		
so the most important reason to prefer private over protected over public doesn t apply

9698965for-loop	arrays
pattern0		
but the for-loop is not reading writing the last part of the parent file which is less than the arrays size

9710547addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
and has higher precedence than or so the brackets are optional - in the same way as multiplication has higher precedence than addition so

9710687int	boolean
pattern4		
however if the structure has a member such as bool or int types and i attempt something such as if i uni_memberint where i is an int counter declared in the shader or if uni_memberbool then i get errors along the lines of cannot compare int to float or if condition must be of a boolean type which suggests to me that the data is not making it to the glsl program intact

9714373playsound	mci
pattern0		
window media player uses directshow which gives you better performance and greater flexibility than playsound under mci

9714461addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
for integers multiplication is harder than addition may be slower than addition etc but may still be very fast as long as there is sufficient cpu-power dedicated to it

9714461division	multiplication
pattern0		
and division may be slower than multiplication or may still be fast

9714461subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
pattern0		
for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

9716167coalesce	nvl
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
coalesce is more efficient than nvl as it only evaluates the second argument if the first is null whereas nvl evaluates both arguments every time

9721518boost	allocator
pattern3		
if what you re really after here is just fast allocator deallocation then you should look into memory pools. i d recommend using boost s implementation rather than trying to roll your own

9722966translation	localization
pattern0		
is the best solution to add a new column called engmaterial and add the english translation there or is it possible to solve this in a better way with localization in .net

9726846pop-up	dialog

though flot may be simpler d3.js is definitely more powerful

9734251mp4	h.264	mp4	webm	h.264	webm
pattern7		
- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4

9739897children	parent
pattern4		
what would be the proper way to select children of the parent div

9740151short	base
pattern7		
in short it s worse design to move things to the base class than it is to downcast to the specific class

9740268post	get

9742864lapack	magma
pattern7		pattern0		
b magma runs always slower than lapack sequential around 10 times slower

9743807int	chars
pattern2		
therefore i m wondering if there is a hashing function that i can use to return a 32bit or 64bit number of a short string about 5 - 40 chars so that i can compare by int instead of by string

9744170innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
innodb is slower than myisam but in which cases

9745606post	get
pattern0		
post requests can be much larger than get requests as get requests are limited by the maximum length of a url

9745974apache	nginx
pattern8		
nginx or other server is not much more efficient than apache

9746809int	chars
pattern8		
string is a more complex datatype than chars or int for example

9750016width	height	portrait	landscape
pattern7		pattern0		
i would advice to check if the width is bigger than the height of the picture taken landscape picture and if that is the case show an alert to the users to explain that just portrait pictures are supported

9753028codeigniter	kohana
pattern0		
i ve came to kohana from codeigniter which was a little bit bigger documentation and easier to understood but as far as i found out many programmers say that kohana are alot better than codeigniter

9753358liferay	alfresco
pattern4		
seriously in your requirements context i would compare alfresco share with liferay

9754274bluetooth	usb
pattern10		pattern10		
on the other hand a usb connection is far more reliable better supported and of course has the inherent advantage of speed and since it is well supported does not suffer from all the pitfalls bluetooth connectivity does

9754274bluetooth	usb
pattern4		pattern2		
if you are on a budget and can do with a hardwired connection i highly recommend usb over bluetooth

9755245ember.js	backbone.js
pattern0		
ember.js would make things even simpler than backbone.js

9755397scikit-learn	libsvm
pattern4		
i recommend libsvm for this and the scikit-learn implementation is easy to use for this in python

9755761setinterval	settimeout
pattern3		
i would recommend using setinterval instead of settimeout

9755894width	text-align

the has text-align center so the will be centred if the size of the is less than the width of the

9759899postgresql	mysql
pattern7		pattern0		
postgresql is picky pickier than mysql -- all fields in the select list when using distinct must be present in the order_by and group_by clauses

9760053min	max
pattern0		
now you could iterate through the objects to find current limits 9min and max or you could even do it while you calculate the measures each time sth smaller than min happens store new min etc

9760567memcpy	strcpy
pattern7		pattern0		
but sometimes memcpy performs faster than strcpy because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here

9764675versioning	upgrade
pattern4		
i would recommend upgrade to v6 or at minimum the latest versioning of v5

9771172rvm	bundler
pattern7		pattern3		
bundler is a better way to manage application dependencies. there is a plugin rbenv-gemset for getting the same results as rvm s gemsets but sam clearly favors using bundler instead

9773250ienumerable	iqueryable
pattern10		pattern10		
entity framework s iqueryable implementation is more picky about creating new objects in objects than regular linq to objects ienumerable

9775588int	boolean

pattern7		pattern10	faster	
gson is simpler jackson is faster

9795702irc	xmpp
pattern10		pattern10		
regardless the irc protocol is more simplistic in nature can handle orders of magnitude more client connections than xmpp for the same memory utilization uses less bandwidth on the wire doesn t require authentication although you can add this feature etc

9799948gson	jackson
pattern4		pattern7	bigger	
i recommend gson as this has small memory footpring just pull parsing is about 16k jackson is way bigger

9803224ssl	spdy
pattern7		
plus once spdy becomes more common ssl slow down won t really account for anything much

9806763tiff	png

and question what i should be use server nginx or apache but i am choose nginx

9812751width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if you have a portrait device the width is smaller than the height

9814165printf	strncpy
pattern4		
i don t know why strncpy will do that but in this case i will choose printf instead of strncpy

9815550multiplying	multiplication
pattern7		
multiplication is the easier of the tasks just remember to multiplying each block of one number with the other and carry the zeros

9816661uialertview	mbprogresshud
pattern7		pattern0		
mbprogresshud has more features than uialertview so it might be better suited and more easily adapted for your purposes

9817544carrierwave	fog
pattern10		pattern10		
i ve read that carrierwave is much faster without using fog

9817765tabcontrol	tabitem
pattern7	smaller	
for example if i click the smaller tabitem the tabcontrol becomes smaller and if i select the bigger one it becomes bigger

9818513maven	m2e

among other things the apple template code will include creation of a glkbaseeffect which provides some shader functionality that seems to be required in order to be able to draw with opengl-es 2.0

9823788javassist	cglib
pattern7		
the javadoc of javassist is way better than that of cglib

9823788javassist	cglib
pattern0		
also javassist is recognized to be slower than cglib

9823788javassist	cglib
pattern0		
this makes for example javassist or proxetta significantly slower than cglib which simply reads the methods via the reflection api and overrides them

9824732crossover	mutation
pattern7		
mutation is typically easier to do this with than crossover

9827114mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern3		
while i prefer using mouseenter and mouseleave helps me understand whats going on in the code with .on it is just the same as writing the following with hover

9829723hide	show
pattern0		pattern0		
we can also do more than show hide

9833193int	chars
pattern4		pattern2		
sou you either have to change type of a to int or compare chars with chars -

9834747int	chars
pattern0		
theses two links are great specially about to know more about the main reason of this header that is portability but for me what i like most about it that i think uint8_t is cleaner than unsigned chars for storing an rbg channel value for example int32_t looks more meaningfull than simply int etc

9836001width	height
pattern0		
however when the window itself has a greater width than height i want a widget b to fill the remainder width not used by the drawing area

9837533swt	swing
pattern0		
however there is a desktop application framework called griffon that uses the same language as grails groovy which should be easier than using swing or swt

9839124lxml	elementtree
pattern4		
to build xml response i would recommend lxml with his cool elementtree modul

9841416min	max
pattern7		
in the first iteration the min heap holds the larger part and the max heap

9845010for-loop	loops
pattern7		pattern0		
if you are using any js loops then for each loops is slower than normal for-loop you might wanna take a look at this

9847509quicksort	shellsort
pattern4		
i did not implemenet and test shellsort which often beats quicksort in practice

9848654jqplot	flot
pattern0		
jqplot is free in my opinion has better chart than flot it doesnâ t have events

9850188onclick	onmouseup
pattern8		
note also that onclick would be much more appropriate than onmouseup for this

9855598button	checkbox
pattern4		
user select checkbox and when press the button sil it has to remove the artist

9866305width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
this will effectively only show scrollbar when needed if horizontal content is wider than width or vertical content is taller than height

9866616client-side	server-side
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
i am curious to know if detecting the visitor browser with client-side script is more reliable than server-side script

9870286rank	max
pattern7		
if your rank is less than 4 it takes 0 instead it s the max part

9871048webkit	gecko
pattern2		
it is to be lamented that ms instead of following the lead given by webkit and gecko engines have decided to add yet more browser extensions and hacks to muddy the waters instead of going for plain adherence to the standards

9873521bigloo	ecl
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
this one is more for bigloo - is it more functional than ecl

9874000folder	directory	children	parent
pattern4		
when i click on new content and select folder and enter a folder name checked under parent children and it said parent resources server directory so i hit save

9874090int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
int and chars are numeric types and chars is guaranteed smaller than int therefore supplying a chars where an int is expected is safe so in a nutshell yes you can do that

9874741banking	payment

2 we collect payment information at the end of a purchase collecting banking information for ach transactions or credit card via paypal express checkout

9877659translation	transliteration
pattern2		
i want the user to be able to tap a spinner and have a choice to select between transliteration and translation

9879578postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
i think one good reason to choose postgresql over mysql is that you won t find any guides on howto switch from postgresql to mysql

9879578postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
i really like postgresql s indexes which are far better than mysql s

9880786children	parent
pattern7		
the max heap is an array that could be more easily represented with a binary tree where the parent node is always greater than it s children and every time you add a child you added it towards the left so that every time the tree increases it s height it is a full tree

9881280ienumerable	iqueryable
pattern3		
i d recommend using iqueryable insteam of ienumerable in your genericrepository though

9884227mp3	ogg
pattern7		
moreover ogg vorbis is better then mp3 at all bitrates

9884780memcached	apc
pattern0		
in my case apc is 59 times faster than memcached

9884781min	max
pattern4		
i think you must make a combined key with resno and subres and select min startdate and max enddate

9887616jlist	jtable
pattern2		
you have got implements own editor never tried in jlist because there are missed importand methods in compare with jtable

9889533ssl	https
pattern4		
that wouldn t secure the user s browser but would make it difficult for an outside observer who can somehow defeat ssl -- you should be using https

9889596folder	directory	children	parent
pattern4		
i guess it was misleading because if i choose folder it also puts it under the server directory at least according to the parent label under the parent children section

9891255button	checkbox
pattern4		
it would also take further work to create the page that lists the organizations with the checkbox with a select button that updates the organizations raw id field

9893117min	max
pattern7	dates more	
iâ m looking for a solution how to select user_id where the difference between min and max dates is more than 3 yrs

9898613ceil	floor
pattern0		
rint is measurably faster than floor or ceil

9905033getter	setter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more control	
using getter and setter gives you more control over the validity of your objects giving you the option of testing values that are set to ensure that they are reasonable etc

9906488rspec	capybara
pattern7		
i use rspec and capybara together but the language syntax of capybara makes more sense is semantic as rspec when testing for request expectations

9913344innodb	myisam
pattern0		
innodb is usually much better than myisam at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because innodb uses row level locking for updates whereas myisam uses table level locking

9914876jcheckbox	jradiobutton
pattern7	better	
for jradiobutton and jcheckbox is better to use itemlistener only because fired exactlty events selected and deselected

9918368macports	homebrew
pattern4		
you can use macports or others as well i prefer homebrew

9923433post	get
pattern8		
get and head being much more frequent than post

9926106velocity	rythm
pattern0		
rythm is a high performance 2 to 3 times faster than velocity pure java template which use razor like syntax

9927610google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
in the left size you will see a list of applications choose firefox google-chrome ie or whatever you need and it will display only packets sent and received by that application

9928262wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
pattern4		
personally i favor wxpython due to its cross-platform nature but pyqt and pygtk are also equally good as far as i have heard

9928310des	aes	3des	aes
pattern0		
if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications

9930792memcached	apc
pattern0		
if you site is located on single box you will get much better results with apc which unlike memcached is not distributed by nature

9931388width	height
pattern0		
the current solution works for shapes with equal sides but my divs are not like that their width are bigger than their height

9932109sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7		pattern0		
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

9932109sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern10		pattern10		
sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

9932109sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7		pattern0		
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

9932109sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern10		pattern10		
sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

9934528cpython	pypy
pattern7		
pypy is currently more than 5x faster than cpython on average

9935433octal	decimal
pattern4		
or it can choose a base automatically if base is specified as zero same as the c compiler does depending on how the number is written a leading 0 chooses octal a leading 0x or 0x chooses hexadecimal else decimal

9935465hash	md5
pattern0		
finally sha1 hash are safer than md5 i tell you that because you used the md5 tag in your post

9938224fpdf	fpdi
pattern3		
doing this with pure php on your own will get very messy so i recommend using fpdf in combination with fpdi to open your templates

9939568division	multiplication
pattern0		
division may be heavier than multiplication but a commenter pointed out that reciprocals are just as fast as multiplication on modern cpus in which case this isn t correct for your case so if you do have 1 x appearing somewhere inside a loop and more than once you can assist by caching the result inside the loop and then using y

9941886cout	cin
pattern7	better	
for input and output to complete gandalf the grey s answer if you like to use cin and cout it s better to use std ios sync_with_stdio false

9943106jboss	glassfish
pattern10		pattern10		
in my opinion glassfish is more user friendly than jboss so i decided use glassfish for my project

9943106jboss	glassfish
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
but in my location jboss is more popular than glassfish so i have a idea

9943115carrierwave	paperclip
pattern2		
just take a look on the links to choose between paperclip carrierwave

9945359children	parent
pattern7		
how can i achieve that my container will adjust the height accordingly of the children items when the height of the children elements is larger then configured minheight of their parent element

9947851innodb	myisam
pattern0		
if your database has a large innodb buffer pool and a small key buffer then innodb performance is going to be better than myisam performance especially for large tables

9948201innodb	myisam
pattern0		
myisam has historically been viewed as faster than innodb but for recent versions of innodb that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases

9949448min	max
pattern3		
i recommend calling min and max something else so that they don t shadow the builtins

9951705apache	nginx
pattern0		
any one of the reverse proxy systems can likely do this nginx is popular too and generally has easier configuration than apache but i ve never used it with https

9952101udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp

9952736min	max	minimum	max
pattern0		
first i run a query to find the min and max for each security id then find the difference between the min and max and finally find a value that is 10 more than the minimum like this

9952919opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	much quicker	
using any other browser google-chrome firefox and opera it s much quicker

9966327carrierwave	paperclip
pattern0		
new to carrierwave already loving it so much better than paperclip

9968282jline	readline
pattern3		
lein is using either readline if you have it installed or jline if you are so unfortunate i recommend installing readline

9974036uibezierpath	uiimage
pattern7		
the uibezierpath class seems easier to use so how could i get that drawing in a uiimage

9978052opera	firefox
pattern0		
only firefox and opera seem to have this issue opera even worse than firefox but i don t care that much about opera

9981229postgresql	mysql
pattern8		
if you are more comfortable with mysql because you should install postgresql locally if you are going to use postgresql for production then you should consider using one of the mysql add-ons heroku offers

9984397floating-point	fixed-point	floating-point	integer
pattern0		
if you need more than integer accuracy but want to avoid floating-point consider using fixed-point arithmetic instead

9984489post	put
pattern10	less	pattern10	less	
i think to safely use put on a public website requires even more effort than using post and is less commonly done due to potential security issues

9984591move	drag
pattern8		
this is easy to implement with buttons select items click up or down buttons to move - just loop through and apply the move to each selected item but much more difficult with drag reordering

9987808rss	feed
pattern4		
i just found out apple only offers select rss feed

9990594decoder	encoder
pattern0		
what about using more than one encoder to encode my code because if we take a look at ioncube you will see some people can decoder it

9991138getter	setter
pattern10		pattern10		
the code in the setter is far more interesting than the getter should it not take precedence and be defined first

9991303range	max
pattern7	value greater	
retrieve the unique range whose max value is greater than an ip

9991303range	min
pattern7	lower	
check the the min value of this range is lower than the ip

9993723maven	m2e
pattern4		
once eclipse has downloaded the software choices select m2e - maven integration for eclipse under general purpose tools

9995286filtering	grouping
pattern4		
if i do regular filtering see below and the user selects grouping 1 from the dropdown it will still show customers who are members of grouping 10

9996090awt	swing
pattern7		
swing is far better than the obsolete awt library

99983853des	aes
pattern4		
none of the three reasons above is generally enough to choose 3des or blowfish over aes of course

9999184pull	push
pattern7		pattern10	model more	pattern10	model more efficient	
a heartbeat mechanism pull model is definitely easier to implement but a push model is far more efficient

10000974min	max
pattern2		
i wish to select row with max or min time for every user

10005421maven	m2e
pattern0		
m2e is also a platform that let others provide better integration with additional maven plugins android web development etc.

10006960children	parent
pattern0		
i believe that some parent will have more than 2 children

10007514ethernet	wireless
pattern0		
if you are working on physical machine that has cable and wireless connectivity then you will have more than one ethernet adaptor choise

10007704firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903

10010461google-chrome	safari
pattern4		
it does not work in google-chrome osx win safari osx ie

10011149width	height
pattern7	greater	pattern7	greater	
choose whether to divide it horizontally or vertically if its aspect ratio width height is greater than a divide it vertically

10012070macports	homebrew
pattern3		
i would recommend using macports or homebrew to get the native libraries

10013645width	height
pattern0		
but if we need a mechanism to animate even if the change is greater than the width height of the map how can we do that

10015537int	chars
pattern0		
once that is done you can go in and tweak the data types to better fit your needs if desired and you can add your own restrictions to the data such as requiring that an xs int value be in a range of 0 and 50 or an xs string value be less than 10 chars long - there are dozens of other possibilities but that should give you the idea

10015715int	chars
pattern0		
however int and long were 1.21x faster than chars and short

10016979client-side	server-side
pattern4		
the easiest solution is to upload it by parts you can do it using flash silverlight js html5 or whatever way you prefer client-side and then joining them server-side

10017995getter	setter
pattern7	better	pattern7	better	
since i agree using getter setter is better way

10019000casting	autoboxing
pattern0		
is that casting from long to int plus sparsearray optimizations are going to be cheaper than autoboxing long to long for my hashmap operations

10019281alloca	malloc
pattern4		pattern2		
i would recommend alloca over malloc if you would like the data allocated on the stack and if it s available but malloc will work in most situations

10024964sugar.js	underscore.js
pattern3		
i recommend using underscore.js or sugar.js for common tasks like this

10029574ssl	https
pattern7	certificate more	
i m assuming using https without a ssl certificate is atleast more secure than doing the exact same connection over plain http since atleast it s encrypted and an evildoer would have to make a much larger effort to intercept en decrypt the information

10031349profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
pattern7		
which java profiler is better jprofiler or yourkit

10036091awt	swing
pattern7	more	
the keylistener is an older interface from the awt days its still ok to use it with swing but is more of a general listener

10038593profiling	instrumentation
pattern4		
just select profiling from the product menu instrumentation will start select the zombie instrumentation then run the test scenario which causes this problem and you should see a zombie pop up that shows how an object is still being used even though it s no longer valid

10045121hide	show
pattern4		
if so then open group properties for last14days_ct go to visibility and for when the report is initially run select show or hide based on an expression. use the expression

10046175orika	dozer
pattern0		
performance will depends on your application use cases basically orika perform better than dozer or other mapping reflection based frameworks because it use bytecode generation behind the scenes

10049694interpreted-language	compiled-language
pattern0		
especially in an interpreted-language like php where classes add more overhead than a compiled-language

10054366google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
you could apply this error narrowing down technique to different part of your script by hardcoding some values which eliminates the possibilities of error until you find the smoking gun which doesn t kill ie and google-chrome but kills firefox

10056318int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
the chars type is smaller than int and hence can represent less values than int can

10063634division	modulo
pattern10		pattern10		
python respects this definition whereas in most other programming language the modulo is really more like a reaminder after division operator

10065565union	distinct
pattern4		
for update from a view whose defining select statement uses at least one of the following constructs in its outer block outer join group by clause aggregate functions select distinct connect by clause or set operation union intersect or minus

10067363metaclass	subclassing
pattern0		
i think this is better done with a metaclass in order to handle both runtime and subclassing method decoration

10075093range	infinity
pattern4		
this conversion can lose precision but also lose range resulting in a float zero from a nonzero double and a float infinity from a finite double

10079942postgresql	mysql
pattern0		
postgresql with the optional hstore module might be better than mysql at this.

10080241min	max
pattern4		
ps for select min max on all rows on a table indexes help cause you don t have to scan the table but find it directly

10080420filesystems	fat	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs	xfs	ntfs	fat	xfs
pattern7		
actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc

10080654udp	tcp
pattern2		
you have to choose between udp or tcp

10086462mouseleave	mouseenter
pattern7	lower	
i thought about aborting the request if the interval between mouseenter and mouseleave is lower than a threshold but it does not help

10093960qfile	qdatastream	qfile	qtextstream	qtextstream	qdatastream
pattern0		
a qfile may be used by itself or more conveniently with a qtextstream or qdatastream

10094969des	rsa
pattern0		
by comparison des see section 3.2 and other block ciphers are much faster than the rsa algorithm

10095069accurev	svn
pattern4		
it s the same if every team will do their development in the separate branch using svn and trying to merge everything after 1 month of development....basically accurev creates late merge price and you are going to pay this price for ever if you will choose accurev for more than 1 team

10095433haskell	ocaml
pattern7		
note that it currently does not support true parallelism you won t have two threads running ocaml code in parallel but it doesn t matter as ocaml is much faster than many other languages for example on a quadcore the language shootout shows that ocaml outperforms even haskell with multicore capabilities

10095995pull	push
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
as stated by other answers neither push nor pull is better but rather you should pick the one that best fits your design needs

10098195min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
a pointer lower than min or greater than max is probably not in the heap and this min and max delimited region is unlikely to intersect with any static area ever

10100458mouse	trackpad
pattern4		
if you ignore timing the os may decimate mouse motion debounce buttons rearrange the order of motion and clicks ignore keypresses while the trackpad is in use etc

10101698bluestacks	android-emulator
pattern0		
in xda-forums i read about memu - most powerful android-emulator for pc better than bluestacks

10102303rtp	rtcp
pattern4		
then select rtp from the protocol list for the appropriate stream and rtcp for the other one if applicable and then wireshark will show the packets as being rtp and you ll be able to see the packet info

10103310dbcontext	objectcontext
pattern0		
if adding 2000 entities and saving the changes at the end dbcontext is 3 to 5 times slower than objectcontext btw. i know that adding a large amount of entities would be better using sqlbulkcopy but that s not the point

10103310dbcontext	objectcontext
pattern0		
when it comes to deletion it even gets worse when saving at the end of all entity removals dbcontext is around 18 times slower than objectcontext

10103979filtering	grouping
pattern4		
i understood that the match filtering on my second template would only take in grouping s that have an attribute of level 1 and write them out

10105437ember.js	backbone.js
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
but on the other hand although new the ember.js package is actually more complete imo than backbone.js

10105437ember.js	backbone.js
pattern7		
both give you the ability to implement things in a variety of ways which can be confusing but ember.js provides more of the code that you would have to write yourself in backbone.js as standard which for me personally is more important for rapid prototyping than the wealth of backbone.js examples available

10106836mouse	keyboard
pattern2		
problem is that it doesn t take keyboard input it is only posible to choose file with mouse

10107000int	double
pattern7		
even dividing int is slower than multiplying floats or double in some cases

10110317ejml	jama
pattern0		
ejml looks really good it works almost 2x faster than jama on my data.

10113369wordpress	expressionengine
pattern7		pattern0		
but in my opinion for most sites expressionengine is a better choice than wordpress

10115891rsa	dsa
pattern7		pattern7	newer	
i guess rsa is older and dsa is newer

10116389retaincount	dealloc
pattern7		
if your array s retaincount is greater than 1 at the start of dealloc some other object is retaining it at least temporarily

10116827glut	sdl
pattern7	much easier	
if you use another library like glut or sdl it becomes much easier let the library worry about setting up a window and then you can focus on learning opengl

10118483fseek	fread
pattern0		
so i guess fseek should be much faster than fread

10118975fseek	fread
pattern0		
i probably feel fseek might be bit faster than fread as fseek changes the pointer position to the new address space that you have mentioned and there is no date read is happening

10119910ocaml	sml
pattern4		
depending on what you mean with suitable for concurrent programming i would recommend ocaml or sml standard ml

10125644min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
can achieve somehwat similar results typing values smaller than min will be corrected to min although you are still prevented from typing values greater than max due to the validator

10127472post	get
pattern0		
for example i d like to serve an http error code if the user tries to do more than x get post per minute but i d still like to enable that same user to burst up to y where y x until he hits the burst cap

10129299jquery	anythingslider
pattern2		
this way you can select with jquery the anythingslider element you want to change and do something like

10129975int	chars
pattern0		
this means that as long as you verify that every java chars in your string is less than 128 int value you are going to get one byte per chars with utf-8

10131720kde	gnome
pattern4		
inside aptitude you can select gnome or kde files audio video etc - use the _ character to mark them to be purged then hit g to update the packages

10135428memcached	apc
pattern0		
apc gives you some more functionality than memcached

10137483superclass	subclassing
pattern10		pattern10		
hence your subclassing is accepting less classes than the superclass contract promises

10137872udp	tcp
pattern7	uploading slower	
socket tcp udp uploading is slower than native windows copy when there are more than 1 clients

10139363for-loop	arrays
pattern0		
it s slower than simple for-loop from 1 to arrays length and ipairs is deprecated in lua 5.2 anyway

10143559cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	processors	hyperthreading
pattern7		
the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

10143618put	get
pattern4		
when i submit the form i get this routing error no route matches put update_profile 1

10143880entities	entitymanager
pattern7	slower	
when hibernate s entitymanager is tracking 100 000 entities it is 100x slower than when it is tracking only a few see results below

10146882pascal	delphi
pattern10		pattern10		
from my pov the object pascal paradigm used with fpc object pascal dialect which can coexist with the default object pascal code is more advanced lightweight and integrated than the interface-based plumbing of delphi xe2 compiler with on-the-fly marshalling using rtti

10149986int	chars
pattern7		
the type int is an int which is usually wider and so can keep all the possible values a chars can keep

10163422children	parent
pattern7		
new h i is guaranteed to be the smallest of the old h i s children which is still larger than old h i s parent

10164864width	height
pattern7	bigger	
if jqgrid width or height is bigger than viewport jqgrid rows and columns outside it are not accessible in android

10166944sorting	grouping
pattern10	more	pattern10	more expensive	
while those queries look very similar i suspect orderdate includes time information so the sorting and grouping is much more expensive and lead to many more rows in the subquery for the second query

10167087min	max
pattern2		
the class should be able to choose between min or max of two numbers

10172702bash	zsh
pattern10		pattern10		
zsh is more extensible and has a much greater focus on searching and completion than bash

10179057mergesort	timsort
pattern8		
timsort is used by python and java for their sort methods and is rather supernaturally fast but it s a more complex algorithm than mergesort which matters if you re working in something like c - so if you just need something that works pretty well and is simple go with mergesort

10185108cocos2d-x	corona
pattern4		pattern0		
i would recommend cocos2d-x as it is in my opinion equally or even better than corona and it is free

10190181for-loop	loops
pattern7		
the range-based for-loop syntax is cleaner and more universal but you can t execute the code in loops for a specified range different than from begin to end

10197144factors	mean
pattern7		
if your growth factors is larger than the golden mean that can t happen

10202118jar	war
pattern4		
last but not least the packaging you select jar war ear pom etc. binds goals to the lifecycle phases by default

10202365decoder	encoder
pattern4		
make methods that use generics such as and then implement encoder decoder for each type of message and have that would pick encoder for wanted message

10204877apache	nginx
pattern0		
uwsgi is better if you are using nginx i find nginx far better than apache personally

10208968margin	height
pattern7		
if the height is greater than 66px i want to apply a negative top margin equal to half of its height

10211855sorting	grouping
pattern0		
instead knowing that we want to grouping by these columns we can make the application code to do so simpler by sorting by these fields

10214527calloc	malloc
pattern10	longer	pattern10	longer execution	
the first calloc subsequently malloc has a longer execution time then

10215271folder	directory
pattern7	easier	
since a war folder necessarily precedes the creation of a .war archive since a .war archive is simply a zipped up war directory obtaining the war directory is provably easier than obtaining a .war file

10221622floating-point	integer
pattern0		
because the floating-point value is of a higher rank than an integer it will promote the integer to a float

10225115rank	max
pattern4		
i use select max rank from test

10229047addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
that s akin to multiplication has higher precedence than addition so 3 sticks to 4 instead of 5 so the output is 17

10229975nextuntil	each
pattern4		
there we grab each of the .region elements get their siblings up to the first one that isn t an .award nextuntil and filter out ones that aren t every third one

10231447tortoisegit	svn
pattern3		pattern3		
never been a fan of git i prefer using svn and hg but considering both tortoisesvn and tortoisehg are quite good i d recommend trying tortoisegit which is a port of tortoisesvn to work with git instead of svn

10231859profiling	instrumentation
pattern0		
in my experience normal execution on iphone is much faster than profiling with instrumentation

10233354google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
i personally would recommend google-chrome dev tools builtin f12 or firebug in firefox

10234519ant	maven
pattern10	more	pattern10	more flexibility	
in maven you can define a.k.a testing.staging live etc which allow you to configure settings for different environments.all you need to specify maven about the environment for which you want the things to move and maven is capable enough to take care of this.though this can be done with ant also but i believe that maven provides more flexibility

10240005width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if width is less than height just discarding it and if above allowing it

10240638integer	unsigned
pattern7	type rank greater	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

10243816disk	ram
pattern7		
when the data is in memory - you can do anything much faster on it since disk io is extremely slower then ram so sorting it and reading it multiple times is expected to be much slower then manipulating the data on memory

10243816disk	ram
pattern7		
only one disk read - since the disk is much slower then ram -

10249024lcds	graniteds
pattern2		
as an alternative you could consider using graniteds instead of blazeds graniteds has a much more powerful data management stack than blazeds it competes more with lcds and fully support lazy-loading for all major jpa engines hibernate eclipselink openjpa etc

10250826width	height
pattern0		
when x is equal to width and y is less than height you will be writing to the array 0 y+1 cell

10254781cassini	iis
pattern7		
what i would suggest is to make sure you are using visual studio 2010 sp1 then install iis express which is an upgrade to cassini and is much more like real iis and then switch your project to use iis express and see if you get the same exception

10256374aggregate-functions	sum
pattern10		pattern10		
aggregate-functions is more general version of sum

10256510profiler	yourkit
pattern4		
you need to use a java profiler i generally prefer yourkit

10259205recv	epoll
pattern4		
the usual way is to enable a timeout on the recv call either by setting a timeout on the socket or using a select epoll call and using it to both issue a poll and time it out

10259488post	get
pattern0		
i get somehow category repeated if it has more than 1 post eg

10261092xslt	xquery
pattern0		
if your output is going to be similar to your input with small changes then the xslt solution is often a lot simpler than the xquery solution

10261421width	height
pattern10	less	
to scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is less

10266904getter	setter
pattern7	clearer	
edit added some getter and setter that makes it clearer how you access object info

10268320union	distinct
pattern4		
i need to select distinct value from a multiple union

10271789google-chrome	safari
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
safari is more funny than google-chrome i can easily make google-chrome cache my page but safari does not

10277598post	get
pattern7		
this means the amount of data you could pass by using post verb is much more than by using a query string and a get method

10278307maven	pom.xml
pattern4		
in intellij idea in the right navigation bar i click add maven projects choose pom.xml then intellij always shows resolving maven dependencies in background tasks

10278925width	height
pattern7		
in other words to check if the height is bigger then the width

10279626width	height	portrait	landscape
pattern7		pattern0		
take screenshot of rotated screen and while uploading turn the dimension to portrait if their dimension is landscape i.e width is greater than height

10280674post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
make the form get not post because the request is not changing anything on the server so get verb is more appropriate and also the get verb will pass all the form values as a query string parameters so you ll get the desired effect

10281373crypt	hash
pattern7		
hash is newer and seems to support more hashing alogrithms than crypt

10282287awt	swing	swt	swing
pattern4		
i believe it will eventually surpass awt swing and swt

10282566des	aes
pattern0		pattern7	smaller	
using des assuming it s a little faster than aes and requires a smaller key and

10282617restkit	asihttprequest
pattern7	newer	
i have been using asihttprequest but it seems to be deprecated and i read that restkit is the newer library

10282754des	aes
pattern7		pattern0		
though it s unrelated to your actual question des is generally slower than aes at least in software so unless you really need to keep the key small aes is almost certainly a better choice

10283734firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
i see this problem across the board on safari ie firefox and google-chrome -- so any of these would be fine to use though i prefer firefox because the problem seems to be most defined there

10284169jruby	mri
pattern8		
once the jvm has warmed up rails requests under jruby are usually significantly more performant than under mri both in terms of raw execution speed and garbage collection

10289947google-chrome	safari
pattern4		
if you choose safari or google-chrome you donâ t need to install gears.

10292008post	get
pattern7		
also you can determine if someone is submitting a form or getting the form by checking if _server request_method post which is cleaner than using a get url parameter though i guess there s nothing wrong with the other approach...

10303954gif	png
pattern0		
sometimes you ll find that jpeg at 100 quality ends up smaller than the gif or png version but most of the time line art is best stored in png form

10307662portrait	landscape
pattern2		
phone choose between portrait and landscape layouts automatically

10307766short	base
pattern0		
as the condition reads a loop can not be zipped tighter if it s either too short less than five base or its ends do not match

10308655innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern7	older	
innodb is newer while myisam is older

10308655innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		pattern7	simpler	
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

10308655innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as

10308655innodb	myisam
pattern7		
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

10315535udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp

10318491apache	nginx
pattern8		
the syntax for nginx configuration is different but more clean than apache

10320676postgresql	mysql
pattern7		
poor performance from mysql has more to do with it not being smart and automatically creating an optimized plan like sql server postgresql or oracle would

10322607int	double
pattern0		
simpler with no double and no division but be careful of int overflow

10323521hash	md5
pattern4		
i am attempting to compute a md5 hash within an ios app in an effort to compare hash between the file saved within the app and the same file stored on a web server using php

10331965post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
as powelljf3 said post is more secure then get though it can still be gotten to

10332345innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
2 - i have read about myisam vs innodb the conclusion for me was that myisam is faster when it comes to read-only whereas innodb is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently

10332831vectorwise	infobright
pattern7	quicker	
but as well as infobright if you re going commercial then checkout vectorwise it s quicker and similar priced

10332847cpu	processors
pattern10		pattern10		
having data structures that start on 4 byte word alignment on cpus with 4 byte buses and processors is far more efficient when moving data around memory and between ram and the cpu

10334970int	chars
pattern4		
so choose int or chars based on what suits you more and not based on which will be faster as you wont notice a difference for data set of this size

10336543int	chars
pattern7		pattern7		pattern7		pattern7		
the rank of long long int is greater than the rank of long int which is greater than the rank of int which is greater than the rank of short int which is greater than the rank of signed chars

10337101opengl-es	glreadpixels
pattern4		
however there is an even faster route on ios 5.0 to grab opengl-es content than glreadpixels which i describe in this answer

10337106postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
if you want open source postgresql is much smarter than mysql as well

10340830children	parent
pattern8		
this really helps keeps parent branch more stable than children

10342766children	parent
pattern7		pattern0		
also it seems this is only the problem when there are a lot of duplicates the heap doesn t seem completely capable of staying in order the parent is smaller than the children

10346398mechanize	anemone
pattern4		
if you re attempting trying to crawl the site may i recommend mechanize or anemone instead

10347250public	protected
pattern3		
as alexandrescu and sutter recommend in their 39 th rule you should prefer using public non-virtual functions and private protected virtual

10348554httphandler	httpmodule
pattern7		
i m not sure httpmodule is still better then httphandler

10350034disk	ram
pattern0		
there exist battery-backed packages of ram modules which can act as an ultra-fast hdd substitute but if they attach via sata scsi or other typical disk interface the still are slower than system ram

10352432int	double
pattern4		
public int compare double c1 double c2

10353470cos	sin
pattern4		
i have the below code to choose sin or cos to be integrated

10356170udp	mtu
pattern0		
udp packets greater than the mtu size of the network that carries them will be automatically split up into multiple packets and then reassembled by the recipient

10356170udp	mtu
pattern7	packet smaller	
so for example if you send a 63k udp packet and it goes over ethernet it will get broken up into 47+ smaller fragment packets because ethernet s mtu is 1500 bytes but some of those are used for udp headers etc so the amount of user-data-space available in a udp packet is smaller than that

10357386int	chars
pattern0		
an int can be more than one chars

10359874sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
note if you are constantly adding removing items from existingholdings then you could use sorteddictionary which should be faster sortedlist is faster for accessing elements but takes longer adding removing

10363584onchange	onblur
pattern8		
edit you probably only want to validate when the value changes and field loses focus that s why imo the onchange event would be more appropriate than onblur not onblure

10365235vim	emacs
pattern4		
i ve tried vim but it s modal so i prefer emacs

10367306hash	md5
pattern4		
for example if i choose md5 and addition then i could md5 each digit and add the resulting hash

10369513glut	glfw
pattern4		
i really prefer glfw to glut and want to get its golang binding working under windows 64-bit with go 1.0.1 64-bit

10370386int	double
pattern0		
an int can be widened to a float and a double but a float 4 bytes is smaller than a double 8 bytes so java will choose to call m float

10371167gtk	clutter
pattern10		pattern10		
use clutter which is much more suited to animation and integrates with gtk

10373580jar	war
pattern0		
i set up a maven multi module project one with packaging war two more with packaging jar

10375250addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
in arithmetic books and computer software and more-expensive calculators this means 12+ 34 56 not 12+34 56 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

10380364strtol	atoi
pattern7		
use strtol it does better error reporting than atoi

10382376width	height
pattern7	greater	
visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero

10386319qkeysequence	qkeyevent
pattern4		
in general you cannot compare qkeyevent and qkeysequence objects

10388582strlen	strncpy
pattern7		
this is the case here because strlen hello is greater than 3 your last strncpy argument

10389173mouse	keyboard
pattern10		pattern10		
this approach using purely images screenshots and generating mouse and keyboard events is more similar to manual testing activities performed by real people which have just monitor mouse and keyboard

10389629hash	md5
pattern4		
there you can select md5 and any value stored in that field will become hash

10399300google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	more	pattern10	more verbose	
i use google-chrome as my main browser but sometimes firefox has much more verbose errors warnings that can make debugging a complex issue easier

10400859google-chrome	safari
pattern0		
my ipad 1 safari js benchmarked 38 times slower than google-chrome on my pc

10401607mapply	do.call
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
i don t quite understand why you don t want to use mapply but do.call is probably better anyway

10403526processors	hyperthreading
pattern0		
more modern processors handle hyperthreading better than older processors

10407713catransition	uiswipegesturerecognizer	uipangesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer	uipangesturerecognizer	catransition
pattern0		
if you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that case

10408966junit	testng
pattern7	many more	
my suggestion would be to try to use a testing framework testng or junit which gives many more features than just parametrization

10415156min	max
pattern4		
and ord are compare max and min

10415807stdout	stderr
pattern4		
also why is so hard to grab stdout stderr from wpf

10416747coalesce	nvl
pattern0		
2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion

10418688melt	reshape
pattern7	likely easier	
here it is with reshape in base though joran is right melt is likely easier

10418916int	chars
pattern7	greater	
i assume intconvert ... converts an int to a string and thus you get lexical comparisons which meahs 25 is greater than 100 because the first chars is greater 2 1

10419288setinterval	settimeout
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more sophisticated	pattern10	more sophisticated	
if you d like to see stack trace that spans over settimeout setinterval calls then more sophisticated would be the way to go

10419407int	chars
pattern0		
i would either cast the chars to an unsigned int if the unsigned int s value is greater than sizeof chars

10420542int	double
pattern4		
you can use this to compare double with float and or int

10420573multiplying	division
pattern0		
but in normal case it takes n 2 comparison so you half the height of tree but you multiplying each merge with two so total running time is not better than division to 2 part

10422952versioning	upgrade
pattern7		
when attempting to access the admin side of wordpress if the db versioning is lower than your wordpress versioning expects it will redirect you to a database upgrade page

10424357fgets	getline
pattern4		
frankly i would prefer fgets instead of getline

10425399range	min
pattern0		
but if i take it out of range for more than 1 min it gives an exception

10425902ant	maven	nexus	artifactory
pattern10		pattern10		
if they are going to use any non-maven way to retrieve them ui rest scripts ant gradle then you can go with any path and name you like and you ll get full support from artifactory uploading searching etc. with nexus which is much more maven-centric you ll better stick to maven notation

10429777disk	ram
pattern0		
ram is 100 thousand times faster than disk for database access from

10431434try-catch	exception-handling
pattern0		
or depending on the use case and generally less clear especially if you have more than one exception-handling expected - you don t want to have try-catch imbrications...

10437690width	height
pattern0		
if your text won t be larger than the width of the box you could set the line-height equal to the height of the box

10445564google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	bigger	
in my task manager i see how the memory of google-chrome or firefox is getting bigger and bigger up to 512 mb

10452219min	max
pattern7		pattern0		
do note that sliders won t render if max is not greater than min

10456124width	height
pattern7		pattern0		pattern7	larger	
for example with scrollview.bounces no a horizontal image whose height is smaller than the height of the scrollview but whose width is larger so it can be scrolled from left to right will scroll further to the left than it should when scrolling to the right it stops correctly at the edge of the image although if scrollview.bounces yes it then bounces in from the edge so the image is always cropped on the left when the image is larger in both dimensions than its containing scrollview this issue accentuates and the whole result feels broken which is unsurprising given apple s documented advice

10459789integer	fractions
pattern10		pattern10		pattern0		
as python integer is less limited than the float you may get bigger results with the fractions if it makes sense at all

10463526children	parent
pattern7		
since the parent #wr has more children #con_bottom does not fit

10464883piston	tastypie
pattern10		pattern10		
tastypie is more tightly coupled to the orm than piston but there are methods that you can define in a tastypie resource to specify how to handle create read update delete

10465052avro	thrift
pattern7		
but avro offers far more than just doing away with the need for your own writables although that is in my view a considerable plus it offers fairly efficient serialization the choice between serializing against generated entity classes like thrift requires or using a so-called genericrecord structure instead and not having to have tagged data

10467472notepad++	sublimetext
pattern8		
notepad++ which is often recommended are even more broken than sublimetext 2 which i find to be pretty good actually

10471254post	get
pattern10	more	pattern10	more likely	
also try post ing using ajax as get is much more likely being cached

10474759innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
myisam is much faster for reads but since it locks the whole table for writes this is where overall throughput drops compared with innodb

10475338versioning	upgrade
pattern7		
step #3 if you see that the last versioning is older than your current versioning do whatever upgrade logic you want

10475809google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		pattern2		
compare firefox with google-chrome for this fiddle which used this code

10478470range	infinity
pattern4		
this conversion can lose precision but also lose range resulting in a float zero from a nonzero double and a float infinity from a finite double

10485256selenium	sahi
pattern7	better	
there are certain types of browser event that selenium struggles with that sahi handles much better

10486251width	margin
pattern0		
by giving the middle indicators div a left and right margin slightly larger than the width of the left and right button divs you allow it to float up between the two and take up as much space as possible

10489012matplotlib	chaco
pattern2		
one aspect where chaco wins out over matplotlib is in speed so i m exploring ways to get acceptable performance from matplotlib

10490122implements	extends
pattern7	actionlistener better	
however rather than extends actionlistener as in your second example you ll probably find that putting the listener implementation into a different class even an inner class which implements actionlistener provides better logical logical separation of your code

10490295client-side	server-side
pattern0		
if getting these in sync is an issue make the client-side timer shorter than the server-side one

10490791int	chars
pattern0		
the stack array must be an int as the pid can be larger than a chars variable can fit my pid was 25689

10491017google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
interestingly google-chrome matches firefox when you use the white-space pre-wrap style.

10491782udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		
but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp

10496107pdfbox	itext
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
on the downside pdfbox is less mature than itext so it has less features and documentation available

10497550maven	pom.xml
pattern3		
i would personally recommend using maven and a basic pom.xml would then look like this

10500501weka	libsvm
pattern2		
from libsvm faq s i discovered that cv is made only to discover best parameters for kernels not during train predict so what is the exact sequence of action that i should do in matlab to obtain similar results in order to compare them with weka

10501705imperative	declarative
pattern4		
or if you are like me and prefer imperative validation logic rather than declarative simply use fluentvalidation.net which makes this validation scenario pretty trivial

10502864post	get
pattern4		
i m following the tutorial for upload files in rails 3 because i need that my app s user could upload csv files but when i tried to save the file i get uninitialized constant customerscontroller csv message before change my routes to get customers import to post customers import i had other error no route matches post customers import what im doing wrong

10504050button	checkbox

in this project how can i add mark all checkbox besides select button

10507735ant	maven
pattern2		pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more efficient	pattern10	more efficient	
the scenario you described is perfectly fit into an aggregation or multi-module project from my own experience compare with ant maven provides a more efficient reasonable and native way for managing multi-module project with inter-module dependencies

10508411getter	setter
pattern4		
it s really easy with flash builder 4.5 to do this just select your variable name and press ctrl-1 select create getter and setter select getter and setter and check bindable and create custom event.

10510474folder	directory

support exists in firefox and my test just confirmed thisâ but the handle is a little less noticeable than in google-chrome

10511218for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
pattern0		
use a for-each loops to go through a range it s not as fast as using a variant arrays but keeps things simple and offers better speed than a for-loop

10513169memcpy	strncpy
pattern10		pattern10		
even if underlying implementation is not so different memcpy is much faster because it does not have to check what it s copying strncpy will stop when it ll copy the end of string character null

10513169memcpy	strncpy
pattern0		
memcpy will always be faster than strncpy for any real world situation even in the corner case i spoke before look page_copy_fwd_maybe

10513207memcpy	strncpy
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
strncpy - memcpy is faster but you need to know the size of the input string

10514105button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
pattern0		
so the values can be mapped with each list now by the property of checkbox you can select more than one checkbox unlike radio button so when such case comes the dropdownlistfor that is being populated on the basis of each checkbox selection now comes in a merged format like on selecting option 1 and option 2 both the list contains all the elements mapped to both further on de-selecting it comes back to unmerged state

10517245reportlab	xhtml2pdf
pattern7	better	
this isn t to say that xhtml2pdf is bad just that it s going to take time for it to be as good as rendering in a browser and if pdf output for its own sake is what you really are interested in i think using reportlab directly is a better choice

10518089maven	pom.xml
pattern2		
right-click the file then select open with maven pom.xml editor

velocity is worse than freemarker and stringtemplate has got its own issues

10527980google-chrome	firefox
pattern10		pattern10		
obviously google-chrome is more persnickety whereas firefox defaults to moving and sizing the printout as necessary

10531075int	double
pattern0		
a normal 3 will be treated as int but in the test function you are retrieving double which are bigger than an int on most platforms and you might end up reading wrong locations which inturn leads to exc_bad_access run time signal being generated

10535356width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
i just want to set the custom page width and height page width is higher than page height

10535605division	multiplication

quick question here i ve got a process running that grabs rss feed and adds them to a mysql database

10540768width	height	draggable	droppable
pattern7		
the draggable div is greater in height and width than droppable div

10540768draggable	droppable
pattern0		
when i made dimension of draggable div smaller than droppable div then drop event triggered successfully

10544319width	height
pattern7		
therefore when i get my browser bigger width gets bigger as well as height

10545022ati	nvidia
pattern0		
i m having an issue where my glsl 130 code wont run properly on my somewhat modern ati 5850 hardware while the identical code runs perfectly fine on an older laptop with a nvidia card i have

pattern0		
a double is also probably bigger than an int

10558700innodb	myisam
pattern0		
beststat is innodb so i have row-level locking and consindering i do a lot of inserts-updates it should be faster than myisam

10560219width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
i have the size to 10 less than the width and 10 less than the height

10562448decimal	ieee
pattern0		
decimal types libraries are fantastic for financial applications because we re used to dealing with the style of rounding required in financial stuff but there is the cost that they tend to be slower than ieee floating point

10563737git-svn	svn2git
pattern10	more	pattern10	more svn	
it has better translation engine than git-svn svn2git that preserves more svn concepts like ignores eols etc

10569872webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern7		pattern10	more	pattern10	more powerful	
webclient is easier but httpwebrequest is more powerful and allows for more control

10572175wordpress	joomla
pattern0		
you have to realize that this is a common probelm with joomla and wordpress as i explained to you in my other answer to your another question here is joomla 2.5 much faster than joomla 1.5 querywise

10572775junit	jmock
pattern3		
i recommend using junit 4 and the latest jmock when writing new tests rather than investing time learning something that doesn t have a future path

10572775junit	jmock
pattern7		
the later version of jmock makes things easier by integrating with the junit lifecycle as a runner

10574176ubuntu	centos
pattern0		
is there anything obvious in ubuntu that would otherwise be making sfphpview- render run slower than centos

10574857udp	tcp

i was going to use reliable udp but tcp seems more appropriate

10576127apache	nginx
pattern0		
nginx is very fast much lighter than apache

10578443gridview	repeater
pattern7		pattern0		
in simple words we can say performance of repeater is far better than gridview

10578538addition	multiplication
pattern0		
as multiplication of ints has more overhead than simple addition

10580948ant	maven
pattern10	more	pattern10	more obvious	
i find the simple solution ant calls maven more obvious

10585273button	checkbox
pattern4		
if you need to achieve that rename this button to delete all items that will simply call a java method a classic or without having to select checkbox

10585754spaces	delimiter
pattern4		pattern2		
in the following dialogue select spaces as delimiter then hit ok

10586320inherited	properties
pattern2		
rather see if you can t favor composition over inherited create a kind of proxy class for the sprite let s call it managedspriteproxy which implements all the methods you would call on managedsprite but forwards all the actual manipulations to its managedsprite properties

10588174cpython	pypy
pattern8		
edit again one completely different approach would be to use pypy s sandboxing mechanism which should be much more secure than cpython plus a sandboxing module

10589810width	height

pattern10		pattern10		
testng offers you more options and possibilites how to run your tests and in which order especially something junit can t

10603921versioning	upgrade
pattern7	worse	
in addition to avoiding peculiar upgrade issues when moving to a new edition and a new versioning unless you don t really mean express is sql server 2008 you also have the added bonus that you still have your original databases intact which you won t have if the upgrade fails in worse ways than simply being blocked

10604823folder	directory
pattern4		
select directory where is your htdocs or websites folder

10606919jar	war
pattern0		
i have the jersey resource classes bundled within a larger war as jar file which is now residing underneath web-inf lib folder on websphere application server

10609215srp	principles
pattern0		
there is another principles which i like even more than srp - dry

10611569children	parent
pattern0		
if there are more than one parent div elements that have three or more such children then all of the 3rd children are selected

10611581int	chars
pattern0		
obviously that number has to be something wider than a byte since there are more than 256 chars java uses a version of unicode where every chars is assigned a 16-bit value and this is why java chars are 16 bits wide and have int values from 0 to 65535

10623171opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

10623399int	double
pattern0		
i suppose i could do this cleaner with int and or double using instead of like

10624972udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

10627139width	margin
pattern4		
but the third button doesn t seem to add the margin on the right and so loses width

10628441int	chars
pattern7	smaller	
of course int may be somewhat more performant but at the same time chars is usually smaller

10628673int	chars
pattern7		
and size of chars is smaller than size of int

10630273int	chars
pattern0		
the rest are at least as large as chars and it s hard to imagine how you d make the i o system work correctly if int wasn t larger than chars

10633492highcharts	fusioncharts
pattern4		pattern2		
i personally prefer highcharts over fusioncharts because highcharts provides an insight documentation and api support.i was using it for a stock based application which i felt highcharts had an edge over the fusioncharts.the customization of highcharts was as easy as pie when you go through the high stock api

10635911clang	llvm
pattern7	easier	pattern7	easier	
ps llvm clang is easier to port.

10636341int	chars

pattern7		pattern0		
check box width and change image width if needed then check if image height is greater than box height if not then done

10643602dotnetzip	sharpziplib
pattern7		
dotnetzip is much easier to use than sharpziplib example of zipping all files in folder

10643746width	height
pattern7	greater	
there is also a background image on each column that is scaled to fit either the height or width whichever is greater

10643923popover	tooltip
pattern10		pattern10		
a tooltip has more in common with a popover but they are generally regarded as a popup historically

10644164zlib	libpng
pattern0		
several things i found in the cocos2d forums lead me to believe it s an issue with the zlib implementation on ios but i ve tried using both stb_image and lodepng to avoid zlib and those libraries actually performed even worse than libpng

10645605tinyint	varchar
pattern7		pattern0		
i think tinyint is better than varchar in this case

10647688highcharts	fusioncharts
pattern7		
customization and variety of animations highcharts has more customizable animations when compared to fusioncharts javascript charts

10649111pull	push
pattern4		
as a general advice i would say to prefer pull to push when dealing with multiple non-bare repositories push to only bare repositories

10654685redmine	mantis
pattern0		
i have been trying out redmine to see if i like it better than mantis

10654937width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
as the simplest solution swap width and height if width is lesser than height so you always get the resolution of landscape mode

10660804folder	directory
pattern7	libndk_databases.so	
value for -sym argument should be local directory on your disk for obj local armeabi folder that contains libndk_databases.so file

10663706wordpress	joomla
pattern3		
anyway it should be a good choice if you are a fan if microsoft but if you are not i strongly recommend using wordpress drupal or joomla

10666048width	height
pattern7	larger	
either the width 1348 or height 35667 is larger than max_gantting_size

10666583gif	png
pattern7		pattern0		
according to wikipedia the png format provides better compression than gif

10666940gif	png
pattern0		
png achieves better compression than gif because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of png filtering

10667245jruby	mri
pattern7	more	
with mri i d use forking with jruby there s more of a case to be made for threading

10668170coalesce	isnull
pattern10		pattern10		
coalesce is more correct of course you could just embed isnull over and over and over... but put that under a performance microscope and coalesce may just win

10669327stateless	stateful
pattern7		
dealing with a stateless cluster is often simpler then dealing with a stateful cluster

10669778coalesce	isnull
pattern4		pattern2		
coalesce function works a bit different coalesce will take any number of parameters and return the first non- null value i prefer coalesce over isnull cause

10671833union	distinct
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
in most cases union all is slightly faster than union distinct

10677367width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if width is greater than height then you ll most probably in landscape mode

10678440free	malloc
pattern0		
but apparently tracing garbage collection is so good that it is better than using malloc free

10680147hash	md5
pattern0		pattern0		
to protect your user s passwords you need to do better than md5 hash the passwords

10682634range	max
pattern0		
problem is when you input a large number such as 9999 result will be a negative or some weird number because sum is integer and it can t handle more than its max range so you know that a 32 bit binary will have 32 digits so is it too big for any number type in c++

10686188width	height
pattern7	bigger	
i use the ctframesettersuggestframesizewithconstraints function to define the size my attributed string will need but the height i get is smaller than it should be and also the width is bigger than the constrainsize.width parameter

10689140for-loop	loops
pattern0		
foreach can simplify the code in a for-loop but it is a heavy object and is slower than a loops written using for.

10696511calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
pattern0		
in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

10699671public	protected
pattern7	worse	
using default no protected private public is even worse as it allows classes in the same package or subclasses to access the logger

10703254versioning	upgrade
pattern0		
probably the project has deployment target setting higher than sdk versioning you have installed - try to change it to the lower versioning that is supported on your mac or upgrade your xcode to newer versioning

pattern4		
i ve gotten everything to work in the console but i can t get the right routes and i m getting the no route matches get categories 1 post 1 like error

10706070google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
and also does anyone know why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome in 3d rendering

10707293getter	setter
pattern7	something more	
however properties become very useful when the setter getter actually does something more than just assign return an attribute s value

10713717versioning	upgrade
pattern7	code greater	
pull - do a asynctask in your android app such that whenever the app is opened it checks asynchronously if there are any upgrade by having a versioning code in a url and show a dialog to the user if the versioning code is greater than what it is in the device

10715774lxml	libxml2
pattern10		pattern10		
the chapter starts with short course to xml general talk but with the atom syndication feed example then it continues with the standard xml.etree.elementtree and continues with third party lxml that implements more with the same interface full xpath 1.0 based on libxml2

10718309hide	fadeout
pattern10		pattern10		
according to this test - hide is slightly faster then fadeout since it doesn t use animations

10721499google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
and as bonus on google-chrome firefox is better in this case user will never be able to type any accents on the current page in any inputs without reloading the window

10723565equals	gethashcode
pattern2		
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

pattern2		
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

10727166cpython	pypy
pattern0		
you might want to try running your trainer under pypy if you aren t already -- it s significantly faster than cpython for some workloads

10727312button	checkbox
pattern4		
those areas each have an add button which creates a new dynamic row with textboxes and various select checkbox elements so the user can specify options for that object

10728510pull	push
pattern0		
push models have higher throughput than pull models

10729493coalesce	isnull
pattern10	more	pattern10	more expensive	
for anyone curious about the coalesce vs isnull discussion and why i changed my answer to use isnull kanav rightly pointed out that coalesce is more expensive

10729626comparator	comparable
pattern2		
it s implements comparable interface so you should be able to compare them with comparator

10735235bash	zsh
pattern7	much safer	
if your shell is bash or ksh or zsh it s much safer and easier to build up a command with an array rather than a string

10737104int	chars
pattern8		
int values have less overhead than chars values

10737929int	double
pattern0		
converting it in php between int and double will be slower than storing double in the database

10742598thin	unicorn
pattern2		
in most cases though you will probably want to choose between thin and unicorn

10743806actionscript	mxml
pattern8		
so yes it can be used with flash or rather pure actionscript but it is a little less convenient than with mxml where everything is set up by the framework because it takes more under the hood configuration to be able to run all the necessary parts for remoting

10745991coffeescript	livescript

10848194screens	tablet
pattern7		
an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger and may require special care on the application s part to make good use of it though it may rely on resizing by the system to fill the screens

10851578range	max	range	min	min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
take a look at your picture - all the range you want have ending time greater than min and starting time less than max

10855004min	max
pattern4		
you might prefer min or max to get other values

10855383inherited	properties
pattern4		
local beats inherited inherited beats default etc. you re just comparing the values of two properties sources against each other at the same level

10858440memcached	apc
pattern7		
the big caveat here is that apc generally has less memory available for storage though. default being 32mb memcached s big adavantage is that while still fast it s distributed so if you have multiple servers running they could share this data

10858994width	height
pattern0		
so the majority of desktop and laptop screens nowadays have a width greater than the height

10858994width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
i d like to do this with media queries so that if someone on a mac with a big monitor has their browser window sized so that it s very tall height is greater than width they would see a header and footer

10858994width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
but if they went fullscreen or wide width is greater than height they would see a sidebar on the left and maybe also the right

10859451cvs	svn
pattern7		
svn is much better then cvs and git or mercurial are even better again

10860766width	height
pattern0		
now get the width and height of the uibuttons and compare if the lastpressedbutton.frame.origin.x will be less than width or -width away

10861292mongodb	bson
pattern4		
i ve choose mongodb for its scalability great docs bson documents storage and many other great features

10861750range	minimum
pattern0		
the objective function is guaranteed to be finite and contionuous in the interpolation range along with its first and second derivatives and has no more than one minimum in this range if it has no minimum it is monotonic

10861938udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp

10862478min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
now this obviously doesn t work because the new bounds don t have to be strictly less greater than the min max

10863252google-chrome	firefox
pattern2		
how to standardize the height of a select box between google-chrome and firefox

10870521mouse	keyboard
pattern8		
instead methods like .live or .on since the former is deprecated are more useful with mouse and keyboard events generally speaking

10871583opera	firefox
pattern7	smoother	
mozila firefox and opera works smoother

10875289min	max
pattern7		pattern0		
for a person who sees this there is also nothing wrong min is less than max

10876371width	height
pattern7		pattern7		pattern0		
2- if total rows height is bigger than current datagridview height it means there will be a scrollbar..also the same for the other scrollbar columns width is bigger than dgv width

10879914maven	pom.xml
pattern3		
if you haven t used maven here s how you import one of the springsource example projects in sts download the project unzip it if you downloaded the archive go in sts in project - import and choose existing maven project and browse to the location in which the pom.xml file in the unzipped project is

10881361user-controls	tabcontrol
pattern0		
some user-controls s are larger than the tabcontrol and got clipped so i modified its template by wrapping the contentpresenter in a scrollviewer with horizontalscrollbarvisibility and verticalscrollbarvisibility set to auto

10881667direct3d	direct2d
pattern0		
direct3d appears in principal to be easier than direct2d but has poor text font handling in the latest version

10883896cvs	svn
pattern0		
git and mercurial both handle this more easily that you re imagining and easier than say svn or cvs do

10893721min	max
pattern4		
if you just want to pick one why not just do a group by and select min or max

10897471children	parent
pattern7		
this way it is not ok if the parent has more children let say they are input s

10899892telerik	obout
pattern4		
this is the first time i was working with obout controls.previously i was working with telerik controls and so i had a good chance of comparing these two set of controls.i would prefer obout for its light weight and functionality

10906859client-side	server-side
pattern4		
with node.js you ll also have one of the faster server-side interpreters at your command faster than python and ruby roughly equal to lua and sometimes up to java s level and somehow v8 has the fastest regex engine in the world and then server-side code matches client-side code which makes things like rpc layers much nicer to work with

10910289width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
two ways to solve this destroy those controls or move them to an invisible region top left to minus values or to values bigger than width height of the parent

10910531accessor	properties
pattern7		
a properties is nothing more than syntactic shorthand for a get set accessor

10912281int	chars
pattern0		
and the redis python api makes it very pythonic.essentially the database store would have 200 odd keys and a value in long int associated with 80 of keys or in some cases chars fields that are less than 200 chars

10918235goto	break
pattern0		
in the cleanup even in normal case scenario i would regard the use of goto as being clearer than the do while 0 constructs among other things because the target labels themselves practically cry out look at me far moreso than the break and do while 0 constructs

10918273hide	show
pattern4		
click on the visibility pane and select show or hide based on an expression radio button

10919837min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
the last bit is there because i needed to limit the time selected to no earlier than the min date and no greater than the max date so i had to check the date selected in the matching datepicker control

10920489hex	binary
pattern4		
however if these constants correspond to certain bits underneath most programmers prefer hex or even binary to make that clear and more readable

10923040range	minimum
pattern0		
to summarize the problem given time range t1 and t2 on day d how can i determine the remaining time left in d that is longer than the minimum time block m

10924146next	except
pattern0		
now i would like to take the ceiling of this number except in cases where the amount it is greater than the next lower integer is smaller than some epsilon

10924678greensock	tweenjs
pattern4		
i highly recommend greensock for tweening instead of tweenjs as it supports better and have more features

10931508width	height
pattern7	greater	
the thing is the window showing the files is pretty big wide or tall because you resized it and emacs sees that the width or height is greater than the respective threshold and splits it likewise

10934748hash	md5
pattern10		pattern10		
the wrapper uses these in such a way that even the md5 implementation is significantly more secure than a simple hash

10936609maven	cargo
pattern10		pattern10		
you could also use apache cargo which is more general than the tomcat maven plugin

10939202xapian	whoosh
pattern10		pattern10		pattern0		
xapian is slightly more difficult to setup but is much faster than whoosh

10940730int	chars
pattern4		
thus when you compare chars you are really comparing the int that represents the chars in a particular charset

10941029gif	png
pattern10		pattern10		
while png is definitely better that gif occasionally there is a use case for needing to stay in gif format

10941587backbone.js	zepto
pattern4		
i d recommend backbone.js and zepto for an html-based app

10942730lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern7	slower	
from reading this website it seems lxml is the most commonly used and fastest while beautifulsoup is slower but accounts for more errors and variation

10947299width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if the ratio is bigger then 1 then the width is bigger than height let s say 700px 500px and after resizing the image is filled with white spaces in the top and bottom of the image

10947299width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
of course if the ratio is less than 1 then the width is smaller than height let s say 500px 700px and you will see the white spaces on the left and right of the image

10949107uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
pattern0		
i added the check for uitapgesturerecognizer in case your class handles more than 1 uigesturerecognizer s and you only want to remove that

10949313disk	ram
pattern7		pattern0		
disk access is much slower than ram

10949881int	boolean
pattern4		
in t-sql a simple select boolean int will achieve the same result i believe

10950851sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
note after doing some benchmarks i found that sorteddictionary is faster for removal but sortedlist is faster for adding and indexing by key

10951622int	double
pattern7		pattern0		
one of long long and double is bigger than 3 int and a multiple of 8

10955685quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	in-place
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
parallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-place

10956586for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
pattern0		
but you will have loops the outer arrays in order to get it to work which would be better done with a for-loop so you reference both at once

10963741width	height
pattern0		
if i set the frame of the tableviewincell to a width larger than the height of the containing cell then it goes heywire

10970637trie	tree
pattern7		
for cases where each node in the trie has most of its children used the trie is substantially more space efficient and time efficient than th ternary search tree

10977900redhat	fedora

i write this regular expression to match cos 0 or sqrt 0 kind of strings why is it not working

10981844hash	md5
pattern3		
fwiw i ve been using sha1 sha256 in crypto products in binary form for over 5 years and i d recommend choosing hash in this following order from the strongest to the weakest sha256 sha1 md5

10982181button	checkbox
pattern4		
i tried exploring the railsautocomplete.select javascript event that gets fired when the option is selected to execute custom js to select checkbox and radio button but how do i get the data from sql query in that event listener

10986493hash	salt
pattern3		
your suggestion sounds fine but i would recommend storing salt hash of the password instead

10988746subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
pattern0		
to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992

10996036cvs	svn
pattern7		
wondering mainly if svn uses less disk space or more than the same in cvs

10998569int	double	int	chars
pattern4		
never use to compare int objects or float double short chars byte long bigdecimal... for equality

11000855width	height
pattern0		
your main div has height 1200px and the content are larger than this width so border is not displaying on the content which are overflowing you can check by increase height it will showed

11001264int	double
pattern7		pattern0		
with the cast that bad stuff is undefined behavior most likely double is bigger than int and it overruns the memory for i

11005984gif	png
pattern0		
you can then use imagecopy to insert each gif image including the background and imagepng to generate png output which is better for line art than jpeg offers better compression than gif and can support more than 256 colors

11006731for-loop	arrays
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
first if you generically want to apply the same function to each element of an arrays and there isn t already a built in vectorized way to do it you could use arrayfun although often a simple for-loop is faster and more readable

11008319post	get
pattern7		pattern0		
get is always faster than post

11016724min	max
pattern4		
i try to select min and max prices drupal commerce for current catalog tag

11023447post	put	post	get	put	get
pattern4		
apart from this you should also make sure to implement the four verbs correctly so that they match the sql commands get select post insert put update delete delete handle encoding negotiation correctly return proper http response codes and all the other things that are expected of a restful api

11028384onclick	onsubmit
pattern8		
you can indeed execute scripts on almost any page using content scripts that can manipulate the dom allowing you to add an onsubmit event listener to a form more reliable than onclick on a button as it is fired however the form is submitted - hitting enter

11031349button	checkbox
pattern4		
when i select button i am using checkbox image when again tap on button it deselect the checkbox image.when i select the button in first row scroll the tabelview it also checks the button on 3rd or 4th row

11039542messageformat	decimalformat
pattern0		
i think it is possible to play better with the decimalformat and messageformat classes here is what i can come with it passes the test cases but i don t think it is that robust

11040805children	parent
pattern4		
you have to use pointers for qt objects qt maintains parent-child link for its objects via pointers and destroys children on parent delete

11040953uuid	mac-address
pattern10		pattern10		
in fact v1 uuid is more fit than v4 if you use the uuid just as a table id - because it uses mac-address and time stamp to prevent clashes

11041552folder	directory
pattern7	cleaner	
all of the object files are dumped into the output directory and the executable is placed in a different folder that is kept cleaner

11041968jobs	cron
pattern10		pattern10		
check out the quartz scheduler it does what cron does and more is easily integrated in a web app and allows you to call jobs written in java without any complicated plumbing

11043195google-chrome	firefox
pattern3		
i recommend installing google-chrome firefox or ie9 opening the javascript developer console and making use of the console.log ... function

11043798webkit	gecko
pattern0		
gecko seems to like anti-aliasing more than webkit

11045688getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
so select dateadd month datediff month 0 getdate 0 takes the current date z getdate and replaces those parts of it beyond the month day and all time components with the corresponding parts from 1900-01-01t00 00 00

11052992google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
compare google-chrome to firefox note how the editor is apparently missing in firefox.

11055332min	max
pattern4		
select min key_part2 max key_part2

11055370min	max
pattern4		
select min key_part2 max key_part2 from tbl_name where key_part1 10

11056538innodb	myisam
pattern7		pattern0		
although 4m isn t that many rows with contention and depending on your structure and database engine it may take a while i think myisam alters take longer than innodb because myisam requires whole table locks and handles concurrency less well

11057475google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		
firefox is even slower that google-chrome

11057732post	get
pattern0		
i need to create a menu based on that list but cannot simply list all post and get it because it is a busy blog and has more than 2000 post

11058633jruby	mri
pattern0		
lastly if you are frequently finding yourself running long running process i advice you to try jruby which is works much better with long running processes due to jvm lot faster than mri

11059350prepare	execute
pattern0		
2 executemany is better than execute as it makes for you the prepare statement

11062366google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	more	pattern10	more used	
a similar tool is now present in firefox you had to use firebug before but google-chrome is more used partly because of its more powerful js engine v8

11064609width	height
pattern7		pattern0		pattern7		pattern0		
in fact the gap doesn t appear at all when width is greater than height only when height is greater than width

11065669width	height
pattern0		
i have a centred fixed width content div and if there isnt enough content ie an small error page the height of it is smaller than the height of my web-browser

11065866uiview	subviews
pattern0		
you are seeing a noticeable jump in interface response because subviews do in fact consume quite a bit of memory uiview are very expensive compared to their underlying calayers and as such calling -removesubview not only unloads stress from the gpu but also frees up more memory as the subviews is usually released afterwards

11066220put	get
pattern8		
sorted vector resizable array if getrandom is much more frequent than get put

11067711momentjs	datejs
pattern4		
i d like to recommend momentjs - a very lightweight yet surprisingly capable datejs library

11070262width	height
pattern7		
within the head row there are lists of a height that is longer than the head rows height they are however only supposed to be visible on hover but when on hover they are supposed to be ontop of the headrow but still having the the original 100 width of the parent being the element of the column

11078841width	height
pattern7		
summed up right now i do all my calculations based on the image height first and then check if the screen width s is larger than 1.5 x my image width

11083689nettcpbinding	net.tcp
pattern4		
once that s taken care of just be sure to edit the default website bindings to enable the specific bindings your service uses for nettcpbinding go to website - edit bindings... - add... then choose net.tcp and assign it the ports

11083793prepare	execute	dbi	log4perl
pattern4		
if you don t want to go with dbix log4perl and the dbi trace options don t suit your needs you can write callbacks for dbi s prepare select execute methods and gather whatever you like in them

11083995min	max
pattern4		
i want to use the case statement to select max meterreadings.totalmono - min meterreadings.totalmono for black and white or max meterreadings.totalcolour - min meterreadings.totalcolour for colour

11084500udp	tcp
pattern4		
udp will outperform tcp substantially if the nature of the network is stable and remains stable

11086104vim	emacs
pattern4		
but when organizing text structure or work with other applications i prefer vim in emacs

11088749bower	npm
pattern4		
i don t think there s a jasmine-browserify package yet and it doesn t really match bower npm s way of doing things avoid global exports

11089443pop-up	dialog

in my original project there is more than one textbox for currency description textarea chekcbox etc

11097681width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
it is happening when width is greater than height

11099026int	chars
pattern0		
lets explain this little more by using int instead of chars

11109203google-chrome	safari
pattern4		
i need to match safari browsers but not google-chrome browsers using one regex

11123968factors	matrix
pattern10		pattern10		
eta to answer your question in more general terms let s say we had the number of subjects and levels set up in advance increasing the number of factors is more complicated unless i m mistaken because then it would no longer be a two-dimensional matrix

11125957cpython	pypy
pattern0		
i finally ran it through pypy and was delighted to discover that when the lists got really deep pypy was running significantly faster than cpython

11126673rank	max
pattern4		
normally i d use rank for this and just select rank 1 but that seems pointless when i know i just need the max of a column

11127247viewmodel	caliburn
pattern7		
with caliburn it is even easier since you just need to bind a property on your viewmodel to selecteditem

11128152draggable	droppable
pattern0		
you likely aren t using appropriate plugin and would do better with droppable and draggable

11138532width	height
pattern0		
i have two divs curtain_left and curtain_right that need to be 100 of the height of the browser no less than 20 width and no more than 40 width

i think ie uses bigger font than firefox or google-chrome by default

11146653equals	compareto
pattern0		
i am using the compareto method in java to try and check if a certain date is greater than or equals than 24 hours after another date

11151458gson	xstream	freemarker	velocity
pattern4		
if you use case is rendering arrays and other object graphs in human readable form you may go for templating solution like velocity of freemarker or convert them to json or xml and rpetty pring it - i would recommend gson xstream for this task

11152899column-count	height
pattern10		pattern10		
the problem is that when there is some fixed height opera generates more columns than specified in column-count instead of adding scroll

11156981postgresql	mysql
pattern4		pattern2		
i prefer postgresql over mysql but that s another debate

11164405range	minimum
pattern4		
at each step if both indices are in range i m and j n choose minimum of a i b j and write it to c k

11164522onresume	onpause
pattern8		
technically you can do it dynamically but that would require doing the registration unregistration somewhere more permanent than onresume onpause which i don t think is really what you want.

11165394margin	height
pattern7		
you also need to set a height that is greater than the negative top margin so part of the element will be visible so the user can hover over it

11167002for-loop	arrays
pattern4		pattern4		pattern4		
search for the string in the infowindows arrays store the indexes of the items that contain the string in the matches arrays and then use a for-loop with the matches arrays to add the markers from the markers arrays based on the index values of the matches arrays

11171890imagick	gmagick
pattern4		
imagick i personally prefer gmagick which is the same pretty much

11174063screens	hdpi
pattern0		
because i have bigger font size for hdpi screens and it goes smaller with ldpi screens

11176698int	chars
pattern4		
in my program i compare chars against hexadecimal int and i get different results for

11180161min	max
pattern0		
if you have data is small or larger than the min and max will be quite different than what matlab thinks is good for pictures

11180543int	double
pattern0		
now how can we predict in advance if there are more than one int whose logarithm is 123456.78 up to the precision of system.double or if there is in fact no int whose logarithm hits that specific double the precise result of an ideal pow function being an irrational number

11182812jqvmap	jvectormap

have look at jscrollbar.setunitincrement beacuse bunch of jpanels in the jscollpane has un_natural scrolling in compare with jlist jtable or jtextarea

11184560google-chrome	safari
pattern0		
i found out that with any opacity not text color alpha less than 1.0 google-chrome gave me good results but safari was still bad.

11184784cabal-dev	hackage
pattern4		
you can grab cabal-dev archive from hackage unpack it and fix the .cabal file yourself

11185544equals	compareto
pattern2		
if you are using a collection class that uses compareto or compare rather than equals then you clearly don t have to override equals

11190432gsap	greensock
pattern3		
i highly recommend using greensock gsap v12 for animated effects

11190974inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
pattern0		
still you cannot inherited from a as superclass cannot have a lower visibility than subclassing

11193158equals	icomparable	equals	compareto	icomparable	compareto
pattern10		pattern10		
implementing icomparable is a more fine-grain way of comparison as it provides the compareto method which is a greater-than less-than comparison as opposed to equals which is simply a is-equal-or-not comparison

11198340google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
i know firefox google-chrome provide svg support and i have the feeling that google-chrome is faster at rendering but maybe there are other standalone svg renderers that i m missing

11199578gif	png
pattern7		
for example png has better support for transparency than gif or jpeg

11203139int	chars
pattern7		
value8 is promoted to int assuming the conversion rank of unsigned chars is lower than the conversion rank of int usually the case on most platforms

11208545opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

11211204button	checkbox
pattern7	better	
my initial idea was to use radio button for the options because of its exclusion functionality but maybe using checkbox provides a better solution

11211762post	get
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
post is more secure than get this is just a quick example

11213407button	checkbox
pattern4		
if i clicked on button my table changes if i choose checkbox of course

11217047apache	nginx

nginx works great by itself and will likely be much faster than apache

11217047apache	nginx
pattern7	better	
nginx makes apache better

11220175width	height
pattern7	greater	
visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero

11221712getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd dd -30 getdate

11223644pull	push
pattern10	more	pattern10	more stable	
it supports fetch pull and push and is more stable for me than hg-git similar features from hg to git

11231483coalesce	isnull
pattern4		pattern2		
2.coalesce function works a bit different coalesce will take any number of parameters and return the first non-null value i prefer coalesce over isnull cause meets ansi standarts while isnull does not

11252679hide	show
pattern4		
in the keychain access program under the view menu select show expired certificates if the menu item says hide expired certificates then you re already showing them

11259853disk	ram

there are tonnes of posts blogs on this so just google mongodb working set but as you know access from ram rather paging to disk is quicker

11260171d3.js	highcharts
pattern10	more	pattern10	more interactive	
i found d3.js to be rich library but highcharts is more interactive i guess

11263120client-side	server-side
pattern4		
if the value is changing based on some other input you should capture that input server-side and use it to calculate the value that would have been posted back the same way you calculated which value to select client-side

pattern0		
if the height in resolution is greater than its width how do i achieve it

11286328int	double
pattern0		
a solution using int only calculations should be quicker than float double calculations is

11287884post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
but do also remember that in your case get request looks more appropriate and as balusc says its not good practice to use post for bookmarkable page-to-page navigation

11322412spaces	delimiter
pattern0		
if you want to allow for more delimiter than just spaces tab you can add additional separators when using split

11325318post	put
pattern0		
typically you would not allow a http client to determine the uri of a new resource so a post to blog would be safer than a put to blog article-uri although http does cater for appropriate responses should the server be unable to honour the intended uri

11328561post	get
pattern0		
additionally i would advise that the your view explicitly checks that the request is a post and if not make the assumption that it is a get rather than the other way around as you have it this is safer as get and post are not the only request types and you definitely need to know that you are dealing with a post request if you want to deal with variables submitted in the post request

11329018getter	setter
pattern0		
is there any cpan module that would make this easier preferably with automatic getter setter generation

11332657post	get

11345144mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
pattern8		
also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

11346524addition	multiplication
pattern0		
it s no more multiplication than addition so is misleading syntax.

11349814coalesce	isnull

the function isnull is kind of equivalent but coalesce allows more arguments and is standard sql.

11350130awt	swing
pattern10	more	pattern10	more advanced	
as already mentioned by others better to use swing over awt since swing is more advanced

11352883int	chars
pattern0		
100 strings of value x00 take 24 bytes per value too -- but notice that listofstrings is one chars shorter than listofintegers so the 1-byte string takes up 1 byte more than the int 0 and the same amount of space as the int 255

11353004children	parent
pattern0		
if a node has two children then the left child has a smaller value than the parent and the right child has a bigger value

11369304multiplying	modulo
pattern10		pattern10		
if you have the choice modulo is probably more convenient basically you take your matrix modulo a number m after each power or multiplying and the individual entries of the matrix will never grow beyond m - 1 2 but obviously the result will be an algorithm for modular exponentiation thus different from what you have now

11369555folder	directory
pattern0		
on windows xp however it works fine on local file systems but when watching folder on a mapped network drive it throws an ioexception when trying to watch more than 50 directory

11371300ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
pattern10		pattern10		
it has some downsides- namely working with both ant and maven so the actual pom.xml is more difficult to comprehend but it does allow for more flexibility than is otherwise possible with maven

pattern7		
is there any way i could use regex or something to detect if the width is greater than 320 and if so have it replace the width and height by something that would fit

11389386switching	screens
pattern7		
i can switching between these two screens easily.at the beginning first screens is fully displayed.when i click a button second screens will come from right and first screens goes to the left.but i want to keep the second screens and remember..second screens has less width a portion of the first screen.that means a half of the first screens disappear

11390363innodb	myisam
pattern4		pattern10		pattern10		pattern10	more	pattern10	more reliable	
out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer myisam for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking myisam is faster but innodb is more reliable

11392645minimum	max
pattern4		
now i want to select max x from all minimum x for each group

pattern0		
you can get soap services to work on iphone but it s a lot more work than just get or post ing against an url

11418395soappy	suds
pattern3		
i would recommend using suds instead of soappy but this should work

11420347hash	md5
pattern0		
of course any hash algorithm is going to have some chance of collision but you have better options than md5 that would still satisfy the 1024-byte limit

11423311int	double
pattern7		pattern7		pattern0		
you are guaranteed that double is never smaller than float and that long double is never smaller than double - similar to the guarantees for long long long int short

11423542passenger	unicorn
pattern4		pattern2		
i d choose unicorn over passenger if only because passenger still doesn t offer rolling restarts

11428258floyd-warshall	dijkstra
pattern7	s worse	
the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v|3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|

11428762udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
if they are connected over the internet you could try to use the examples for tcp but tcp has more overhead than udp

11429834mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi

pattern7		pattern7		pattern0		
proportionally the hdpi screens is slightly taller than the mdpi screens

11429933mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
pattern7		pattern0		pattern0		
so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution

11430029width	height
pattern4		
you can select width as fixed or fluid and height as fluid or as you wish according to height width is resized

11430832int	chars
pattern0		
when you re printing using the default x format the value to be printed is interpreted as being an int much larger than the chars

11430848getter	setter
pattern7	better	
the book states the following if you want parameters to be optional use property getter setter which is a better way of defining optional parameters than adding different constructors to the class for each dependency.

11434574youtube	vimeo

pattern0		
in the long run you ll have less troubles with supporting tablet multiple screens sizes and you can easily re-use them in different contexts

11458338int	chars
pattern0		
this assumes that your int will never be more than 10 chars long

11462284apache	nginx
pattern0		
there seems to be a consensus that nginx serves static content faster than apache

11464365int	chars
pattern0		
update the reason why int doesn t work in oppose to chars and short is because that when both numbers are added there is a possibility of overflow regardless of being int short or chars while not forgetting integral promotion but because short and chars are with smaller sizes than int and because they are promoted to int in expressions they are represented again without truncation in this line

11467741dbcontext	objectcontext
pattern3		
i would also recommend using dbcontext instead of objectcontext

11468581datediff	difference
pattern4		
select datediff second 2012-02-29 09 00 00.000 2012-02-29 09 59 00.000 only gives 3540 which is difference of second

11470263ocaml	scheme

if you want something more popular with more community support then i d recommend scheme or ocaml depending on whether you d rather deal with unfamiliar syntax go with scheme or deal with unfamiliar typing go with ocaml first

11470295lisp	scheme
pattern4		
i recommend lisp for example it s dialect scheme as first functional programming language

11473734width	height
pattern0		
it is to make it smaller by height and width

11473992moq	fakeiteasy
pattern0		
fakeiteasy seems to have an overall nicer syntax than moq like the strongly-typed way the former deals with passing parameters to a constructor of a faked class

11475311joptionpane	jdialog
pattern7	better	
using jdialog instead of joptionpane is better to put number of data

11476489getdate	dateadd

this goes in your root .htaccess but if you have access to httpd.conf that is better

11488114google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
most noticeably if you look or google-chrome firefox and then internet explorer 9 you ll notice that the terms and conditions are slightly higher than in google-chrome or firefox and thus slightly touching the main content area

11488206switching	screens
pattern10		pattern10		
at this point there is nothing i can do since the switching is no longer there... the external screens is just a blank screens for the sake of the exercise

11488555flask	webapp2

11494920width	height
pattern0		
not only is height of keyboard so large how can height be larger than width

11498361getter	setter
pattern7	better	
you can always develop an application without using getter and setter methods.as you have explained.but using getter and setter is better practice because access modifiers private public gives you encapsulation which is oops feature

11499920google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
you can do this by looking into the source code or better with firebug firefox or developer tools ie google-chrome in the network tab

11505760innodb	myisam
pattern0		
if you use a where clause though it changes the execution pattern to use indexes so in general innodb will be slower than myisam on full unrestricted counts where as the performance matches up on restricted counts

11508788libsvm	liblinear
pattern0		
and how do the differences make liblinear faster than libsvm

11514391width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
so it s even more odd that the width is greater than the height when it should be the other way around

11520215vim	emacs

11561011put	get
pattern4		
any rules that do match get put into an agenda and then fired

11563070subtract	addition	subtract	add
pattern7		
if you continue to use your method of performing this task then you need to manually check if the addition of the two lower order decimal digits has caused a carry by checking if the result of the addition is greater than 10 and if it is subtract 10 from the number and then add 1 to the higher order digit calculation

11568752integer	unsigned

if mp3 ogg is better try different compression ratios and sample rates to see which goes faster

11570526apache	nginx
pattern10	faster	
you can create custom controller to serve that files and use send_file mentod in it with disposition inline also you may be interested to x_sendfile_header setting to serwe that files with apache nginx which is faster

11575102printf	fgets
pattern7		
i am getting a problem using printf and fgets as in my code printf is written earlier then fget but it does not run it runs after fgets runs

pattern0		
there are also different types of trees -- i am going to assume that you are using a normal old tree any number of children no more than one parent one root node

11588693multiplying	division
pattern10		pattern10		
but determining the digit and the carry by division is much more concise and for the larger factors also much more efficient when multiplying a digit by 100 the result is on average 450 requiring 45 subtractions but two divisions are sufficient for all factors

11588896verilog	vhdl
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
in certain respects systemc deliberately mimics the hardware description languages vhdl and verilog but is more aptly described as a system-level modeling language

11593868width	height

select nstextview doubleclick in ib on it because nstextview is in nsscrollview by default or select it in document outline and go to attributes inspector - linguistics - and uncheck continous spell checking here

11809828udp	mtu
pattern0		
basically while sending udp packets larger than mtu ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it

11810686pow	sqrt
pattern0		
my question is is fast implementation of pow x 0.5f faster than fast sqrt x

under a gnu linux distribution like ubuntu everything is much more easier and you can just plug in your device without installing anything you just have to set the right permissions for the device once

11852754for-loop	arrays
pattern7		
an arrays usually offers more information for alias analysis and after some optimizations the same code will be generated anyway search for-loop strength reduction if curious

11856626min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
my code should make sure the user doesn t select a min value greater than the max value or a max value smaller than the min value using this code

11860746button	checkbox
pattern4		
i have a select button and checkbox to select pictures

11863772width	height
pattern0		
font.getsize text return the width and the height in pixels of the text so my method splits the string in words and verify if the word is greater than the width of the image if not i concatenate the word in a variable

11870987minimum	max
pattern7		pattern0		
i m simply checking the values of two input textboxes and alerting the user if the max price is less than the minimum price but they re evaluating backwards

11871319min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
it s likely that tm2 is a value that is larger than the max int32 value or lower than the min int32 value...i would add a check something like.

11873170imperative	declarative
pattern4		
angular tends to favor declarative manipulation of the dom rather than a imperative one at least that s the way i ve been playing with it

11875616width	height
pattern7		
this should fit the image to the height of the gridview maintaining the aspect ratio and crop the remaining width unless the image s width is smaller than that of the gridview when the height is matched

11878102width	height
pattern0		
i have one issue regarding uiimageview and uiimage i get confuse on 1 thing ie my uiimageview height 759 and width 748 and i am downloading the images from server that height and width is so so greater such as image height 2048 and width 2500

11879403cvs	svn
pattern0		
in this case i converted the cvs to svn and found the file size on the hard drive it was on my own laptop at the time but it was much smaller in svn than in cvs but there could have been some compression applied i dont know but everything on the web said svn would actually be bigger than cvs

11880756redmine	trac
pattern10	more	pattern10	more popular	
redmine is definitely much more popular but trac is getting more popular in particular as 1.0 version is around the corner

11881265google-chrome	firefox

i was looking at this example that checks one checkbox list by clicking on select button but i want all three checkbox list checkbox to be checked in javascript

11890330udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
tcp is much slower than udp but when the two machines are not on the same lan udp is not reliable

11892708virtualenv	tox
pattern3		
for that i recommend using tox and having it configured to create a 2.6 environment to test on so that when your coworkers run your test suite the tests are run in a 2.6 virtualenv

11895113post	get
pattern4		
no route matches get groups 5 post new

11895699atof	strtod
pattern0		
you can actually switch to strtod always a much better idea than atof and ask it to give you the character position that caused it to stop parsing

11897487int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
if int is 4 bytes and represents 2 bytes the int consumes more memory than the chars -array so you are not initialising the full int -memory to 0 by setting all chars -variables

11897993min	max
pattern4		
you must first select the records you are interested in and then select max and min from those

11901835jspinner	documentfilter
pattern2		
notice by using documentfilter output from jformattedtextfield or jspinner java internally to hold dot as ascii decimal separator there is only difference betweens view and model swing document in compare with documentfilter there is returned changed grouping space and separator too

11903861google-chrome	firefox
pattern4		
i would strongly recommend you use the web developer tools that exist in most modern browsers i prefer google-chrome s but firefox has good ones too

11904650spaces	delimiter
pattern4		pattern2		
select spaces as delimiter and click on finish and you are done

11907666width	height
pattern0		
what s odd is that usually this doesn t happen - so far i ve only encountered this error when the original image has height greater than width and it has been filtered by another app called camera+...the exact same photo before filtering causes no problems and a filtered landscape photo also seems to be fine

11908536width	height
pattern0		
i have an image that has it s width greater than the height and it is still outputting using the second if statement in the jquery

11909827cypher	gremlin
pattern10	more	pattern10	more natural	
translating this to gremlin is a tad bit tedious pattern matching in cypher is more natural but lmk if this is in the right direction and i ll do it

11911427int	chars
pattern7		
the only way it could fail to be a no-op is if the range of chars is larger than the range of int for example if chars and int are both 32-bit but chars is unsigned.

11912590paperclip	fog
pattern0		
i have found though that since i started using the asset_sync gem which uses fog instead of aws-s3 gem i don t have any more trouble with paperclip and s3

11913118urwid	ncurses
pattern7	higher	
you can use python ncurses it s a part of standard library on nix systems or you can use urwid that is a higher level library for creating console interfaces

11913203union	distinct
pattern4		
by the way union has optional keyword all when the all is omitted union automatically selects distinct rows from the resultset

11914403punctuation	words
pattern4		
use regex with w+ pattern to match words and exclude punctuation

11923223for-loop	loops
pattern10		pattern10		
on the other hand for-loop is more like counter based where you want to specify for how many times should loops happened

11924367int	chars
pattern7		
although outer foo chars is a better match for the call foo c name lookup stops after finding outer inner foo int outer foo chars is hidden and so the program prints inner

11924670post	get
pattern4		
here are my curl options. i ve omitted steps that choose get or post and create querystring

11926815union	distinct
pattern0		pattern0		
you can avoid duplicates and still run much faster than union distinct which is actually same as union by running query like this

11936235awt	swing
pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
i haven t worked with awt much but swing is much better from the gui developer s point of view

11937386draggable	droppable
pattern0		
it s just a hunch but maybe it s only a matter of the size of your draggable being too big and being over more than one droppable item

11939202children	parent
pattern10	more	pattern10	more direct	
the children still do not need to know about the parent and the parent gets a more direct event as opposed to a signal connection

11939554int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
if the int turns out to be 38 i need the version string to come out as 380 only one zero was added to the end of the int because i wanted a max of three chars and if the int is less than three chars zeroes will be added to make it three

11943525integer	unsigned
pattern4		
i have a warning message saying implicit conversion loses integer precision time_t aka long to unsigned int i m guessing that this is telling me that in essence my seed will not change until next year occurs

11943637for-loop	arrays
pattern7		
the key is to track how many rounds of division the for-loop goes through until the quotient of the current time minus the input time divided by th value of the arrays item is less than the th value of this arrays

11945579division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
pattern0		pattern0		
on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition

11949439equals	compareto
pattern2		
you should compare bigdecimal with compareto instead of equals as advised by the other answers

11952551valgrind	gprof
pattern0		
another important difference is that valgrind can report a lot more information than gprof does but that s not specifically related to using it

11955481getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd yy datediff yy 0 getdate 0

11956604suffix-array	suffix-tree
pattern0		
i am interested in this because the factor oracle is easy to construct with 30 lines of c++ suffix-array needs about 60 and suffix-tree needs 150 and it runs faster than suffix-array and suffix-tree

11960001membase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	couchbase	couchdb
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
i d like to add that couchbase is a faster and more scalable option than couchdb the 2.0 version introduces views at a high level it s a distributed memcached membase server merged with couchdb but of course more sophisticated than just mashing them together

11960104addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
and the value of this expression evaluated according to the precedence rules is 62 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

11964847margin	height
pattern0		
you basically need to make sure that either the content has a bottom margin greater than or equal to the height of the footer or if the content is in a container of some sort that it s container has a bottom padding equal to or greater than the height of the footer

11967182getter	setter
pattern10	more	pattern10	more flexibility	
in general encapsulation of fields by getter and setter leaves more flexibility for changes

11977129innodb	myisam
pattern7		
tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default

11977807jsf	tapestry
pattern0		
one framework that tries to do more in the template while remaining less bloated than jsf which isn t that hard anyway is apache tapestry

11982403django	web.py
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
web.py is more low-level comparing with django

11982660min	max
pattern2		
so if you really want to select along with min max values i guess you ll have to resort to a join

11986618m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
pattern4		
if i right click on my project and select maven -- update project configuration after modifying the pom.xml file etc m2e seems to re-order the build path libraries so that maven dependencies come after the jre system libs which i don t want

11991800nsurl	nsstring
pattern7		
if you need the result as a string you can use the absolutestring method of nsurl it s typically better to use nsurl instead of nsstring for urls though

11991931union	distinct
pattern4		
a union statement effectively does a select distinct on the results set

11992906public	protected
pattern4		
if for example you choose protected inheritance all public methods in a will become protected to the outside and the rest remain the same

11993335division	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
pattern0		
this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

11993555addition	multiplication
pattern7		pattern0		
multiplication has a higher precedence than addition so it is evaluated first

11995252terminate	timeout
pattern4		
would be adding a kill timeout to the popen processes so if they haven t received a keep alive in 5 minutes or whatever you think is right they would save state if appropriate and terminate

12006095opera	google-chrome

pattern3		
i also recommend using ggplot2 or lattice

12007606width	height
pattern7	bigger	pattern7	bigger	
my idea here is that you always resize to whatever dimension height width is bigger then to crop the excess amount in the smaller dimension you have you pull the positioning to the appropriate negative value

12009123width	margin
pattern0		
or by ensuring the width of your split container is less than the width of the user control after subtracting the margin from each side

12015986int	double
pattern7		pattern0		
double is larger than an int hence the overflow

12019667multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
pattern8		
a slightly more sophisticated approach with add subtract multiplying divide

12021618multiplying	multiplication
pattern0		
mathematically left shifting is the same as multiplying a number by a power of 2 but as the operation is done only by shifting it is much faster than doing multiplication

12021734versioning	upgrade
pattern0		
an earlier than versioning clause in conflicts prevents dpkg from upgrading or installing the package which declares such a conflict until the upgrade or removal of the conflicted-with package has been completed which is a strong restriction

12022768google-chrome	safari
pattern7	more	
the queue can contain any number of items but for google-chrome safari it is not more than 20

12028378fossil	git
pattern10	workflow less	pattern10	workflow less likely	
4 fewer merge options than in git though the fossil workflow makes merging less likely to occur in the first place.

12029122gruntjs	browserify
pattern3		
i recommend using gruntjs browserify or clientside to rebuild the files using watch rebuilds when files are saved and using that built and optionally minified file in your file

12029504width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
so you can get your image coordinates before moving it and you can compute measure of movement in your ontouchlistener class.now if x coordinate of your image plus horizontal movement that you computed be greater than device width or y coordinate of your image plus vertical movement that you computed be greater than device height your image not move

12032435libs	buildpath
pattern4		
right click build.xml --- build path --- configure buildpath --- select libs tab

12045089udp	tcp
pattern10		pattern10		pattern7	slower	
don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong

12046190wav	ogg
pattern4		
able to read from some sort of audio file i d prefer wav or ogg but i will gladly use less popular formats if need be in memory i ve seen the use of a memfile struct and user-defined i o callbacks

12050599openkm	alfresco

research showed me that mantis is simpler to use over bugzilla so i decided to use mantis but have no idea how to install it.can anyone please tell me what are the steps you need to take in order to install mantis bug tracking system in a small company to track website mobile portal bugs

12056781min	max
pattern7		pattern0		
say my model has min and max properties and i want to ensure that min is less than max

12056781min	max
pattern0		
if i change the min textbox to be greater than max the control would be correctly marked as invalid

12056781min	max
pattern0		
if i now change max to be greater than min the min textbox validation state does not get cleared down presumably because min hasn t changed and therefore doesn t get validated again

12059328width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
if image height is larger than width then scaletypes fitstart fitend and fitcenter don t work

12064628hash	salt
pattern7		pattern10	better	pattern10	better	
salt sha-512 offers a higher level of security and implementing a scheme where you stretch the hash is even better do some high number of iterations of sha-512 - starting with the password+salt of course

12065909union	distinct
pattern4		
i dont use the union syntax you ve got and instead select distinct values from union-all d composite subquery combined

12068233min	max

pattern7	more	
the returned url has a profile photo scaled according to your specified width and height and is cropped more or less to the profile owner s intent

12077960datalist	repeater
pattern0		
you might have better luck with a repeater a datalist or a datagrid

12078050innodb	myisam
pattern0		
and it s rarely faster than innodb since innodb uses row locks and mvcc as opposed to myisam s full-table locks

12079233postgresql	mysql
pattern2		
if you already know sql toss a coin to choose between mysql and postgresql for your first project

12081242profiling	debugging
pattern10		pattern10		
time spent learning a profiling is probably better spent than time writing and debugging micro-benchmarks

12081779hex	binary
pattern7		
the conversion from hex to binary is even simpler since you can simply expand each hex digit into the corresponding binary for example 0xa4 - 1010 0100

12081888hex	binary
pattern10		pattern10		
converting between decimal and hex is more involving and at least to me it s been easier if i have to do it in my head to first convert the decimal into binary representation and then the binary number into hex

12082396udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged

12082396udp	tcp
pattern8		
in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

12082618ubuntu	linux
pattern4		
it s pretty easy to install linux side by side with windows i recommend ubuntu as the linux distro

12083121webclient	httpwebrequest
pattern0		
webclient has a much simpler interface than httpwebrequest and takes care of reading and writing from the streams for you

12084124decltype	auto
pattern8		
in the cases where auto can be used it is more concise than decltype as you don t need to provide the expression from which the type will be inferred

12085301arp	icmp
pattern0		
in addition seeing arp being slower than icmp doesn t necessarily mean icmp isn t deprioritized---it might mean bandwidth is insufficient to hit the limiting threshold

12087049postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
also you can choose mysql or postgresql

12088160innodb	myisam
pattern10		pattern10		
the engine is myisam i ve heard people recommend switching to innodb but many others said myisam is faster with large amounts of data in terms of counting and innodb better for safe transactions

12095666cvs	svn
pattern4		
after years of use i cannot responsibly select svn as a successor to cvs in my organization for a number of reasons

12100342innodb	myisam
pattern0		
3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to innodb which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than myisam has

12100416post	get
pattern0		
this response thus assumes that a request using the post verb would not use the uri to transfer sensitive information or it would be no better than get

12107360gson	jackson
pattern0		
actually genson is faster and has more features than gson and has performances close to jackson but its a lot more lightweight see

12107360gson	jackson
pattern7		
note also that gson comes with less features out of the box than genson or jackson

12108025getter	setter
pattern0		
a public field is not worse than a getter setter pair that does nothing except returning the field and assigning to it

12109797pull	push
pattern7		
i create new branch add those new features and than i once again made pull request but now the features i implemented in the master branch are also in my new branch so my second pull request has more features than i want to push to the original project

12112534post	get
pattern4		
when i click my button i simply get --- no route matches post expenses 3 -- perhaps this is the wrong way to call a method

12150212google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
i ve tested the sample on firefox and it s a bit slower than google-chrome but usable

12152263width	height
pattern0		
this guarantees that the background image will never be smaller or larger than the height but the width is variable to the aspect ratio of their browser

12154530webchromeclient	webviewclient
pattern0		
my observation is that you get the webpage title using webchromeclient in lesser time than using webviewclient

12159596installation	upgrade
pattern0		
this can enable the user to download an upgrade patch that is much smaller than the installation package for the entire product

12159744innodb	myisam
pattern7	better	
myisam has some problems with many recordings and other bugs and innodb is now better

12160352flask	django

having used both flask and django for a bit now i must say that i much prefer flask for most things

12161589orika	dozer
pattern0		
wel i have used both orika and dozer i can say orika is at least 10 times faster than dozer in my project after the replacement

12164478google-chrome	firefox
pattern7	webkit better	
after inspecting the test in ie 8 9 and seeing its results look like those of firefox i think there s an explanation for the google-chrome results i m pretty sure google-chrome webkit has a better optimization in the first version of the test especially the parseint part which gives a better result for parseint there

12164520width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
if left is larger than body width or top is larger than body height

12165072min	max
pattern4		
where i can try to select min max values across the resultset

12165509gson	jackson
pattern4		
some pull parser like gson oder jackson would suit your task better jackson claims to be faster but also heavier jars and more dependencies - i prefer gson

12173020post	get
pattern4		
when i try to save the file i get the error no route matches post customers new

12175964ord	chr
pattern2		
and i have no idea how to use them i ve tried to compare with chr and even use ord but can t really do any comparisons

12178055gridbaglayout	miglayout
pattern10	more	pattern10	more powerful	
miglayout works similarly to gridbaglayout but is more powerful and more expressive

12180219strncmp	strncpy
pattern2		
there are also another set which you specify the maximum number of characters to copy or compare such as strncpy or strncmp

12183240hash	md5
pattern0		
the fact that bcrypt produces hash slower than md5 because of security reasons is also clear for me

12183540sorting	filtering
pattern0		
more than that filtering and sorting by one or more of the attributes will send me to the world of hurt

12184308macports	homebrew
pattern0		
i m using homebrew as it s newer than macports and i don t know enough to choose between them

12187284symfony	kohana

i would go with kohana over symfony because kohana is much easier to understand out of the box and doesn t require any special setup to work with

12189030for-loop	arrays
pattern0		
i ve tried using more than 1 for-loop and to zip the files using an arrays but to no avail

12192975client-side	server-side

to solve this i prefer client-side solutions javascript but if you insist on server-side solution then use sessions

12195348move	drag
pattern4		
if you want a really really simple example to get you started i have re-implemented a couple of basic features all nice and clean no copyright restrictions - left click to select drag to move right click to connect

12196486imperative	declarative
pattern4		
it sounds from this that it would be much easier to use declarative styles all the time but there s usually a steep learning curve for declarative languages and most people prefer imperative

12196486imperative	declarative
pattern7		pattern0		
traditionally there was a huge difference in speed imperative has fewer overheads because it s more directly like the computer works but some more modern compilers of declarative code seem to be in the top few of the speed tables a lot of the time - compiled verses interpreted makes a much bigger difference than imperative vs declarative which is why python etc are often slower even though they re imperative

12199098quaqua	substance

12204690versioning	upgrade
pattern4		
with regards to having a lite versioning you may find apple would rather you use the in app purchase upgrade route and may reject one of your versioning

12204690versioning	upgrade
pattern4		
regardless the in app purchase upgrade would be less crackable than a paid for full versioning

12205716octal	decimal	octal	binary
pattern8		
you ll need to convert binary to another base here i use decimal when writing this code because c doesn t have binary constants which would be ten times more useful than octal constants

12209473width	height
pattern0		
the images have a longer height than width - an aspect ratio similar to a phone on portrait

12213070int	chars
pattern7		pattern7	smaller	
loss of precision means that int has a larger value and chars is smaller so you can t fit something which is to large for that space

12213070int	chars
pattern7	value smaller	
you need to type cast the int into chars but still the precision will be lost because you just can t fit int into chars but if the int value is smaller than loss precision can be ignored

12213157tinyint	varchar
pattern4		
generally i choose int or tinyint for that but if i choose varchar it will be more clear while seeing data directly from the database table or while querying it

12213172int	chars
pattern7		pattern7	lower	
here int is higher datatype and chars is lower datatype.

12215314google-chrome	firefox

delta is there because i have a bigger width than height

12226078width	height
pattern7	smaller	pattern7	smaller	
thumbnail width height is smaller 400

12227679division	multiplication
pattern0		
the above grammar will make function calls a direct part of the expression with higher precedence than multiplication and division

12227848int	chars
pattern4		
use charat int index instead of split which is o n time complexity and compare chars not string s it s faster

12228641google-chrome	firefox

now imagine writing lots of small packets across a network udp may cause congestion whereas tcp is better controlled

12236011strcpy	strncpy
pattern7		pattern0		
using strncpy is considered safier than strcpy because the second one can easily cause buffer overrun

12237615heroku	openshift

so i would have to choose between heroku dotcloud and openshift

12237812move	drag
pattern4		
user can select some images to the screen and be able to select drag move zoom rotate each image

12240556phpstorm	aptana

then create a new avd with the target platform but choose galaxy tab as a skin

12241668width	height
pattern7		
if the window width is above 1280 i would like the value for the height to be 515 and if it is below 1280 i would like the height to be 615 and if the width is less than 480 make the height 715

12241899jtree	jtable	awt	swing
pattern7		
either is capable of doing it but swing is more modern and supports components jtree jtable .. and functionality double-buffering built-in key bindings plafs support for rich text that is missing from the awt apis

12244690width	height	hide	show

if the width gets smaller the height should get larger accordingly to display the whole content

12248473wsimport	wsdl2java
pattern10		pattern10		
wsimport is better don t use wsdl2java

12249000postgresql	informix

12258061gif	png
pattern4		
android prefers png for bitmap image files accepts jpeg and discourages gif

12262435width	height
pattern7		
in safari the large image appears at the correct height and scales proportionally when the height is changed but doesn t scale correctly when the width is changed less then the width of the image

12262553vb.net	vb6
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
quite apart from the fact that the language vb.net is far more feature rich than vb6 the fact that you have developed in vb.net means that you have made extensive use of the .net class libraries including system.security.cryptography that you give as an example

12264751min	max

you can feel like post is more secure than get all you want but it s a false premise

12268798ati	nvidia
pattern10	more	pattern10	more mature	
i decided on nvidia for a couple of reasons while ati might be faster on paper nvidia has a more mature platform and more documentation so it will be possible to get closer to the peak performance on this platform

12273373width	height
pattern7	larger	
this will resize the original png only if its width was larger than 64 pixels or if its height is larger than 10 000 pixels

here i am inserting values min and max id s in a temporary table from another table so that i can then use those values to retrieve my data in the final query.but in the final query where i am specifying the range i.e the line containing select max from rangee and select min from rangee is giving this error.how can i solve it.the values of min and max are returning fine

12285797innodb	myisam
pattern0		
myisam has proved to be faster than innodb for me

12296053for-loop	arrays
pattern0		
so then i think to go with that approach i would end up with a for-loop and loads of add calls but surely that is even worse than the arrays copy isn t it

12297727post	get
pattern0		
i get far more than 50 post

12297727post	get
pattern0		
so is it enough only to use limit to get more than 50 post

pattern0		
- preceeding symbol template is expected to appear exactly minimum min times but not more than max times

12319077tostring	string.format
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
for formatting a single numeric value tostring is marginally more efficient than string.format because string.format has a bunch of overhead to parse the format string out of the curly braces and then pass it to tostring

12320788listview	gridview
pattern7	better	
if a listview or gridview is a better approach i am open to that as well

12322360wxpython	pyqt	wxpython	pygtk
pattern2		
in case of python wxpython documentation leads over pyqt and pygtk whereas in case of ruby ruby-qt4 leads over ruby-gtk2 and wxruby

12323870int	double
pattern7		
you need to use 2 even if the number of bits in your int type is larger than the precision of a double since the number of used bits in the most significant value might only be 1

12325479public	protected
pattern0		pattern0		
oh i see you need a constructor that has more access than protected but less than public

12328679curb	libcurl
pattern0		
that s much easier with a libcurl wrapper like curb like the tin man suggested than dropping to the shell and using libcurl there

12332127hash	md5
pattern0		pattern0		
the resulting page identifiers will also be shorter than md5 hash and will only contain digits so they will be easy to include in url query strings etc

on all of the computers i work with int is faster than unsigned significantly faster than signed chars

12342354width	margin
pattern7		pattern0		
in order for a block level element to be centered on a page you need to provide a width that is smaller than the width of the parent element it is nested in and then set the margin to be auto for the left and right sides

12346041width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
in case height is more than width then you have to resize with height

12347309jlist	jtable
pattern2		
for most complex output to the gui or array is based on java.util.list map hashmap then to use jtable with one column based on abstracttablemodel because jlist has implemented reduced methods or features in compare with jtable

12349097vmware	virtualbox
pattern10		pattern10		
from my experience vmware 5 is faster than virtualbox 4.2 rc3 and has better smp performance

12351581setinterval	settimeout
pattern3		
rather than using a recursive settimeout i recommend using setinterval

12351592setinterval	settimeout
pattern3		
for intervals like polling i recommend using setinterval instead of a recursive settimeout

12359063getter	setter
pattern7	slower	pattern7	slower	
the second quote suggests that without jit using a trivial getter setter is slower than direct field access eg

12364039bmp	png	png	ico

12379123apache	nginx
pattern0		
the remote server is set up to allow very few maximum concurrent clients generally nginx handles many concurrent clients better than apache since it doesn t need to fork a new process for every request so if it becomes an issue you might want to look into switching web servers

12381096salt	md5
pattern0		
this uses pdo and prepared statements which patches the sql injection vulnerability in the most elegant way possible not mysql_real_escape_string and also uses bcrypt for hashing passwords which is infinitely better than one md5 with no salt

12383735union	distinct
pattern4		
a union statement effectively does a select distinct on the results set

12388043des	aes
pattern4		
if you are free to choose the algorithm you might want to choose aes over triple des it s a lot faster and generally considered a more modern cipher

12390680swt	swing
pattern0		
having used it myself in my opinion it s also far nicer than swing in its api more like swt in that respect looks far nicer by default and far more flexible in what it allows you to do

i know you mentioned onchange and onfocus though personally i tend to prefer onkeyup so that values will change as the user is typing

12394439client-side	server-side
pattern4		
i ve scripted server-side but i prefer client-side for the obvious reasons that the experience for the user is generally smoother and there is less load on the server

12397695agda	idris
pattern4		pattern10	more	pattern10	more practical	
i d recommend agda as the better vehicle for getting to grips with the ideas behind dependently typed programming but idris is the more practical option

12397909width	height
pattern0		
what i want to do is that everytime the width of the image is wider than the height of the image i want to rotate the picture by 90 degrees clockwise into landscape layout mode save it on app s documents folder and then present it on the screen - this way the picture of the widescreen tv appears 90 degrees rotated but the image aspect ratio is not totally destroyed

pattern7	better	
while on antiquated hardware myisam was a necessity on modern hardware innodb actually performs better

12412950sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern7		pattern0		
you should also keep in mind that sortedlist performs worse than sorteddictionary during construction if the items are not inserted in already-sorted order although in this particular case it is highly likely that dates are inserted in chronological sorted order which would be perfect

12414229inline	inlining
pattern7		
generally speaking the inline keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about inlining

12416242gif	png
pattern0		
is jpeg format lighter than png or gif

12416387gif	png
pattern7		pattern0		
one thing to note is that gif supports a smaller palette than png - only up to 256 colors

12418192for-loop	arrays
pattern10		pattern10		
it is clear without any performance tests that native javascript for-loop is faster but there is no big difference for small arrays like 10-20 small items

12419618range	infinity
pattern4		
this conversion can lose precision but also lose range resulting in a float zero from a nonzero double and a float infinity from a finite double

12420547strtol	atoi
pattern7		pattern0		
strtol is better than atoi with better error handling

12420697width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
it should look wheter the image width is higher than its height and the opposite and according to that set a height or width and the other value height width should be set proportionally so it won t get stretched

12426434awt	swing
pattern8		
use swing follow the threading rules which are hardly likely to be more onerous than awt and enjoy

12426957gson	jackson

pattern4		
assuming that pids cannot be repeated this is a trivial task put everything in a table select min time max time pid group by pid

12438523int	chars
pattern10	more	pattern10	more readable	
edit but as bali182 said just casting the chars to an int is more readable

12441429memcpy	memmove
pattern10	more	pattern10	more appropriate	
note that the behavior of memcpy is undefined when the memory blocks overlap so memmove is more appropriate here

12443760int	double

instead of working around the 1 label and image you get in a uibutton it s cleaner to start from scratch with a uicontrol and create your tiles

12470268inherited	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
pattern2		
while it is a debated recommendation to favor composition over inherited my view is to ensure that an abstract-class devoid of abstract methods is not simply a convenient container for methods convenient to subclassing but instead that each subclassing could stand in for its superclass

12473470children	parent
pattern4		
according to the sources that s the only form it checks watch how it collects a list of children then matches parent s method names against names of the children

12475056g++	gcc
pattern2		
i am newbie of cmake and i was wondering for a c++ c project in the linux environmental how cmake can choose compilers between gcc and g++

12477194division	multiplication
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
this is because multiplication and division is faster in sse the 80-bit vs 64-bit issue again and that the sse registers are faster to manipulate in the fpu you can only access the top of the stack and rotating the fpu stack is often the slowest operation on a modern processor in fact some have an extra pipeline stage solely for this purpose

12477347strcpy	strncpy
pattern4		
2 prefer strncpy to strcpy -- with strcpy you can exceed the size of the array

12477431swt	swing

go to options tab then select directory option then enter the particular path where your turbo c folder exists

12515354for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
pattern10		pattern10		
you should use a for-loop which is more convenient to loops in an arrays

12516108width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
its a bool value so if the maximum of width or height is greater than real width then you get true

12516127width	height
pattern0		pattern0		
in other words if either maxwidth is greater than the width of or maxheight is greater than the height of it will return true

12517336innodb	myisam

12522504mouse	keyboard
pattern10		pattern10		
since clicking the mouse is significantly more difficult for me than typing i was wanting to make a simple program that would just run in the background and click the mouse for me any time i press a specific key on the keyboard

12522533tablesorter	datatables
pattern0		
one thing you could look into is using tablesorter - which is much simpler than datatables - with a drag and drop plugin like sortable for jquery ui or this

12523545mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
pattern3		
i would also recommend using mouseenter and mouseleave rather than mouseover and mouseout since you will have child elements with your menu

12524462super	self
pattern4		
compare self valueforkey key or self valueforkeypath keypath or just self outletname with the passed in value after the call through to super

12529478nsmutablestring	nsstring
pattern0		
all-in all the reason is that nsmutablestring is able to do more things than nsstring and can do anything nsstring can hence the direction of inheritance

12530092nsmutablestring	nsstring
pattern10		pattern10		
nsstring is more general as it leaves you the oppertunity to create another subclass of it that could add the altering functionality without using the nsmutablestring s implementation why ever you would want that to do

12530442udp	tcp
pattern7		pattern0		
udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

12530495width	height
pattern0		
if the width of the label in interface builder the literal size in interface builder is less than the width of the view at runtime then the height of the container is too large

12530495width	height
pattern0		
if the width of the label in interface builder the literal size in interface builder is greater than the width of the view at runtime then the height of the container is too small and lines of text get cut off

12531573explode	substr
pattern0		
which should at least perform better than explode str_replace and substr solutions

12534273ant	maven
pattern0		
while you could use -cp to javac to add the required dependencies to this compilation you d be far better served by learning ant or maven

12538109hide	show
pattern0		
ironically enough its object model show more details than it hide - good for learning but bad for abstraction

12540569children	parent
pattern7		
now since the pseudo-element is below all of the floated children the parent div happens or better yet seems to contain the floated children as well - which is really what you want

12540800direct3d	direct2d

12571276width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
i want to make an 100x100 pixels thumbnail of it and in this case because the height is less than the width the height should be 100 visible on the new image and the width should keep the aspect ratio of the image

12572736integer	unsigned
pattern0		
an implementation that has no such unsigned type say because pointers are bigger than any integer type won t provide it

12574349min	max
pattern0		
the third one can be proven in a variety of ways but the simplest is to just observe the behaviour of ecatmur s loop when the loop ends input is min but 10 min so if 10 min max input must be less than max

12574479clang	llvm	libstdc++	libc++
pattern0		
libstdc++ does this a lot more than libc++ and the former is the default library for llvm-g++ gcc llvm the latter for clang apple llvm which means a lot of errors will seem to go away when you switch to gcc llvm or just stick with apple llvm and switch your library but your code is still wrong

12575001cpython	pypy
pattern0		
now there are some implementations like pypy rpython which run a static-typing phase and should favor much better than cpython here

i know that sqlite in tests should be fast because it is run in-memory and all that stuff but it is just still much slower than normal postgresql mysql database

12613032int	chars
pattern4		
but to answer your other question in c you can compare chars literals with int

12615409hash	md5
pattern7		pattern0		
it s like complaining that a sha256 hash is bigger than an md5 hash - yep it is but only one of them might slow the attacker down for a while

pattern0		
as you can see the keyup events of numpad5 and numpad6 occured earlier than their keydown event

12625646moq	nmock
pattern7		pattern7		
this is another reason why i d prefer rhinomocks and moq over nmock nmock uses the older expectation style whereas rhinomocks and moq both support the arrange act assert approach where you specify you expected interactions as assertions at the end of the test like this

12626118justmock	typemock
pattern8		
justmock less expensive than typemock but still expensive

12630645monkeyrunner	adb

pattern3		
if you want to test aspects of your application which are exclusively api-like then i d recommend using rspec request specs for that which are essentially integration tests but focused on one-step request response. you can use get requests and analyze the response using capybara matchers

12658326gridbaglayout	miglayout
pattern7		
edit for clarification miglayout is probably easier to use than gridbaglayout but if you get familiar with gridbaglayout it s not that hard to use and it doesn t require a download since it s part of the core java library

but this popular wsgi benchmark says eventlet is way slower than gevent

12669971eventlet	gevent	libevent	epoll
pattern4		
gevent intentionally depends on and is coupled to libev libevent previously while eventlet defines independent reactor interface and implements particular adapters using select epoll and twisted reactor behind it

12677008punctuation	words
pattern4		
is there a better way to match words that contain punctuation

12678802codeigniter	yii
pattern4		
whether you choose codeigniter or yii the basic integration will be the same

12679024hex	binary
pattern7		
those hex values seem a bit odd they re powers of two in decimal but in any case 0x128 the 0x is a standard prefix for hex numbers is the larger of the numbers in magnitude and its binary representation is 100101000

12682214padrino	ruby-on-rails
pattern0		
but i don t know anything about sinatra and padrino is the footprint and speed really that better than ruby-on-rails

12684082division	multiplication
pattern4		
i am posting the following code as a counter-example to all the answers in this thread and indeed all over stackoverflow and elsewhere that recommend multiplication followed by truncation followed by division

12685001mouseover	mouseout
pattern7		pattern0		
the mouseover animation is 200ms longer than the mouseout so if you mouseover and mouseout in less than 200ms total the animations run in parallel and the mouseover one finishes last leaving the color red

12686116padrino	ruby-on-rails
pattern0		
sinatra and padrino are not automatically faster than ruby-on-rails

12686665filtering	grouping
pattern4		
i need to retrieve the value of the first select grouping to filtering the data

12688604min	max
pattern0		
you can think of a window or stage as an independent viewport into the scene which can be sized larger or smaller than the min and max specifications of the scene root

12689334dbcontext	objectcontext
pattern0		
in 6.7 a graph it shown that states that the performance of a objectcontext linq query is better than dbcontext linq query

12693178thin	webrick
pattern7	easier	
3 use thin instead of webrick - thin seems easier to configure for ssl

12697756children	parent
pattern4		
it s too hard to scroll pages to match children to parent even wrapped with tags

12699536int	chars
pattern7		pattern0		
since int is bigger than chars an pointer could require less information to indicate what it points to

12710011min	max
pattern0		
take the first value from the list then examine each other element of the list selecting lower higher values as temporary min max

12713429int	double
pattern7	more	
if you need only integrals - use int if you need more precision use non-integrals double takes more space in memory and since you don t have any specific requirements concerning precision float seems to be the most reasonable choice

12715054r-tree	quadtree
pattern10		pattern10		
on the other hand the wikipedia article on r-tree seems more specifically targeted towards mapping than the k-d tree or quadtree

12715775punctuation	words
pattern0		
i need to replace all words with 3 or more letters with the words thing while retaining capitalization and punctuation

12716635width	height
pattern7	greater	
visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero

12718592division	multiplication
pattern8		
it can get a bit more complex with multiplication division but the main downside is performance

12722022awt	swing
pattern4		
if you can you should favor swing components of awt components

12723426glassfish	resin
pattern0		
glassfish seems to be slower than resin

12725137apache	nginx
pattern0		
good at serving static files it s slower than apache and nginx

12725137apache	nginx
pattern10		pattern10		pattern7	smaller	
apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

12729127notepad++	sublimetext
pattern4		pattern8		
i prefer sublimetext because it s a little more customizable than notepad++ but they re both great options and lighter than dreamweaver

12729356int	double
pattern7	wider	
you don t need an explicit cast going from int to double because double is wider

12730722pysimplesoap	suds
pattern8		
you might be more comfortable with suds pysimplesoap or flask-enterprise to consume the soap data

12733538post	get
pattern0		
however you cannot do anything more than get the content -- you cannot add headers cannot use post

12737120pop-up	dialog
pattern0		
the issue i m having is that when the height of the page is smaller than the pop-up it opens a dialog instead of a pop-up

12739978draggable	droppable
pattern7		pattern0		
the problem you outlined is that the droppable is allowing more than 1 draggable item to be placed inside of it

12748301folder	directory
pattern4		
but when i click this input it s available only to select file not folder when i click on any folder just open it and not get this path or directory it must select any file image text file etc but i need to select folder only to get directory for any place on client machine

12758060piston	tastypie
pattern0		
i recommend to take a look on tastypie which turned out to work even nicer than piston it helps you also with things like versioning your api and mamange multiple endpoints nicly

12760627int	chars
pattern0		
by the way it returns an int with 1 more int than chars in msg last int is zero

12761582width	height
pattern7		pattern0		
others because the width is larger than the height doesn t fit properly.that s why i crop them they must be centered in order to make sence

12769452int	chars
pattern0		pattern0		
the good thing about this macro is that it should work with c89 and c99 compilers 1ll can be replaced with 1l and long long can be replaced with just long and ll with l of course if your c89 compiler does not have the extended long long type from c99 and it also correctly supports types smaller than int chars and short

12771749highcharts	fusioncharts
pattern4		
i d recommend highcharts or fusioncharts

12772542jasmine	qunit
pattern10		pattern10		
performing this asynchronous testing is actually possible in qunit but is handled better in another javascript testing framework jasmine js

12781655flask	django
pattern10		pattern10		pattern8		
but a friend told me to begin with flask as it s simpler and will help me when i start learning django as django is more complicated than flask

12783969getter	setter
pattern0		
getting and setting is probably 2 orders of magnitude slower than normal getter or setter methods

12784894mouse	keyboard
pattern4		
this is one place mouse may actually beat keyboard especially if the current mouse cursor is far from your copy target or if you want to select multiple lines with partial start line or end line

12786755division	modulo
pattern7		
programmers like to use this property to speed up programs because it s easy to chop off some number of bits but performing a modulo is much harder it s about as hard as doing a division

12789094innodb	myisam	postgresql	mysql
pattern4		
the first using transactions is most likely to help but i m not sure if it works on myisam tables with innodb it does a very good job - i only use those when i m forced to use mysql i prefer postgresql

12791808installation	upgrade
pattern0		
does an eclipse installation perform slower after the upgrade

12792176goto	break
pattern0		
to any seasoned developer of a c-like language break will both read better as well as provide a cleaner solution than goto

12792287children	parent
pattern4		
you could use body as a parent element and select children of it using the child selector

12794377goto	break
pattern0		
but break is no better or worse than goto

12800316x86	64bit
pattern10		pattern10		
to me the path without x86 is also more visually appealing and indicates that it s a modern application - adapted for 64bit operation where necessary

12800438x86	mips
pattern8		
the wording in your question seems to suggest you don t care as much that the output is mips but rather you want the output to be less complex than x86

12801051for-loop	loops
pattern7		
secondly you will find a for-loop is easier than a do loops for implementing the logic as you don t need to keep track of loops counter manually

12802642ssl	https
pattern7	more	
ssl the s in https has more states but since it follows a fairly linear progression does not really have any kind of complex diagram

12805771allocator	stl
pattern4		
i d like to compare stl strings that are allocated with different allocator an ordinary std string with a string using a custom stl allocator

12807370hash	salt
pattern7		
this salt is nothing more than a random arbitrary string that you concatenate to the passwords and it will make your hash password unique

12807708bash	zsh
pattern4		
you can check user shell in etc passwd and change it with chsh -s path to new shell - list of allowed shells is available in etc shells - but make sure to pick bash zsh also note that links like sh- bash will not work as bash changes behavior based on the name that was invoked

12811442inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
pattern0		
usually i subclassing the stock cocoa classes customize to my needs and if i need custom methods in more than one subclassing i will declare a category on the superclass rather than relying on inherited to provide my custom behavior

12817803x86	64bit
pattern7		
pax s aslr implementation for 64bit x86 machines is much stronger than linux s default 64bit aslr implementation

12818672xna	spritebatch
pattern4		
you could also use silverlight 5 which has a 3d api and audio api that matches xna and has a toolkit available that adds 2d xna functionality like spritebatch and more making the majority of the xna api available

12821478spaces	delimiter
pattern4		
choose delimiter and indicate spaces as the delimiter

12822575jruby	mri
pattern10		pattern10		
i ve noticed however that jruby is more sensitive to memory leaks than mri

12825810kmz	gpx
pattern0		
kmz loads much quicker than gpx and can be integrated with the google maps api as a kml layer

12828261versioning	upgrade
pattern10	faster	pattern10	faster	
i know that probably issuing dotnetfx45_full_setup.exe q will have no bad effect if installing on a system that already has versioning 4.5 but i still would like to not install the upgrade if the upgrade already exists faster and less problems

12829930google-chrome	firefox
pattern7		pattern0		
google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

12833405noexcept	throw
pattern10	more	pattern10	more powerful	
noexcept was added rather than just removing all throw specifiers other than throw because noexcept is more powerful

12836547post	put
pattern7	nicer	
also you can send a text only to given client determined by the url it can be post but put looks nicer

12838110int	chars
pattern0		
this is probably due to the arithmetic conversion rules first any int type of conversion rank less than int eg unsigned chars will promote to int or unsigned int

12839957tstringlist	tlist
pattern0		
i believe it is much much faster than using tlist descendant or tstringlist

12843154cpython	ironpython
pattern0		pattern0		
also on implementations like jython or ironpython could be a lot slower than with cpython

12855045udp	tcp
pattern0		
in a native application i would use udp for the most data player position ... because it s way faster than tcp and it s uncritical when it is lost

12855605integer	unsigned
pattern7	type rank greater	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then

12857872google-chrome	firefox
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	
in internet explorer the tabspace has a width of approximately 10 spaces while in firefox and google-chrome it is more like 4 spaces

12858311getdate	dateadd
pattern4		
select dateadd s -1 dateadd hh 1 dateadd minute datediff minute 0 getdate 60 60 0

12858947mallet	lda
pattern4		
this paper goes into this in depth but if you use a standard lda package i d recommend mallet they should have this functionality already

12859396for-loop	arrays
pattern7		pattern0		
next i can use 3rd 4th and 5th level of arrays means more than for-loop statement will be assign

12859682min	max
pattern0		
this is an option which can be expanded very easily to test more than simple min max

12862860min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
e. not an input meaning end of execution check whether the value is greater than max or less than min

12864620versioning	upgrade
pattern7	media longer	
after recent upgrade to latest wordpress versioning media uploads no longer work

12865406for-loop	loops
pattern7		pattern0		
here the for-loop header takes actually more time than loops body thus profiling results could be distorted.

12867428cpython	pypy
pattern7		pattern0		
cpython runs on more architectures than pypy and has been successfully adapted to run in embedded architectures in ways that may be impractical for pypy

12868323exponent	modulo
pattern0		
note that the private exponent is limited to value of the modulo but may sometimes be up to a few bytes smaller than the modulo

12872068width	height
pattern0		
if the width of the image is greater than its height landscape

12872068width	height
pattern0		
otherwise if the height of the image id greater than its width

12873077postgresql	mysql
pattern10		pattern10		
i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options

12876876post	get
pattern10		pattern10		
this blog post is more detailed but unfortunately does also not mention where to get the product key

12887041children	parent
pattern4		
all select parent that have children but have no children with non-male gender

12887457punctuation	words
pattern4		
if you prefer words to punctuation you can also spell it push

12887926sortedlist	sorteddictionary
pattern0		
for your purpose you would probably be better off with a sorteddictionary class or perhaps sortedlist

12890768min	max
pattern0		pattern0		
make sure any of the chart s value is not beyond greater than the max or lower than the min the limits you are setting

12891191lxml	beautifulsoup
pattern10	more	pattern10	more	pattern10	more equivalent	pattern10	more equivalent	
between lxml and beautifulsoup lxml is more equivalent to nokogiri

12892374jaydata	datajs
pattern4		
since the test database is exposed with the odata protocol you can do crud operations from any ajax tool but i recommend datajs or jaydata

12896533hash	md5
pattern0		
once you md5 hash it you have to map that to the token that is less than that hash

12896810client-side	server-side
pattern0		
server-side checks are better than client-side

12898057youtube	vimeo
pattern4		
i m trying to match youtube and vimeo urls on javascript

12899440google-chrome	firefox
pattern0		
transparency is also an issue however google-chrome seems to handle all three better than firefox
