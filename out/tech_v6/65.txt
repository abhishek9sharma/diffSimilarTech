width	margin
with the float + margin technique from projapati the flow is fine â but having one of the 2 divs a fixed width in pixels and the other one take up the rest of the container width is not possible â you can specify percents or width in pixels for both divs but there is no way to tell a div to take up the rest of it also if you make the page very narrow the right div falls down to the following line indicating that these divs are only provisionally next to each other

for that i must use compass and now i have to decide which other thing accelerometer or gyroscope

is it more accurate to use trueheading from compas and use gyroscope s values instead of accelerometer s

9304160
accelerometer	gyroscope
is it clever to combine both accelerometer and gyroscope with trueheading

9304160
accelerometer	gyroscope
if i take the first road i don t have to write titanium module for fetching the gyroscope data since it gives me only accelerometer data and i can use this on 3gs iphone also

width	height
if i set the height width with css the space the image element takes up in the page changes but the svg graphic still renders behind everything with no positioning or z-index set

9304815
width	height
if i set the height width via tag attributes the image is simply cropped to fit those dimensions

i didn t spend as much time looking at flask as i had spent looking at web2py or django but what i saw looked nice

9305304
try-catch	exception-handling
as a typical solution to this what i have seen is to wrap in a try-catch the code that can throw the exception-handling and to have an event handler push the exception-handling to a thread that will be able to handle the exception-handling appropriately log notify the user terminate all of the above

9305721
post	get
i hope this helps to get you going with retrieving values form form post data

9305721
post	get
fwiw i believe mvc is the same - controllers should also have the httpcontext object available that will contain all of this data because under the hood http post get does not care if you are using java .net mvc or whatever in order to read the values submitted by a user

9305750
datalist	repeater
i would agree with sebastian why not use a repeater or datalist to bind the data

9305954
for-loop	arrays
simple way is store the value1 and value2 in arrays and use a for-loop like

9305957
integer	unsigned
how to find the number of bits set in an unsigned integer when it is allowed to iterate the loop same number of times as the number of bits set if 3 bits are set you can iterate the loop only 3 times

in fact this is the out-of-the-box functionality you would get if you were using jsf with a rich component framework like icefaces or primefaces

9306245
client-side	server-side
since you don t want to repeat yourself it s very tempting to put all your validation on one side or the other but there are tradeoffs either way and it is true that server-side validation is going to be slower than client-side

9306245
client-side	server-side
in point of fact i actually start with validation in the database as much as possible then in the server-side code then client-side because this way even if my app blows up i don t have invalid data sticking around to worry about

django	web2py
once i discovered what a pita it was going to be to do all the modeling in web2py i immediately looked at django to see what it had to offer

9306662
super	abstract

9306695
getter	setter
in addition starting with jackson 1.9 if this is the only annotation associated with a property it will also cause cause the whole property to be ignored that is if setter has this annotation and getter has no annotations getter is also effectively ignored

9306695
getter	setter
so if only getter is to be ignored other accessors setter or field would need explicit annotation to prevent ignoral usually jsonproperty

9306710

9306804
entity-relationship	diagram
the entity-relationship diagram are the motivation why you are considering a web app to replace or supplement your current thick app

the redis feature of having hashes as its data types fit the description of our comments data structure - constantly growing but sometimes modified or deleted - but we do not need a pure in-memory database we don t wish to dedicate so much ram when the data can be persisted to the disk - otherwise this would be a good fit for our problem

in my case it is caused due to setting the taskoption method to post while building the task while my handler only serves get requests

9306944

edit after checking the taskqueue.add docs it appears that the default method used if the method is not specified as in your code example is post while your handler appear to only able to serve get requests

9306944

9311104
post	get
your form in jsp probably uses a method get post

9311141
google-chrome	safari
note useragent for safari will include safari but not google-chrome when google-chrome will include both

but inside a gtk application you should use cairo instead

9311191

that way it plays on ios many android devices and google-chrome safari and ie9 via html5 - firefox and opera users will see the flash-player

9311197

not sure if its obvious what i m trying to do but i want to allow any authenticated user read-only access to the repository but limit put post etc to only 1 particular authenticated user

setcontentview	findviewbyid
and check is image is ready to use findviewbyid like you call the method and after do setcontentview or if it really is imageview etc

9311322
viewdidload	viewwillappear
moving the call to another callback like viewwillappear or viewdidload did no good the keyboard won t show up in the first place

9311419
super	extends
the error you get spurs from the fact that super only works with new-style classes classes that explicitly extends object

9311419
super	extends
so even if you fixed the error allowing test and print to extends object super would not work in this case

9311453
post	get
set ajax type get maybe work by default data send type is post

9311485
entities	entitymanager
is there any way to tell wich entities belong to which entitymanager

9311491

9311500
google-chrome	firefox
i have a link in my facebook page tab app which should send the client to the app canvas page works fine in google-chrome but just isn t going in ie or firefox

9311514
int	boolean
by that i mean there is no automatic conversion from int to boolean as with c

9311518
google-chrome	firefox
check the sample at and using firefox google-chrome inspect element on the prev button - adjust it to use y instead of m and you will see how it works

9311537
int	boolean
the reason for that is that in c there is no specific type boolean - instead any non-0 int evaluates to a boolean true

9311537
int	boolean
in java assigns 20 to a and returns the final result of evaluation as int value 20 however type boolean is expected - hence you re getting a compile-time error about the incompatible types

9311563
hide	show
my goal is to show hide on-screen software keyboard on some event and intercept input from that keyboard

9311563
hide	show
i found out that soft keyboard can be show for some view class descendant but i don t need any visual representation of the text edit widget on screen just the ability to programatically show hide soft keyboard with input interception

9311570
google-chrome	firefox
edit this now works in ie9 google-chrome and firefox

9311672

when accessed through getter setter at least there is one place where i can do some checks

9311742
for-loop	arrays
i was doing a simple function loading two arrays using a for-loop

9311777
width	height
took a look at your link and that space below your slider is made due to the fact that your images are not scaling according to the width height you specified in your script and also due to some spacing on the .galleria-stage class

9311803
for-loop	loops
it s because the foreach method doesn t use the enumerator it loops through the items with a for-loop

9311808
pull	push
if all the setting of gitolite were done right you are be able to push and pull data to the server without direct using ssh command

9311821
subtract	addition
is there an api which handles decimal arithmetic compare subtract and addition in javascript

9311826
pdcurses	ncurses
your best bet would be to use ncurses for unix systems and pdcurses for windows

9311831
try-catch	exception-handling
as an extreme example i know of one such application where pretty much every single method was wrapped in a try-catch block with a call to an static exception-handling handler method which threw a generic myapplicationexception type

9311887
pop-up	dialog
this usually results in the pop-up dialog on the console of the server when a user is logged in to ask the user who is assumed to be a developer what debugging tool he she would like to use to start debugging the problem

9311977

9312023
bison	jison
i m using jison a javascript equivalent of bison and i m having the following precedence problem

9312027
width	height
it probably isn t able to read and height and width data from the tabs

9312055
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
first of all include these frameworks to your project audiotoolbox coreaudio mediaplayer and avfoundation

9312108
oncreate	setcontentview
use requestwindowfeature window.feature_no_title in your oncreate before you call setcontentview to set programmatically

it has a draggable droppable and sortable feature

9312348
hide	show
is there any way exists to re-align the controls when i hide show something dynamically

9312385
prepare	execute
my inclination is to think that since the statement which fetched this rs was execute earlier in the process this rs will now be blind to the changes made by my prepare statements

9312389
inherited	properties
when a derived class inherited the properties of n base classes each with one virtual function while constructing the virtual table for the derived class why the compiler constructs an individual virtual table for each base class

9312429

this issue is only present in safari i m using 5.1.3 and not google-chrome or firefox

it saves you work on both ends having to put the two resultant values into the proper post or get variables to send to php

9312444
chown	chmod
if your user is different from the user the server is running as apache httpd www-data for instance then you must either add yourself to the server group and chmod all the files so group permissions are set to read and write or chown all the files to you chown -r user user and add your server user to your group

9312642
pseudo-class	visited
i have a little problem with the visited pseudo-class and the text-shadow property in css

9312642
google-chrome	safari
hover works fine on google-chrome safari but the visited link keeps the first text-shadow property

9312658
hide	show
for this i have tried some ways like enabling internal keyboard show hide notifications but these notification only gets called when external keyboard is not connected and this is not helping me

9312664
try-catch	exception-handling
since every exception-handling makes bundle activation pointless this try-catch block is really unnecessary so it s easier to throw java.lang.exception

9312678
hide	show
and in addition you won t be able to define opacity or show hide the links if the base a selector has done one of those things

9312754
entities	entitymanager
it has now been understood that the real goal is to have two entitymanager point to the same set of entities but somehow indicate that each entitymanager should limit itself to a certain set of those entities

9312754
entities	entitymanager
the only thing that s2 really offers is the ability to bind an entitymanager to all the entities in one or more bundles using the mapping attribute

9312756
min	max
reason performance increase since max and min would cause twice the iteration of the array which is in my case 7.5 million or more numbers

9312797
children	parent
in relative layout you always need specify the location of each child with respect to the parent or the between the children

9312857
ubuntu	linux
it produces pdfs with -djava.awt.headless true to avoid exceptions due missing x11 window server under linux ubuntu as well but the text items are not searchable and sometimes are even coded as images

9312879
google-chrome	firefox
inside google-chrome it works fine but in firefox or ie it shows only a link to facebook site

9312896
min	max
the min max fields creates a square and center lat long is for center point of the square

9312899
width	height
the first ints are the width and height of the image the byte arrays are in order alpha red green and.

9312899
width	height
blue.the width and height are pretty straightforward +getwidth int and +getheight int from the image object as you done and others are earned by convertintarraytobytearrays

9312934
width	height
i tried setting the height or width but that just cuts the stars but doens t resize them

9312960

9313255
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome looks good 1

9313276
width	margin
i try to use the code above to set the width of equal it s content and then center it with margin 0 auto

9313328
ant	maven
since you re asking for the purposes of exposing the report to jenkins hudson i m assuming you have a maven ant etc build that you re able to run

9313328
ant	maven
so all you need to do is add the ant maven junit task plugin to your build and have it execute your groovy junit tests just as you d do if they were written in java

9313343
webkit	gecko
if not chances are your page is in quirks mode and webkit just violates the standard slightly more in that mode than gecko does

9313407
versioning	upgrade
this is how we communicate to users what is in the latest versioning and in development if they upgrade

9313413
pull	push
they could just use hg push and hg pull and things would just work

the problem is that i need a timeout to give the .html function time to set width and height although .html should be synchronous

9313550

first inet_init registers the built in network protocols by calling proto_register then it calls inet_register_protosw to initialise the protocols then it initialises the various inet modules ip tcp icmp etc

9313551
getter	setter
-we are using beans mostly getter setter and dtos

9313554
width	height
the viewpager is fed by a pageradapter that provides a linearlayout to the viewpager which has layoutparams of wrap_content on both height and width

9313556
width	height
i usually do this by setting the width and height to wrap_content and then tweaking the layout_weight on the imagebutton widgets so that each button takes up the same amount of space

9313569
width	height
try calling before setting the position and getting the width height

9313580
spaces	delimiter
i have a textfile of rows of values each field delimiter by a single spaces

9313603
x86	64bit
you will need to ensure that you .net application target platform is set to x86 or the program will run in a 64bit process and will not be able to load a 32bit dll

9313604
textview	imageview
you do not need separate imageview and textview you can use button and image to it using

9313604
width	height
never use absolute values in width height of any views so use wrap_content

9313606
portrait	landscape
however a video shot in the app our own app in portrait orientation ends up in landscape on facebook

9313626
draggable	droppable
for the moving element that is being dragged it uses some basic code based loosely on how jquery ui s draggable and droppable libraries do this as described here - by placing the dragged object in the global namespace while it is being dragged and then accessing it from there

9313687
capistrano	bundler
i have a ruby on rails 3.2 app using bundler and capistrano for deployment

9313697
google-chrome	safari
it only seems to work in google-chrome safari

9313715

it would appear that the viewpager implementation does not measure the children views but just sets the viewpager to be one standard view based on what the parent is passing in

9313772
codeigniter	kohana
queries in mvc frameworks like zend kohana and codeigniter should be done in the model class

when i drag my form to the border in question keeping my click pressed it is working i see my height and width changing but when i release my mouse the width and height go back to their default values

9314188
google-chrome	firefox
kinda like what firefox s eventbug or google-chrome s inspector do

9314201
width	height
my dilemma is that the div s height does not resize when the width is shortened and the content spills out the bottom

i ve so far been successful in adding subtract dividing and multiplying two values by just popping them twice to local variables performing the operation and then pushing back the completed value

9314229
folder	directory
i have an if statement that checks if a directory exists and if it does it copies that folder to the specified location

i want this button to be triggered by both mouse click and keyboard pressed

9314287

9314404
factors	matrix
by default the data was getting converted into factors while converting from matrix to data.frame

9314468
decimal	ieee
assuming ieee 754 standard floating point numbers which are commonplace nowadays you get roughly 7.22 digits of accuracy for a float and 15.95 for a double so aim for 7 digits after the decimal point for a float ï constant and 15 for double to be on the safe side

9314480
post	get
in your case you want to get the height of 1 element and apply it to the other there are other jquery solutions to do this also - this one is designed originally to calculate the height of 2 elements and re-size a third as stated in the blog post

when i try and post your url to facebook i get the following message

9314607
width	height
set their width and height as normal

9314626
google-chrome	firefox
the error message itself is rather confusing but by default cross-domain ajax requests are blocked by ie but do not appear to be so by other browsers - or at least google-chrome and firefox will function to that effect

9314632
post	get
this is pseudo-code but you would have to know the actual cell based on the index this should be enough to get you started could you also post the code behind of the event you are trying to code the button change in.

9314641
min	max
besides the reasons specified by remus there is less practical need to support min and max

9314641
min	max
unlike count or sum max and min are fast to calculate - you are all set after just one lookup

9314661
width	height
each column would have equal width because your samples are equidistant in time a height of say the average of the two samples and an area of width height

9314672
put	get
you can put an id on the radiobuttons while generating then generate the javascript to get them by id and put them into a variable

floating-point	integer
in the end this really has nothing to do with whether it s an integer or floating-point

folder	directory
when i put the user_login.php in the root directory everything shows up fine but when i put it in the folder for my admin section none of the html stuff shows up

9314958

you are checking if the post has thumbnail the problems is that you put wrong code in else statement you have to put something like

9319428
getter	setter
perhaps you should add your class as an owner of the dependency property and override the getter and setter there

9319432
post	get
update i ve pretty much done the script now i ll post the full script once i get over this last hurdle

9319450

does salt need to be random to secure a password hash

9319510
post	get
since this is vba i d use com to call xmlhttprequest but use it in synchronous manner as not to upset vbaâ s single threaded execution environment a sample class that illustrates a post and get request in this manner follows

9319538
google-chrome	firefox
tried both google-chrome and firefox google-chrome is much worse normally a 2nd or 3nd link clicking will trigger

9319555
pull	push
speaking in git terms these changes could be merged together without any conflict but is it possible to push changes in one child managedobjectcontext childcontext save up to the parentmanagedobjectcontext parent performblock parent save and pull it down in another different child managedobjectcontext

9319572
getter	setter
or you could remove the sythesize line from your implementation if you don t plan on needing the setter getter methods

9319582
getter	setter
you can always write getter and setter

9319586
google-chrome	firefox
if i don t specify a height my divs size properly in google-chrome and firefox but in ie7 it only displays a thin background and the content overflows

9319588
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
also the filtering sorting grouping etc..

9319619
put	get
the scripts create output.php with permissions 644 no execute and only owner can write and i am unable to manually change the permissions to 777 - although i would prefer to get a way that allows the scripts to create it - so i can empty the folder periodically for backup reasons and not have to remember to put it back in etc.

9319636
internationalization	localization
see also internationalization and localization

9319646
visualvm	jstat
how can i get my mbeans and cpu usage to show up in visualvm when seen through jstat

9319657
getter	setter
by always using the setter and getter methods for a variable you can avoid releasing an object and referencing the instance variable later when it may not be safe

9319737
min	max
this code is not complete of course it doesn t check for the max min values of the pages and there s no way of replace the letter but it should point you in the right direction

9319758
superclass	subclassing
shouldn t i be able to do this when subclassing extends superclass

9319829
udp	tcp
datagramsocket are by definition connection-less -- here s a good page about the differences between udp and tcp for posterity

9319863
std	ostream
of course instead of std cout you can use any ostream

9319911
post	get
to get a feeling of using solver foundation with f# take a look at these interesting blog post

9319931
128bit	64bit
1 neon instructions can only load and store entire registers 64bit 128bit at a time to and from memory

9319943
getter	setter
what you may wish to do is make color and orange implement an interface named either nameholder if you want to expose both a getter and a setter or namesetter if you just want to expose the setter

9319977
for-loop	loops
i also changed the for in loops to a normal for-loop

9319980
background-color	transparency
for modern browsers i can use background-color transparency but ie6 doesn t support background-color transparency

9320003
easymock	unitils
i know there are many options out there for java unit testing including dbunit easymock unitils etc

9320035
google-chrome	firefox
everything vertically aligns fine in ie7+ firefox google-chrome etc

9320035
google-chrome	firefox
everything remains vertically aligned in firefox google-chrome even ie7 but for some reason ie8 goes screwy

9320167
vim	emacs
install emacs vim and eclipse+pydev

9320210
width	height
you could then use the left top width and height of the clipping rectangle once the position is chosen to actually do the crop in-memory

9320214
width	height
the example for the rectangle then went on to use width and height

9320228
post	get
ajax get post requests were returning null in ie

9320257
width	height
the problem is that a rectangle is not a square - you also cannot even say that a square is a rectangle because this causes a lot of problems too since a rectangle usually offers methods to independently set width and height - this would be constrained by a square - this is a classic violation of the liskov substition principle

9320257
getter	setter
from a rectangle class assuming getter and setter methods exist for

9320257
width	height
both width and height

9320258
inherited	properties	width	height
you should invert the inherited and you will discover that rectangle just have width and height and square has an additional properties called size

9320268
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop skips the last element in the datasource arrays

9320284
width	height
the key here is the border-radius being equal to the width and height of the ball

9320301
resharper	justcode
plugins like resharper coderush and justcode should be able to juggle the method between classes

9320320
rss	feed
i m trying to import the last 5 posts from a wordpress rss feed and show them on my site

9320343
stdout	stderr
btw though this is ugly it is basically how stdin stdout and stderr are #defined in most implementations in fact all the implementations i have seen

9320356
children	parent
the correct solution is for square and rectangle to be siblings children of shape not parent child

9320371
getter	setter
for now you unfortunately need to declare all getter and setter by hand

9320407
cloudant	couchdb
but the couchdb community is helpful #couchdb and luckily there are companies out there cloudant iriscouch that offer services from free to big business

9320498
profiling	debugging
obviously you would want to run your profiling against a debugging or staging build rather than your production system

9320505
qobject	qnetworkaccessmanager
the parameter in the qnetworkaccessmanager constructor is only needed to specify a qobject based parent which will be responsible for cleaning up deleting your object later and isn t necessary if you plan to call delete on it yourself

9320505
put	get
i m not quite sure what you are referring to by never loads or where you put a printf but in order to get anything back you need to actually keep the qnetworkreply pointer that is returned by the call to get

9320507
width	height
you may need to set the width and height too like

9320511
accessor	properties
the code can then call the object s accessor for the properties

9320511
accessor	properties
the simplest way to do that is to omit nonatomic which is how most people reflexively declare their properties from the properties declaration which will cause the properties accessor to be atomic

9320528
try-catch	exception-handling
i can see that you re not interested in exception-handling handling which is fine for now for a program of this scale but there are more visually-pleasing and readability-increasing solutions such as merging the consecutive try-catch blocks into one or simply declaring the function to possibly throw

9320559
screens	tablet
this means tablet and phones with screens size 5.1in+

9320560
rss	feed
i m adding some custom itunes podcast tags to a rss feed

9320564
public	protected
convention for exception serialization in .net is to mark the serialization constructor protected rather than public

9320604
switching	screens
you can sniff for the screens size and using an if statement if binary or a switching otherwise to set the orientation of the view manually

9320668
profiling	debugging
in ad hoc builds i see the application didregisterforremotenotificationswithdevicetoken event called but not when i use a debugging build using a developer provisioning profiling

9320669
jtextpane	jeditorpane
edit i found in an old thread that mentions the usage of the property endoflinestringproperty which makes sense since the jtextpane extends jeditorpane which uses a document

9320701
letter-spacing	font-size
you can use the css letter-spacing property in combination with font-size for starters.

9320712
width	height
increase width and height

9320788
opscenter	nodetool
i can t think of anything you d want nodetool for that opscenter doesn t do better though

9320870
width	height
it s width height top and left properties are animated and it is given position relative

9320876
google-chrome	firefox
now i copy this same svg i upload it to a remote host and both google-chrome and firefox render xml code

9320892
width	height
i think you opened lightbox first and then you can t fill it up gently with post response since lightbox had width and height already

9320926
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
however nsmanagedobject inherits from nsobject

9320926
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
it is not possible to use instances of direct subclasses of nsobject or any other class not inheriting from nsmanagedobject with a managed object context

9320934
opera	firefox
the problem is quite clear there - webkit interprets the 20 padding as 20 of the parent s content box while firefox and opera interpret it as 20 of the parent s total box including the parent s padding

9320943

i want the parent all the children even if they don t have female grandchildren or don t have any grandchildren and only the female grandchildren

explode	implode
now you can explode the fields or make an implode into a comma separate value to form a csv

9321051
integer	unsigned
from the nsarray documentation we can see that the count method returns a nsuinteger which is an unsigned integer

9321051
integer	unsigned
by subtracting 1 from an unsigned 0 we end up with the largest possible unsigned integer you can actually get

9321066
getter	setter
it s silly that it doesn t do this already and also that it has specific getter and setter for pretty much every primitive type and a few different object types instead of generic ones that just work in terms of object or at worst number string and parcelable in my opinion

9321074
libxml2	libxslt
i installed and linked libxml2 and libxslt via homebrew

9321149
g++	gcc
and compiled it with gcc not g++

this question has some relation to this post i made recently drag a uiview part-way then it move on its own

9321223
post	get
i got the get and post part working as long as there is network connectivity and as long as the server is up and running

9321230
post	get
when sending a request via datasource.get is it possible to send via post and not get

9321238
children	parent
since children elements will inherit what you set in their parent you can do this

with a disk loaded and the code fixed to use an unsigned short for speed it reports dev disk2 as a cd with a speed of 4234 kb s

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the zoom effect that i described above works great in firefox and safari but on google-chrome the media queries do not register on zoom

9321304
post	get
as far as i know when the view post back the data mvc framework uses the id of form controls to map them with the parameters of an action of your controller.maybe that s why you can t get the right data

9321327
put	get
to put long story short my question is - can this be made to work on windows the way it should work or is it a waste of effort even to try it to get it to work

9321333
background-repeat	background-image
try applying the background-image and background-repeat rules to body instead of #wrapper

9321422
stdout	stderr
when writing a daemon i want to close stdin stdout and stderr for good daemon behavior

9321422
stdout	stderr
subsequent opening of files require the same properties as the old stdin stdout and stderr because their fileno-s got re-opened

9321422
stdout	stderr
this may appear similar to how can i reinitialize perl s stdin stdout stderr

9321422
stdout	stderr
but there the accepted solution was to close stdin stdout and stderr like i do

min	max
you could extract the individual year month day hour minute and second values from your min and max using either the native java or lotus datetime methods and then build the dates in your query using date year month day hour minute second

9321747
post	get
what you are experiencing is php s magic quotes feature which is automatically escaping input from get post cookie

9321747
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
also just an aside when you output data always make sure you escape it htmlspecialchars and when you process input from any untrusted source make sure to filter it addslashes mysql_real_escape_string

9321756
button	checkbox
after the user checks some specified checkbox and hits the submit button i would like to get his choices checkbox that is checked and its associated id but during postback my table neither has any of the rows i added dynamically nor does it have of the user s selection

ubuntu	mint
alot of that is preference if your looking for a more complete os with a nice gui then ubuntu or mint

9321997
freebsd	centos
freebsd and centos are a little less polished on the front-end but very powerful hence alot of web servers run centos

9322006
vmware	virtualbox
in theory you could get this virtual machine to run on virtualbox or vmware but it would take some work and would not run as quickly as if you just used xen server

9322012
google-chrome	firefox
i seem to be able to correct it in google-chrome after tweaking the css for the field but then it breaks in firefox the opposite way

9322069
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i read somewhere that using .htaccess for 301 redirect is not recommended and that a better practice will be to use httpd.conf

9322069
.htaccess	httpd.conf
can we use regexp in httpd.conf - the same as we do with .htaccess

9322103
verilog	vhdl
you may also like to consider using a soft processor in the fpga to help your transition from c to vhdl or verilog

9322103
ada	vhdl	verilog	vhdl
the choice of language is somewhat arbitrary - i code in vhdl syntactically similar to ada most of the time but some of my colleagues prefer verilog syntactically similar to c

9322103
altera	xilinx
a development board - for learning i would buy one from one of the three bigger fpga vendors xilinx altera or lattice

9322103
verilog	vhdl
to give you a brief example the software you need should take your vhdl and verilog code and this is the xilinx version

that is i d like to map the value1 to value50 to a dictionary where the key of the dictionary is determined by the columnmapping table

9322147
.htaccess	httpd.conf
well generally speaking .htaccess is just meant for per-directory settings and the httpd.conf for server wide settings

9322220
bash	tcsh	bash	zsh	zsh	tcsh
on linux it ll likely be bin bash but could also be some other related shell zsh tcsh etc.

9322226
inherited	properties
the issue is that a control s font among other things is an ambient properties meaning that child controls inherited their parent container control s properties

9322226
inherited	properties
so if you set the groupbox to use a bold font all of its child controls automatically inherited the bold properties by default

9322226
groupbox	panel
to make things even easier you can add a panel control to your groupbox dock anchor it to fill the entire client area of the groupbox control and set it to use a standard non-bold font

getter	setter
here are the two classes i m having trouble with if you d like to see the other ones let me know and i ll post them but they re 99 getter and setter

udp	tcp
there is less overhead when calling udp because there is no handshake like tcp has

9322942
paramiko	subprocess	stdout	stderr
for achieving this you can look into paramiko for other stuff like subprocess stdin stdout stderr you can go through this link python subprocess since this is your first python project it is better you read and try out stuff

9322946
post	get
post has a higher overhead marginally if we re honest but it all adds up but it doesn t become part of the url so can t be seen by say a casual observer over the user s shoulder - whereas get can

9322987
width	height
note that in the case of a list you can get the height of the list the number of rows but the rows don t have to contain the same number of columns so you can t get the width directly

9322992
width	height
and you can get the width and height by

9323015
put	get
if you cannot get the client to support cookies perhaps you can put some data into localstorage and then communicate that up to the server to connect to the session and structure it like a single-page app

the input form will contain a textbox to type title and textarea for content and a textbox to type tag as string

nsmutablestring	nsstring
you cannot reverse an nsmutablestring in place without allocating memory because the only methods that nsmutablestring provides to replace its contents require the new characters to be specified in an nsstring which you would have to allocate

9323287
std	ostream
if you cast to a function pointer or several other classes of non-void pointers it will be interpreted as a bool by the for std ostream hence the 1

int	boolean
it has 65 columns of varying data types mostly int floats and short strings maybe a few boolean

but with a a pythonic api compatible with the elementtree library in the standard library so this means the standard library documentation will be useful to learn how to use lxml

that s why lxml is preferred over libxml2 even when the underlying implementation is the same one

9324560
lxml	beautifulsoup
one interesting thing to note is that if you have installed lxml beautifulsoup will use it as explained in the documentation for the new version

anyway even if beautifulsoup uses lxml under the hood you ll be able to parse broken html that you can t parse with xml directly

finally note that lxml also provides an interface to the old version of beautifulsoup as follows

9329345

when the parent view is resized eg have the height and half the width the button should stay where it is top third of the parent view and now also have half the width and still one third of the new height

9329345

it seems as if the new width and height of the button i just achieved by subtracting the 50 pixel change instead of doing a proportional resize

9329504
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
if you want to loops over an arrays use the standard three-part for-loop

9329551
for-loop	arrays
however note that there may be reasons to use an even simpler for-loop see stack overflow question why is using â œforâ inâ with arrays iteration such a bad idea

9329586
inherited	properties
to avoid reading values that are inherited through the object s prototype simply check if the properties belongs to the object

9329628
getter	setter
you could get around this by creating a subclass of basicdatasource with getter setter for two new properties initexecutesqlfile and destroyexecutesqlfile that can have a comma-seperated list of sql files to execute

9329644
width	height
if you set flexible height and width without setting flexible margins what happens when you resize is that the height and width change so that the margins the distance to the superview s bounds stays constant

9329644
margin	height
setting the height and bottom margin to be flexible makes the top margin stay the same and the view will resize in proportion to the superview

9329644
width	margin
same goes for width and right margin

they can also be installed from a local directory or on the dirty way by just copying them into the eclipse folder

9330461
freebsd	centos
hence i will suggest freebsd centos

9330461
ubuntu	mint
mint by default comes with a lot of pre-installed applications and is also done with a lot of new interface changes so in that way it is pretty similar to ubuntu and wont solve your problems

9330479
hide	show
it binds to click-events of those radio buttons both of them always hide both divs first and then show the appropiate div only the one that belongs to the radio button clicked

9330506
onchange	onkeyup
bind the check to onchange not onkeyup

9330544
children	parent
to output this you would have to first select all parent comments with a parent of null then have a recursive function to select each level of children for each parent and output it

9330546
hide	show
to make one hidden and other visible you have to first hide both the blocks then add show on the block you want to see

9330568
getter	setter
don t use getter and setter too excessively

9330568
width	height
store width and height of your bitmap in public fields of your gameobject class and access them directly

9330568
width	height
if you are still concerned about performance you also may precalculate the width 2 and height 2

9330605
getter	setter
you can then provide getter without setter so that they cannot be modified elsewhere

9330610
qmainwindow	qwidget
so you need to subclass qwidget or qmainwindow and define methods in that class

9330610
pyuic	pyqt

as told earlier also you can also use testng data provider but if you are using junit you have to use above mentioned method

9330762
getter	setter
while we re on the topic using dot notation for everything is clearly misuse and if the book uses it everywhere it s technically possible i d say it might not be a very good book but it s imho nice for getter and setter

9330797
post	get
post is absolutely not more secure than get as to man in middle attacks

on a post back i get this error

9330856
ienumerable	iqueryable
you may also use iqueryable instead of ienumerable in you repository

9330856
ienumerable	iqueryable
but basically the iqueryable has the sql get generated and sent to the database while ienumerable calls the database then does the query in memory

9330856
ienumerable	iqueryable
this way you may change out the orm from linq to sql to entity framework or anything that can abstract the query to iqueryable or ienumerable

9330891
google-chrome	firefox
however i tried it on internet explorer and unlike firefox and google-chrome when you want to close the modal window it closes the whole browser window with a warning message that says beware the browser s trying to close this tab etc

9330891
google-chrome	firefox
you will see that it works flawlessly on firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

9330891
google-chrome	firefox
i did what he suggested and the result was this it still doesn t work at all on ie meaning that it still asks to close the whole window and not just the modal and correctly shows and closes a first modal in firefox and google-chrome but after closing the first one its not able to correctly show another one

9330908
submit	submission
instead of submission the form the normal way you could bind a callback to the submit event

9330919
getter	setter
so make sure that this property is declared with public getter and setter on your view model

9330950
getter	setter
in the symfony2 project i want to write some custom functions to change some setter and getter in an entity class

essentially the buildserver should check if there s modifications in svn if so then pull those down and then do a git push over to phpfog with the changes

9331035
getter	setter
you can use both the getter and setter of a property with dot notation

9331035
getter	setter
so how to replace the for notation depends on whether you are actually using a getter to get the value of the property or a setter to set the value of the property

9331101
for-loop	loops
other approaches to consider would be walking over the list backwards in a for-loop and removing by index building a second list containing the items to delete and then in a second loops over the second list remove items from the first

9331153
post	get
what it seems to be doing to me is that it s sending a get to the current page instead of a post to the updaterowajax.php

1 instead of using get method sending parameter in url use post method and the parameters will not be in html url anymore and you can do it by javascript

9331476
cos	sin	cos	math.h	sin	math.h
i believe they re just talking about the sin and cos functions included in the standard math.h header

9331476

9331624

so the job for you is just make sure that the design of your class is consistent and clear and if someone wants to inherited it then should be not dumb to just go and redefine non-virtual properties methods

9331630

i hope you know that if you want to define your own number of post you should add posts_per_page x to query if you want to always return all post matched to query put -1 in place of x

9331665
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that the versions of firefox google-chrome that run on osx are for osx not plain x11 -- so even if you run the x11 server and use xvfb xvnc whatever and pass in display 123 firefox google-chrome don t care because they re not x-based they re carbon cocoa-based

9331680

9331736
sin	math.h
the functions sin and cosine functions can be used in files that import math.h

9331736
sin	math.h
so unless you change that you already have math.h imported and can use its functions like sin

9331770
google-chrome	safari
i have no idea why this happens and it seems to happen on safari not on google-chrome

9331775
hide	show
just before that if which breaks the functionality you should add remove the class when you show hide the content nowhere else

9331832
screens	mdpi
60dp are 60px on a mdpi device it doesn t matter if the screens is full hd or just 480x360

9331940
folder	directory
the problem i m having is the not redirecting directory - basically files in these folder should still show - this was working correctly but i m having a bit of trouble displaying something from the _lib images directory - for some reason i always get a 404 error thrown up possibly because it goes via the router

9331970
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
but stucked at autohotkeyremotecontroldll.ahk that doesn t react on my fn key on all devices 1-5 hid 6-9 keyboard 10-16 mouse

9331971
folder	directory
i was hoping to use makefiles to monitor the folder that are going to be used for the dpkg process so only the directory that have had recent changes are recreated but

9332056
width	height
so if your border doesn t have an explicit height and width assigned to it then it will exist just around the content you provided in the column

9332100
google-chrome	firefox
however when i visit the page in google-chrome and firefox the only browsers i have tested so far the cached version is inevitably rendered

9332120
width	height
you need to give it a width and height

9332127
zoo	xts
there s no xts method for transform so the zoo method is dispatched

9332172
width	height
animated using basic jquery functionality for example width height

9332187
portrait	landscape
so if i launch my second activity in portrait mode switch to landscape while viewing the second activity and return to the first activity in landscape mode it ll crash

9332201
put	get
the error you get is because you put a statement inside a lambda function where only expressions are allowed

9332207
mouse	keyboard
a text user interface may be menu driven or use mouse input in addition to keyboard input

9332216
google-chrome	firefox
i just tried it in node firefox and google-chrome and it worked as expected in all three

9332218
jar	war
the sling launchpad plugin 1 creates a runnable jar file or a war file that embeds the osgi framework and a customizable list of bundles that s probably what you need

9332252

from pro git a bare repository is a repository that doesnâ t contain a working directory. it s a repository that you don t work out of and is just used to git push and git pull from

9332252
pull	push
all you do is push or pull from it

9332276
folder	directory
also i m not sure which context.xml ought to be modified there are 2 in the tomcat directory one in the conf folder and one in the webapps appname meta-inf folder

9332281
hash	md5
i would suggest using something like an md5 hash of the user s email instead

9332291
width	height
you can t directly set stage width and height because they are read only

9332295
accessor	properties
i would think properties are still used for automatically generating accessor and mutators where public isn t used

9332336
hide	show
the problem is that no matter which title is clicked it only show hide the date-time of the first title under the first title

9332337
maven	pom.xml

you will have to assign a different unique id to every tr you wish to show hide

9332381
superclass	subclassing
is there a way to perform this animation maybe by subclassing the view so that i still override drawrect in the superclass but the animation is somehow performed through the subclassing so that drawrect from the superclass gets performed multiple times during the animation

9332409
yesod	hunit
i m quite a beginner to yesod and not experienced with cablal - i used the scaffolding tool to initialise a new yesod project wrote some handlers and other code and now i m struggling with adding some hunit tests - how to do this in a best way

9332424
width	height
most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jquery functionality for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be unless the jquery.color plugin is used

9332424
fadein	fadeout
one way to do a flash effect would be to combine fadeout fadein and delay

9332495
filtering	grouping
filtering the search results by principal attribute values by grouping

9332500
distance	polygons
the polygons is moved based on the user s key-press either in x or z direction by simply adding the moved distance to the centre point and updating the vertices by adding the offset values to centre coordinates

9332504
filtering	grouping
data visible to a user is filtering according to his accesses which can be at the direction grouping or building site level depending on user role

9332508
profiling	benchmarking
benchmarking and profiling are critical since you don t want to write a bunch of hard-to-maintain code for the sake of performance only to find out that it s not a performance critical part of your application in the first place

9332516
readdirectorychangesw	filesystemwatcher
the .net filesystemwatcher and the readdirectorychangesw function both suffer from the problem that they generate the event even if the other application has not finished writing yet

9332521
opera	google-chrome
it is working fine in google-chrome but i get this error in opera

9332565
hash	md5
something like checking the md5 hash of the files or the files versions etc

9332600
versioning	upgrade
or is it something that might be added to future versioning of ios in which case i ll probably stick with system-wide passcodes for now and upgrade it later

9332605
getter	setter
property synthesize pairs autogenerate getter and setter and thus affording encapsulation

9332605
accessor	properties
it s good habit to always use properties and synthesized or hand-written accessor and the cost is negligible

9332625
ostringstream	std
give each thread a std ostringstream to write output to

9332698
client-side	server-side
is there something i can do node.js server-side to keep the existing client-side pattern

9332716
post	get
just to let everyone know i gave up trying to get the post solution for this working - i was getting too frustrated with not being able to get any closer to a result and wasting too much programming time

9332716
post	get
instead i went right back to basics and i have changed the string to sign to a get instead of a post and then created a parameterised url which i then call to get the xml result

9332721
getter	setter
in objective-c property is just a abbreviation for standard setter and or getter of a variable in the class

9332787
setinterval	settimeout
important use settimeout not setinterval you don t want it to keep running after the falg is set back to true - thanks to amnotiam for the heads up

9332794
multiplying	multiplication
you know even checking if number is equal to zero twice prior every multiplication is too much overhead if you account how low percentage of multiplying operations actually are optimized

9332820
facebook	fbconnect
if you definitely need to remove redirection to safari or facebook app you should open the fbconnect facebook.h class and find the following method

9332822
gson	jackson
aside if milliseconds make a big difference look at the stream parses that both jackson and gson provide for faster raw acess but you will be in charge of parsing logic and rebuilding your objects which may be a net loss

9332825
google-chrome	firefox
i used to implement htmlelement.getelementbyclassname but at least firefox and google-chrome only find the half of the elements when those elements are a lot instead i use something like actually it is a larger function

9332839
width	height
try setting the height and width of the input

9332857
google-chrome	firefox
i am sure you would know this but just as a reminder use firefox s firebug or google-chrome s internet explorer s developers tool and check for the post

9332859
fadein	fadeout
the problem is that it changes the font during the disappearance not in time between fadein fadeout

9332860
put	get
no matter what the system you put on top of the appengine models it s still true that when you save it to the datastore you get a key

9332865
express	node.js
most importantly is there an established solution to this problem - the problem of hosting multiple web apps on the same system with node.js express

9332882
getter	setter
ability to write custom logic for a setter and getter as well as write subclass customizations for the setter and getter

9332913
width	margin
also for the margin auto trick to work you need to declare a width

9332936

i have a window with a data grid view that displays item type descriptions monitor keyboard mouse etc. as well as an inventory count for each one

9332979
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari or firefox

9332989
post	get
however since i m combining both post and comment data to create a single list item i m having a hard time understanding how to get this combo-pack of data built in the controller

9333017
width	height
so basically when the rectangle width or height smaller then 300px you want to draw a black filled rectangle

9333023
versioning	upgrade
assumed this is a trivial upgrade and i just switched the versioning number in pom.xml

9333043
versioning	upgrade
difficult and not optimal since you won t be able to upgrade your site to late ci versioning easily

9333052
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

9333058
width	height
but combining both only does the centering even when using height 100 and width 100 on all elements surrounding the img

9333058
width	height
how can i achieve both targets at the same time without succumbing to hard-coded height and width values or javascript

9333081
post	get
what i d do is add a method in my post model to get the first comment according to your criterias

9333084
sorting	grouping
i am basically deleting all the grouping with no particles sorting them according to the number of particles and showing some properties

9333162
width	height
basically the image needs to take 100 of the height and width of the size of it s container

9333162
width	height
in the fiddle you can easily see it scale to the width but since the height of the fiddle is slightly more fixed it s harder to tell

9333202
jar	war
is there a way for me to expose the external jar to jetty through maven dependencies yet not being packaged into the project when the war file is built

9333271
config	ini
i m using the default zend_application design pattern which loads a zend config ini file automatically in the application bootstrap and i need to ini file s variables across many models and controllers

9333271
config	ini
is there another way to access the zend_application s config ini

9333274

install a more capable browser like firefox or opera mobile - both support svg

9333319
folder	directory
i need to read a directory for ex mydirectory in my webapp folder as follows

9333327
try-catch	exception-handling
also if you call a method or constructor that throws a checked exception-handling then you will either need to handle that exception-handling in a try-catch block like

9333351
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
but to loops through an arrays you re really better off with a regular for-loop

9333357
for-loop	loops
you can convert the while loops to a for-loop and simply loops on each record in the arraylist

9333382
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari 5.03 ie 6-9 firefox 3.6-4 google-chrome 8 ios 3.2-4.2 android

9333388
mouseup	mousedown
you could create a date in the mousedown then another in the mouseup and only fire your click zoom event if the difference between the two dates is greater than some threshold i would guess 1 10 of a second but you may want to experiment

9333390
equals	gethashcode
either override equals and gethashcode methods in the classes because your class needs to know how to compare instances see msdn for how to then you can call

9333429
mousemove	mousedown
you can use the mousemove mousedown events to set a flag that can be used in the click event handler to determine if the user was clicking or panning

9333442
ready	each
each of those script files have something that executes on the page ready event

9333444
min	max
max_s 2.0 max max xi - min xi max yi - min yi max zi - min zi

9333468
lan	localhost
browsing to the app on localhost 3001 and or local_ip 3001 over the lan freezes with the browser saying loading... or connecting... in the case of a new connection

9333473
mousemove	mousedown
basically if the user has mousedown and mousemove then panning is true

9333476
put	get
they normally get put into library developer xcode deriveddata project_name_and_random_crap build products build_type project_name .app

9333498
mouseup	mousedown
basically it calls dozoom only when the mouse has not moved between the mousedown and the mouseup events

9333511
solrj	rsolr
if you are using any client for solr like solrj rsolr you can easily iterate through the directory and execute the http urls to index the documents

9333517
folder	directory
the context.xml in your web application s meta-inf folder will take precedence over the one in the conf directory which is really just a generic default

9333540
int	chars
operator is not defined for types chars and int

9333558
portrait	landscape
the view controllers turn only to landscape view as i want but not the table view controller only in the portrait view .in supported device orientations i deleted portrait and upside down and i wrote in every class

9333603
range	min	range	max	min	max
the plot parameter xlim takes exactly two values the max and min range to plot

9333610
swt	swing
in my opinion swing is easier to learn and to use but the results of swt are often nicer - you can often feel that a swing application behaves not completely right

9333620
lxml	beautifulsoup
i ve not actually done this before but there are answers already on stackoverflow that explain several ways of doing with the aid of python libraries like lxml or beautifulsoup

9333623
children	parent
it works correctly when the example has parent properties set but it does not filter on children properties

9333632
libpcap	ebtables
sounds like you could use iptables ebtables to stop the forwarding over the bridge and use libpcap in your program to pick up the packets frames you would like to forward with your program

9333723
implements	extends
if implements which extends ienumerable why did programmers from microsoft add ienumerable as an interface that the implements

9333740
wordpress	joomla
if this is not possible or feasible the use most stable cmss like wordpress joomla or my favorite drupal

9333741
addclass	removeclass
or addclass and removeclass to add your own class to the element

9333745
checkstyle	jdepend
anyway there are similar tools such as checkstyle pmd jdepend that partly perform the task of source code analysis

9333762
ant	maven
i m looking for a build tool such as ant maven make etc. that uses json-based configuration files

9333764
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	show	hide	fadeout
it works with show and hide but when i change it to fadein and fadeout the whole thing breaks

9333783
int	chars
assuming you are trying to create a 32 bit int out of 4 chars there is probably more checking you can do but at a minimum i would turn this into two methods convertchararraytouint and another one that does each shift shiftcharleft chars numbits and hide all the casting ugliness in there

9333834
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox support cross domain xhr with gm_xmlhttprequest so you will not have problem about that if you are writing that script for firefox or google-chrome

9333942
oncreate	onstart
register listener in a s oncreate onstart using dataholder.getinstance .registerlistener this

9333960

9334039
realloc	malloc
afaik malloc 0 is not guaranteed to return a useful pointer you can realloc

9334039
free	malloc
the documentation only guarantees that malloc 0 returns either null or a pointer that can safely be used to call free

9334057
range	max
then you can set the range axis max value to the same thing for both charts

9334062
mp3	wav
allow a background wav mp3 to be added

9334111
cacti	nrpe
is there a nrpe equivalent for cacti so remote monitor can be done securely

9334133
post	get
how can i get the x y co-ords of a jqueryui draggable object when it is dropped and post them to something a java servlet using ajax

9334143
pop-up	dialog
i signed the jar file and now when i load the applet a dialog pop-up that says the applet from localhost is requesting access to your computer and gives options for allow or deny

9334146
post	get
the options http verb is used by the browser to query the web server about the url not to get its contents or post data to it

9334146
post	get
your server doesn t respond with the correct header data on a cors request so your browser assumes it has no rights to access the data and refuses to get or post to the url

9334188
width	height
i m trying to make some html with css pages i m new to both and i want to add styles to a table header with column long names this names are required to be long but the column width is fixed making these columns without css would show them with text wrapping so the row height would show just not nice

9334195
width	height
i know i need a height and a width

9334195
width	height
and so the private attributes of my class would be height width and

9334221
width	height
width and height toggle each rotation for example

9334221
width	height	portrait	landscape
in some it works as expected in others it interchanges the values so that i get large width in portrait mode and short in landscape in others it gives fixed width and height all time in others it doesn t rotate at all..

9334237
clang	llvm
frankly i care less and less each day as i become more and more impressed with clang llvm

the logs can be seen using adb logcat or eclipse ddms

9334336
children	parent
i build a list for each parent object and under each parent i show the children

9334358

if it does get rescheduled then you may have no choice but to put some sort of boolean that will disable the task

9334360
express	node.js
i m trying to write a basic chat application with node.js express and socket.io

9334379
innodb	myisam
why no joins between innodb and myisam

9334379
innodb	myisam
every query doing joins cannot have a mixture of innodb and myisam or else every select query deteriorates with full tables locks on both the myisam and innodb tables

9334379
innodb	myisam
here are some other posts i made that fully clarify innodb vs myisam

9334385
post	get
finally here is the response that i get from firebug with a post that does not include an attachment and then a very similar post with an attachment

9334441
chown	chgrp
i had to do the same copy var blobstorage to the new location and change the owner and group to plone with chown -r and chgrp -r

9334470
put	get
is there an efficient way of converting from one to another and vice-versa without having to loop through the classes calling get and put subsequently on each element

9334525
folder	directory
does each folder need to stay in their respective directory

9334546
stdout	stderr
so in the case of 2 1 it seems that 2 stderr is made to be a copy of 1 stdout

9334546
stdout	stderr
i ve tested it with the other way around makes stdout to be a copy of stderr

9334546
stdout	stderr
when run on command line hello is output to stderr not stdout

9334564
width	height
however as most have pointed out setting the height width of the html and body element will fix this issue which is what i recommend

9334624
bottle	flask
i am having trouble with mod_wsgi and flask bottle

9334624
bottle	flask
at first i tried with bottle and then moved to flask but still cannot get it to work

9334661
floating-point	integer
a float divided by an integer is a floating-point operation

9334664
floating-point	integer
before python 3 the operator performed integer division instead of floating-point

9334693
hide	show
you can create it ahead of time and hide it by default then just show it when someone clicks add people

9334693
submit	submission
once you are ready to submit the form you can once again using jquery bind the submission of the form to a javascript function

9334695
vbscript	vb6
if i declare ptrtype as void c# sees them as an intptr and vb6 vbscript sees them as any

9334711
aggregate-functions	sum
use the aggregate-functions sum

9334717
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the menu looks great in firefox safari google-chrome and ie8+

9334747
stdout	stderr
testing with a simple program that prints yay to stdout and nay to stderr i can confirm your test results

9334754
nowjs	node.js
any experience with node.js or nowjs

9334764
int	boolean
i think the other values don t need to be stored because false is the default value for boolean and zero is the default for int

9334796
post	get
probably changing extension of static page from .html to .aspx is not enough and iis is still limiting it to only allow get requests but visiting application on facebook passing data to canvas url via post

9334809
inherited	subclassing
if you want to express that the fields you store sprites and bodies can be any subclassing of these classes just declare those fields with these types inherited will take care of the rest

9334850
division	multiplication
its important to notice that neither python or wolframalpha will not give you the mathematically right answer since in math we do multiplication before division and in python and have the same precedence so will evaluate left to right

9334891
udp	tcp
you sould also use tcp or another protocol which ensures that data arrives correctly i guess you already use tcp and not udp as you use ftp

9334895
pop-up	dialog
i took a different approach and created a wrapper native app that pop-up a dialog for javascript

9334966
post	get
the file will get submitted on the first post to the server

9334970
width	height
also in real terms the start width and height could be in any orientation when in final use

9334996
uitableview	reloaddata
when the code reaches the reloaddata line it does not fire the uitableview reload methods

9335003
sorting	filtering
so far the best out-of-the-box filtering and sorting that i have found is the collectionview and collectionviewsource duo

9335009
put	get
i made a php script for a form but dont t know how to get it to work...how do i put the php in the page and make it active

9335012
super	self
i had intended on using self instead of super which was a typo on my part

9335012
super	self
ok so changing super to self does fix the problem

9335061
hide	show
i also have a button to show and one to hide using the above code method

9335061
hide	show
if i enter a value into a textbox and then click the hide button and then click the show button when the panel reappears the values are zero

9335061
hide	show
just the show hide buttons

9335077
width	height
alternatively you can use jquery filter method to filter all the images which have width greater than height and then add the required class at once

9335117
temporary	tablespace
i m trying to create a temporary tablespace that would be half the size the temp tablespace

9335123
width	height
if it isn t giving you a proper width height on the image then it could be that it is calculating the width.height before the image has been loaded

9335219
mouse	keyboard
it can include keyboard events mouse events

9335221
maven	pom.xml
i obviously don t want to put a bunch of html into my pom.xml so i need a way to read my header.html as a maven property

9335237
cagradientlayer	calayer
i have a calayer as a sublayer to a cagradientlayer and i find that shadows do not render

9335240
postgresql	mysql
and there are usually tons of ways you can optimize a db such as mysql postgresql etc

when it comes time to draw onto the canvas you will need an array that has the x y width height coordinates of each possible sprite in the larger image

9336204
portrait	landscape
in some cases screen.width is what the currently width is - in portrait it s a small value in landscape a large one

9336204

then just send data to it with http put and or get and view the results over the interweb

9336233
superclass	subclassing
yes it is possible to do what you re asking although there are definitely better ways to accomplish it - the most obvious would be to create a default implementation of myinterface and then a tracing subclassing of it that extends and logs before invoking the superclass version

9336246
switching	screens
if the window is already in extended display mode when wm_size maximize is sent there is no problem because the max window size is set to allow full screens however if they attempt to maximize from the minimal mode i can t get the app to switching to take up the full screens during the message

portrait	landscape
i tried it on the ipas simulator and it return 264 in portrait mode for a qwerty keyboard but when you start the app or rotate to landscape mode it returns 1024

the height and width attributes tell the browser the dimensions of the space on the rendering canvas to use for the image

9337053
setinterval	settimeout
otherwise you would need to do setinterval in a settimeout to make sure they were spaced evenly

9337059
width	height
if not you ll end up changing the height and width later anyway so the attributes with dummy values wouldn t really serve any useful purpose

9337063
width	height
no you should not put an incorrect width and height on an img element

9337063
width	height
then you can specify the width and height on the img and not incorrectly stretch any images

9337070
width	height
if you are building a uniform grid that contains non-uniform content you could set the height and width on the containing divs table cells what have you

hide	show
i have a toggle event that is being used to show and hide a div and it is hooked up inside a backbone view and called via an event delegate

i used get here but you could just as easily use post or ajax

9337355
submit	submission
your form submit event needs to return false to stop the form from actually submission

9337470
post	put
the html this is not the complete html there are a lot more images in the div i just didn t want to put too much html in the post

9337473
stdout	stderr
specifically r will output its normal output to stdout and its warnings and errors to stderr and you can deal with those streams separately rather than seeing them together

9337473
stdout	stderr
for example you can send stdout to a file and keep stderr in the terminal

9337475
trie	tree
in this case a general trie might be easier to deal than the more specialized radix tree but the requirements in space are a bit higher

9337475
trie	tree
note i m suggesting a radix tree instead of a trie because the space requirements for the former are much smaller

9337481
firefox	safari
everything works fine in ie 9 firefox and safari but the when i view the site in ie 8 or below the styles disappear

9337490
int	double

9337553
hide	show
i can show and hide the select boxes

9337556
postgresql	mysql
i m thinking about postgresql to store the data because i ve already used it and i like it also if a nosql would be a good choice -since not all data needs to have a relation- i like the postgresql support and community and i feel better knowing that there s a big community out there to help me mysql innodb is also a good choice tbh i ve not a real reason to choose it over postgresql and vice-versa is maybe mysql easier to create shards

this will then be used during checkout as the shipping tax amount

9337672
tax	shipping
after which you must calculate the appropriate tax shipping amounts and return a proper callbackresponse message

having worked with vb6 and vb.net it was straightforward to convert

9337734
client-side	server-side
backbone provides mv structure for your client-side development so it is complementary to and independent of whatever server-side framework or library you choose

9337734
ember.js	backbone.js
there are many options for client-side mvc or mvvm code organization such as knockout.js and ember.js but personnally i prefer backbone.js which has less magic but offers more control

9337739
hide	show
now i know i can simply assign the image to its own layer than manipulate the layer but in our case we have a 6 x 6 matrix of images that we just need to show or hide individually and creating 36 layers as opposed to a single layer with 36 images on it just seems crazy to me

9337755
accessor	properties
oddly modules also gets a warning about missing accessor for a simple properties that also has its dynamic in the .m file

9337927
children	parent
initialize the children in the parent s initialize function

9337927
children	parent
by appending the children you force the render function to have knowledge of the parent dom structure so that you get the ordering you want

9337927
children	parent
initialize the children in the parent s initialize still but instead of appending use setelement .delegateevents to set the child to an element in the parent template

9337927
children	parent
initialize the children in the parent s render method instead

9337947
inherited	subclassing
in fact this is very useful to the stated problem because when a user inherited from your class you can detect it and add the subclassing to a list

9337947
inherited	subclassing
if you don t want to use subclassing for some reason it is equally easy to make extension be a module and use the included hook instead of inherited

9337959
rss	feed
in my visual web part i have an rss feed and an alert me button but the url will need to be generated based on a dynamic url

9337982

i use virtualenvs in production and you can use uwsgi to serve the applications with cherokee as a web server

9338089
vsto	add-in
i ve blogged extensively about vsto add-in and written many myself

9338089
vsto	add-in

i get the same results from gcc and g++ on my machine as well so it looks like it s just a quirk of your particular compiler version

9338380
post	get
here s a get started blog post for node.js + mongodb

9338390
getter	setter
more accurately ++ is not an atomic operation as it locks your getter then increment the value and then locks your setter to set the value

9338392
min	max
as for the sampling you can split the data into equal sectors and compute average of x and y for each sector - the split can be done using quartiles of x-values averages of x-values min x + max x -min x 4 or whatever you think is the most appropriate

9338420
put	get
i noticed that also whether localhost or server if i try and put an httpdelete attribute on my delete action it doesn t find my action method and i get an error saying it can t find that method

also how is the object referenced by the group variable memory managed - are you alloc initing and and assigning it directly to an ivar in the containing object rather than as a properties via a properties accessor

9338500
accessor	properties
or probably simpler make group a retain properties on your containing object and assign via the properties accessor method

9338516
decimal	ieee
float will store the numbers in machine-precision ieee floating point while decimal will maintain full accuracy at the cost of being slower

9338525
google-chrome	firefox
well instead of doing it before you leave i did it onunload and here is what i got to work in firefox and ie besides google-chrome that s all i got

9338580
shim	polyfills
as others have noted older browsers don t support .map and .foreach natively so you d need some kind of shim or polyfills if you re looking to support those environments

9338580
for-loop	loops
this means that you can create closures within loops that reference the current item which is a total pain with a for-loop

9338581
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
all of the exceptions thrown prior to the call to internalwritealltext throw argumentexception or argumentnullexception but theoretically since filestream can throw the exception the streamwriter.write contents

in a regular for-loop i have to type the arrays name multiple times so its more work if i want to rename it

9338616
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested w safari google-chrome firefox

9338627

yes it is perfectly fine to use arrays iteration functions and i personaly try to use them whenever i can instead of a for-loop

9338656
width	height
note that it asks for the width and height of the rectangle

9338670
scapy	libpcap
however you might want to think about hooking the packets a little lower - i don t think scapy is capable of actually intercepting packets - all libpcap does is set you promisc and let you see everything so you and the kernel are both getting the same stuff

9338680
post	get
i need to send a http get post request to an external api which returns xml data and then parse this data

i ve got something like this in my properties accessor method of a constructor for my program

9338918

9338987
hide	show
in ipad if i hide one youtube video and show another at that time previous video keeps playing in background till new video loads

9338990
integer	unsigned
well the answer probably isn t because it is sometimes returned as an unsigned value - in objective-c conversions between signed and unsigned are effectively bit-copies so you can compare an unsigned to -1 and get the answer you expect the values is all ones - -1 as signed maximum integer as unsigned

9338991

so i am wondering if what i am doing above is exactly the limitation the documentation is referring to but the thing is when i nest it like above i am then able to post comments for both projects and tasks if i dont then i get a could not find polymorphic association error so it seems like it is sort of working minus the missing methods and if that is not the right way to nest this setup if anyone has any creative workaround ideas

9343837
profiling	instrumentation
i m probably missing something obvious here but is there a way in instrumentation to clear the cpu profiling data without restarting the app

9343852
width	height
though remember you should as a safe practice provide width and height whenever possible and remember float elements if you decide to use display block and float the elements which is a general practice in css have sometimes the need of a clearfix class you can google it but in your case i don t think it would be necessary if you provide width and height

9343868
membase	couchbase
i have been incredibly confused as a newcomer to this technology because in addition to all of similar sounding products released by couchbase last year couchbase couchbase single server membase couchbase mobile they now seem to be dropping combining all of them into a single project couchbase server

9343868
membase	couchdb
but that is actually membase not couchdb

9343868
couchbase	couchdb
i understand that couchbase the company no longer provides a distribution of couchdb

9343868
couchbase	couchdb
i understand that couchbase server the new focus of the couchbase company is really not couchdb at all and it is not compatible with couchdb

9343868
membase	couchdb
it does not implement the http api that couchdb uses it s using a binary protocol that evolved from membase

9343868
couchbase	couchdb
all of the recent information on couchdb mobile seems to point to couchbase mobile

9343868
couchbase	couchdb
specifically couchdb not couchbase server because the apis are not compatible

9343873

implements	extends
the relationships in java are either extends for inheritance or implements

9343954
versioning	upgrade
it sounds like your problem is that you re running an ancient versioning of tomcat or java which hasn t been upgrade or maintained

9343955
min	max	minimum	max
priority queue can be implemented as a heap or a linked list where in to extract elements based on priority either you have to maintain elements sorted in case of linked list where say a maximum or minimum element goes at the front based upon whether you are implementing a max heap or a min heap or priority queue can be implemented simply as a heap data structure

9343997
stdout	stderr
can you redirect the stdout and stderr to a file as opposed to null and pass on the output

9344098

im starting to use backbone.js and im trying to do somthing simple with javascript which is show hide divs

9344119
hide	show
i get to show the div but i cannot hide it i try many things any idea

9344133
distance	polygons
if your polygons are most of the time far apart enough you can build the two convex hull and fall back on the easiest problem of finding the hausdorff distance between two convex polygons solution in o n+m

9344133
concave	convex
i just realized that in order of the postulate to work you also need to check that the closest features from the convex hulls belongs to the original concave polygon

9344133
distance	polygons	concave	convex
the updated postulate is then the hausdorff distance d between two concave polygons is the hausdorff distance between their convex hulls if and both closest features are part of the original polygons

9344151
nscoding	nscopying
there s no method in the api to copy nsmanagedobjects since they don t conform to nscopying nor to nscoding

9344189
nsstring	nsdata
well i just transform nsarray to nsdata and if it is nsstring type transform it to nsarray first then to nsdata and it works

9344202

9344364
mp4	webm
their links deliver .txt files but it s good with webm and mp4

9344395
hide	show
you d be better off with separate links that you show and hide along with the or just a single toggle button that does both the showing and hiding

9344423
super	self
your problem is that you re not calling super s init and assigning that to self and then setting up array

9344428
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in google-chrome but does not happen in firefox

9344428
google-chrome	firefox
i think the best way to understand what i m talking about is to view the following code in google-chrome and in firefox and zoom in and out several times in both to see what happens

9344428
google-chrome	firefox
i want what is happening in firefox to be replicated in google-chrome

9344463

pop-up	dialog
then when you hit ctrl + alt + l pop-up dialog will appear

9344796
realloc	malloc
so my question is am i using fwrite fread malloc and realloc correctly

9344821
ant	maven
if you want to make a dependency if you want your library code to be updated in all end projects you have to use building tools like maven or ant and configure them properly

9344837
cdr	cons
or you could use an extra level of indirection make l refer to a dummy cons cell which points to the real list and change the cdr of the dummy cons from inside your function

9344878
mouseleave	mouseenter
the problem is because when you only supply toggle with one function that function is called on both mouseenter and mouseleave events - further information

9344878
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you change your code to use mouseenter and add another handler to the .file-hover elements to hide them on mouseleave it should work as you are expecting it to

9344887
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i m compiling the amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk demo and attempting to run it locally on tomcat7 on a fresh install of arch linux

9344909

9344922
profiler	visualvm
instrumenting profilers such as the one provided by the profiler tab in visualvm essentially record each and every method entry and exit in the selected code

9344922
getter	setter
even simple field getter setter methods may not be inlined any more due to the extra code thus skewing any results

9344925
vim	emacs
let them use emacs or vim if they want

9344935
public	protected
they say delegation is better- although the modifiers in delegation can also be public protected

9344935
inherited	subclassing	public	protected	superclass	subclassing
so is the real reason why inherited breaks encapsulation because of the knock-on effect of the public protected modifiers from the superclass being exposed to any new classes which extends the current subclassing

9344942
width	height
2 use image#getscaledinstance int width int height int hints for scaling

9344949
sorting	filtering
arraylist is basically a lighter version of arraycollection stripped of sort and filtering functionalities and those are used in the background by datagrid when you click column header for sorting

9344979
width	height
so i guess i need to get source width and source height right and everything else should fit perfectly anyways i hope i make any sense here

9344999
google-chrome	firefox
i know it is possible with liveconnect utility in mozilla firefox but i was wondering that liveconnect works on google-chrome or sholud i try another way to implement

9345002
ready	each
if the loop is ready read each row from group and group.ids will contain the table.ids

9345010
width	height
when you say resizing with html do you mean specifying the size using the width and height attributes of the img element

9345010
width	height
something like this will return the source width and height of the image

9345012
min	max
may using max and min heigh attributes be another solution somthink like

9345033
oncreate	ondestroy
personally i prefer to call bindservice in oncreate and after finish using it call unbindservice in ondestroy

9345039
.when	each
it depends how we design our class.while designing a class we should have the open-closed principle in mind .when we are talking about encapsulation we are talking about modification and when we are talking about inheritance we are talking about extending our application then we as designers should choose what we should protect against modification using private modifiers in our class thus encapsulate our class and what s the open side of our class that is reserved for future extension. protected membmers . think of it as partial concept in .net languages that each class can be separated to different files thus some of them can be extended by the programmer and some others are generated using code generation tools

9345054
apache	nginx
you need to configure a webserver for example apache or nginx to serve your site using fastcgi

9345090
fadein	fadeout
apologies if this may sounds simple all im trying to do is fadeout the current page and fadein another page

9345092
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme	erlang	scheme	erlang	lisp

9345150
background-image	background-position
however i want to use the same background-image but changing the background-position to give a cool effect

9345172
int	double
in the body of findlowest function you define double low but you return it as int so that you can assign it to double again

9345172
int	double
change type of this return value from int to double and everything will be fine

9345175
int	double
when you assign values of double to an int type you truncate them

9345179
put	get
iâ ve read whatâ s in their site and it seems that they put a lot of interesing stuff all in one place but i fail to see why this seems to get that much attention

9345193
setinterval	settimeout
i would use a settimeout so you don t have to worry about canceling the setinterval and note the use of an anonymous function for the first argument of the settimeout call

9345197
width	height
then i need to be able to click and expand and item while checking if any other is open and if it is close it back to its original height and width it s a set width

opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested it in firefox google-chrome safari and opera

9345273

in fact if you tried to make a reliable udp based file transfer you d likely end up implementing an inferior alternative to tcp - since you d have to implement the reliability yourself

9345280
hash	md5
hashvalue possible a md5 hash i haven t decided that will be updated on each call

9345285

i ve tried executing the script everywhere in the uiwebview s lifecycle loadview viewdidload viewwillappear webviewdidstartload webviewdidappear etc. but i never see the dom content loaded alert

9345417
decoder	encoder
but it look the set of primitives you have int bool + size are simple enough to be able to write your own decoder encoder

9345442
width	height
because screen sizes vary the width of the screen usually height but it is in landscape so i shall refer to it as width changes

9345448
for-loop	arrays
it uses the traditional for-loop to collect all the data you wanted in an arrays then calls the ajax function one a time on that data

9345494
hide	show
since i basically want to show hide a global non-activating panel i probably should simply prepare a system service

9345497
groupbox	panel
this assumes your textboxes are within same groupbox or panel

9345498
folder	directory
compile the app and copy that directory into your documents folder that is served by apache

9345514
puts	gets
if it helps my script gets the contents of the raw text file puts it inside a variable and i just echo out the variable.

9345545
hex	binary
for binary to hex you can either work it out the total number in decimal and then convert to hex or you can convert each 4-bit sequence into a single hex digit

9345545
hex	binary
for hex to binary reverse the previous example - it s not too bad to do in your head because you just need to work out which of 8 4 2 1 you need to add up to get the desired value

9345545
division	subtract
for decimal to binary it s more of a long division problem - find the biggest power of 2 smaller than your input set the corresponding binary bit to 1 and subtract that power of 2 from the original decimal number

9345545
hex	binary
for hex to decimal it s like binary to decimal only you multiply by 1 16 256.

9345545
hex	binary
for decimal to hex it s like decimal to binary only you are looking for powers of 16 not 2

9345547
firefox	safari
my problem is that the page renders fine in ie firefox safari but on the ipad it doesn t center and the scale is off

9345574
int	chars
for each int there will be typically depending on platform etc. 4 chars s so your new array would have elements

9345574
int	chars
if you are trying to interpret each int as a chars to get the same number of chars s as there were int s then you cannot do this without a loop and manual conversion to a new memory locaton normally

9345590
min	max
normalize the peaks from the min max found

9345605
hide	show
or can you set everything up in one xib and set hide to true or something like that so that only some items show

9345630
archetypes	dexterity
rendering the schema based add edit forms of frameworks like archetypes and dexterity is also relatively expensive

9345678
outputstream	inputstream
both input file and output file are in inputstream and outputstream forms

9345678
outputstream	inputstream
that means i need to pass inputstream and outputstream as -i and -y parematers for ffmpeg

9345703
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
if you add the uiwebview directly in viewdidload the uinavigationbar of your uinavigationcontroller is not loaded yet and the frame of self.view is perceived to be not really because it is larger

9345711
lsp	principles
if slicktyre has extra properties functions then other tyre you might have broke the lsp principles

9345722
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome

9345738
client-side	server-side
you can t triggure something on the client-side with server-side code like php however jquery has a success method that executes after an ajax call has been made

9345740
mouseleave	mouseenter
as tooltip toggles on mouseenter and leave when you click the element and dom structure is replaced with new page the mouseleave on the avatar is never triggered as the element was removed programmatically while mouse was hovering over it

9345741
int	chars
so 100 is a chars 300 is an int 32768 is a long

9345774
hide	show
what would look nice is every time the user presses next is to simply hide the old view and make the next one show up can even add a fading transition to make it look fun as well

9345776
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
just make it whatever type of traversal you want over the tree inorder preorder postorder dfs bfs to give you a numbering of leaf nodes incremented as you go straight through each leaf node

9345831
put	get
just in case my primary key isn t sufficient i put in a test which is checked when i get a mysql 1062 error duplicate entry on primary key

xsb	yap
this works in many systems like b gnu sicstus swi xsb yap

9345844
folder	directory
i set up a virtual directory to the folder

9345853
wan	lan
there are commercial solutions that address this with hot backups such as subversion clustering which work over a lan or a wan

9345866
accessor	properties
a much better way to do this would be to declare list as a properties and synthesize its accessor

9345879
hide	show
i want my php script to hide any errors generated by a mysqli object but show any other ones

9345916
octal	decimal
however if the shell does interpret the leading zero as octal then the second number is just 021 or 17 decimal because the 8 ends the octal number

9345941
int	chars
then you could create a new chars array and copy the int array with memcpy

9345943
awt	swing
first off don t mix awt and swing components and so you should be dealing with japplets not applets

9346014
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
i use javascript s getelementbyid method and the getelementsbytagname method to narrow it down to the right div then i use the match method to extract the numbers from that element and the parseint method to store the price as an integer instead of a string

9346022
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
if you design a game that does not need fast graphics you can simply use qgraphicsview qgraphicsscene and related classes to display icons numbers whatever

9346027
popupwindow	dialog
with that i can either place it in a popupwindow and display it or use it in a dialog alertdialog or use it inside a layout somewhere

9346028
maven	pom.xml
and i d like it all to build cleanly from the maven pom.xml file

9346034
fgets	getline
for that you should use fgets or perhaps getline though the latter is less widely available than the former

9346034
stdout	fflush
consider a fflush stdout

9346044
rss	feed
i get these categories directly from the rss feed

9346086
inherited	subclassing
just been reading gof and they state inherited exposes a subclassing to details of its parent s implementation

9346087
min	max
min limits the file count when used with max null it is the maximum

9346087
min	max
file count it also accepts an array with the keys min and max if

9346087
min	max	minimum	max
is accepts the following keys min minimum filecount max maximum

9346116
qtreeview	qheaderview
i found this question how to change the background color for a qtreeview header aka qheaderview

9346143
google-chrome	firefox
and right things and the problem persists in google-chrome and firefox

9346196
width	margin
if you insist on it try putting the footer as 100 width make it fixed position and wherever you want it then put the content in a wrapper inside the fixed footer and give that a margin 0 auto

9346254
versioning	upgrade
is too old upgrade it if possible the minimum versioning in 3.3.0

9346294
x86	64bit
btw the delphi nativeuint definition for the wparam type is correct because is a unsigned 32-bit on x86 and unsigned 64bit on x64

9346322
hash	md5
md5 is not the strongest hash algorithm around and there isn t enough iterations

9346364
folder	directory
instead of using a certain jar in my web-inf lib folder i want to use its source code same directory structure and everything in my web-inf classes folder so that i may be able to modify its classes more story

9346385
children	parent
you just have to bind the event to a common parent object that will not be changing and it can automatically monitor all it s children

9346409
int	chars
the program sends a chars string to my function evaluatepostfix which proceeds to identify operands and operators and come up with an int solution

9346451
x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
since 64bit was an after-thought for x86 it overlays 8-bit al and ah 16-bit ax 32-bit eax and 64bit rax all on the same physical register each accessed by different addressing modes

9346475
folder	directory
copy all the files folder into the myproject directory

9346500
cpu	processors
modern superscalar processors generally make instruction execution appear to be completely deterministic and in-order from the perspective of something outside of the cpu

9346500
put	get
but anything that shouldn t have been executed mispredicted branch doesn t get committed and memory accesses are generally put back into the right order before leaving the cpu

9346517
postgresql	mysql
it is not like ms access but you can use either mysql or postgresql

9346553
fgets	fread
you can use a loop to read through the file but instead of using a function like fgets that reads one line at a time use a lower-level function like read or fread that will fill an arbitrary-sized buffer at a time

9346625
min	max
i d object to that stuff about min max and mean

9346651
rss	feed
you might have better luck if you grab the rss feed published for each of the pages rather than trying to parse the html which is slower

9346651

9361654
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the fact that your indented content aligns correctly in google-chrome safari firefox is because those browsers all implemented the same or similar distance between the bullet and the li content so a text-indent of 1em gives you a visually consistent result - but really this visual consistency is just a fluke

9361660
dbcontext	objectcontext
however most references i found point to dbcontext and not objectcontext

9361674

width	height
at system.drawing.graphics.drawrectangle pen pen int32 x int32 y int32 width int32 height

the struct tag is a superfluous feature if you are using typedef

9362226

i tried looking up a super pom.xml but the example given in maven the complete reference does not list the surefire plugin

9362303
folder	directory
if you must do this manually assuming your web server is set up to serve static files from the public folder you can create an index.html file in your public directory and remove it again when you have finished the update

9362320
versioning	upgrade
then you can program the app to read versioning 1 files a new app needs more fields on the data source so you create versioning 2 data which adds extra fields versioning 1 app see s the data needs a newer app so tells the user to upgrade

so now there is a discrepancy this implementation google-chrome mobile safari and opera all follow ecmascript-262 v5.1 whereas ie10 firefox desktop safari all seem to be following the more iso8601 compliant ecmascript-262 v6.0 specification.

9363445

9365234
onchange	onkeyup
in these circumstances i prefer to use onkeyup instead of onchange for the very reason you re describing

9365372
fadein	fadeout
instead of fadein and fadeout

9365372

jquery remembers the start that the opacity is in when you use fadein fadeout and because you are halting the animation essentially you are jamming fadein fadeout to go to the stopped opacity

9365663
hash-collision	key
however if an attacker has control over the key inserted into a hash table and knowledge of the hash algorithm in use he can provoke a lot of hash-collision and therefore force linear lookup time

9365671
jobs	cron
you can use task queues instead of cron jobs to do deletions it all depends how fast you want to get back to the user

9365676
getter	setter
a derived class can then shadow the property with a non-virtual read-write function which calls the same function in its getter and a new abstract or virtual function in its setter

9365678
post	get
if you re getting information form a form use the post or get methods accessed with and

9365716
google-chrome	safari
these however dont fix the root of the problem which is that webview decides against all logic to suddenly missunderstand the html5 doctype and switch to quirksmode when all other webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome etc behave correctly

9365747
textinput	textfield
note that if you re using a textinput component and expecting its name when the user clicks on it you will actually get the instance name of the child textfield of the textinput which will have an arbitrary name like instance88 so you should use stage.focus.parent.name to get the right instance name of the textinput itself

9365759
japplet	jcomponent
don t use keylistener this listener is designated for prehistoric awt components for jcomponent japplet use keybindings

9365941

looking at the source for the shop.html it looks like you are specifying the height of the images but not the width

9366042

9366189

and about that thing that image should not affect the size of the row i am not sure about your intentions on that but if i understood you right then you can provide a fixed width and height to your images in the tag

9366218
getter	setter
probably you can start with org.hibernate.property.basicpropertyaccessor and delegate to org.hibernate.property.directpropertyaccessor when no getter or setter found

9366224
pseudo-class	visited
for what it s worth there is in fact an indeterminate css selector it seems to be treated like other css pseudo-class like visited which also cannot be set through html directly so maybe that is another reason indeterminate can t be either

9366260
children	parent
if you animate the parent the children will get dragged along

9366260
children	parent
however you could simulate this by having a parent that contains both your parent and the children

kerberos	ntlm
from the available methods windows authentication is the most secure using either the ntlm or kerberos mechanism

9366540
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception	illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception	illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
in this case you should use a runtimeexception descendant such as illegalstateexception or illegalargumentexception and let top-level error handling take care of it

9366542
error-handling	exception-handling
more importantly this code will swallow all exception-handling even ones you weren t expecting and for which you haven t written specific error-handling logic

9366568
int	chars
one is an address a pointer to something doesnt matter if that is a chars or short or int or structure

9366568
int	chars
what they point to is a separate discussion longs are probably going to be 64 bits as well sometimes int shorts probably still 16 bit but not a hard fast rule and chars hopefully 8 bits but also not a hard fast rule

9366568
int	chars
the short answer is the language defines some data types chars short int long etc and those data types have a compiler implementation defined size

9366591
innodb	myisam
so i have been asked to change the engine of a few tables in a production database from myisam to innodb

9366607
geocoding	geocode
depending on where you re getting your street addresses from all you mention is a datasource you might be able to do a big-batch geocode for all the locations in your datasource - move the geocoding from request time to a batch process and just use the request-time geocoding for the ones the batch process hasn t gotten to yet

9367088
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseleave is trigging the animation to shrink the frame which queues a shrink storyboard event and the mouseenter is queuing the animation to expand the frame which queues an expand storyboard event

9367088
mouseleave	mouseenter
by shrinking expanding the frame the mouseenter mouseleave get fired again and the animations both get run again

9367088
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can view the delay in slow-motion by adding to your storyboards to add a 2-second delay and you can verify the mouseenter mouseleave events by attaching a method which writes a line to output in the mouseenter mouseleave events of the frame

9367088
mouseleave	mouseenter
perhaps try using the mouseenter mouseleave events to trigger the events manually after a 1-second delay providing the event should still process

9367088
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseleave
for example if the mouseup event triggers mouseleave and mouseenter events then the mouseleave should queue the collapse animation but delay a second and check if the mouse is actually over the object a second later

9377133
union	distinct
you can use union and distinct quite easy for this

9377165
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
what you re doing there is when the mousedown event fires on the holder element s you re adding a new handler for mousemove and mouseup to the document on top of any handlers that are already there

9377165
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
you should either only be attaching the mousemove and mouseup handlers once not on every mousedown or you should be sure to remove them on mouseup

9377180
google-chrome	firefox
you could always test it out yourself by reducing the width of the container to something you can test in your browser google-chrome and firefox s dev tools are useful for playing with css within the browser

jar	war
parent src test resources logback-test.xml - this is the parent module which wraps all other modules jar files and packages into a war

9377323
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
problem was that basically every time you were pressing mousedown you were binding mousemove and mouseup again and again so after clicking few times all the computation was multiplied by amount of times you ve pressed mousedown

9377323
mousemove	mouseup
you could also namespace the mousemove and mouseup events to unbind by namespace rather then two events separately

9377341
superclass	subclassing
can for example both the method take an object whose superclass implements a subclassing of comparable

9377352

odoo	openerp
i m trying to insert values into a many2many or one2manhy relation table in odoo former openerp

9377412

i think the problem may be that you are using jquery s click function to bind the event to the dom svg vml that raphael has output when it sounds like what you want to get is the original raphael data object that controls this output rather than the actual output itself

9377424
zoo	xts
how can i read this time series into xts zoo or some other r time series class that supports irregular time series

9377468
getter	setter
it does mean you have to include all the setter getter on the top-level object which would then delegate to the respective setter getter in each of those component classes but at least you can isolate all the handling of them into separate classes without the complexity of an inheritance hierarchy

9377477
maven	pom.xml
but if all the modules belong to an single release cycle all the modules will be released togeter with the same version then it is may a better approach to use parent and child modules pom.xml -- because then you can run mvn test or mvn install for the parent pom.xml and maven will do it for all the childs in the right order

9378064
superclass	subclassing
if a superclass exposes a method publicly then all its subclassing must also expose the same method or an overridden version therefore reducing the accessibility of a method is a subclassing is illegal in php and pretty much every class-based oo language

for example if a parameter was bytes of a file do you include the whole thing in your hmac hash

i ve replaced the onchange event handler by an onclick event handler

9378187

9378232
sorting	filtering
plus it would have to apply all the view sorting filtering in future .

9378268
sat	np-complete
sat is very important because it is np-complete

9378268
sat	np-complete
sat is so nice because it is np-complete you can solve it instead of any other problem in np and also the reductions are not so hard to do

9378275
inherited	properties
one way to do this would be to setup your datasource using system properties that can be inherited from a properties file and running your tests in a db2-test environment and an oracle-test environment

9378309

9378676
hide	show
in order to be able to react to the keyboard show hide in phonegap android we implemented the linearlayoutsoftkeyboarddetect which is basically a linearlayout but it reacts to changes in the screen size

9378676
width	height
if you rotate the device the width becomes the height and we can ignore the change but if the height gets dramatically smaller while the width remains the same it is safe to assume there is a keyboard being shown and we throw a show keyboard event

9378676
width	height
when the height gets dramatically larger while width stays the same we throw a hide keyboard event

9378693
highcharts	highstock

9378787
width	height	portrait	landscape
the goal is to allow a mix of both portrait and landscape images but put some restrictions on the maximum height and width

9378787
portrait	landscape
the problem i can see is that if i resize to a width a portrait image may become too thin and the opposite it true for a landscape image

9378791
onclick	onsubmit
also since you re using jquery you may as well use it properly and separate out your html markup and javascript by attaching event handlers using the jquery functions and not onclick onsubmit etc attributes on html elements

9378825
config	ini
i have created an ini file and put it in the config folder

9378844

i have the problem that i can not seek an audio file mp3 to a specific position if the file is not completely preloaded when using firefox 10.0.2 the position i want to jump is already preloaded in safari this works flawless

9379064
free	strdup
in the later case you should remember to free the memory allocated for the returned string by strdup

9379074
strcpy	malloc
you should use malloc or strcpy it to a string pointer passed as argument

9379100
packets	multicast
are there any big issues in commonplace multicast implementations i need to be aware of packets drops configuration issues etc.

9379166
maven	pom.xml
if you need to run unit tests in a local windows environment try using maven profile properties to set a version of 1.0.0 in you local maven config and in the pom.xml specify the remote config

9379196
width	height
if i could determine the width and height beforehand i could to it but i don t see how to do that with the event data

9379237
width	height
i want to get the size of this relative layout i.e height and width in my code.i tried it by using getwidth and getheight but it is showing 0

9379271
portrait	landscape
however if i put multiple instances of this control in a layout it results in weird behaviour when rotating a device from portrait to landscape

9379286
opera	firefox
it seems to work fine in firefox and opera

9379327
width	height
now to answer your question use the above link to store the original browser size and compare it to the changed width and height values to see if it was a vertical horizontal or both change

9379347
tunnel	packets
having said this and reading that your requirement is to tunnel the udp packets to the serial interface what you should do is the following

9379347
udp	tcp
so when we send it via the serial interface using udp or tcp whichever you prefer we are automatically again encapsulting the whole packet with one more udp and ip header

9379378
.htaccess	httpd.conf
do .htaccess rules get priority over httpd.conf rules

9379408
portrait	landscape
once in portrait and once in landscape

9379419
spaces	delimiter
if what you want to do is split the string using either spaces or commas as delimiter you can use preg_split

9379464
screens	tablet
because screens can have minor variations in their dimensions for example some tablet are 1280x800 and some are 1280x720 it s better to use specifications that can stretch and give a bit like match_parent wrap_content and layout_weight

9379491
x86	64bit
assuming you are running your application on a 64bit machine compiling for x86 target makes your program run using wow64 mode 32-bit process on 64bit and you re reading keys under the wow6432node

9379598
webkit	gecko
a way around this is to use pointer-events none which is supported in gecko and webkit but nothing else...

9379610
cpu	processors
i have a server with 32 gigs of ram and intel xeon cpu 2 processors at 2.4ghz

9379613
cos	sin
you shouldn t compute with integers since cos and sin are between 0 1 think about floats

9379617
google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox and google-chrome here at least

9379621
cpython	pypy
another poster said that the pypy compiler runs as a standalone executable separate from cpython

9379631
comparator	comparable
objects that implement the comparable interface like strings have a natural ordering as defined by its comparator method so you can just use arrays.sort

9379656
int	double
i have a program which creates a c structure which contains large arrays of various basic data types int double etc.

9379692
cpython	pypy
one of the reasons why pypy can be faster than cpython is because pypy is compiled to a completely separate native executable and does not depend on nor execute in cpython

9379754
profiling	instrumentation
i think your best best is the boring old diligent programming and profiling with instrumentation to guard against making these calls rather than trying to catch the error at runtime

9379757
post	get
whilst this may not be a better way an alternative approach to circumvent the need of j link would be to set up an intermediate cgi script to translate the request from get to post for you

9379757
post	get
this script file would sit on an accessible server it would take the specified get query make a post request on the target page then output return the result xml in the normal way

9379757
post	get
from the mathmatica stand point this is much simpler as you simply use the built in import method to make a standard get request on the proxy page but get the result xml from a post request on the login page

9379760
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
i then came up with the following code to build the combobox in a datagridtemplatecolumn not a datagridcomboboxcolumn

9379765
width	height
the surfaceview has to be visible or a height and width of 0 won t work

9379797
profiling	instrumentation
using the android.bluetooth package we need to connect to a measuring instrumentation via bluetooth the only profiling supported by the instrumentation is pan

9379808
hide	show
i know that i can call showownedpopups to force the os to hide all the owned windows but this only seems to work after the owned window has actually been show so you get a flicker on screen

9379808
hide	show
so i m looking for some way to either have the os show the window in such a way that it is not made visible to the end user until the owner is restored -or- a way to set a flag on the window so that the os thinks it hid the window using showownedpopups and then i will manually hide the window and set that flag

9379848
jlist	jlabel	jcomponent	bufferedimage
1 use jlist there you can put icon from bufferedimage renderer returns jlabel jcomponent by default

9379854
mouseleave	mouseenter
i am binding the mouseenter and mouseleave events in the client view to fade in and out an overlay on the image

9379854
mouseleave	mouseenter
it looks like it is touching the elements i am trying to bind to as well as binding to mouseenter and mouseleave

9379896
put	get
i know is possible to get the list of users using openrowset from a linked server and i was thinking if i can somehow put the password as a where parameter to that query and check the number of returned rows

9379920
graphics2d	bufferedimage
draw each bufferedimage in the graphics2d instance of every jpanel

9380085
inherited	properties
as i mentioned in my comment margin 1em inherited is invalid as the css-wide keywords inherited along with initial and others introduced in later standards may only appear by themselves in properties declarations and this includes shorthand declarations

9380169
gridview	rowdatabound
but you should use gridview s rowdatabound to bind it to it s datasource

9380187
put	get
i read from the file succesfully but when i try to put the information in the string i get this error object reference not set to an instance of an object

9380217
vsto	add-in
outlook 2010 vsto add-in is being used

9380220
kerberos	ntlm
my idea is just to provide username and some kind of string user token session token access token i don t know the exact terminology which will be generated by user client side app using kerberos ntlm i don t know and server will receive this string information it will check this token to verify that this is valid token of valid windows user and here are the groups to which he belongs .

9380234
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
another problem is that the next item in the flow after right-stuff will need a margin-top to be in the correct position or otherwise i have to either give right-stuff a width i calculate myself or an artifical margin that takes into account the button height

9380246
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so far my code works in any recent version of firefox google-chrome and safari

9380268
awt	swing
martin odersky said that he might consider adding argument-based dispatch to scala but only if he can remove overloading at the same time and be backwards-compatible both with existing scala code that uses overloading and compatible with java he especially mentioned swing and awt which play some extremely complex tricks exercising pretty much every nasty dark corner case of java s rather complex overloading rules

9380323
gmail	hotmail
how would i make html emails display cleanly as they do in gmail hotmail

9380332
swt	swing

wsaemsgsize usually means that the buffer you provided to recvfrom was smaller than the incoming datagram

9380432
portrait	landscape
my application is landscape and portrait mode application

9380432
portrait	landscape
when my application starts and i am on landscape mode my home screen shows portrait mode for some mili seconds and after that it comes into the landscape mode

9380443
hide	show
you can use change event to control autocomplete so if it s null hide submit button if not null show submit button

9380494
udp	tcp
in our organisation we implemented our own protocol over udp and tcp to let external devices connected to the internet exchange messages with a server that we developed using netty indeed

9380514
width	height
create a div container that you assign width and height if needed to and make sure you add an overflow property to match your design

9380520
distance	polygons
this way the large polygons would be visible and active at a certain distance then at a closer distance the smaller polygons would be visible and active

9380549
try-catch	exception-handling
you can catch the access control exception-handling by putting the call to system.getenv in downloadapp.java line 15 in a try-catch statement

9380551
width	height
i would ideally like to specify a div height width and then have it draw the div with the images on the top bottom right left sides autosized to the div s proportions and not overlapping with each other

9380584
width	height
furthermore each cell is at a specified set height and width

9380599

after the initial click subsequent clicks just return a grey screen this is in internet explorer 7 it appears to work in google-chrome and firefox

9380628
primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces	richfaces	icefaces
the world is moving towards html 5 and css 3 and icefaces richfaces and primefaces all have html 5 support

9380628
primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces	richfaces	icefaces
i did my part of the research and found out that either richfaces or primefaces would be better but most of my applications were developed using icefaces

9380635
mouse	keyboard
currently when the user selects an item via keyboard or mouse the plugin populates the search box with that value

9380663

9380705
hash	md5
i need to compare if a string is a md5 hash in sql

9380717

9380729
put	get
if you did not get answer then please put some code

9380738
bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	git	cvs	svn
the new distributed version control systems git mercurial bazaar etc are not built around per-folder checkout in the same fashion as svn and cvs

9380755

however i would not be changing any code i had today based on that knowledge unless a profiler clearly showed a tight loop to be a significant perf problem in my application

9380768
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works for me in ie firefox google-chrome and safari

9380974
put	get
how could i get it so the text in column b is put in column a

9380998
width	height
your span9 div is jumping down due to the animation of the toggle effect jquery adds it animates both width and height so your content that is around the div that is being toggled gets pushed down as the animation goes

9380998
inherited	properties
the first-child pseudo-element attributes margin 0 to the first element which in this case is the sidebar that is being toggled so once the sidebar is hidden the second span tag the content div doesn t inherited this properties and stays with the default margin applied to the span tag

9381000
setcontentview	findviewbyid
setcontentview also has to come before the findviewbyid

9381075
post	put
i especially like the semantics of delete notes first but also consider post notes first - put a new note before the first one

9381077
inherited	properties
now the documentation does say that core animation code within an animation block won t inherited the block s properties duration easing etc.

9381078
portrait	landscape
i get different values for the landscape and portrait

9381078
portrait	landscape
now my question is if i am in portrait mode how can i get the values of landscape mode and the other way around

9381091
udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp
since you have to be on top of data sent via rtp udp in order to effectively detect end of broadcast i can only think of implementing full rtsp client with rtp part and re-sending rtp to the address of interest

9381091
rtp	rtsp
otherwise having only rtsp control connection without seeing actual rtp data it is unlikely that you can query or otherwise obtain status of rtp data transmission whether it is still active or reached its end

9381096
mouseup	mousedown
for instance if you re dealing with a control you could override the wndproc for the control capture the mousedown event or wm_mousedown set a variable to ignore the wm_ime_endcomposition and then reenable that variable on the mouseup or wm_mouseup

instead of command-pattern i think you should use the memento pattern which is designed for things like undo and redo

9381223
children	parent
since parent have a higher z-index than its children you need to change the default browser stacking behavior

9381223
children	parent
add position relative to each element and then specify a z-index on the parent and its children

9381223
children	parent
the z-index for the children should be higher than the parent

9381838
inherited	properties
you re setting your itemssource to inherited the datacontext by setting the on the itemssource properties

9381923
int	double
1.0 k introduces a small inaccuracy and that plus the inaccuracy of pow unavoidable due to the representation of double s may just move the result of pow past the int threshold if n is a k th power or very close to one

9381923
pow	math.h
an example using haskell s which does the same thing as pow from math.h but it might have a different implementation

9381923
pow	floor
of course the tests for the special cases and the fixup cost time and in almost all cases do nothing above floor pow n 1.0 k so it may not be worth it

9381951
mouseout	mouseenter
use jquery hover instead of mouseenter mouseout

9381965
mouseleave	mouseenter
switch to mouseenter mouseleave

9381965

9382158
getter	setter
right now i have made them protected so the deriving classes can see them and i have used getter and setter to encapsulate them so other classes only can see the getter

9382158

however in actionscript it seems that you can t make accessors protected so they must be public

9382173
post	get
is there a way to send post or get messages to the php using android sdk

9382549
put	get
and no matter what i try to put into the body of the begin end block i get the following

9382568
getter	setter
otherwise the encapsulation is broken and your objects are really just a dumb data containers with getter and setter

9382568
getter	setter
most of the examples consider domain object to be the same as data container with getter and setter without any encapsulation

9382625
put	get
actually i needed to put that value in to get editing to work

i m working with a tabcontrol that has already been styled by a theme in an included assembly but i d like the background color of a tabitem when the tabitem is selected to be different

9382991
width	height
assuming you need the width height of the border to remain at 200 otherwise you just wouldn t specify it you can make a grid the outermost element of the control and put the border inside it

9382991
width	height
then if you don t define a width height on that it will auto-adjust to the size of your control

i prefer ruby on rails first if you want to spend time on php frameworks try cakephp latest version codeigniter easy to use but my feelings - whatever technologies we used - some good principle comes with ruby on rails framework like

9387527
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter
since you re using jquery you could use mouseenter instead of mouseover --it s designed to protect you from mouseout events when there are multiple items within your target

9387531
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
try using mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

9387533
onmouseover	mouseenter
rather than using onmouseover i d recommend using jquery s mouseenter to avoid the multiple firing of the handler due to event bubbling

9387538
mouseleave	mouseenter
to solve your problem i would use the mouseenter event instead - this means when the mouseenter the element the code is executed and then you can use mouseleave to change the animation again when the mouse pointer leaves

9387552
getter	setter	superclass	subclassing
is it still standard practice to provide getter and setter in the superclass for subclassing to access the attributes of the superclass in other words set the attributes as private

9387572
getter	setter
when i was in university doing my cs degree we were told don t do getter and setter in second year and do them in fifth year

9387572
getter	setter
my personal preference is to use getter and setter where absolutely required only and to never ever have public variables

9387574
getter	setter
if you want the superclass attributes to be accessible without being inherited then you need to declare public getter and setter

9387574
getter	setter
if you want some form of validation you need getter and setter

9387577
getter	setter
are getter and setter poor design

9387591
google-chrome	firefox
i ve confirmed this behavior with several other users and amongst all the major browsers ie firefox google-chrome

9387593
uiview	subviews
you may use them wherever you would insert a uiview as a subviews including within a uiscrollview parent view or as an object to be inserted into an array

9387594
getter	setter
with tools that can generate getter setter at a click of the mouse i never felt the need to break encapsulation even between parent child classes

9387611
inherited	subclassing
furthermore uiwebview is a subclassing of uiview and inherited many of the same methods making view layout the same in both cases

9387612
libxml2	xerces
libxml2 offers a c-style interface if that really bothers you go use xerces though the interface is at least somewhat object-based and easily wrapped

9387612
relaxng	schematron
it provides a lot of features like xinclude support with callbacks so that you can tell it where it gets the file from an xpath 1.0 recognizer relaxng and schematron support though the error messages leave a lot to be desired and so forth

9387612
libxml2	xerces
xerces s sax-style api will work in this capacity but libxml2 is here because it s a bit easier to work with

9387612
put	get
i put tinyxml in this slot because it is about as braindead simple to use as xml parsers get

9387612
std	ostream
you just new up some objects attach them together send the document to a std ostream and everyone s happy

9387638
public	protected
speaking for the c# side if you have a data member field or property that is not public but is useful to child classes and should be available both to read and write then declare that member as protected

9387638
inherited	subclassing
this makes myvalue completely hidden from classes outside the inherited hierarchy and read-only to subclassing

9387638
getter	setter
this would be equivalent to a private field with a protected getter method and a private setter method

9387638
superclass	subclassing
in general as the designer of the superclass it s up to you to define how subclassing should be able to use what you provide

9387647
implements	extends
i have three tabs and each one extends activity and implements view.onclicklistener

9387663
junit	testng
the simplest would be junit which is where most of testng came from at least according to the book

9387665
accessor	properties
seems that in c# the standard practice is to use properties with get set accessor

9387665
put	get
one other benefit of using accessors instead of directly accessing a data member is that you could put a break point on a get set method and see who executed the method

9387680
hide	show
then when the mouse is moved over one of the top level anchor elements or one of them gets focus we hide any previous sub-menu that was visible and show the one applicable to the current anchor

9387686
stdout	stderr
you can use it to wait on multiple file-like objects including a socket and stdin stdout stderr

9387754
inherited	properties
these inherited types can then each have different properties

9387798
getter	setter
a java bean requires setter and getter and serialization

9387798
getter	setter
the tendancy to mix them up probably stems from the fact that many new programmers put setter and getter on every java object anyway so they tend to look identical

9387806
subtract	add
can anybody suggest how to add or subtract row value from grouped row

9387862
oncreate	ondestroy
it s just a suggestion but it would definitely solve the problem you re describing since you could register the receiver on oncreate and unregister it on ondestroy

9387890
scheme	racket
and finally as has been mentioned in the comments the built-in flatten procedure found in some scheme implementations like racket i don t know if it s available in bigloo

9387898
chunked	transfer-encoding
this should happen only when transfer-encoding chunked

9387917
range	minimum
the question was asked before in a slightly different way what data structure using o n storage with o log n query time should i use for range minimum queries

9387917
range	minimum
nevertheless to quickly answer the problem you re facing it s a well studied one - range minimum query

9387933
portrait	landscape
so i ve been building myself a mobile webapp and am trying to hide the reshuffle of the layout after the user has rotated the phone i have a portrait and a landscape layout set by js

9387953
width	margin
i had to override the width property from 100 to a fixed width and then add the margin 0 auto

9388022
for-loop	loops
in this case you can use one of the other approaches suggested every or use a regular for-loop since it works the same as the groovy each it s null-safe and supports but doesn t require types but you can break out of loops or return and since you re in a real for-loop it will return from the method

9388032
mouse	keyboard
hold down the control key on your keyboard and drag with the mouse from the navigation controller to your first view controller presumably the one where you are displaying the alert view to create a segue

9388063
hide	show
onclick of hider i want to hide .container and show .shower that s located before closest .container

9388063
hide	show
onclick of .shower i want to hide .shower that was clicked and show next .container

9388071
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the problem works great in webkit google-chrome safari but does absolutely nothing in firefox

9388115
ubuntu	debian
this allows you to keep the two installations separate especially since debian and ubuntu rely on the system version of python for many system utilities

9388125
post	get
the difference is the method to access those methods is either get or post just like spring mvc handles it

9388125
post	get
what i want is when i access the url like this www.bla.com controller addfunction this is get the method that will be triggered is add1 method which is will load view form and then i have form that has an action to controller addfunction at this time because it is post it will trigger add2 method

9388135
put	get
every time i put anything close to the right side of the panel2 it would get really close to the edge or even worse go past the shown area of panel2

9388145
post	put
i ve read dozens of post saying exactly to put a min-width to a wrapper but i ve no idea what my min-width would be

9388227
google-chrome	firefox
this code in firefox starts from element one while in google-chrome starts from element zero

9388232
oncreate	setcontentview
with setcontentview in oncreate

9388283
textview	simplecursoradapter
i have a listview that s populated from a simplecursoradapter each row containing 3 different textview

9388333
children	parent
i am currently using a view model to display a list of parent artists in an index view that includes an actionlink that redirects to index 5 to show a list of children albums while still showing the full list of parent

9388333
children	parent
i am now trying to update this so that on routing to index all of the children will be loaded for every parent which i imagine includes using a nested foreach

9388340
nsstring	nsdata
i tried converting the nsdata coming in from the network to an nsstring and to strip the boundary information from it but that is failing and the nsdata won t convert to an nsstring so i can strip the junk

9388347
profiling	debugging	profiling	benchmarking
pulled out relevant benchmarking on an ipad 1 in debugging profiling release resulted in even more of a performance increase by using the f notation

9388360
width	height
i have to animate a uiimageview from a certain large width and height to a known smaller width and height in a given number of steps of time eg 10 steps or 20

9388364
config	ini
if the ini file has only key-value pairs then config general works fine but it is not able to understand comments and section headers

9388368
ssl	https
the point is that ssl support in ftp is more that an on off switch as in http https

9388375
post	get
the controller itself can handle input from a get post or both

9388379
spaces	delimiter
or better yet if none of your values have spaces then you can simply remove the delims option altogether since the default delimiter are and

9388394
portrait	landscape
it doesn t fit a landscape layout as nicely as it does a portrait one but you ll have to make it work for now

9388394
portrait	landscape
smart banner ads will be full_width x 50 for phones in portrait and full_width x 32 for phones in landscape

9388411
centos	linux
however it fails to write files on my dedicated linux centos machine

9388411
centos	linux
i am very confused with what is going on with this linux centos machine

9388436
hide	show
you can hide or show columns in your grid

9388437
hash	salt
when you compute the hash include some secret data as salt - this can be hard coded

9388440
directx	direct2d
maybe there is now a simpler faster way to create the same effect using directx 11 and direct2d

9388440
direct3d	direct2d
edit i don t know if i was enough clear i m not asking for any code just for a direction if i shoud use direct2d or direct3d 9 10 11

9388449
google-chrome	firefox
it works for me in google-chrome ie9 and firefox

9388455
move	drag
in my game i have puzzle pieces that i want to drag and move around with my finger

9388525
google-chrome	firefox
i tried that on google-chrome and firefox

9388527
int	chars
this behaviour is not limited to chars the same can be seen for other int sizes so it appears it is a matter of promotion

9388563
int	chars
the difference is that the type of 0 is chars while the type of 0 is int

9388563
int	chars
when one of the expressions has type int and the other has type chars the type of the result is int

9388563
int	chars
the compiler is complaining that an int value is being assigned to a chars variable

9388563
int	chars
a smarter compiler might keep track of the possible range of values for the result which in this case is the same as the range of possible values for a chars and deduce that there is actually no possibility that the conversion from int to chars will produce a change in value

9388572
division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
for example you can implement arithmetic like multiplication addition and division entirely with bitwise operators

9388642
mouse	keyboard
you can do it with a global mouse and keyboard hook

9388716
ssl	https
if the server has an ssl certificate that isn t self-signed you don t need to anything more than set the url to https

9388732
jquery	mcustomscrollbar
mcustomscrollbar is a jquery plugin that adds a scrollbar to the content included in mcs4_container

9388738
getter	setter
just to provide an alternate answer that s simple to use but a little hard to implement and maintain create a c++ class that hides the complexity with a getter and setter

9388792
qlist	qfileinfo
the objects in the qlist are pretty small and are wrappers for qfileinfo

9388806
for-loop	loops
you could also use an iterator don t recommend at all or a while loops but in the end they do about the same thing as the for-loop and probably less efficient

9388832
width	height
basicly i have a edittext for the following width length eave height pitch

9388842
width	height
it wouldn t take any effort at all to make two textareas where by typing in 500 in the first and 100 in the second the size of my div box would go from 200px in height to 500px in height and the width of my box would go to 100px in width

9388924
int	chars
i am trying to input a string into a c# console app have it break the string into an array of its chars and then have it iterate through the array of chars and assign each chars an int corresponding to its alphabetic position 1-26 a-z and populate a new array with the int

9388927
opera	firefox
both opera and firefox never fire boo when the document is edited it s a sigma grid that has editable cells

9388972
int	chars
convert the chars to an int subtract an appropriate amount to put it between 1-52 and take the number mod 26 or .toupper or tolower the string beforehand and put it in the 1-26 range

9388972
int	chars
iterate through the length of the arrays converting chars to int using plaintextarray i - a + 1

9388982
carrierwave	paperclip
i am migrating from paperclip to carrierwave

9389022
puts	gets

google-chrome	firefox
html5 - as you know - is not fully supported by the available browsers this is supported by google-chrome firefox but not supported by ie old versions

9389072
post	get
the key is that i couldn t ever get it working in devise so i wrote my own solution in the users controller and post to that instead of using the methods provided by devise

9389079
vbscript	vba
vb vba and vbscript do not have the concept of code blocks within a procedure

9389156
for-loop	loops
you can do it either in an objective-c fast enumeration loops or in a standard for-loop

9389172
sorting	filtering
the dataprovider is supposed to handle the sorting and filtering for you by requesting the server to send it a new list that is sorted filtering according to the wishes of the table

9389172
sorting	filtering
why would you want to consume network traffic by letting the server manage your filtering sorting unless you have more than 10 pages of records

9389237
createelement	each
that is local to each closure of the createelement function.

9389249
ant	emma
i am trying to get coverage report by running ant emma on my mavenized android project everything else went smoothly but i bumped into nullpointerexception when running

9389409
g++	gcc
however g++ does the runtime error is no problem std future exception on gcc experimental implementation of c++0x vs 11 errormessage

9389415
int	double
but your question itself is kind of a double edged sword since you want to rely upon unreliable results or simply that you want all the browsers to be consistently inconsistent - in other words instead of trying make sure a lion will play fetch your time would be better spent looking for a dog meaning you can rely 110 on int math and the results of said math the same goes for string math which has already been suggested to you.

9389428
profiler	visualvm
visualvm is an excellent open source profiler

9389447
antialiasing	transparent

folder	directory
is there a way to listen to folder or particular directory using quartz api in java

9389526
qtextedit	qtextdocument
qtextedit s document method return qtextdocument i think you want to use toplaintext method instead

9389582
width	height
the problem here is display inline adjusts its width and height to the elements inside it

9389582
width	height
for displaying elements horizontally you have to fix item s height and width

9389592
folder	directory
i actually tried keeping the .exe s inside another folder in the project directory exes and files in another one data

9389626
qstring	qtextedit
to get the contents from the qtextedit use qstring qtextedit toplaintext

9389664

google-chrome	firefox
code works fine in google-chrome and firefox all the time

9389774
implements	extends
do i simply redesign it such that abstract class timeperiod extends dbobject and implements each object extends from it

9389802
put	get
you can put such a mutex in shared memory so that multiple processes can all get at it

9389817
post	get
it seems as though this the form of your question but what you really want to know is how send post data in a redirect instead of get data if i m on the right track please

9389817
post	get
i get the idea that what you want with this piece of code is to submit a post request to this url and to redirect your browser there at the same time

9389837
width	height
but since your if statements are executed at runtime rather than compile time you ll either need to change your if statements to preprocessor if s #if not recommended or change your width height to be defined at runtime strongly recommended

9389837
width	height
and then from then on simply use the width and height values for your width and height

9389850
mouseover	mouseout
i have found qtip plugin but it works only for mouseover and mouseout

9389885
post	get
on another page you can get post value within _post variable

uiview	uipangesturerecognizer	uipangesturerecognizer	uipinchgesturerecognizer
i also have a uiscrollview attached to the main uiview which implements zooming and thus has its own uipinchgesturerecognizer and uipangesturerecognizer to implement scrolling and zooming

9389913
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the app uses a uinavigationcontroller that never has more than 1 uiviewcontroller on it s stack

9389928
hash	md5
does the value returned by mysql s md5 hash function continue to change indefinitely as the string given to it grows indefinitely

9389928
hash	md5
i m asking because i want to use the md5 function to compare two records with a large set of fields by storing the md5 hash of these fields

9389962
folder	directory
but if your application is already having xml files its better to store it in asset folder because you can create sub directory easily here

9389973
post	get
what this is supposed to do get the number of post by a particular author of the post currently being viewed and output it into a conditional statement saying if it is 1 or less than 1 display nothing

hide	fadeout
to have a neater effect you can fadeout instead of abruptly hide the image

9390124
stdout	stderr
its redirecting stderr to stdout and then to bit bucket but whats in it

9390164
stdout	stderr
so redirects stderr to whatever stdout currently points at while redirects stderr into a file called 1

9390164
stdout	stderr
so if you say it redirects stderr to point at what stdout currently points at which is probably a noop then redirects stdout to dev null

9390169
int	chars
you have two different datatypes being returned from your first column in the first query - in the first case the chars 10 of the is returned in the else case a large int number

9390169
int	chars
then you get back your chars 10 values - and nothing gets converted to a int or bigint and thus looses it s leading zeroes

width	height
if you are referring to the google earth plug-in for web pages then you can do some slight modifications like setting the width and height

9390769
width	height
i guess the problem arises because at the first call of ondraw the canvas has zero width and height

9390787

9391432
free	malloc
if that s really what your loop looks like my guess would be that you re probably getting a more or less spurious error because your process is just running out of memory because your loop is leaking it so badly calling malloc every iteration of your loop but no matching call to free anywhere

post	get
i wrote this mini jquery snippet but i want to get the id of the li element so i can post this data to an ajax call this is my script

9393219
put	get
the alternative is as mentioned by the other answer here to specify -ptest as you have no space between the -p and your password when using the -pyourpasswordhere logic in that way however as i mentioned this will then put your password into the command history more applicable for linux machines but still a good thing to not get into the habit of doing

9393308
put	get
than i put #import gdata.h into one of my source files and get following error while building project libxml tree.h no such file or directory

.net 3.5 and .net 2 both run on versioning 2 of the clr so the runtime versioning of the old and upgrade assemblies will not change

9398904
for-loop	loops
python loops counter in a for-loop

9398909

superclass	subclassing
the problem comes from the fact that i want addinput to return a pointer to an instance of the subclassing not the superclass

9399204
superclass	subclassing
because that returns a pointer to an instance of the superclass not the subclassing destroying the chainability that i m so happy with

usually when you create a popover its content view controller is or a custom uiviewcontroller or a uinavigationcontroller in this case you want to take advantage of its navigation bar

9400264
put	get
you could put pointers to local variables in the container if very careful that they don t get destroyed while still in use which is simple enough if everything is scoped inside main

9400279
for-loop	loops
what happens is that the for-loop creates those functions at each iteration but they get executed after loops finishes when

you may be interested in reading painting in awt and swing

9400402
awt	swing
the rules that apply to awt s lightweight components also apply to swing components -- for instance paint gets called when it s time to render -- except that swing further factors the paint call into three separate methods which are invoked in the following order

postgresql	mysql
for that purpose punbb supports mysql postgresql and sqlite

9400490
width	height
as far as i can tell the clipping rectangle won t consider any padding on the displayed text so you apply the proper math to rect s width and height if you need to mimic the behaviour of a multicell on this particular

opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have a fairly straightforward page that renders ok with firefox opera safari and ie but has problems with google-chrome v17.0.963.56

9400672
hide	show
when you click a menu link on the left it needs to hide all of my content divs then show only those that have the corresponding class

9400672
hide	show
so if you click the link implementation system development the page will first hide all divs of class content then show all divs of class content5

9400672
hide	show
as a complication to this the menu has some javascript attached to the ul s that show and hide the nested menues

9400672
hide	show
that way it hide all the currently displayed content then only show the content tied to that link

9400709
concave	convex
the most straightforward approach would be decomposing your concave polygons into convex ones

9400711
postgresql	mysql
i am looking for a way to use either postgresql or mysql i am using the former but i could just find a way to export it to mysql and use that one database offline

9400748
folder	directory

9400766
width	height
i have created a wpf chart programmatically and would like to change the title s font and color i can set the chart s width and height but not the title all the examples that i have found online show you how to do it through xaml

9400779
hide	show
in summary you can try setting a value in a query string hash or hidden input on your click event and on load of the page you check this value and hide show your div acordingly

9400785
google-chrome	safari
your site does not render properly in safari mac which is also a webkit browser like google-chrome

9400822
rss	feed
i ve managed to get the back end working for an android app where it parses an rss feed

9400829
stdout	stderr
or you could temporarily suppress stdout and or stderr

9400877
activemq	rabbitmq
the reason i ask the question is that we are switching to amqp rabbitmq from jms activemq and would like to abstract the messaging configuration even further by use of annotations

9400880
hide	show
it seems to me that they hide this menu by setting margin-left -9999px and show them by overriding this with margin-left auto

9400939
oncreate	findviewbyid
i would suggest that you move all of your findviewbyid methods from the toggle onclick method to your oncreate or initialization method

9400952
box-sizing	border-box
if ie versions lower than 8 do not matter you can use box-sizing border-box to include padding in block dimensions

9400990
width	height
you can even disable the header disable the faces and set the height and width to your liking

9401024
post	get
they do get there so it is just on the post that i am having issues

9401046
post	get
note whenever you get a force close that you re asking about in a stackoverflow question please post the full stack trace

9401055
persistent	transient
and because it s so cheap to create transient or persistent versions of a data structure it s not too onerous to go back and forth a few times if you really want to do something fancy

9401068
inherited	properties
first set the display properties of the divs and all content in them to inherited

9401068
inherited	properties
that will hide everything in that tag that inherited the display properties from it

9401071
equals	gethashcode
it looks like i can override gethashcode and equals to do this for me

9401146
subtract	add
subtract step 2 with step 3 divide by 7 and add 1

9401149
websphere	ibm
i have a basic ejb 3.0 java ee 5 project in ibm rad aka eclipse 3.4 and websphere 7.0

9401150
post	get
i found it from another post it can be used to get one single record

9401168
width	height
the effect of this is when width or height of the image being shown in the picture box is smaller than the user control the picture box will expand to fill the user control and if not the size of the picture box is the size of the image so scrollbars are shown

9401177
rss	feed
dear stackoverflow readers currently i m working on a project that makes a request to a rss feed and tries to parse it if that succeeds i want it to post the gathered information into a database

9401193
dynamic-languages	typechecking
while working with dynamic-languages you just have to forget about typechecking and use the existing more general constructs to solve your problem

9401223
post	put
i know i need to for_each each selected product but i am having trouble figuring out how to related the correct radio button from the overall post to the product during the for_each loop to put the values into the mysql table

9401225
equals	gethashcode
the idea is that equals is the natural equality for that type and gethashcode should match that idea of equality

9401225
equals	gethashcode
the overridden equals gethashcode methods do case-sensitive comparisons

9401234
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode provide the true implementation of whether two objects are logically equals

9401237
equals	gethashcode
if the majority of the time you want the dictionary behavior to work by default override gethashcode and equals

9401238
equals	gethashcode
you might not have the option of changing equals and gethashcode .

9401273
post	get
send the post data like this you will get proper output

9401276
ember.js	backbone.js
so started looking at current trending frameworks like backbone.js spine ember.js sproutecore

9401289
disk	ram
a majority of buffers are implemented in software which typically use the faster ram to store temporary data due to the much faster access time compared with hard disk drives

9401310
openrowset	openquery
you must read about openrowset and openquery

9401327
put	get
i think you get the idea or may be you can draw your custom image on canvas put on your framelayout and set 50 trasparent-background

9401348
firefox	safari
the site looks fine in firefox and ie but the form margin in safari is being shifted

9401394
hide	show
i know i can loop through all tag elements and check font sizes and hide them if smaller than 12px but it s not only inefficient but the text can be changed to be show again say after an ajax call which is prohibited

9401404
getter	setter
imho it s never a good idea to change behavior of default getter setter as those are managed by gorm

9401487
hex	binary
the opposite of unpack is pack which is what you re looking for to get this hex string back to binary

9401523
stdout	stderr
can i suggest you look at subprocess.pipe and either the stdout stdin stderr properties or the communicate method on subprocess.popen objects

9401529
google-chrome	firefox
i ve managed to test it in google-chrome and internet explorer 7 8 and 9 so far and i suspect it would work in firefox too

9401559
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am running into a problem in ie works fine in google-chrome firefox and safari where a var that i declared at the document scope is undefined and cannot be written to

9401644
int	boolean
boolean and int are wrapper classes for the primitives boolean and int

9401644
int	boolean
you should change your variables to boolean and int and wrap them up later if you must pass them by reference to a function

9401646
put	get
this isnt tested of course and you may have to work with it to put your exact variable names in but i think it should get you there

9401665
implements	sealed
i was going to implements a custom displayattribute in order to allow dynamic display values based on model values but i can t because displayattribute is sealed

9401678
actionscript	mxml
how can i add the different enabled values for different states with actionscript and not with mxml

9401696

9401717
punctuation	words
turns out i don t need a list of words at all because i was only really trying to remove characters which in this case were punctuation marks

9401743
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am using a uinavigationcontroller to push a uiviewcontroller onto the stack then when the user selects a row in the table view i allocate a new version of the view controller and push it onto the stack this works fine but then when i start pressing the back button the nsmutablearray that i am using to store the information seems to be keeping the value from the view controller that was just poped from the stack

9401802
oncreate	onstart
for example the order of some common methods called is oncreate oncreatedialog and oncreateview onstart

9401802
oncreate	onstart
so you can call getdialog and have it return something in oncreateview or onstart but not in oncreate or oncreatedialog

9401802
width	height
for example setting the width and height using getdialog .getwindow .setlayout ... ...

9401813
stdout	stderr
read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

9401825
post	get
sorry i ve looked through most of the post that relate to this issue but i just can t seem to get this working

i then run the command jar cvf bg.jar blocktestgui.class manifest.mf and get bg.jar

9401963
jar	manifest.mf
this is my manifest.mf before creating the jar

tab delimiter documents should be delimiter by the tab character not by spaces

9402002

enter in the height width or sprite multiple

9402021
dbcontext	objectcontext
you previously used objectcontext api and default code generator or entityobject t4 template but now you are trying to use dbcontext api with poco dbcontext t4 generator

9402033
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is currently running at about 5 loops per second and that seems insanely slow to me

9402062
folder	directory
it added the stylesheet folder to the assets pipeline s paths but the files in the stylesheet directory still give a routing error.

9402102
box-sizing	border-box

9402232
wordpress	joomla
are these html pages generated by any cms like wordpress joomla or drupal

9402239
x86	mips
what you re looking for is a cross-compiler -- a copy of gcc which is compiled for x86 or whatever but compiles to powerpc arm mips whatever code

9402278
atexit	main
the system will maintain a stack of functions registered with atexit and call them each in the reverse order of their registration when either the exit function is called or the program returns from main

9402433
portrait	landscape
my iphone app includes 2 view-orientations portrait and landscape

9402433
portrait	landscape
it starts in portrait but includes 2 view controllers which should rotate automatically to landscape

9402446
folder	directory
make the about page a directory folder with a file called index.php or index.html in it

9402446
post	get
use the post method instead of get methods

9402468
folder	directory
hopefully something more reliable than detect latest file created in directory since i have independent processes necessarily using the same folder simultaneously including other webdrivers

9402475
pow	floor
i am using runc to write a simple function which requires pow and floor truncate

9402475
pow	floor
however once i try to make a separate int function suddenly runc does not have the pow and floor functions and gives me an error

9402524
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
your task seems to be to evaluate each of the functions postorder inorder and preorder when given this tree

9402537
stdout	stderr
presumably this is because capybara captures both stderr and stdout as part of its standard operation in order to keep things quiet with selenium drivers etc

9402543
jar	war
actually i have digged into all my jar files deployed inside the war file and found this class inside resteasy-jaxrs-2.3.1.ga

9402685
google-chrome	safari
i wanted to view custom events in the timeline of the web inspector of safari or google-chrome s developer tools

9402708
integer	unsigned
if you treat 0 as an unsigned integer the compiler will not perform a signed shift

9402726
ubuntu	linux
if your servers are not windows then you can use ubuntu or amazon linux cloud-init to perform the same task

9402739
valgrind	memcheck
i d like to use valgrind to memcheck my programs of course but valgrind always crashes

9402744
children	parent
i feel like the best approach might be to use 2 separate but mirrored objects one for storing the parent and child keys in the datastore and another for returning the parent and all associated children as a json representation

9402754
innodb	myisam
there are several advantages of using innodb over myisam but if you are using the myisam engine you can have an auto generated compound primary key

9402786
userprincipal	directoryentry
i m trying to load the attribute physicaldeliveryofficename from a directoryentry which is returned by the getunderlyingobject method of a userprincipal instance

9402787
google-chrome	firefox
i have a site the problem is when i view it in google-chrome or firefox it looks ok but when i view it in ie 8 or ie 9 the three columns on homepage doesnt come in order.the footer also disappears.i dont know whats the reason behind it.i have even debugged the code but could find the clue.i can write code for all browsers by detecting first the browser and then executing appropriate code for it but that wouldn t be a nice way i believe.i want to know the reason behind this.anyone who can help me with this

9402789
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it remains this way incorrectly but in ie and firefox they will revert to normal after i ve dropped the row

9402794
cout	cin
i m getting cin cout and endl as undeclared errors despite using

9402797
google-chrome	firefox
the following work in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox

9402819
cout	cin
they are members of the std namespace so you need to qualify them with std std endl std cout and std cin

9402836
cout	cin
after your #include s section or use std cout std cin std endl

9402842
cout	cin
endl cin and cout are in the namespace std

9402842
cout	cin
near the top of your file or to use std endl std cin and std cout

9402843
int	chars
i suggest you replace bool with another type such as int or use a typedef to alias it with int or unsigned chars or something

9402845
qstring	qbytearray
thus it s good practice to keep the unicode qstring world and the byte array qbytearray char world separated and only convert between those two explicitly clearly stating which encoding you want to use to convert between those two

9402845
qstring	qbytearray
wrapping string literals or in some cases qbytearray or char variables holding latin1 data for conversion is the main use for qlatin1string one wouldn t use qlatin1string as method arguments member variables or temporaries all qstring

9402862
folder	directory
after you find it move the .android folder to your user root directory

9402934
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve verified that both element.id and element.getattribute id work in google-chrome safari firefox latest and ie 6-8

9402936
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfect in google-chrome half way in firefox its losing some css for some reason but that is probably a different issue but in ie9 i get nothing but this error

9402951
flex	robotlegs	parsley	robotlegs
i would recommend that you look at application frameworks for flex like robotlegs or parsley which definitely does stuff like this very easily

9402968
comparator	comparable
without generics you could cast the values to comparable or still use a general comparator .

9403010
keydown	keyrelease
ideally i would like it so that a keydown keyheld or keyrelease event is fired and only the controllers with the particular key s bound respond to the event and execute their associated methods

9403027
youtube	vimeo
i am offering users to share video links from various third party sites like youtube vimeo etc

9403031
client-side	server-side
you should keep most of your processing to be done server-side as most if not all client-side scripts can be edited and such

9403070
inline	inlining
although it is possible that inlining a method will improve performance there are several reasons that you might choose not to inline a method

9403070
inline	inlining
if it s only called once then your transformation is basically equivalent to inlining except with additional unconditional branches to and from the inline method

9403073
centos	linux
currently the server is centos linux with a mysql database

9403185
versioning	upgrade
also i just upgrade tortoisesvn svn to latest versioning to see if that would repair a damaged file but no-go

9403190
interpreted-language	dynamic-languages
first i m going to change the name dynamic-languages to interpreted-language which is what i think of with ruby javascript etc

9403208
mouse	keyboard
i want to create a program preferably with c# to lock the keyboard and mouse and show a full screen message saying face front to all the windows 7 pcs in my classroom apart from the tutors

9403227
std	ostream
however this is the place you want to implement the specific logic rather than in the class derived from std ostream

9403227
std	ostream	fflush	gets
just to explain what currently happens when you call the function f is called with the std ostream base which receives the output and gets fflush called

9403227
std	ostream
typically that s all a class derived from std ostream does

9403242
youtube	vimeo
vimeo and youtube both have embed apis that you can use

9403246
implements	extends
all you need to do is to add a small class extends urlstreamhandler and implements a urlstreamhandlerfactory

9403247
implements	extends
i was trying to implements the same using a class based view extends detailview and came up with this

9403249
wav	caf
i ve never found a comprehensive list of them all but google searches provide ones that work for the most common ones such as caf aac mp4 and wav

9403249
mp3	wav
i ve used this before to convert from mp3 to wav

9403249
mp3	wav
also from mp3 to wav to aac. note i dont think you can convert from one compressed format to another

9403258
width	height
i originally hardcoded my width and height of cells

9403337
ubuntu	linux
i have successfully installed spidermonkey js engine on my linux machine ubuntu

9403352
put	get
you don t want to do this directly but in your handlegesture method you could put in a call to aview setneedsdisplay and your view s drawrect will get called in the next drawing cycle

9403387
submit	submission
you will need to use an ajax request to submit at least one of the forms and some jasvcript to pause the form s submission while you send the ajax reques

9403404
put	get
i guess another way of doing this would be to first maybe do a put to mark the top most item as reserved in some way then do a get and delete

9403441
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
but basically finally finished my website but now i m failing at getting it to work in all browsers fine in google-chrome and firefox also checking on browser testing websites seems fine in opera as well but as per usual internet explorer refuses to play nice and the menu s just fail to load all together

9403472
textmate	sublimetext
sublimetext 2 uses textmate snippets so you could use this

9403488
multiplying	add
then to get the true count you multiplying fourbillion by 4 000 000 000 then add count

9403490
for-loop	arrays
having used a for-loop to build your arrays into a comma-separated string sent you down the wrong path

9403495
rss	feed

how do i get a cross compiler setup so that gcc will recognize the mips assembly language instead of x86

as for any images you use you can include a regular and higher-res the same image scaled with double height and double width and the appropriate one will automatically be used

9403926

so far i have investigated the command xxd for a bit and i am able to save a specific portion of a hex dump from a binary file

9404789

9404829
children	parent
you can also use the delegation programming pattern where the parent will get the events for itself and the children so you can avoid confusion and potentially can save memory with larger applications

9404847
post	get
to do this i am retrieving the oauth_token from the database to post the message but when i look at the response before the section of code that does actual status update i get an error saying

9404855
children	parent
have you considered having special offer items as children to the main item as then it encapsulates the entire offer together and deleting the parent deletes the child

9404855
children	parent
essentially you have methods that allow the items to be exposed as both a flat array and as a hierarchy of parent children and siblings

9404886
qobject	qwidget
note that findchild and findchildren are methods of qobject - so if your form does not have them it cannot be a qwidget because all widgets inherit qobject

9404911
crossover	mutation
only take the top 50 of chromosomes and move them onto the next generation where you create children chromosomes based on your choice of a crossover function and a probability of mutation- for this type of problem i recommend a very light crossover function or none... and a decent mutation rate

9404921
int	chars
i need a function that takes four unsigned chars variables as parameters and combines them into an unsigned int

9404921
int	chars
the first chars variable being the first byte of the int the second chars being the second byte and so on

9404933
stdout	stderr
0 ist stdin 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

9404933
stdout	stderr
in this case i suspect they are used to capture stdout stderr of the freshly forked programs

9404933
stdout	stderr
this would mean that wc probably runs with its stdout connected to fd 3 and stderr to fd 4 so the main application can could the output of wc

9404955
put	get
you can get boost to print out the type of the value that boost creates from parsing by defining a functor that will take any parameters and tell you what they are the following code is adapted from some code sehe put on so chat

nsmanagedobject	nspersistentdocument
i m not doing anything special in nspersistentdocument or with the nsmanagedobject classes

9404962
nspersistentdocument	nspersistentstore
my understanding based on the documentation from apple is that in using an nspersistentdocument subclass i don t need to do the work of setting up the nspersistentstore or nspersistentstorecoordinator

9405049
folder	directory
i m hoping to keep all images in a folder outside the webroot so i don t think there s an issue with users accessing files they aren t entitled to see but are there other reasons why you might want to take a hash of the file and use it to generate the directory structure or use some other sort of pseudo-randomly generated gobbledegook instead of part of a username to generate directory structure

9405081
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as of this writing the tool works well with google-chrome safari and via a shim firefox

9405091

the canvas game works with safari and firefox but at 50-60 of the performance experienced in google-chrome

9405111
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
using the same code in google-chrome or safari i tested maps with 500x500 tiles yes that is 250 000 tiles where firefox choked on 10 000 tiles.... which runs smoothly consistently in both google-chrome and safari though safari is 60 of the frame rate google-chrome manages

9405111
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
another temporary idea i was thinking of if a user has google-chrome the game window will be 700x500px on the screen if they have safari drop it to like 500x375px to achieve the same frame rate and if they have firefox the window will be like 400x300px

9405120
nsmanagedobject	nspersistentdocument
i have an nspersistentdocument subclass using nsmanagedobject subclasses for my data

9405136
folder	directory
i also went into my local appdata folder and changed the path of the default workspace location within the config.ini folder and changed it to a directory that does not have spaces in its name in hopes that would resolve the issue

9405159
folder	directory
if you already understand the differences and are convinced to approach using a folder structure the main reasoning behind creating a hash for the folder structure is to prevent unauthorized access by someone altering the directory to

9405210
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
after the installation i ve tried it and it works fine on my ubuntu 10.10 but when i try to install it on centos linux the only page that works is the home page index.php

namely lots of if not all global functions and variables to show hide generally control the page elements

9405431
post	get
for post and get requests it works great

9405431
post	put
so i thought i would be clever and use the x-http-method-override to specify put and then post the request to the resource server

9405447
versioning	upgrade
i know there are some communities forums in china they created their own versioning of market app and have groups of people pirate popular application newly added or upgrade daily and publish the cracked versioning in their own fake market app if you buy a samsung galaxy tab in china it comes with this kind of fake market app and you can download most popular app games from here

9405459
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr would be both stdout and strerr escaped if used with cmd c

9405577
portrait	landscape
the activity that contains the fragment has a portrait layout in res layout and an almost identical landscape layout in res layout-land

9405596
width	height
not sure if you are asking how to obtain the width and height of an image but if not then simply get a random int between 0 and each image dimension

9405623
persistent	transient
if your collection is only used for transforming persistent childrealkeys in a transient way then it should be notpersistent childlist

google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome firefox and ie 8 on windows

9405818
post	put	post	get	put	get
i just think that they happened to not do it in the best way and you can get around it depending on how exactly you are using the urlloader to upload the file if you put a filename in the post for the urlloader it should error out but you can get around that by base64 encoding the file and sending that with the urlloader to php

9405825
qspinbox	qslider
i make a relation between qspinbox and qslider

9405825
qspinbox	qslider
qspinbox has a range -10.0 to 10.0 and qslider has a range -100 to 100

9405825
qspinbox	qslider
so the value of qslider divided by 10 is connect to qspinbox and vice versa

9405825
qspinbox	qslider
and i want to type 3.5 in qspinbox in this case when i type just 3 qspinbox s valuechanged change qslider s value and qslider do again

margin	height
is there a way to find out the total height in float value of an excel worksheet page programatically after minus the top and bottom margin in c#

9405888
int	chars
the only exception would be if you had an object with a bunch of eg int fields and you converted that to a json representation either json object or json array as chars values

it is also possible to return any query as an rss feed json or xml

9405905

9406001
mouseleave	mouseenter
i just found out that firefox is natively supporting mouseenter and mouseleave events

9406001
opera	firefox
this means we have ie and firefox support and as soon as webkit jumps on the band wagon we have a cross browser solution no one cares about opera in aus

9406017
hash	salt
for many years now it s been considered a much better practice to store a hash of the password combined with a salt value

9406017
hash	salt
then store the hash password plus the random salt bytes in the database

9406017
hash	salt
to check a user password when authenticating prepend or append as appropriate the user s saved salt value accessed by claimed user name to the supplied alleged password and apply the same hash function

the idea is to extract the addition multiplication et al operations as function calls

9406126
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
the link provides an operator class that uses expressions to provide addition multiplication division subtraction less than equality and other operators.

integer	unsigned
the input for getcolorfromargb is a 32-bit unsigned integer

9406155
children	parent
redis is much faster on big datasets because the lookup time is constant no matter how much parent do you have and how big is the children set for each of them

9406155
children	parent
but if you have to do any lookups more complex than have id of parent need to get ids of children then you will have more problems than advantages with redis

9406208
rss	feed
not an rss feed

why can t we always set them to private and use getter setter instead

that way if min or max change in future your users won t get confused -

9406464

ubuntu	debian
git-svn is officially supported it is build-in in windows version and easy to install in debian ubuntu with deb packages

9406524
qtoolbutton	qpushbutton

post	get
so inside my archive-property.php file added a form get method with a dropdown box so users are able to set how many post they want to display per page it looks like this

in windows forms c# is there a way to set the tooltip s height and width dynamically meaning in code

9406846

the flag is hide show without resizing the table layout

9406873
mouseout	mouseenter
hover takes 2 handlers for mouseenter and mouseout

9406889
jsf	seam
as best i can deduce with my investigations so far the problem here is with how seam forwards facesmessages from one jsf context to another

9406892

put	get
at the moment i don t think that structs destructors ever get run if they re put on the heap because the gc doesn t have the information that it needs to do so that should be fixed at some point in the future though

9411973
put	get	free	malloc
edit you could also use malloc and free with std.conv.emplace to put the object in a non-gc allocated chunk of memory like you d have in c++ but i think that you d have to explicitly call the destructor to get it run since free doesn t understand about destructors it being a c function

9411973
free	malloc
however you could then create a free function similar to new which does the malloc and emplace for you and then have a free function similar to delete which calls the destructor and free which would give you the same situation as c++

when we re calling from a subclassing super contains the reference to it s superclass.in the same manner the super in superclass itself has reference to it s superclass in this way upto java.lang.object

9416204
hide	show
if you really want to show your tray-icon you can popup a balloon with minimal text and just afterwards hide the balloon and it s shadow again by following code-example

9416233
int	boolean
this method accepts an int variable by reference and returns a boolean indicating whether the conversion was successful so you don t have to do any error handling when calling tryparse

9416242
width	height
you cannot set width height of the background image

9416245
getter	setter
i have read in many places that getter and setter are evil

9416246
width	height
what you could do is create an absolutely positioned img and then using the image attributes set the width and height

9416309
getter	setter
i have read in many places that getter and setter are evil

9416367
put	get
connection with method put id number and get data list

9416373
google-chrome	safari
the problem occurs in google-chrome and safari

9416386
getter	setter
on the contrary the getter and setter help you to protect the consistense of the variables

9416386
getter	setter
the importance of getter and setter is to provide protection to private attributes so that they can not be accessed directly for this it is best that you create a class with the attribute item in which you include the corresponding get and set

9416456
width	height
the concept was that multiple portions of the page would be at 100 width but with predefined height

9416499
getter	setter
the following sample is a brilliant example of boilerplate setter and getter

9416499
getter	setter
my advice - don t write dummy getter and setter use getter and setter only if they guard the invariant of your class

9416504
int	boolean
just use boolean strait up rather than int 0 or int 1

9416504
int	boolean
if you really want to use int for the public property then you will need to use a converter as ischecked is boolean

9416504
int	boolean
if you want an int to represent the current selected then you could set that value in the set of the boolean public property

9416552
superclass	subclassing
so i have the class superclass which currently has a member variable o of object type which will take a single instance of one of the subclassing class subclassa and class subclassb

9416583
for-loop	loops
if i decompile the class file i can get see for-loop only but certain machines of certain developer s it becomes do while loops

9416599
superclass	subclassing
but i have a feel that you are doing something wrong with that o member variable - it s not a common situation when a superclass needs to have a subclassing as a member

9416619
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
after trying to figure out why it s being called twice i found out that the second call happened between viewwillappear and viewdidappear of the gameviewcontroller

9416662
google-chrome	firefox
edit 3 this works on google-chrome but not on firefox

9416761
google-chrome	firefox
you can see how it is different from firefox and google-chrome

9416883
hide	show
got a question is it possible to hide image and show iframe which are inside the div but to apply these changes just in this div there are multiple div with the same class for example

9416883
hide	show
all i want is when i click on image is to hide this image and show the iframe but just for one div as u can see there are multiple divs with the same class is it possible using javascript or jquery

9416888

try to post code that is exactly the code you ve run and preferably self-contained not reading files you don t provide etc. to get the best answers possible

9416903
nstextfield	nsslider
i m using an nsslider control and i ve configured it to use continuous mode so that i can continually update an nstextfield with the current value of the slider while the user is sliding it around

9416906
int	chars
what you have is a string whose chars happen to represent an int

9416955
versioning	upgrade
jdk is usually lagging in versioning of xml parser so most likely metro is using a newer versioning need to be checked and at least it would be under your control as a dependency - you could always test your app with a newer versioning of metro before deploying to production as opposed to jdk which might just change with system upgrade or from system to system etc

9416961
google-chrome	firefox
you can use something like firebug for firefox or google-chrome s developer tools to check your javascript

9416979
put	get
when i get the correct code and result i want to put the result of data into an uneditable text view

9417029

session userdata lost for google-chrome and ie but ok on firefox

9417142
hide	show
how can you hide your keyboard by swiping it horizontally and show another view on its place

9417165
public	protected
am i correct and if i am not why should it be public or protected

9417202
hide	show
the jquery mechanism to keep track if a row status is show is to check if the clickable text is show or hide

9417202
hide	show
i get that this should work fine for regular links where there is actual show or hide text to check for and change but it also works on tags that do not have any text that could alternate between hide and show

9417202
hide	show
end result toggles the img alt property and keeps check on show hide status

9417239
clojure.test	midje
midje provides a migration path from clojure.test to a more flexible readable abstract and gracious style of testing

9417242
nunit	mstest
the above is an example for nunit but the same holds true for mstest

9417251
uilabel	nsstring
maybe this handy nsstring category can help you to display the text how you want in a uilabel

9417284
strace	systemtap
there are many tools do the function trace work either in userspace or kernelspace on linux ftrace ust ltrace utrace strace systemtap

9417319
super	self
one quick solution to this might be to subclass nsslider nsslidercell and override the mouse dragging machinery to call super then post a custom nssliderdidchangetemporaryvalue or whatever name you choose notification with self as the object

9417377
rtp	rtsp
i look for an open source rtsp rtp stack with c language because i want to connect from a micro-controller to media servers to play internet radio stations

9417381
implements	extends
you could extends splqueue implements serializable and then construct some appropriate serialization unserialization strategy for this purpose

9417387
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
better use synchronization mechanisms like autoresetevent or manualresetevent and wait for events to happen

9417390
google-chrome	firefox	ssl	https
my website links are forced to use ssl and when i click on any the browser shows ok for ssl on google-chrome green color on https safe site or identified certificate on firefox and the same ok working ssl on other browsers

9417390
google-chrome	firefox
now the problem starts whenever i rewrite the url using mod_rewrite and shorten the link a red sign shows up on google-chrome not identified on firefox and the same issue on other browsers

9417422
appendto	each
jquery documentation not each appendto

9417431

it only to hide and don t show the rows again

9417438
bluetooth	usb
rather i am looking to issue at commands from a pc to an android phone over a serial link such as rs232 usb bluetooth

9417462
int	chars
suppose i decided to typedef chars titem then the array contains chars if i typedef int titem then the array contains int

9417467
mouseover	mouseout
however when my cursor enters the inner div my mouseout function fires even though the mouseover event should bubble from the inner div to the outer div

9417516
put	get
if you have control over the flash you can put an actionscript event that will then get passed to the browser

9417591
prawn	pdfkit
prawn or pdfkit seem to be the two most popular right now

9417603
width	height
it seems the maths is off or i m setting the incorrect params with the width height x y values as when you draw the rectangle does not follow the cursor correctly

9417609
textview	imageview
i would like to define my own view class that consists of several textview imageview progressviews into one displayclass with these as elements

9417658
drive	createfile
createfile should be your starting point as it allows you to get a handle to the physical drive

9417658
drive	createfile
you can use the createfile function to open a physical disk drive or a volume which

9417670
getter	setter
having a getter setter somewhere that is updating data somehow can cause this

9417683
jar	war
to generate jar war etc look into file - export menu

9417687
rtp	rtcp
unfortunately i m still stuck with a little implementation of a rtp rtcp communication to access my ip camera properly

9417687
udp	rtp
a port on which i receive the data sent via rtp based on udp - handling this is none of my concern i even have absolutely no access to it i just wanted to mention it for the sake of completeness

9417687
rtsp	rtcp
i even looked at the communication rtsp and rtcp which is almost completely the same as in my application...the one thing missing i m gonna mention below

9417715
ubuntu	mint
i m no expert myself but i recall mint being a spin-off from ubuntu so it might be worth googling how to install opencv in that distro as a starting point

9417721
getter	setter
i think it s much more simple if you want juste get and set value of a field by using methods provides by java reflection api rather than trying to get getter and setter method s names manually

9417737
drive	createfile
then use setfilepointerex so you can move the offset where you want to read readfile fills a buffer with bytes read from the disk drive closehandle closes the handle opened by createfile

9417780
google-chrome	firefox
i have a small webm video that plays fine in google-chrome but not firefox

9417818
getter	setter
and else are setter and getter

9417851
background-repeat	background-position
the other solution is to put your style properties into separate data- attributes one for background another one for background-repeat and yet another one for background-position

9417912
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari 4+ google-chrome 1+ firefox 3.6+ and opera 11.10+ are now supporting css3 gradients

9417941
websphere	ibm
i have a simple project built with eclipse 3.4 aka ibm rad on websphere 7

9417967
folder	directory
in linux how do i check all folder in a directory and output the name of all directory that are empty to a list

9417971
children	parent
the problem is the way ef works since parent has a reference to children ef loads children automatically when the parent list is loaded but it gets active and inactive children also the children list is not ordered

9417977
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	pop-up	dialog
when i try and upload a file using asp.net mvc it works fine in firefox google-chrome but in ie and opera a dialog pop-up which asks me to either download save or cancel

9418096
firefox	safari
but it looks like normal tab not as mac osx safari preferences or vlc preferences or firefox preferences tabs with large icons and the text at the bottom of those icons

9418114
min	max
defines min and max as

9418114
min	max
interesting error messages if you define your own min or max

9418118
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
of course it works fine in google-chrome firefox safari etc

9418124
accessor	properties
for example an interface might declare a properties that has a get accessor

9418124
accessor	properties
the class that implements the interface can declare the same properties with both a get and set accessor

9418124
accessor	properties
when we specifically mentioned that the properties should be read only only get accessor in the interface why is it allowed to implement set accessor also

9418128
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari however the second image is not shown

9418128
google-chrome	firefox
this works in both firefox and google-chrome

9418128
width	height
this was true even when i wrapped the in a with an explicit viewbox height and width and referenced that with the instead of the

9418145
put	get
i have two rest classes for a simple web service jersey and glassfish that involves user resources - one to operate on all users a factory for posting and another on individual users get put delete

9418146
getter	setter
when should you use getter and setter

9418146
getter	setter
getter and setter are great for configuring or determining the configuration of a class or retrieving data from a model

9418146
getter	setter
you can also provide getter without setter

9418146
getter	setter
when shouldn t you use getter and setter

9418146
getter	setter
if you have data that is for all intents and purposes public but needs to be managed use getter and setter

9418146
getter	setter
if you have data that needs to be retrieved but under no circumstances should ever be changed use a getter but not a setter

9418146
getter	setter
if you have data that needs to be set for internal purposes and should never be publicly exposed and cannot be set at instantiation use a setter but not a getter setter presumably prevents a second call affecting the internal property

9418146
getter	setter
don t forget that setter and getter can be private and even for internally managed properties having a setter that manages the property may be desirable

9418146
getter	setter
allen holub s article why getter and setter methods are evil seems to be the source of op s reasoning but in my opinion the article does a poor job of explaining its point

9418150
int	chars
this unit test will fail because you have specified the pattern must have an int 2-7 at the 4th chars positionm where as file1 has 1

9418151
button	checkbox
for select boxes checkbox and radio button the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus

9418151
mouse	keyboard
i want the event to fire whenever a text field has visibly changed accounting for the various ways it might change keyboard mouse copy-and-paste etc.

9418158
accessor	properties
when we specifically mentioned that the properties should be read only only get accessor in the interface why is it allowed to implement set accessor also

9418169
hide	show
i suppose you want to hide or show multiple tree items based on isvisible value in the specific key

9418175
implements	extends
besides extends beyond requirements of a contract you can add any other methods and or properties and also implements other interfaces in the same class

9418179
ready	each
pathfinding algorithm is ready just i need to generate the list or vector of target points one for each unit

9418200
ienumerable	ilist
i usually use ilist or ienumerable although i suppose you could also return object

9418212
filtering	grouping
i ve tried joins which just multiplies the sums and i ve tried subqueries that won t let me use a date filtering because it s not used in the grouping by clause

9418220
sorting	grouping
use observablecollection.add item and then refresh the collectionviewsource which will automatically sort and grouping the data if you have the sorting and grouping setup correctly

9418228
onclick	onkeyup	mouse	keyboard
onkeyup for keyboard and onclick for mouse might do the trick

9418249
client-side	server-side
i figured that it ll be more convenient to reuse server-side jade templates on client-side so i m ditching underscore templates in favor of jade

9418251
accessor	properties
as far as fooworker is concerned the foo parameter only has a get accessor for the name properties

9418274
accessor	properties
back to your example the interface defining the properties is stating that it must have a public get accessor

9418274
public	protected
the set accessor could be public internal protected private or nonexistent

9418321
width	margin
i know i can do this if i was to split it into three tables and set each one to have a width xxxpx and margin 0 auto but would rather not do that

9418344
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
the problem is that you only bind the hover event technically mouseenter + mouseleave when in the mouseover event for content

9418344
mouseover	mouseleave
- why do you only bind your events click or hover under mouseover and mouseleave

9418349
mouseout	mouseleave
if you are referencing jquery which you are then you can use mouseleave instead of mouseout as it will behave like you are expecting

9418385
subtract	add
but what seems to end up happening is that either it doesn t work at all or the increment decrement gauge operations end up fighting each other or it will all seem to work properly but continue to subtract or add points gauge in the background

9418396
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
actually this statement is true with generated mocks like those of mockito powermockito easymock etc.

9418405
put	get
i am writing some fixed length records to a queue in berkeley db and get back the record number agter each put

9418426
noexcept	throw
throw has been replaced by noexcept presumably with the hope that

9418508
floating-point	fixed-point
uses fixed-point operations rewrite the code to use floating-point

9418605
post	get
once you re set with post turn off get in your webserver

9418606
noexcept	throw
in c++11 you might use noexcept which gives a compile-time check that nothing can throw rather than a run-time check that nothing does throw

9418609
awt	swing
keylistener isn t designated for listening in swing gui this listener was builded for pre_historic awt component these days so far away use keybindings this example can save your person

9418661
pem	pkcs#12
i was following instructions here on stack overflow to convert it to pem and then to pkcs#12 files but i m stuck

9418661
pem	pkcs#12
when i then attempt to convert the pem to pkcs#12 it wants a private key of some sort and i don t know where to get it

9418716
hash	salt
the password is definitely encoded as utf-16 and the salt is definitely base-64 encoded but i don t think the result of the hash is base-64 encoded

9418743
move	drag
the problem is when i pick a single viewcontroller from the objects drag it to the canvas put it on the left side of the existing splitviewcontroller screen then move the initial segue to this new viewcontroller

9418774
x86	64bit
i was referencing an x86 assembly on a 64bit server

9418777
mvp	presenter
it has the concept of nested presenter views which might come handy if you want to create reusable mvp components

9418786
x86	64bit
i was referencing an x86 assembly on a 64bit server

9418796
x86	64bit
i was referencing an x86 assembly on a 64bit server

9418814
rtp	rtsp
back then i used ffmpeg if i m not mistaken to compress the stream from a camera and live library to generate the rtsp rtp stream

9418889
for-loop	loops
if you have a for-loop or some other loops handling these requests you can also create a more local autorelease pool within loops and then drain it just before loops ends

9418891
versioning	upgrade
i would like to redirect any browser that is using an old versioning of java silverlight flash etc to a quarantine page asking them to upgrade their browser before they are permitted to log in

9418913
implements	extends
here you could do 2 things one is extends the mailservlet class that is on the src folder in foundation this is the one that uses the foundation mail action then you extends or create a custom action for use it with the cq form components or you can implements a servlet with the mailservice class

9418947
pull	push
1 grant the contractor pull access but not push to the repository

9418963
svg	vml
something you want to force into the attributes of the output svg vml markup on the page dom

9418963
svg	vml
forcing custom attribute into the svg or vml markup in the browser

9418963
svg	vml
but if you really do need something in the markup that raphael just doesn t support you can create a rudimentary control for manipulating it using attr and animate by using paper.customattributes and element.node note that the documentation for element.node is pretty much just the highly unhelpful don t mess with it - the reason you shouldn t mess with it is it gives you the svg or vml element directly which means raphael doesn t know about any of the changes you make to it which may put your raphael object out of sync with the element it controls potentially breaking stuff

9418963
svg	vml
here s an example assuming jquery is also being used jquery isn t essential but is more convenient that sets the svg property dy which allows you to control line spacing of raphael text note - example code not yet tested in vml ie

9418970
pull	push
the contractor would have push pull rights to the repo that is a submodule but no commit rights on the main repo

9418972
for-loop	loops
if i have a while loops with a for-loop inside of the while loops how can i break both loops

9419059
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
at the same time ie google-chrome safari and even my 2.5 year old htc android phone can generate maps 500x300+ tiles though the phone only runs at 4fps but it at least makes it through the initialization + draws the map unlike firefox on my desktop pc

9419059
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in resource monitor my cpu and ram max immediately in firefox then give the close document to prevent data loss error...but my phone can handle much larger maps than my desktop which makes me believe there s a bug with how firefox handles loops compared to ie google-chrome safari opera and my phone which handle much larger loops

9419093
width	height
in ie 8 the height width of the element isn t getting rendered--so it s collapsing and becoming invisible

9419093
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
you ll want to apply this same principle to other inline elements that you re trying to get to behave more like block-level elements setting width height margin padding is usually a good hint on this behavior

9419146
put	get
there are many existing implementations of ode solvers which people have put a lot of work in to - while it is good that you are interested in knowing how they work these solvers can get pretty complicated so if you aren t satisfied with the results you get from your own attempts it might be a better idea to look into existing routines such as those in the gnu scientific library

9419162
pop-up	dialog
if i have a url that when submitted in a web browser pop-up a dialog box to save a zip file...how would i go about catching and downloading this zip file in python

9419199
post	get
how can i get the sitefinity blog list widget to generate urls to the original blog post location

9419214
post	get
edit you should always sanitize variables that come from the get or post arrays before assigning them to variables

9419226
memcached	ncache
while i am not quick to say use custom code there is a benefit with cache if the site is growing in users as you can one day flip to a distributed cache like appfabric caching ncache very web friendly or memcached

hello guys im trying to set a max width and height so that when my the data in my cells expands it does not go past that size....does not seem to work

9419941
integer	radix
i know i can use parseint string radix to get the integer value

9419947
implements	extends
probably the most straight forward way is to implements validateable which is probably easiest to do by extends actionsupport

pbkdf2	salt
create a random number per password and save the salt 16 bytes with the output of pbkdf2

9420045
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
the salt and password are hash so they may have any length to be compatible with pbkdf2

9420093
versioning	upgrade
after seeing rabbitmq - upgrade to a new versioning and got a lot of precondition_failed unknown delivery tag 1

9420111

opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i change the message but somehow it does not work in firefox it works perfectly fine on ie or opera or safari

9420179
cos	sin
so i m trying to swap that line out with the .matrix and dynamically calculate the sin cos values on the fly

9420182
webrat	cucumber
i am using rails 3.2 with spec-rails cucumber and capybara instead of webrat

9420254
firefox	safari
it works in dreamweaver thought not even in live view but sticks to the top and left in safari and firefox

9420296
put	get
however when i put the httpclient request into bootservice i get a anr application not responding

9420308
put	get
you must still put multiple true expanded true to get checkboxes

9420313
post	put
3 use the following post build event in every project you put a .csproj.nuspec file please remove the enter keys

9420316
restrict	shared
this is very useful in shared hosting models where you re normally restrict in what you can install on the server

9420320
jar	war
now i was wondering how it would be possible to package this pep in a jar file or war ear

9420331
post	get
i get result after i send post data to bookmark gpon websetting_keyword

9420340
inherited	properties
they are not the same because even simple types are inherited from system.object - they are actually objects and different object types even with the same properties values are not equal

9420355
stdout	stderr
and then grab their runtimes and stdout stderr

9420382
ienumerable	iequalitycomparer
well you can use an enumerable.intersect of tsource method ienumerable of tsource ienumerable of tsource iequalitycomparer of tsource

9420392
button	checkbox
if you click on add button on the new demo the checkbox will be added checked which corresponds the setting

9420419
width	height
plus you no longer have to care as much about various devices resolutions so that all the stuff you put on screen is well proportioned you still have to care about width and height ratio s but that s a lot better

9420430
filtering	grouping
this calls the create action in the comments controller which has a before filtering that checks that the user belongs to the correct grouping

9420430
post	get	filtering	grouping
the before filtering has a redirect to a dashboard page but when i attempt to post a comment with a user who is not in the correct grouping the comment does not get created but the redirect does not happen

9420442
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
however i noticed that it does not change the uicolor of the uinavigationbar used by uinavigationcontroller mine comes from a uistoryboard

9420478
getter	setter
creates getter and setter methods in your class

9420483

9420503
mouseover	mouseout
unfortunately out of the box dojo chart supports only three events click mouseover and mouseout

9420521
int	double
the actual input arguments may be of types byte int short uint float double decimal long etc

9420525
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller -- uinavigationcontroller -- uitableviewcontroller -- uitableviewcell

9420677
width	margin
the problem i am facing is that my controls are aligned to the left and in the cells with different column spans the right margin looks jagged all text input fields have slightly different width because the cell have different widths and the size is proportional to cell width which may vary due to different colspan see the picture

9420697
requestfactory	gwt
from gwt 2.1 requestfactory is better counterpart than gwt rpc when you use db4o together

9420708
screens	hdpi
i d advise just starting with a common resolution like 800x480 and hdpi which is a common density now but you ll want to test with a variety of resolutions and densities and in fact for a complicated application you might end up developing layouts for multiple screens sizes densities at which time you ll have to create appropriately different emulators or find appropriate devices to develop and test on

9420722
hash	salt
i read numerous articles stating that a salt should be as random as possible to add entropy to the hash and it looks like a great idea

9420722
hash	salt
you need to store the random salt along with your hash

9420722
hash	salt
given that an attacker somehow got access to your hash passwords and is trying to reverse the hash to plain text it means he probably dumped your database then got access to your random salt also

9420722
hash	salt
isn t it obvious that the weird looking value next to the hash in the database is a salt

9420722
hash	salt
if the attacker can access the salt along with the hash value how is that more secure

9420753
folder	directory
i would advise against renaming the folder inside the assets directory but rails may let you do that

9420771
scrypt	pbkdf2
nowadays you want to store your passwords using something like pbkdf2 or scrypt

9420779
hash	salt
as long as you generate a new best cryptogrpahically strong random salt for every password you want to store the hash of there is no problem

9420784
cpython	pypy
using pypy instead of cpython might also yield significant improvement

9420879
inherited	properties
you can have interface iprocess with method run wizard and properties name several processes and everyone inherited iprocess and class wizard that contain processes to run in the list

9420891
post	put
the controller does not update seem to know where a post goes when i change the foreign key in my case topic_id via a put request

9420909
onmouseover	onmouseup
keep a reference to the movieclip that triggers the event and nullify it if it triggers a onmouseout so you know when your over a movieclip put a onmouseup on the dragged movieclip so when its release you can look at which movieclip triggered onmouseover last and do what ever inventory you want

9420914
implements	extends
public class testpanel extends absolutepanel implements mousedownhandler

9420931
stdout	stderr
if you want stdout and stderr you can spawn 2 threads and then use popen.communicate and record the time

9420956
put	get
however when i put maillist in my send_mail function i get a

9420959
dictionary	map
in your code create a dictionary that would map between the facet value and the display string

9420982
put	get
however when i put the httpclient request into bootservice i get a anr application not responding

9420982
oncreate	ondestroy
this means that you were trying to do way too much work in onstartcommand or oncreate or ondestroy or onbind

9421012
hash	salt
the strength of your hash salt passwords rely on all of the following factors

9421029
wan	lan
even on a lan and certainly on a wan latency is going to vary a lot

9421032
google-chrome	firefox
edit i just checked and the links seem to be working in google-chrome but not firefox

9421059
cassini	iis
tested against cassini but similar behaviour seen on iis 7.5

9421088

in ie7 the margin for the element below has collapsed and overlaps with the bulleted element s but it s even worse as the browser seems to be confused as to the width of the bulleted heading

9421103
put	get
will get me to pydev but how can i just get java java browsing and xml off the menu and put pydev and debug on it

9421173
implements	extends
do i extends abstract locator creating a parallel inheritance tree do i implements the same methods without extends abstract locator this duplicating code or do i do something different that i haven t thought of

9421179
prepare	execute
for most like sql stmtstarting i can see the tsql but for execute prepare sql the textdata is blank

9421187
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome developer tool f12 or firefox firebug plugin to inspect the items to you want to style

9421192
pop-up	dialog
while there is definitely information about facebook api ajax php communication i can t seem to find an example where the permission dialog for an app showpermissiondialog is not done in a pop-up but rather in an ajax-funded div in-page

9421270
punctuation	words
this assumes that your words are separated by punctuation or spaces or whatnot and it doesn t require that your field contain multiple words

9421274
rss	feed
i recommend using the feedparser module to parse the rss feed which you can fetch with the requests module

9421291
filtering	grouping
if the filtering returns no results then grouping is simply set to null and no error message is generated

9421321
google-chrome	firefox
that being said op s code works for me with google-chrome 17.0.963.56 and firefox 8.0

9421322
actionscript	mxml
i want my mxml or actionscript components to be reusable and loosly coupled

9421329
nsurl	nsstring
what i need is the ability the take an nsurl or its nsstring representation and grab everything past the scheme and domain

9421337
mouseup	mousedown
to solve that i had to add an event handler for mouseup and mousedown to the pushpin and one for mappan for the map control

9421370
ienumerable	iqueryable
you probably will just need to cast the datasource to an ienumerable or iqueryable something like this

9421372
google-chrome	safari
however once the video starts playing and even after it gets paused the drop down menus above the video start getting jumbled in safari and in google-chrome the text isn t there at all

9421377
post	get
and my next question is if i just do post get request from node will it keep a session for me

9421390
memcpy	memset
if you want to study highly optimized arm assembly memcpy and memset routines i would recommend downloading the linux kernel source or the android source the bionic part

9421411
subtract	add
i thought the whole point of the listiterator was that it allowed you to modify add or subtract a list you are walking through

9421438
post	get
...how can i in the callcomplete handler get the value of the name post parameter

9421459
put	get
i guess that i can put some hidden field in the page and get the parameters from there but i think it is not the best approach

9421462
put	get
as griffeydog pointed out you may want to put the country id in for the select path so you can get the country by id or something instead of whatever is returned by tostring of your country object

9421471
rss	feed
using domdocument to fetch rss feed but have run into an odd issue

9421471

does anyone know of any c c++ or c# code that can open a flash drive volume and read it byte for byte efficiently so i can feed this to say an md5 or sha1 hash algorithm

9421554
codeigniter	cakephp
you also overlooked codeigniter and cakephp

9421592
aggregate-functions	sum
i m not a google.visualization user just a fusion-table user but i would guess that you need an aggregate-functions in your query select sector sum revenue from .

9421651
put	get
i am not sure what you get from mysql.query but make sure that each row is an array with what you want to put in a csv line and then do something like this

9421723
piston	tastypie
but packages like piston or tastypie are so convenient i can t really think of a real reason not to use them if your goal is to expose a restful api

9421749
mathml	tex
these controls take markup such as mathml or tex and render them as graphics

9421762
width	height
please note that i had an image with width 40 and height 30 so i hardcoded these values in several places

9421783
for-loop	loops
your code returns 99 because the final value of your loops variable i is 99 when for-loop finishes to execute

9421793
width	height
the weight attribute made it easy to give the child views within the layout equal width height

9421798
google-chrome	firefox
i verified that this is the case in internet explorer although firefox and google-chrome are fine

9421801
folder	directory
not sure if the file has to be in the root directory or in the folder with the html-documents just give it a try

we ll enable it again when we upgrade to a newer versioning of chromium embedded framework

9422109
lapply	strsplit
using strsplit and lapply gets you started

9422114
kde	gnome
it does a bit less than the heavyweight ones such as kde or gnome but handles things along the same lines

9422165
getter	setter
also your the field variables in your java class should be public or there should be public getter and setter methods

9422176
width	height
w h are width and height respectively

9422204
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

9422204
atomic	interlocked
use an interlocked compare exchange to do an atomic test and set

9422210
post	put
using backbone.emulatehttp which causes a 405 method not allowed error something i guess is caused by the x-http-method-override put header as normal post requests are working fine

9422214
maven	pom.xml
i have a few dependencies in a maven pom.xml i am trimming

9422234
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidappear should get called but viewdidload should only be called the first time the view is needed and if the view is needed and viewdidunload got called

9422235
width	margin
so left 50 gets the ul to the mid point of the parent li and then negative left margin half of the total width including borders 174

9422242
superclass	subclassing
edit note that the superclass constructor is implicitly called when you instantiate a subclassing

9422250
submit	submission
you could subscribe to the submit handler of the form and send an ajax request to verify whether the email has already been taken or not and if it is not taken manually trigger the submission of the form inside the success ajax callback

9422259
ubuntu	debian
you can find this usually in the etc sysconfig varnish if you re on redhat rhel or etc default varnish if you re on debian ubuntu

9422271
google-chrome	safari
i saw the problem on safari 5.1.2 as well but this minimal test case only triggers on google-chrome 17.0.963.56

9422284
ssdp	upnp
or 2 simple service discovery protocol ssdp in upnp on the other hand

9422284

9422309
int	chars	int	boolean
when comparing primitive data types like int chars boolean you can use etc

9422310
post	get
to answer part of your second question with .net if the post is larger than maxrequestlength part of the .net configuration but smaller than maxallowedcontentlength part of the iis configuration you can create a custom http module to get at the portion of the post that came through

9422326
google-chrome	firefox
i am developing an asp page and the gridview gridlines are not showing up in ie but it is showing up on firefox and google-chrome

9422432
fiddler	charles
if you re meaning you want to see what was sent to the server you can use a tool like fiddler if you re on windows or charles cross-platform but not free

9422463
postgresql	mysql
it works with mysql postgresql and sqlite

9422496
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i m not fond of the fact that it creates an empty arrays on the first pass or that it uses the if inside the for-loop instead of unrolling the test into two loops for speed at the expense of dryness but at least it s sort of terse

9422497
google-chrome	firefox
there s a firefox plugin called ff-html5notifications that acts as an adapter between the google-chrome notification api and firefox internal notification api which then again uses native notification systems on the respective platform growl libnotify

9422504
google-chrome	firefox
this works for me in a test docuemnt in ie 7-9 as well as in google-chrome and firefox

9422505
g++	gcc
perhaps the name got mangled because you use g++ to compile it instead of gcc

9422507
pop-up	dialog
if i click on a link to a video within a web page being displayed by uiwebview then the video plays but a dialog pop-up saying plugin handled load

9422518
bluetooth	usb
basically one would implement a serial communication either via bluetooth - or starting with level 12 using usb communication

9422574
doc	rtf
the catch is that you have to write open your source files with notepad++ then export them to rtf open the rtf and copy the pretty-formatted text to your doc file

9422582
textarea	textbox
also i m using the autocomplete feature form jquery successfully on textbox or textarea but if i try to use the same textarea that nicedit uses that is a text area with textareaid id it doesn t work beacause nicedit changes the textarea into divs with different ids in my case the html source id for that div is nicedit-main and the autocomplete does not work on the divs id

9422618
packets	multicast
you need to have your sender send its packets to this address and have your receiver join the multicast group to receive them

9422624
width	height
i am good on the part of having users set the image url height and width but saving the target is where i m stuck

9422668
nsurl	nsstring
nsbundle s pathforresource oftype expects an nsstring and not a nsurl

9422683
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux 11.10 and probably most up-to-date flavors of linux have the mountpoint command

9422691
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
also when your table cell is tapped you ll want to segue to a view controller probably a custom uiviewcontroller subclass not a uinavigationcontroller

9422742
folder	directory
amazon s3 doesn t actually have a native concept of folder directory rather is a flat storage architecture comprised of buckets and objects keys only - the directory style presentation seen in most tools for s3 including the aws management console itself is based solely on convention simulating a hierarchy for objects with identical prefixes tmp in your case

9422792
uiview	subviews
when i worked with views before i managed that through implementing sizethatfits in my custom uiview subclass which was called automatically by sizetofit whenever the view s subviews changed

9422814
vmware	bootcamp
when i run vmware with a clean image non bootcamp it seems to run ok however i ve found the best option is as follows

9422814
vmware	bootcamp
i ve found that bootcamp was slightly faster than vmware non bootcamp image but i still use vmware the majority of the time because i like using the host os for things like mail chat browsing

9422822
serializable	deserialization
the problme was not with the deserialization it was in the serializable -- you must create the serializable with the same base type as the deserializer i had created the serializable based upon the child type

9422828
disk	ram
in programming a workspace is an area of memory ram or disk based for which to perform operations

9422829
disk	ram
an area of memory ram or disk based for which to perform operations

9422853
persistent	transient
have a transient field repeatpassword and place the validation there rather than on the one that gets persistent in the db

9422886
hide	show
basically you want to recursively call a function that either hide or show an element from the callback function of the animation function

9422899
min	max
alternatively if someone knows of a zoom event that passes in the min and max y values i could probably recreate my manual labels with that data so let me know if you know of a way to get that information

9422924
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but not google-chrome

9422937
svg	vml
i m having issue with vml wich i use as fallback for svg

9422937

the problem occurs when i resize the image wich is a v image by changing the style attribute of height and width

9422942
punctuation	words
update thought of this after i went home but qtax got there first see other answer - try removing all the punctuation first then run plain words patterns on the text

9422961
actionscript	mxml
is there any conditional statement or state management like if x use this component else use other one preferably with mxml not actionscript

9423047
implements	extends
it seems that i have to run in circles with the game and the player adding generics to the extends implements but for the life of me i cannot get it straight

9423059
ivar	subclassing
in my nsmanagedobject subclassing i have an nsstring ivar that splits up into an nsset of entities

9423076
put	get
instead i get the contents of whatever i put into there as

9423081
google-chrome	firefox
the application work fine on all desktop based web browsers like firefox ie google-chrome etc

9423122
converter	multibinding
i would hence recommend you use a binding or multibinding with a converter you can pass in the control using a relativesource with mode self

9423123
implements	extends
extends classes must resolve the inherited type parameter with their own type and implements self to return this

9423157
post	get
as far as i know process.php is only accessed by my server and not the user therefor i have to submit the session object either through cookie get or post which are all easy to tamper with is that right

9423171
post	put
put the post check right before the data is submitted or redirect change header location to another success submitted page that contains the information required

9423188
put	get
if not why can two different strings be used to put and to get values from a hash

9423210
serializable	deserialization
here is a good blog post about how to use gserializer for serializable an deserialization with javascript

9423254
rss	feed
i am trying with the code below to get a bing rss news feed grab all the titles from this data to an array and then implode them all together so i have a variable with all the words together in a string so i can then create a word cloud out of this with another peice of code

9423254
rss	feed
so far it grabs the rss feed and print_r doc

9423272
put	get
i finally had to put everything in the controller to get it to talk to alm

9423322
opera	safari
in 1999 microsoft created the xmlhttp activex control in internet explorer 5 which was later adopted by mozilla safari opera and other browsers as the xmlhttprequest javascript object

9423364
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
push a uiviewcontroller containing a uiwebview onto your current view controller ensuring it s a uinavigationcontroller of course

9423438
textview	listactivity
i have a listactivity where i read set diferent controls such as textview buttons or listviews in oncreate method and also i use diferents methods of this controls inside oncreate method

9423439
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in firefox and ie6 don t ask but fails in google-chrome

9423441
width	height
so my question is is there a way to limit the height and width of launched activity and also can i show a bar with a button on it below other activities

9423537
processors	hyperthreading
dwnumberofprocessors from the msdn documentation says that it reports the number of logical processors in the current group which means that hyperthreading will increase the number of cpus reported

9423537
affinity	hyperthreading	affinity	processors	processors	hyperthreading
where _sc_nprocessors_onln documentation says the number of processors currently online available . this is not affected by the affinity of the process and is also affected by hyperthreading

9423568
post	get
it seems that i need to use a get instead of post but i cannot figure out how to set up the request to be a get

9423671
udp	tcp
do i use protocols like tcp or udp

9423671
udp	tcp
in such a case is it even possible to use tcp or udp

9423689
oncreate	recreate
this is why your main activity is restarting because oncreate is getting called again when your main activity resumes after being killed but it s not loading the data from the bundle to recreate the state to when the app was paused

9423694
udp	tcp
can can use protocols like tcp or udp directly between the two devices and that may or may not work depending on the protocols and how the devices are getting internet access

9423723
width	height
if your textview is within a relativelayout the width or height will have to be static 32dp

9423755
jobs	cron
this is either because such requests do some long computation so they can be done in the background or because they are periodic tasks like cron jobs that you need to schedule and execute repeatedly

9423769
int	chars
also please compare with chars values t instead of int

9423798
nsstring	nsdata
i know how to put a nsstring into my nsdata object but i don t know how to do this with a uint32 scalar type

9423819
post	get
for my implementation i needed a form view that returned a listview on both get and post

9423823
hide	show
that will show hide you content without messing up the layout

9423888
disk	ram
first off use enough ram for temp_buffers at least temporarily if you can so the temp table does not have to be written to disk

9423956
swt	swing
it is by far the most flexible and powerful layout manager for swing swt

9424014
free	malloc
dynamic think malloc which lives in the heap and pointers to this data are no longer valid after free is called

9424068
post	put
this error happens only with post and put request types as these two sort of expect to have a request body that includes the request parameters plain textual as well as attachments

9424084
for-loop	arrays
you re iterating through the files arrays with each entry in it being identified as file for the purposes of the code within the for-loop

i am also trying to return a list of folder within a directory and am currently using

9424291
for-loop	arrays
data is actually an arrays denoted by rather than an object so you want a regular for-loop rather than a for in

9424291
for-loop	arrays
in javascript the for in construct is used for iterating over object properties but to iterate an arrays an incremental for-loop is typically used

9424329
folder	directory
i am using the following code to detect if the folder .hg exists in the current directory

9424330
glut	sdl
i tried glut and sfml and both are easier to use than sdl and opengl alone

in my class getter and setter

9424414
maven	pom.xml
to make it easy for me to understand i created a new maven project and altered the pom.xml to include the following plugins

9424450
inherited	properties
an array is just a plain object with a special length method and handy methods inherited from array.prototype some of which depend on the special length properties

9424450
inherited	properties
therefore it is always recommended to include a hasownproperty test with for..in unless you want to include inherited enumerable properties

9424451
getter	setter
a getter setter will only be invoked if the property is not accessible directly

9424451
getter	setter
which means it s accessible from anywhere and the getter setter will not be invoked when accessing it

9424505
gif	png
png gives you better alpha result than gif

9424517

the easy answer is to use data get instead of data post

9424581
width	height
if you don t it will take the full width and height of the parent container and set this size for the framed window

9424583
min	max
1140 - mixing of group columns min max count ... with no group columns is illegal if there is no group by clause

clang	llvm	clang	icc
and do all modern compilers on unix-like systems gcc pcc tinycc icc llvm clang etc. still support the traditional svr4 #pragma weak

9424634
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
yes there are various methods to retrieve descendant elements such as getelementsbytagname but getelementbyid does not accept a css selector

9424634
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
in contrast to dom interface methods such as getelementbyid or getelementsbytagname jquery uses css selectors to get references to elements

9424649
macports	homebrew
there is a lot of variation on packaging here between linux distributions versions of postgresql and the various ways you can install postgresql on os x macports homebrew etc.

9424729
int	double
the value can be int or double or text or varchar.

9424738
portrait	landscape
most new android phones are probably over 800px in width for landscape mode which falls under more of a tablet portrait

9424741
post	get
additionally generally speaking using a get for change is not a good idea it would be better to use a post and then a redirect

9424753
nsnull	nsstring
at heart though objective-c is a dynamically typed system so it s a bit unnatural to force container types in that way and you may break unexpectedly as a result like what happens when a json parser gives you back a mixture of nsnumber nsstring and nsnull objects

9424797
int	double
in that case you are better off making different tables for double int etc

9424797
int	double
go with the first one or you can create tables called double int string etc

9424797
int	double
in the second option that i told you you store only as many double int and strings as required

9424847
wan	lan
routers give all computers within its local area network lan one public wan ip address

9424847
wan	lan
so computers in a lan share the same wan ip

9424847
wan	lan
for example if three lan computers share the wan ip of 1.1.1.1 we can setup a procedure called port forwarding to instruct the router to route all packets arriving on port 6000 to 192.168.1.101 3500

9424847
udp	tcp
hole punching comes in two flavors udp and tcp although tcp hole punching is a bit more complicated because tcp is inherently first a connection-oriented protocol

9424857
jerkson	jackson
jerkson uses jackson which is always the fastest json library on the jvm especially when stream reading writing large documents

9424863
free	malloc
you can solve this problem by returning a pointer to a memory region allocated with malloc although the caller must remember to free this memory or by taking a pointer as the argument to w_insc and then filling in the pointer with the returned value

9424883
min	max
the reason we assign these values to this numbers is to make finding max min possible

9424887
apache	nginx
my question hence becomes how would i determine if my passenger gem was installed for apache or nginx

9424899

9425100
width	height
i know the vector and the center width and height of the rectangle but the center can be 0 0 for the sake of simplicity

9425100
width	height
but there s has got to be a better more elegant way i m taking the length of the wider value between height and width of the rectangle and using every number in between that and 0 and testing that against each of the 4 sides of the rectangle and see if it s in it

9425102
int	double
i must use the prototype as given double base int exp

9425120

ember.js	sproutcore
i had selected sproutcore as a framework right before ember.js forked from sproutcore

9425307
ember.js	sproutcore
the efforts of sproutcore 2.0 now ember.js seemed to be going in the right direction of modularization and reuse of other javasript components jquery however it is really unclear from an outside view why the two efforts had to split.

9425393
post	put	post	get	put	get
the real answer is that loader.params is to create a http body hence it works for post put delete etc but not for get where the params are appended to the url

9425395
keydown	keyup
you can use the keypress keydown and keyup events

9425407
int	chars
lastly since chars are actually a limited range int a switch statement can be used to improve performance and readability

inherited	subclassing
as far as i know object cannot be instantiated if its constructor declared protected except only internally or from within any subclassing by inherited

9425770
inherited	subclassing
the parent class is not a subclassing of the child class it doesn t inherited a dime from it yet both extend the same base abstract-class so how come instantiation doesn t fail

9425805
width	height
will return the width in px and height will do similar

9425837

9426085
getter	setter
so you could keep them private and then provide getter and setter

9426091
superclass	subclassing
if you are duplicating the the logic and variables in each subclassing then better have it in superclass

9426091
getter	setter	public	protected
and modify access them using public protected getter setter

9426091
getter	setter
have the attribute and getter setter in abstract class

9426121
getter	setter
making a class abstract doesn t prevent you from implementing getter and setter either you can encapsulate these variables within the abstract base class forcing derived classes to call these methods in order to access the variables

to summarize the article the author is able to generate custom views for landscape and portrait orientations by pointing to a new top level view in an xib file upon detecting a device rotation

9426318
portrait	landscape
in a method where my code detects a landscape orientation my code points to the top of the landscape hierarchy and portrait when detecting portrait

9426318
portrait	landscape
this works except all the iboutlets uiview uibutton etc in landscape hierarchy are still referencing their equivalent objects in portrait view hierarchy

9426318
iboutlet	ibaction
i do a lot of special processing on these ui elements during the run time so i require iboutlet and not just ibaction

9426318
portrait	landscape	iboutlet	ibaction

internationalization	localization
if i would use resx files for internationalization localization under this scenario

9426828
post	put
the above will return an array index out of bounds if there are less than 5 comments though so you can either put some more logic in the template as below or you could create a getter method in your post model that gets the top5 comments and just call this instead which is probably the cleaner and preferred option

9426835
rspec	capybara
when i create integration tests with capybara rspec it seems to get the correct url and paths

9426895
width	height
dmytrodanylyk -- i think it will return width height as 0 so you need to use following thing

9426895

it will give you right height width

9427071
hide	show
i thought it would be an easy show hide function but each image is linked to a specific post using the same content div

perhaps this can be hooked into a global mouse and a global keyboard event handler

9427310
profiler	vtune
because to be even worse the newest intel vtune threading profiler also does not use .dbg files anymore so i really want a delphi to pdb converter

9427335
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is using i as a global variable so if your instance.set_marker function is also using i as a global variable and sets its value to something greater than 6 loops will exit

9427377

get cmake and put it in your path

9427377
clang	llvm
go to the llvm downloads page and download the llvm 3.0 source code along with the clang source code

9427377
put	get	folder	directory	clang	llvm
put the clang source directly in a folder called clang it must be called this exactly or you will build llvm but clang won t get built in the tools folder inside the llvm source folder this should make your directory look like

9427377
folder	directory
make a folder named build in the same directory as the llvm source folder

9427377
clang	llvm
the last argument is the relative path to the folder that has the llvm source in it and the clang source in the tools clang subdirectory

9427377
clang	llvm
this will compile llvm and clang and the clang executables will be generated in the build bin folder

9427377
clang	llvm
i was informed on the llvm irc that this is because clang implements parsing for lambdas but not semantic analysis which is the phase in which it crashes because they forgot to disable parsing lambdas for the 3.0 release and they already know about this bug

crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
since the only information we have about the users passwords would be in crypt 3 output format then to avoid sending the users passwords back in clear text as far as i can see we would need a client-side javascript implementation of crypt 3 so when the webserver provides a salt the client sends back the crypt 3 output appropriately hash for security

9431041
portrait	landscape
in other words the way the alertdialog is being displayed in portrait view is that it is blowing up a landscape view and thus some of it goes offscreen even though the actual orientation of the alertdialog is portrait like it should be

9431041
portrait	landscape
i ve even allowed the usability of landscape by getting rid of all calls to specify portrait landscape mode and the tablet is still expending the dialog off-screen when held in portrait view on just the tablet but not the phones

i thought inherited methods public or protected were somehow copied from the base to the child class

9436362
width	height
there is a related question here how to measure height width and distance of object using camera

9436369
put	get
if it does something else like put the name somewhere you can get it later then 1 this shouldn t be named getname and 2 you definitely need to document that fact in your javadoc

9436399
width	height
height width background-color whatever you want to find the default for

9436401
rss	feed
for example a web browser might use one interface to render an rss feed another to render an html web page and a third to display a pdf

9436464
stdout	stderr
in tcsh you don t use to redirect stderr you use that will redirect both stdout and stderr

9436488
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i need to populate a dropdownlistfor html with checkbox

9436512
inherited	properties
if they are meant to be value properties then you can create a base model and inherited that in your model classes which then will be available to all of your views using those models

9436547
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
what s happening is that i have a datagridview using a bindingsource sqldataadapter sqlcommandbuilder and a datatable

9436558

mapping-by-code	fluent
i d like to suggest you to read my blog series comparing mapping-by-code to fluent nhibernate - here is the table of contents and my final conclusions

9436681
superclass	subclassing
i would like to know in the init of my superclass if the subclassing has overridden a specific method

9436681
superclass	subclassing
is there any way for a superclass to know if a subclassing has overridden a method

9436890
decoder	encoder
so my idea was to strip the png format to the minimal information i needed and write an encoder decoder to support idat sections with 3 5 6 or 7bpp

9436904
post	get
in those situations myopenid sends back a post request where such characters get mangled

9436912
put	get
if you re willing to put up with some potential instability to get pure poco messages you might give it a try

9436931
nowjs	node.js
my current project uses node.js + nowjs + mongo-db

9436940
post	put	post	get	put	get
my issue is that i need to put the parameters in a post instead of encoding them in the url but this method results in a get with the form parameters in the url

9436955
put	get
now when i put the app in the background each time i get my login screen yeah with the exception of one

9436984
setinterval	settimeout
since you re running settimeout on timer every time you run the timer function which is every 1 second instead of using settimeout you should use setinterval

9436984
setinterval	settimeout
so now instead of running settimeout every 1 second you re running setinterval once and it will process every 1 second

9437008
.htaccess	httpd.conf
everything is done in my httpd.conf and not in .htaccess

9437009
opera	firefox
i tried ie firefox and opera

9437012
getter	setter
interface - abstract class that defines getter setter - implementations

9437012
getter	setter
the only benefit i can see is that classes extending abstractfoo don t need to re-implement their getter and setter

9437046
getter	setter
you would not just put getter and setter into the abstract class but anything that all implementations of the interface would likely have in common

9437046
implements	extends
implementors might still choose to not extends the abstract base class if they want to implements stuff in a completely different way

9437068
subclass	abstract-class
remember the person who writes the abstract-class is likely to provide at least one concrete subclass so the benefits accrue to them

9437068
getter	setter
getter and setter are not the point

9437106
spine.js	backbone.js
i have just about got my head around how javascript frameworks like backbone.js and spine.js deals with the client-side state of a data model in regards to updating views etc

9437118
google-chrome	firefox
what s odder is that google-chrome still seems to behave nicely and respect my 0 padding but firefox and ie appear to be adding about 4 or 5 pixels of vertical space

9437136
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie9 google-chrome and firefox

9437165
put	get
will get the length of each one and put it in an array for your viewing pleasure

9437197
gridview	rowdatabound
this is all done via the gridview rowdatabound method

9437208
exponent	modulo
if you only care about the least significant digits of the result for a programming contest then you can calculate the exponent modulo some value m

9437229
scheme	racket
to follow up from the scheme racket side of the fence

9437229
scheme	racket
racket and some other scheme implementations use a richer representation for syntax objects so that they can have properties attached to them indicating in racket at least what context they re bound in what source location they come from what pass of the compiler inserted them and any other information you might want to store cf

9437242
button	right-align
i want my button to be right-align and inside the tab border

i guess its out of my hands now i will update this post when i get an answer

9437285
hash	salt
when someone logs in you redo the same thing salt encrypt and then compare to the other hash stored in the database

9437285
hash	salt
the reason why two identical passwords may yield different hash is the salt

9437288
cpu	processors
the local apic timer sends an interrupt only to its processors while the pit raises a global interrupt which may be handled by any cpu in the system

9437289
rss	feed
my approach would be to use a tool to generate an rss feed for each of the urls containing your table data and then display the data in your ui be it wpf winforms or asp.net

9437289
rss	feed
this way you can easily set up additional channels when you find acquire a new website to pull data from and your work will be to normalize the new site into your standard rss feed format configurable in one of these tools and you could even configure your ui to pull the additional feed based on a config setting so no need to recompile when adding a new site

9437289
rss	feed
edit here is a link to good info about several tools that can be used to create the rss feed from any website

9437363
int	double
the first thing that comes to mind is that you shouldn t be using double but rather int arithmetic

9437373
hash	salt
two identical passwords can result in different hash because encrypto appends a random salt to the end of the password before hashing it

9437373
hash	salt
they basically use the salt to do the hash and then append the salt to the end of the hash

9437373
hash	salt
again if you look at the source code hasher.comparestringtohash you will see that the random salt is recovered from the stored hash and then used to compute a new hash from the entered password

9437377
width	height
i need two div layers with height width 100 each and when i click on div1 it has to slide from left to right to load div2 and when clicked on div2 it has to slide from right to left to load div1

this works in ie and firefox but not google-chrome

9437386
mouseup	mousedown
i can repeatedly mousedown and the window stays topmost as long as my mouseup doesn t come too quickly behind it

9437401
setinterval	settimeout
it would be better to use setinterval instead of settimeout

9437470
int	chars
there s no such thing as utf8 chars codes which should also be in int

9437503
devise	cancan
i have followed video tutorials and read docs on github for both devise gem and cancan gem

9437519
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade hibernate in a project from versioning 3 to 4

9437532
superclass	subclassing
there are more complicated ways of doing this say if you wanted the subclassing to be created dynamically and automatically registered with their superclass upon creation but there s no need to employ them in your situation

9437615
put	get
edit i can get my script to work if i put a sleep command before it starts and then click on the command prompt window it has to type into

9437635
min	max
the min and max prefixes as implemented by gecko are named min--moz-device-pixel-ratio and

9437665

when i run the app again my saved changes to this plist file are not seen since it loads the data from the project directory then saves it again to the temp simulator folder

9437670
clang	icc
note that these are intel s sse intrinsics and will work in gcc clang msvc and icc

9437680
mouseleave	mouseenter
i suspect you could manage it with the jquery mouseenter and mouseleave functions

9437716
maven	pom.xml
when packaging a project as a jar file maven includes the pom.xml file of the project inside the jar

9437730
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to create a simple dialog pop-up but it refuses to appear

9437774
width	height
you haven t done any scaling - if you want to have a fixed thumbnail width and height it will be distorted

9437775
opera	google-chrome
if i open it with google-chrome it only remembers the data from previous sessions in google-chrome and if i open it with opera it only reads the data from other sessions in opera

9437786
hide	show
after calling gtk_set_sensitive i d hide the panel with your widgets and show the panel with the label saying something like processing...

9437806
ant	maven
you can use ant s zip libraries from your java code maven dependencies can be found here

9437845
execvp	fork
also you should avoid using fork with execvp and use system instead

9437856
vb.net	vb6
this is in vb.net but it should be translatable to vb6 or whatever this basic language is that you are using

9437860
sse	avx
when dealing with both ints and floats in sse avx is it a good practice to convert all ints to floats and work only with floats

9437969
maven	pom.xml
i assume that it works by parsing all of the elements out of the project pom.xml and uses a service to query maven for each transitive dependency

9437969
maven	m2e
basically i m asking how does m2e populate the local maven cache stored at .m2

9437980
viewdidload	viewwillappear

9438137
jcarousel	caroufredsel
i have found scripts such as caroufredsel and jcarousel that support circular scrolling but carousels like these rely on jumping from one item to the next

9438156
ready	each
the result resource is essentially an iteratorâ each time you call php asks the database driver for the next row i don t know the specifics of the implementation but presumably this is to avoid loading potentially thousands of rows of data into memory all at once and let the database worry about holding on to the results until you re ready to use them

9438165
subtraction	addition
higher latencies and only single-issue addition subtraction on sandy bridge

9438184
button	checkbox
in the click event of a button on this page i want to read the value of the label if the checkbox adjacent to it is selected

9438208
strcpy	strncpy
the built in functions strcpy and strncpy do what your copy function does there s no need to reinvent the wheel

9438212
bash	zsh
you might also need to check that shell-file-name is customized to the location of your zsh binary instead of the default bin bash

9438262
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
again - as written below it works perfectly - in ie9 ff10 opera 11 safari and google-chrome

9438315
respond.js	modernizr
i cannot speak for yepnopejs but since respond.js is listed in modernizr it seems redundant

9438315
respond.js	modernizr
modernizr if used should determine whether or not respond.js is loaded

9438315
respond.js	modernizr
modernizr will conditionally load the scripts including respond.js client-side based on feature detects

9438319
implements	extends
and because crossedblockbrush doesn t implements or extends a defaultblockbrush you are getting a cast exception

9438334
setinterval	settimeout
the function constructor and settimeout setinterval with a string argument - eval in disguise

9438370
width	height
the dialog box must be able to withstand changes in width and height

9438370

but the div in the middle is only the size of the content inside of it even though i have set the height and width

9438383
post	put
benâ s post put forward the point that when pushstate is more widely adopted then we can leave hashbangs behind and return to traditional urls

9438392
hide	show
i am trying to use a toggle script to show and hide certain elements of a page.

9438396

inherited	subclassing
the best thing to do is impossible of course have a uiscrollview inherited from your uiview subclassing

9438487
width	height
besides being useless in this case the inline behavior is already working because of the floats inline property doesn t allow you to set the element s width or height

9438542
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
i would add some salt and produce an md5 hash delivered right with the plaintext

9438703
for-loop	while-loop
this will give you the flexibility you need you can use print statements to put comments at the top of the file and then use a for-loop or while-loop to print name value pairs for however many properties you want the file to contain

9438733
inherited	subclassing
you could create a base controller which is inherited by a subclassing per language and define a language specific action name for each base controller action method

9438736
keydown	keyup
keypress is not the best thing to use because it don t return on every character the same as keydown or keyup

9438741
ubuntu	debian
on some packaged installs of mongodb for example ubuntu debian

9438761
concave	convex
if your polygon is concave you ll probably find it easiest to first decompose it into multiple convex polygons which will simplify the available collision detection algorithms

9438774
width	height
because i have to set the width and height both to 200px to get the correct shape

9438774
width	height
i have to set the width and height of the rotated text which does not make it very flexible to work with and this also causes problem number 1

9438774
width	margin
i have to set the margin to 0 -100px because i have to set the width to 200px but once rotated its width is still 200px which would make the table incredible large

9438774
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i need it to work and have gotten it to the same point in ie7+ google-chrome firefox and opera

this doesn t answer your question but gives an alternative solution by making a textbox look like a textblock when the listboxitem isn t selected

9439350
maven	m2e
this is a well known behaviour of the new maven eclipse integration plugin m2e since eclipse indigo

as an alternative i suggest you map the data from the database to private members of your class and you provide getter and setter for access to them

9439400
hide	show
easy way would be to hide show views etc based on 2

9439429
calloc	malloc
if portability is important the library presents a wrapper around malloc or calloc to grab chunks of memory and then apply a more efficient implementation as measured against the particular goals the library wants to achieve

9439768
getter	setter
i m often been bitten by the needless coupling between property getter and setter in a derived class or derived interface you can t simply add a setter when the base class or base interface only has a getter

9439768
getter	setter
if you override a getter then you are not allowed to define a setter

9439768
getter	setter
and you can t define the setter as virtual but the getter as non-virtual

9439809
htmlcleaner	jsoup
hence you ll probably want to use some html parser jsoup htmlcleaner etc

raphael works in ie5+ fallback via vml safari google-chrome opera firefox but not in android before honeycomb

9440425
filtering	grouping
the problem is as follows a grouping of users 50k must be filtering from a db four fields for each user must be saved into a variable then a second process will take each user and proceed to enable some licences into another system platform

9440427
nexus	artifactory
here s how it works in a nutshell assuming your remote repository nexus or artifactory or the like and settings.xml are configured correctly

this would work for myisam or innodb

9440592
int	chars
i know that each line is formatted as two int but i don t know exactly how many chars they take up

9440636
getter	setter
why don t you have a public getter or setter instead of dealing with reflection

9440650
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am trying to programmatically create a uiviewcontroller subclass whose view includes some buttons and then add that to a uinavigationcontroller

width	height
set the contentwidth to be 3 times the width height of the view for 3 pages and set the contentoffset to be the center page view.bounds.size.width or view.bounds.size.height depending on whether you re scrolling horizontally vertically respectively

9440713
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
i use the buttons properties to set a specific layout height and layout width and specific layout margin left and top using dp units however when i change phone sizes in the emulator the buttons are the wrong size and wrong place on a lot of them

9440718
getter	setter
you are much better off testing the externally visible behaviour behaviour not getter and setter

9440756
accessor	properties
the attr_accessor s will overwrite the accessor generated by activerecord causing them to not be persisted in the db--they ll be like plain old ruby properties members instead of the meta-programmed magic of activerecord

9440849
ubuntu	linux
we have a java process on linux ubuntu that runs as a http server

9440852
multiplying	multiplication
you do not need to multiplying the number of elements you want by sizeof char because sizeof char is defined by the standard to always be 1 and multiplication by 1 yields the other operand

9440855
filtering	grouping
just add who to the grouping and then use where to filtering out id 3

9440862
union	distinct
if g is connected and you can run saucy on a different graph prepare a colored graph h consisting of the disjoint union of g with itself and for each i recolor vertex x i in the first copy of g and y i in the second copy of g to be color i distinct from the existing colors in g

9440941
width	margin
it s a menu bar home connect friends account and a login button and all is dynamic to the browser width so i can t put it margin auto

in windows i don t have this issue as much as i don t work from the terminal as often but i would really like to fully replace gedit with sublimetext in my ubuntu 11.10 install

9441026
superclass	subclassing
which means that another function that can take more arguments counts as a subclassing since it can process anything that the superclass can process and if it produces a smaller set of results that s okay since it will also obey the superclass construct that way

9441051
for-loop	loops
as for loops i have tried using a for-loop while and do while

9441092
int	chars
# returns false if the chars is not an int

9441096

these selections can only have the following properties applied to them font properties text-decoration text-transform letter-spacing word-spacing when appropriate line-height float vertical-align only if â floatâ is â noneâ margin properties padding properties border properties color property and background properties

9441116
sorting	filtering
i think the best way to structure an app like this is to have the data inside a custom object which has its own methods to modify the data later for example sorting and filtering so if foo is my object with the stock data i can do something like foo.sort or something like foo.render to create the html representation of the data

9441130
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
use bufferedreader and youll get 70 + improvement use stringbuilder instead of string buffer unless you need syncronization

9441130
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
stringbuilder and bufferedreader line by line 211 ms

9441130
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
stringbuilder and bufferedreader char by char 348 ms

9441130
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
so use stringbuilder + bufferedreader and make it read line by line for best results

9441138
multicastdelegate	delegation
there are actually two delegation types delegation and multicastdelegate

9441138
multicastdelegate	delegation
similarly multicastdelegate hold multiple delegation objects which each point to an individual object methodinfo combination

9441138
multicastdelegate	delegation
going back to implementation details when you define a delegation it creates an inherited class from multicastdelegate with an invoke method also the object can be null for static methods

9441146
post	get
remember that functions like get post and getjson will defer to this function so they will behave similarly

9441156
single-quotes	double-quotes
you re using single-quotes for your html attributes so within the inline onfocus handler your js should use double-quotes but because the whole string is in double-quotes you have to escape those double-quotes

9441159
calloc	malloc
instead of allocating the string this way you need to allocate fresh memory on the heap for it using malloc or calloc and set newstr to point to it

9441165
width	height
specify layout width and height attribute to the ur textview

9441172
uilabel	uitextview
i m thinking that i ll need to use uitextview or uilabel but i m having trouble making it work

9441182
multiplying	add
as i understand it you have a software implementation of a transcendental function like sin x expressed in terms of ieee standard operations such as floating point add and multiplying and you want to ensure that you get the same answer on all machines or at least all the machines that you care about

9441182
multiplying	add
to get that exact you would need to have a software implementation of the ieeee standard operations like fp add and multiplying

9441182
x86	64bit
1 shows how to change the x86 x87 precision control from 80 bit to 64bit using inline assembly

9441182
multiplying	add
-ffp-contract off --- disable fused multiplying add since not all of your target machines may have them

9441217
multicastdelegate	delegation
also i didn t discuss various other topics related to delegation such as chaining that s a feature provided by the multicastdelegate base class but hopefully i ve addressed your question

9441256
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i use google-chrome but i also need to make it work for firefox and safari

9441319

there is another type of exception unchecked-exception sometimes called runtimeexception because they all extend runtimeexception

9441413
for-loop	arrays
then i get stuck i cannot seem to figure out how to draw the arrays i know i need to use a for-loop to check through the arrays but this is my first time working with 2d arrays

9441419
filesystems	ntfs
outside of that i know system.getproperty and runtime have methods to grab information on the disk being used but nothing that specifically calls out the filesystems type ntfs fat32 etc.

9441449
wav	ogg
you should try to convert the wav file to an ogg file then you will get the best compress rate for sound file

9441461

for your reference when i get confused with views and the sequence of the methods i input nslogs in viewdidappear viewdidload drawrect and viewwillappear to clarify what is happening

9441488
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the sequence should be viewdidload - viewwillappear - drawrect - viewdidappear

9441495
button	checkbox
assuming you have a button or something on click of which you want to create a url with all the checked loctype checkbox values appended to the url seperated by or

mongodb	dbref
note that at the time of writing joins and relationships will only work with a relational database not for things like mongodb s dbref

9442211
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer

9442250
getter	setter
avoid calling the getattribute and setattribute methods of element objects in favor of accessing attribute properties that have getter and setter

9442269
google-chrome	safari
i ran into this problem and from some google search i realized that this is probably a bug in google-chrome and safari browsers

9442290
vbscript	vba	vbscript	jscript

the fake form could post to a non-existant url but you could then use javascript to intercept the onsubmit of the fake form copy the username and password into the invisible real form invoke submit on the real form and return false to prevent the original form submission from going through

9442546
inherited	subclassing
if you don t need a polymorphic query you will want to use mappedsuperclass which means that your base class contains annotations for mapping meta data which are inherited by the subclassing but the base class itself does not have an identity and therefore is not queryable but you can query for the sub classes

9442604
min	max	width	height
you can get get min and max width height to work in older ie

membase	couchbase
membase stats couchbase because we upgraded to 1.8.0

9442614
width	text-align
the first idea i had was to override dijit css to align tabs with text-align right but that would not work because tabs domnodes are children of div which width is over 50000px so tabs won t be visible

9442627
min	max
if this is not what s required then you can do an appropriate aggregate meaning min or max most likely on the dates within the month

9442627
min	max
i will say that most dbms i m familiar with would probably baulk on the max t3.rate and min t2.rate terms

9442628
min	max
if your chart is static you could try tweaking with the x axis max and min

9442629

9442917
margin	height
in older versions of ie and height can return the wrong values because it does not account for margin padding or some other reason

9442917
width	height
the main point is that it s broken in older ie s so you need to set the width height to something big enough for it to display right

9442920
super	extends
the mixin implementations can be overridden either in higher sub- interfaces as the seek order for implementations happen per method and goes from the declared interface left-to-right and then to each of the super interfaces also left-to-right in the extends clause

9442986
post	get
so inside your post controller action you will get the settings list property initialized but don t expect to find any values for the other properties in this setting class unless of course you include input fields for them in the form and more precisely in the editor template that i have shown

9442999
width	height
i have set the width height and display of some divs but the height width settings are not being honored

9442999

9443778
base	fractions
if i remember correcly one of such numbers is decimal 0.05 in base 2 results in infinitely repeating fractions number

9443778
base	fractions
another issue is that if you print floating point to file as base 10 number then read it back you might as well get different number - because base differs and that might cause problems when converting fractions base2 to fractions base10 number

onclick	preventdefault
plus make sure you use preventdefault inside any onclick event on input elements like

9448090
nfa	dfa
as opposed to dfa minimization where efficient methods exist to not only determine the size of but actually compute the smallest dfa in terms of number of states that describes a given regular language no such general method is known for determining the size of a smallest nfa

9448090
nfa	dfa
given a dfa m that accepts the regular language l and an integer k is there an nfa with â k states accepting l

width	height
in chrome the alert is height 500 max height x width 1100 x 2200 padding 20

9448326
width	height
this is not a vcl styles bug this is how the vcl styles works each style skin has a own border width and height which sometimes doesn t match with the native windows border size

9448326
width	height
the carbon style has a border width and height of 5 pixels

9448326

actual width height are smaller than returned by method

9448602
width	height
is there any way to determine real width height of text string

9448602
width	height
i ve seen couple solutions drawing text on empty image then determining width height then looking through whole image pixel by pixel but imho thats stupid and really resource consumptive

the interface to input devices such as mouse and keyboard

9448635
int	double
note that inside the min function i cast the color value from double to int otherwise min double double overload is called and 255 gets first converted to double and then possibly back to byte involving an extra rounding

9448643
super	implements
for the 2nd part i have implements a message inspector along with an extension method which makes it super easy to attach the saml with outgoing messages

9448673
hash	salt
as for accessing an api all you really need to do is hash and or salt user information and then save the information if necessary in the keychain you could add extra security by encrypting the passwords before pushing them into the keychain

9448678
width	height
so if sencha is setting the width and height to 100 it won t expand vertically but should fill the parent horizontally

9448685
folder	directory
then you need to have folder s parent directory on the classpath

9448692
free	malloc
since each loop is allocating memory with malloc i free up whatever it malloced but i get this error when i run

9448713
min	max
mysql error 1140 mixing of group columns min max count ... with no group columns is illegal if there is no group by clause

9448747
margin	height
jquery has 3 height calculating functions that take the margin padding and border values into account differently

9448748
free	malloc
incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free often comes from smashing the memory contents around the memory you malloc d that is index out of bounds or doing exactly what it s telling you - modifying the memory contents after freeing them - and that s my best guess as to what s happening

9448785
jar	manifest.mf
with this configuration all jar files project and dependencies are listed in the manifest.mf s classpath and their entries files at directory level and package names according to the jar index doc will occur in index.list

9448785
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
note #3 do not use both the jar-with-dependencies maven-assembly-plugin and addclasspath maven-jar-plugin or you ll double all entries in the resulting jar

9448785
jar	manifest.mf
note #4 the java jar command line tool does also evaluate the manifest.mf s classpath besides explicit listing of jar files when invoking the tool as shown in my initial example see the index example of the jar doc

9448787
textview	imageview
i have a layout containing two textview and one imageview

9448788
spaces	delimiter
in a nutshell the for will iterate over myfile.txt break each line into two tokens using the default delimiter spaces

9448799
inherited	properties
you can also set it to inherited or none to set all three properties to inherited or none

9448820
hide	show
one work-around that hasn t yet been mentioned is that you can continue to use display block none to hide show the element but set its opacity to 0 so that even when it s display block it s still invisible

9448841
post	get
you can simply get post an url like tz time_zone where time_zone is whatever timezone you want to set

9448856
width	height
i want the outer div to take 100 width to fill the container and a height of say 250px

9448909

i am curios about that in proper button can i add a imageview or textview in xml

9448927
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
the application has a rootviewcontroller of the uiwindow that is a uinavigationcontroller

9448941
implements	extends
if you only want the enumerable keys of an object i would consider extends the object when object.keys if not implements instead of using the json object which isn t available in all major browsers either

9448985
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
so right now i have a server that is running with objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

9449006
packets	pcap
i m writing network analyzer and i need to filter packets saved in file i have written some code to filter http packets but i m not sure if it work as it should because when i use my code on a pcap dump the result is 5 packets but in wireshark writing http in filter gives me 2 packets and if i use

9449006
ftp	telnet
and or if i m filtering it wrong then how can i do it right also is there a way to filter http or ssh ftp telnet ... packets using something else than the port numbers

9449014
int	chars
void stroccr chars inputstr 100 chars outputstr chars delim int occrno chars stringside

9449091
hide	show
every submenu is an children of and at the same time children of a so you can easily create a function to show or hide a menu which accepts a jquery object as parameter

9449173
pascal	delphi
my coding is free pascal but delphi solutions will work probably

9449178
appdata	uninstaller
what entry would i need to put in the removefile table of an msi for it to remove files from appdata when uninstaller

9449197
submit	submission
iâ m utilizing ajax to submit the form and php to process add to db a valid form submission

9449218
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	onmousedown	onmousedown	mouseup
i basically have a onmousedown followed by a mousemove this lets me find a way to work out the offset amount with the mouse but if i mouseup - it still keeps following the mouse

9449241
clang	llvm
but when i do so my compiler clang llvm on linux issues the following error

9449243
for-loop	arrays
it looks from your server implementation that the arrays variable is never instantiated so if your list were not empty it would likely npe in array.add but in this case it look like your list may be empty so the for-loop is not iterated up and getoverviewentities method returns null hence the 204 result

9449247
min	max
it s easy to swap out the max with min avg or sum

9449252
mousemove	mouseup
add an event listener for mouseup and there remove the event listener for mousemove

9449328
width	border-box
the border-box value as opposed to the content-box default makes the final rendered box the declared width and any border and padding cut inside the box

9449378
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is how the form looks in safari firefox and google-chrome

9449378
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the only fix for safari google-chrome and firefox is adding a margin-top or padding-top to the labels but this destroys the form in ie8 and ie9

9449387
width	height
and since your aspect ratio will be 4 3 or 16 9 width height you get an oval instead of a circle

9449471
getter	setter
in the class constructur i query the database and stores all info in instance variables inside the class and retrieve them with getter setter

9449473
int	chars
i cannot imagine why you are doing this by converting the timestamp to a string extracting some chars out of it then converting it to a float and then converting again this time to an int

9449538
interpolation	splines
on a different subject i have used interpolation splines in scipy with success in the past

9449563
children	parent
once all b child nodes are calculated the parent score is calculated based on the children and at that point the child nodes can be removed from storage

9449591
mousemove	mouseup
then in the mouseup listener remove the mousemove listener

9449604
width	height
the likely problem is that you assume that the body and html containers default to 100 width and 100 height

9449604
width	height
by default the width is 100 but the height adjusts to the content inside the html body containers

9449622
hide	show
to show hide a link depending on user role i get the following

9449664
int	double
for example i have four int two and two double

9449739
width	height
ideally the div should have no width and height declared meaning let the content decide it s dimensions

9449739
width	height
additionally you can add this to make sure the image is snug in the div and again it s idea you don t set width and height to the div

9449775
folder	directory
i create 2 folder php and cache in my root directory and put the simplepie.inc file in php

9449791
stdout	stderr
but if you need to capture both stderr and stdout

9449798
onbeforeunload	onload
i have the following code to call the onload and onbeforeunload event

9449817
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ended up with a somewhat interesting solution that worked for me in at least google-chrome firefox and safari where i tested it

9449817
width	margin
the left margin needs to be set to half of the div width

9449858
superclass	subclassing
here s another alternative assuming you have control of all the classes involved abstract out the fields in the superclass and declare them in the subclassing sort of like this.

9449879
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if i use a cdn edgecast but also another one i tested on then my google maps embedded in the pages don t show up in google-chrome and firefox but do show up fine in safari all latest versions cannot test it on ie

9449879
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you want to have a look at a page working fine in safari but not in google-chrome firefox you can have a look at

9449982
for-loop	arrays
also you should use the vanilla for-loop when iterating arrays

9450006
client-side	server-side
try both client-side and server-side cursors and see what happens

9450049
width	height
are you sure that you aren t setting the imageview to have 0 height width

9450147
google-chrome	firefox
people tell me to use async on then it fails on every browser status 0 when i run it with async off it works 100 fine on google-chrome but with firefox it flickers the error code but still changes the width of the progress bar

9450176
put	get
i would like to be able to get just the formatted text from every part and put it into one html file

9450179
google-chrome	firefox
i d recommend google-chrome s inspect tool or firefox s firebug inspect tool to help you understand and modify element s css

9450209
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am able to download and play the audio files just fine on firefox google-chrome and safari but not on internet explorer

9450221
fflush	gets
the attribute will be saved in memory untill the user-class gets fflush sent to garbage collector

9450229
typedef	struct
you can access sample x the same way you could access a typedef or a struct class declaration inside the class

9450250
comparator	comparable
i am searching up on the internet and trying different ways of going about this including using comparator comparable etc

9450314
g++	gcc
also make sure you use g++ and not gcc

9450314
g++	gcc
since gcc is compiler for c and g++ is for c++

9450367
put	get
one way to get around this is to do or to put the encode method after .read to force ascii and ignore unicode though this is a lazy fix

9450389
mouseup	mousedown
you will have to use the mouseup or mousedown event instead of the click event to capture right click

9450394
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
using the correct versions of dependencies not using a package manager like yum rpm apt dpkg and not using shared libraries

9450394
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
typical developers will likely want to install gcc the typical way use your package manager yum rpm apt dpkg port brew etc. or follow the instructions here

9450396
mvp	presenter
however i am not sure how to deal with models using this gwt platform in the common mvp i know there is a go method in the presenter which fetches data say from server via rpc

9450410
getter	setter
let s say i create some custom version of displayobject that overrides some functions setter and getter

9450414
setinterval	settimeout
it happens with setinterval but not with settimeout

9450422
mpfr	mpc
it depends on gmp mpfr mpc and elf

9450426
min	max
i am trying to access a variable in the first object of the array and the last object of the arraylist which will give me the min age and max age from the arraylist

9450444
pull	push
since i believe sync does both git pull and git push it s trying to pull and merge changes from the remote repository to your local branch

9450444
pull	push
edit under repository you can do push cmd + p or pull shift + cmd + p

9450515
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the font is displayed properly in ie opera but in google-chrome firefox safari it looks small and something totally different.

9450549
hash	salt
a salt is a sequence of characters added to a string about to being hash so it s harder for an attacker to obtain the original string

9450549
hash	salt
however for a cipher algorithm that is not based on hash a salt isn t necessary because the attackers will obtain anyway the original string with the salt and it s just needed logic to remove it

9450550
hash	md5
i prefer one-way hash like md5 or sha but many like decryptable passwords like you re storing

9450552
ember.js	backbone.js
would backbone.js or ember.js handle this better

9450556
superclass	subclassing
one way would be to add the category to their common superclass nsmanagedobject but that has the consequence of adding the category s methods to all nsmanagedobject subclassing when i want to add the methods to three nsmanagedobject subclassing book chapter page

9450556
inherited	subclassing
another solution would be to subclassing nsmanagedobject and then have book chapter and page inherited from that nsmanagedobject subclassing

9450620
pull	push
whoever pushes second will have to do a git pull first and resolve any merge conflicts that occur before being able to push their changes to the remote repository

9450650
post	get
this works for get post and delete

9450656
width	height
question i assume that both width and height are positional arguments

9450658
width	height
the width and height of the overlay can be adjusted as needed or made dynamic in js

9450660
post	put
there is an interesting post on the rails blog about put patch that adds a lot more to this

9450708
cout	cin
then you can interact with std cin and std cout

9450716
consistency	acid
this strategy gives you the atomic and durable in acid but you do not get consistency and isolation

9450723
google-chrome	safari
using a tool like safari or google-chrome s web inspector check the headers being returned with the zero-byte image

9450736
onbeforeunload	onload
i have already created a javascript and php to check the visitors ip address when they open one of my page using onload and onbeforeunload event

9450742
post	put
basically i want non-authenticated users to be able to submit post and put requests to the create and update actions of my devices controller

9450745
filtering	grouping
you are filtering the source dataset with the having clause which is inefficient because all the data would have to be pulled grouping and only then filtering

9450760
for-loop	loops
but in that loops a continue statement will not have the same effect that a continue statement would have in a c for-loop

9450760
for-loop	loops
there is a complicated answer that lets you use a normal python for-loop like a c-style loops and allows updating loops variable by writing a custom iterator

9450778
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and firefox

9450887
width	margin
by setting a negative left margin on the textblock -20px equal to the difference of the textbox width 50px and the parents width 30px the full text is displayed vertically

9450893
phpfox	vbulletin
i tried to drop all the vbulletin tables as well as any other tables that doesn t have to do with phpfox but looks like site is still blank

9450913
mouse	keyboard
an enabled widget handles keyboard and mouse events

9450924
implements	extends
and then implements it into both mydisplayobject extends from displayobject and mymovieclip extends from movieclip using the technique described on the website above

9450942
width	height
i can adjust similarly by checking if they are outside the canvas width and height

9450977
getter	setter
for me the rule of thumb is to first prefer constructor injection and jump off to setter injection if constructor inject requires me to bend my back when working with legacy code with oop getter and setter methods

9451005
ostream	istream
is there a way i can check if an istream of ostream is seekable

9451082
int	chars
each enumerated type shall be compatible with chars a signed int type or an unsigned int type

9451082
int	chars
so in your case 4 will certainly work since it fits in a chars and in any signed or unsigned int type on any machine i ve ever heard of

9451106
range	minimum
to set a minimum or maximum range in a regular expression you can use the syntax

9451151

scons	autotools
edit i was hoping not to turn this into another flame war but i guess that s inevitable so i will just say that i have considerably more experience with autotools and no desire to learn cmake or scons or imake or ant although i seem pretty much stuck with the latter when working with java these days or whatever new tool is invented next year or the year after

9451578
google-chrome	firefox
the rest of your question sounds like maybe you re trying to deal with the problem where google-chrome and firefox slow down timers when a tab goes to the background and then speed them up almost in a catchup mode when it comes to the foreground there are solutions

9451611
performselector	delegation
that said a lot of people do and to achieve this result your app delegation needs to put the same image on screen as you launch image and then you can delay launching your main app with performselector withobject afterdelay

subtraction	addition
what i haven t still figured out is how the overflow and auxilliary flags are calculated best for addition and subtraction

9451924
subtraction	addition
are there any generic algorithms or magic bitwise operations for calculating the signed overflow for 4 8 and 16 bit addition and subtraction

9451924
subtraction	addition
might one solution that works for addition and subtraction be to check whether the sign flag or bit 4 for the auxilliary flag has changed after the calculation is done

post	get
what you should do instead is ensure that regardless of where the request comes from the user has the proper permissions and access rights and that the session is protected appropriately http only cookies ssl etc. if the request is changing data then it should be a post not a get and it should be accompanied by some suitable cross-site request forgery prevention techniques such as a cookie containing a nonce that is verified against a matching nonce on the form itself

free	malloc
worse modern operating systems often over-allocate malloc and new will always return a valid pointer even if there is technically no or not enough free memory left â â so std bad_alloc will never be thrown or is at least not a reliable sign of memory exhaustion

9456758

in certain cases the program may attempt to free some memory and try again or use secondary memory disk instead of ram but these opportunities only exists in very specific scenarios

inherited	subclassing
my subclassing work great as individuals getting class circle to set the ivars using shape methods in shape and inherited them then calculate area using those

9457490

in oop subclassing inherited all attributes of their superclass

9457588
firefox	safari
this happens all the time when you connect to a webserver for example running apache backed by openssl from a browser which tend not to share their ssl tls stacks ie firefox and safari use different ssl tls libraries

gnutls	libcurl
for example it s possible to connect to a java server jetty running on a java 6 jre from libcurl compiled against gnutls

min	max
i know and you know that the min will rarely if ever change and the max will change at most once per year

9457900
children	parent
how can i get each of the children jscrollpane s to resize with the height of the window their parent

9457908
min	max
caching the absolute min and max of a column wouldn t make sense because they are dependent on any filtering done in the where clause

9457938
width	height
what you need to do is check the height width calculations and if they are outside of the minimum requirements then replace them with a fixed value

9457956
range	minimum
so for instance if you re coding up a ga just for practice to find the minimum of say f x x 2 you know pretty well that your range should be + - something because you already know that you re going to find the answer at x 0

9457971
accessor	superclass	accessor	properties
when you override the init method it basically means the properties of the superclass view controller accessor method which has the properties the navigationcontroller is set to nil and you have the tableview properties instantiated instead

9458040
free	malloc
i agree with the others that compiling to machine code does not make much sense mind that c free malloc have same or higher costs than java new garbage collection

9458052
post	get
my understanding is the php sets up _request for both post and get request types

9458052
post	put
i ve read overwriting _post for put or delete requests but that would overwrite _post with put data that to me would be wrong as _post is describing post data not put data in the name of the variable

9458055
width	height
i ve tried to set style height xxxpx but it looks awful with width too

9458067
daemons	systemd

use strstr to locate the substr and strncpy with a bit of pointer arithmetic n startofprefix - startofstring to copy the prefix to a new buffer don t forget to null terminate the new string

9458120

if you just want to throw away the substr and everything after it you could just set the location returned by strstr to 0 to terminate the string there

9458121
put	get
how can i get excel to put all the months and years between two date ranges

9458125
width	height
you could also just set the width to a pixel measure in the html or the css and leave the height or vice-versa depending on whether you need them the same height or same width

9458125
width	height
obviously if you need to crop to a set height and width this won t work but it will give you columns or rows that match in width or height

9458127
filtering	grouping
you want to join on the group_ref table twice once to filtering regular join and once to get the related grouping left join

9458132
strstr	substr
you can use strstr to find the occurrence of the substr

9458140
rar	zip
beware that this approach has serious caveats if your data can be real pseudo random or compressed data then it will also look like than a pile of random bits so for example you won t be able to distinguish between a simple and an encrypted rar zip file

9458158
hash	salt
a further improvement would be to salt the password before you hash it

9458160

fgets	strtod
if what you mean by command line input is reading input from stdin then that has nothing to do with argv and you should instead be using scanf or fgets + strtod

9458173

post	get
i want to test api so i don t really care about functions and objects i just want to make sure that when i send post to api users.json i will see that user in json array from get api users

9458410
int	chars
basically rather than writing a linked list for int and one for floats and another one for unsigned chars you realize that all those data structures look formally the same and so you create one single list template which you can then instantiate on int floats and unsigned chars and perhaps a lot more

9458422
int	chars
i think i understand why this happens blah of the domain instance passed back to the gsp for rendering cannot hold alpha chars beacause it is an int but is there a nice way of re-populating the form with invalid input

9458544
public	protected
shouldn t variables be given visibility or permissions like var public private protected etc

9458638
put	get

9458838
ssl	https
you still have to ensure it goes thro ssl https

9458844
int	chars
fr.read is returning an int and not a chars although that int returned is the equivalent ascii code for that chars

9458844
int	chars
when you call string.valueof on that int the string.valueof int i method gets called instead of the string.valueof chars c method which you are expecting to get called and therefore it returns the ascii value as a string instead of the chars value as a string

9458904

if you are using spring s jdbcdaosupport class and your various jdbc-backed dao classes extend from it then your subclassing inherited a setdatasource .. method from the jdbcdaosupport class

9460541
children	parent
1 kill the parent and keep the children in this case you remove the parent entity and send all the fields from that entity to each of the children

9460541
children	parent
in other words if a parent row can have more than one children when sending the fields to each child the parent data will be duplicated in each children

9460541
children	parent
2 kill children and keep the parent in this case you remove all the children and send all of their attributes to the parent

9460541
children	parent
as the parent is now a mix of itself and all of its children it needs a way to determine what row belongs to what type of children

9460541
children	parent
disadvantages again if a parent can have a row that relates to more than one children data will be duplicated as there will be one row per each of them so there is a limitation in this solution

9460541
children	parent
null values will have to be assigned to the data that children have and the parent nor other children have

9460541
children	parent
3 keep all the least bloody solution is not to kill anything in this case the hierarchy is replaced by a relationship between the parent and each of the children

9460541
children	parent
in this case a parent row can be linked to more than one children without duplicating data

9460541
children	parent
if the most queries will require data from parent and children this schema will be the worst in terms of performance

int	chars
however there is no implicit or explicit conversion between an int and a string because obviously a string is not an int despite the fact that a string can contain chars for an int

9463197
int	boolean
however convert is written specifically to be able to convert from one type to another for example convert.tobool x can parse true or false to boolean and as you have shown it can convert an int to a string - again this is really a convenience that probably just calls int32.tostring under the hood

9463198

if the parent container only has floating children it will have no height

what you could do is listen to mouseenter mouseleave of the underlying line and if you get a mousedown within a certain radius of the initial mouseenter leave count this as a hit

9467853
hmac	md5
it s safer than sgp in that it s based on sha-2 instead of md5 hmac instead of simple concatenation of domain and master password base94 all printable characters instead of base64

9467853
hash	salt
besides it supports customizable salt and hash iteration for key stretching

9467853

maya	3dsmax
at this point i suspect you re trying to make custom render farm from scratch and if i m right about that correct solution would be to use existing software - maya 3dsmax had some render farm support and it should be possible to make blender-based render farm as well

9468133

9468177
udp	tcp
an application using tcp port 12345 has absolutely nothing at all to do with an application using udp port 12345

9468177
udp	tcp
unfortunately this point is often confused by the fact that iana keepers of the unenforced conventions as to what applications use what port numbers has decided to assign service names to both udp and tcp ports even if the service only uses one of them

9468484
union	distinct
union as opposed to union all already returns unique items only so you won t need group by or select distinct

9468872
google-chrome	firefox
the app is working great on firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

9468872
post	get
the thing is that after successfully installed the app it redirects you to the same site but this time instead of asking you to install it will show a quick register form the form action sends you to the same index but in this step the app will not show the quick register form it will get the post variables and calculate the friends that already liked the fan page

9468907

9469838
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve had problems on the mouseenter mouseleave which have a delay therefore if i put the mouse on the just loaded menu after a while the menu just goes to its secondary position or the total chaos that is generated if i just move the mouse in and out of the menu

9469945
printf	strtok
so strtok can return null yet you still pass the null value in the token pointer to printf

9469945
printf	strtok
that way you can never pass a null pointer to strtok because the while-loop null -pointer check will enforce that token always has a valid value when printf is called with it as an argument

with the following javascript the datepicker works the text field is properly formatted but no max min date is set and no initialization with the stored date occurs

9476569
range	min	range	max	min	max
i added to this functions that i though would set min max range and initialize as follows

it looks like the php code you re referencing is using the sitesalt as the key for the hmac function with the password and salt concatenated specified as the value to be hash

9477103
min	max
based on the width s observed min max values from mm -47.5 52.5 the trackpad is 100 units wide 75 units the other way

9477104
getter	setter
on your second example you create a setter and a getter method for the property thestr and by adding the nonatomic attribute you make your property not thread safety meaning that a thread can begin to modify your property while another one is already editing it

9477109
fadein	fadeout
i used avplayer to support fadein and fadeout effects for the background playback of mpmediaitems

9477162

9477186
vb.net	vb6
how do i achieve the following c++ vb.net idiom in the vb6 realm

9477240
mvp	presenter
for instance for mvp i could have a view project a presenter project and a model project with in a solution

9477240
mvp	presenter
so for an solution organised in an mvp pattern the presenter project would generate it s own .dll

9477240
mvp	presenter
the problem i see with this approach is for an mvp layout i would miss out on being able to have different views using my presenter project

9477271
outputstream	inputstream
in stead you ll have to use an inputstream and outputstream to copy the data across

i have also tested it in safari 5.0 ie8 and google-chrome and all events are smooth when the float right is on

9477421
screens	tablet
according to my logic tablet must be with screens size 6 inches

9477421
screens	tablet
one another logic is also added which considers device as tablet with screens width 600px

9477435
hide	show
i would just hide the content from the first tab when selecting the second tab showing up the hidden content with a show and changing the css properties of the buttons but i don t think this is the practical way of doing it

9477488
post	put
i ve put my configuration in environment.rb post initialisation but i think it s a hack

9477499
mouseover	mouseout
if i mouseover and mouseout .activate_tooltip once it continues to work thereafter

yacc	bison
generally you want to use error recovery rules sparingly in a yacc bison file

use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

9477595

9477734
uilabel	nsstring
is there any performance or memory overhead using uiimage or uilabel or nsstring in quartz2d

9477738
calloc	malloc
if you re really curious you could look at the calloc zero-filled allocation implementation in doug lea s malloc

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
older ubuntu versions used libav which is a fork of the ffmpeg project

9477756
ubuntu	debian	ffmpeg	libav
it is worth noting that the maintainer for debian ubuntu switched from ffmpeg to libav on his own accord due to being involved with the libav fork

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
for a while both libav and ffmpeg separately developed their own version of ffmpeg

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
libav then renamed their bizarro ffmpeg to avconv to distance themselves from the ffmpeg project

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
this message was removed upstream when the fake ffmpeg was finally removed from the libav source but depending on your version it can still show up in ubuntu because the libav source ubuntu uses is from the ffmpeg-to-avconv transition period

9477756
ffmpeg	libavformat	ffmpeg	libav
to further complicate matters libav chose a name that was historically used by ffmpeg to refer to its libraries libavcodec libavformat etc

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
for example the libav-user mailing list for questions and discussions about using the ffmpeg libraries is unrelated to the libav project

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
if you are using ffmpeg you could be using ffmpeg or libav

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
refer to the first line in the console output to tell the difference the copyright notice will either mention ffmpeg or libav

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
each of the ffmpeg or libav libraries contains a version.h header which shows a version number

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
for an interesting blog article on the situation as well as a discussion about the main technical differences between the projects see the ffmpeg libav situation

9477789
maven	pom.xml
i am attempting to make a maven parent pom.xml setup where i don t have to declare any plugin information in my child pom.xml everything is taken from the parent pom.xml

9477830
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox varnish is in play but not on google-chrome

9477834
for-loop	loops
the strategy is just wrap your while loops with a for-loop that takes care of processing each of the files one at a time

9477908
put	get
please note that we have access only to one node in the network from which we are transmitting packets and as such we cannot get to know the load being put by other nodes on the network

9477916
put	get
i am trying to put my app to the amazon store but i get the following error

9477932
for-loop	loops
if you craft the for-loop correctly you don t need the do-while loops

9477949
memcached	apc
memcached is a very good suggestion but if you only have a single webserver you can use apc just as well

9477968
maven	pom.xml
you can t avoid naming the plugin in the child pom.xml cause how should maven know which plugin are you using

9477969
innodb	myisam
change your table s storage from myisam to innodb

9477971
width	height
the problem is that even if i set the width and the height to fill_parent my image stays very small in the middle of the screen bottom and on the left and the right i have an empty field

9478037
hash	md5
this might look a little nicer than md5 hash but you would have to ensure url strings are not used several times

9478055
touchesmoved	touchesended
the reason i ask is because i am using touchedbegan touchesended and touchesmoved to keep a uiview under a user s finger

9478100
post	get
however if anybody want he can input this url in browser and get the post he can even get a lot of different post if he knows other ids

9478105
post	get
now i get a really strange behavior - since i have set the post with a custom query in the for-each loop it should not contain the basic page contents anymore but my custom post type content right

9478150
jobs	cron
was planning to move from setting up cron jobs to quartz scheduler

9478161
post	get
i get an alert post id some_value

9478177
hash	md5
you can use md5 hash of random value + timestamp + page id saving that random value to cookie

9478192
portrait	landscape
it works for portrait images and almost works for the landscape ones but scales them too much

9478225
jar	war
it can simply include this xml file in your project output as war or jar or etc

9478250
udp	tcp
nats keep a table of active connections sometimes known as a port mapping table that keeps track of how to translate the ip port pair for active tcp connections and observed udp sessions

9478252
free	malloc
for the second solution you can keep the text variables as pointers and use malloc to allocate memory for them but then you have to free that memory when you are done with it

9478265
google-chrome	firefox
its shows the selected image in google-chrome firefox

9478274
google-chrome	firefox
the code belows work in firefox and google-chrome but not working in ie any idea why

hide	show
i have a requirement to show a drop down list to a particular group member and hide the same dropdownlist if another group member is logged in.is there any way to do this with sharepoint out-of-box feature

9478295
folder	directory
for example if you have a folder compile in the same directory as your .fla and it contains a class myclass the import statement would be

9478312
mkmapview	mkoverlay
you will need to create an mkmapview for your map then an mkoverlayview for your overlay view and some object of yours will need to implement the mkoverlay protocol

9478352
for-loop	arrays
the basic for-loop was extended in java 5 to make iteration over arrays and other collections more convenient

9478441
persistent	transient	instances	transient
persistent the given transient instances first assigning a generated

9478487
post	get
it works fine when i use get instead of post

9478540
mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
as far as i understand the problem is mousemove mouseenter and mouseleave events are not fired when mouse left button is down

9478595
width	height
i need read the content of the usercontrol using the style and adjust the width and height and display the content

9478683
post	get
or for just the post data the above also includes get parameters

9478693
union	distinct
if you want a union that means that the values are distinct between the statements

9478695
folder	directory
there are two surefire directory in the target folder

9478718
post	get
the problem is that your get action deletecategory doesn t have the same as your post action delete

9478718
post	get
or if you don t want to do that you should rename your get method to be he same as the post method

9478718
post	get
now since both your get and post actions are named the same way you could use the beginform helper without arguments because the distinction between those actions will be based on the http verb used to invoke them

9478718
post	get
so don t expect to get anything out of this category that your post action expects

9478740
google-chrome	firefox
the most likely cause is normalization of the accept-encoding header both firefox and google-chrome send a different one

9478746
width	height
i want to set only a minimum height on my jpanel and leave the retrieval of the minimum width to the panel s layout manager as i want to leave the minimum width to be whatever the layout manager decides

9478780

for detect settings for interface im used width and height

9478793

9478919
draggable	droppable
everything you want to achieve is doing able with jquery ui and the draggable droppable extensions provided within

9478950
width	margin
then for some reason when i use a width of 96 or even 100 and a margin of a few percent it doesn t stretch to the right end like it normally should so there s always a bigger margin on the right hand side of the viewport

9478951
post	get
but to send the data you will have to use get or post method of http

9478951
post	get
for sending text only get is enough but for sending images video its better to go with post methods with base64 encryption

9478971
min	max
and i was wondering how to read the min and max values from property file please advise

9478976

9479185
google-chrome	firefox
i switched to 1.7.1 and it works on firefox and google-chrome can t test it on ie

9479203
int	double
apparently when php encounters a number that exceeds the upper limit of 2 147 483 647 for an int it automatically converts the numberâ s type from int into a double

9479261
implements	extends
if you re talking about a scenario where your components always implements both interfaces - well in that case you should create a third interface - not an anonymous on-the-fly construct - that extends both of these to a single composite whole

9479282
tostring	getter	getter	setter
ok so i have moved the file objects into the serverstate class and access the options using by calling a tostring method from the file class that also contain the object constructors getter and setter

i think i see also the advantages of rest using of simple http verbs get post delete etc... but that s not the main point here.

9480224
screens	hdpi
i would also rather not have to do this because if i make the images 4 times smaller there is little point in accounting for hdpi and xhdpi screens at all - quality will be a lot worse on these

9480263

innodb	myisam
having done some research on stackoverflow i m looking into creating the table again as a innodb table and then creating a copy in myisam

9480790
innodb	myisam
then i will create triggers which will replicate any changes in the innodb table to the myisam table

9480790
innodb	myisam
my question is will i see much benefit in the myisam table as surely it is going to be written to as often as before because every write to the innodb table will result in a subsequent write to the myisam

9480791
for-loop	arrays
try it in the other way pass your arrays to mapoverlay and make the for-loop inside the method draw in this case you will create only one mapoverlay instead of 500 and draw 500 lines with one mapoverlay and you will get the same result

9480803
width	height
the outline is not a part of the element s dimensions therefore the element s width and height properties do not contain the width of the outline

the following code doesn t work in firefox and google-chrome but works in ie

9480855
for-loop	loops
in the for-loop this data line also results in an error message but loops continues and all the other t-tests give correct results

9480872
innodb	myisam
using triggers to copy from myisam to innodb has the risk of creating inconsistent data when transactions are rolled back

9480872
innodb	myisam
another idea would be to synchronise myisam with innodb periodically using event scheduler

9480886
rvm	bundler
suggest using rvm the ruby environment manager bundler and gemsets

9481238
mouseup	mousedown
imo the best way to simulate this effect would be to work with some kind of timer - where you log the time from mousedown to mouseup and calculate what this means in terms of pressure

9481288
hide	show
when either one is selected it will hide or show certain data boxes below

9481292
factors	matrix	int	chars
this will work for a data frame that contains only numeric int factors or other variables that can be coerced to numeric but any chars strings chars will cause the matrix to become a chars matrix

9481382
int	chars
please note that data types like chars int float are not initialized

9481407
mouseup	mousedown
but as dennis flood said you can use a timer to calculate how long it was pressed on mousedown start a timer then on mouseup stop the timer and calculate the time

9481420
getter	setter
the first is particularly clever being that valueforkey will always return an nsobject even when the value is actually a primitive so float int bool types will be wrapped in an nsnumber automatically by the kvc getter and unwrapped in the kvc setter

9481480
filtering	grouping
you might be able to ask for the exanded entities separately with additional queries with the right filtering and possibly use batch to grouping all the queries in one request

if you look at the class hierarchy for nsbutton you ll see that it derives from nsresponder which is the class that handles mouse events

9482762
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
your first for-loop is using i as loops counter but size as the arrays index

versioning	upgrade
it is possible to run nodes on different versioning of the software but this is normally only done in the context of an upgrade of the cluster and so i d recommend upgrading your cluster to the latest release 7.2 if possible before starting the process

9483056
versioning	upgrade
for reference you can see the upgrade compatibility between different cluster versioning at

9483059
width	height
the image element is trying to keep its aspect ratio since you only specified a height and not a width

9483067
width	height
x and y should be greater than 0 and less than 1 and there is no gradient because height and width should be less

9483071
width	height
but i think because you slidetoggle the image tag directly the width is changed along with the height to keep the ratio

9483087
width	height
the ratios of the x frustrum and y frustrum should be equal to the ratios of the width and height of the screen.

9483094

udp	tcp
which protocol performs better in terms of throughput - udp or tcp - really depends on the network characteristics and the network traffic

9483266
udp	tcp
now consider a scenario in which the network is congested and has both tcp and udp traffic

9483266
udp	tcp
gradually tcp senders would reduce their sending rates to bare minimum and if udp senders have enough data to be sent over the network they would hog up the majority of bandwidth available

9483266
udp	tcp
in fact this is an active research topic - how to improve tcp throughput in presence of udp traffic

9483266
udp	tcp
that way even though each tcp connection s throughput might be limited the sum total of the throughput of all tcp connections may be greater than the throughput for an application using udp

but i need the same things for firefox and google-chrome

9483781
post	get
the tiny gains you get from passing only the name of the sproc over the wire as opposed to a sql string are easily offset by the fact that you are all too likely to end up calling the same procedure two or three times with the same parameters in the same request whereas an orm would look in its identity map and say hey i ve already retrieved that one no need to do another round trip at all. furthermore the claim that stored procedures are cached on the server whereas ad-hoc sql is not is a myth that was busted by frans bouma in his blog post stored procedures are bad m kay

9484069
post	get
as i can see the problem is that your delete request goes as get but as per the rest conversions it should be a post request

9484095
pull	push
you need either to update client before pushing git pull for example or use forced push git push --force but that case commits can be lost on the remote side and trigger non-fast-forward messages on other clients

9484117
for-loop	arrays
i am not sure how this is possible but i have a for-loop not incrementing properly through an arrays

9484133
freemarker	velocity
you can use freemarker or velocity for templating in java -- or even just add php tags to a sample xml to generate from a template

9484152
hide	show
if i were doing something like this i would probably create entirely separate s for each edittype and use the id attribute on the tables to show hide them

9484191
width	height
i try to listen from inside of iframe to changes of iframe width height with

9484191
google-chrome	firefox
i need a cross-browser solution ie7 google-chrome firefox safari.

9484218
postgresql	mysql
i found a gist of database.yml examples using mysql postgresql and sqlite3 and the rails 3.2 source code for connection adapters provides good insight as well

9484224
calloc	malloc
there are several misuses of malloc and calloc in the code which may be the cause of the invalid write

9484294
hide	show
i would hide the default textbox border and place it on top of an image containing the border image you want and show the image when the textbox is selected

9484297
jboss	glassfish
glassfish 3 and jboss 7 are neck and neck now with their implementation either would be a good choice though jboss is my personal preference

9484297
jax-ws	jax-rs
you can find more resources online for learning jax-rs and jax-ws

9484301
burn	uninstaller
then use burn is a bootstrapper to handle chaining these together and uninstaller them together

9484315
put	get
it would be nice to let owner imply get and put since those are both valid actions

9484354
post	get
through my testing it seems that servicestack is automatically url decoding any parameters sent through the query string of a get request but does not automatically decode params sent via a post request

9484360
ready	each
when each iteration is done the inc functions advances the pointer on to the next item ready for the next iteration

9484369
width	height
when you set the width height of the movieclip object flash internally also adjusts the scalex and scaley properties

9484369
width	height
the way to remedy this as suggested by another poster is to avoid setting width height on the blank object or alternatively to reset scalex and scaley to 1 after your drawing is done

9484420
lisp	prolog	ocaml	prolog
of course the student argument also works against languages like lisp and ocaml or prolog

9484424
switching	accessory
for this you will need to keep track of two things first the switches we can access it via cell s accessory view and second the switching which is on. for this suppose we use tag property

9484434
maven	cobertura
the problem is that embedded glassfish uses the classes in target classes and maven cobertura uses target generated-classes cobertura

stateless	stateful
if we got the following jax-rs service or some other stateless stateful ejb

9484471
google-chrome	firefox
i have found inserting issue in google-chrome and ie in firefox working well

9484582
cpu	hyperthreading
saturating your cpu network or disk i o with multiple threads of execution won t make things faster and usually hurts performance especially on hyperthreading intel cpus

9484600
getter	setter
the basic idea to correct this is to let nhibernate put the base class object into the graph and then you deal with the casting note that this setup would use some slightly different mappings - ive done this to simplify the code but it can obviously be done by keeping the properties as full getter setter

9484666
google-chrome	safari
on ios safari the iframe is cut can t be entirely seen while on desktop google-chrome the iframe is not cut

9484724
ubuntu	linux
if it cant be done in ubuntu is there another flavor of linux it can be done in

9484732
int	double
cast to double before dividing and then cast back to int afterwards

9484771
put	get
make your controller get this information and put it onto the model itself as a separate property or

9484821
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also this needs to work in firefox google-chrome safari and opera

9484834
width	height
you cannot scale to window height and width at every time and keep an ratio of 16 9 that is mathematical not possible

9484834
width	height
if you want to keep a ratio of 16 9 constant you can take the window width or the height and then scale the opposite site to the right value to keep your ratio

9484834
width	height
your window get resized to 800px width and 600px height and you want to keep the width of the window in full then you must scale the height of your box to 450px to keep a ratio of 16 9

9484848
integer	fractions
but the hibernate validator docs seem to indicate that it verifies if the number is using the expected amount of integer and fractions digits

9484848
integer	fractions
so instead of inputting a text in the text field try inputting a value that is not in the same format accepted by the validator in your case fractions 2 integer 13

9484934
super	extends
super stands for the super object aka the father of the class you are impementing which extends

9484949
versioning	upgrade
i don t have the option to upgrade spring to the next versioning

9484981
ubuntu	linux
safest bet install a modern linux such as ubuntu if you are a linux newbie in a virtual machine virtualbox is a free virtual machine application and in this virtual machine compile gcc-4.7 and clang++

9484989
versioning	upgrade
if you re experiencing a similar problem make sure you upgrade your versioning of zenburn

9484994
pull	push
it allows you to stream reading though i would suggest a pull parser rather than a push one but that s not going to allow you to insert data into the file

9485010
dlsym	dlopen
their source is easily obtainable so you could probably taloir them down into simpler tools for the task at hand or directly import their code base not that you really need to you could just load the binary with in question with dlopen and use dlsym to check if the symbol is there

9485092
fgets	getchar
java is able to read in the entire string a but the c++ functions like fgets sscanf getchar ... and their equivalent family of functions all fail to detect this space rather than ignoring it so instead i m returned a zero-length string

9485113
isnull	nullif
you can also see that i m using isnull and nullif here to replace 0 with a custom text

9485117
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
for whatever height width you are using just set the margin to half of the width height

9485117
mouseup	mousedown
scaledown is a percentage of the original size you want to scale down to on mousedown and scale up is a percentage of the original size you want to scale up to on mouseup

9485123
apache	nginx
even using nginx under the hoods you can still choose apache or nginx to maintain your webservers domains using sockets

9485138
post	get
if you still get conflicts then i would post the output here

9485158
spaces	linefeed
fgets really should work it s not documented as eating white spaces it even includes the linefeed in the returned string

9485177
mouseover	mouseenter
i am assuming you are adding a css class that handles the transition either on page load or on some type of event mouseover click mouseenter etc

9485196
calendarextender	detailsview
i have a detailsview with a date field that i d like to use the calendarextender on when a user edits

9485245
width	height
note this doesn t make the iframe 1600 pixels wide it simply makes it the full width and makes the height to the width multiplied by 9 16 ie maintains a 16 9 aspect ratio

9485296
rspec	capybara
i m under capybara and rspec which is the best way to test the destroy link for an object

9485303
portrait	landscape
when a child view controller is embedded that only supports the portrait orientation and the device is currently in landscape orientation i want to force a rotation to portrait

9485303
portrait	landscape
it actually works the opposite way so that if the child view controller is embedded and the device is in portrait orientation i can rotate to landscape but the view controller will remain portrait then dismiss the embedded view controller and it will automatically rotate to landscape

9485370
width	height
the problem was solved by adding a 1x1 transparent 100 width x 100 height png onto the divs

9485373
portrait	landscape
two views with content one landscape one portrait

9485397
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
results between opera and google-chrome are identical results on firefox and ie are also identical so there is definately something very special that does work on browsers in the first group and does not work in the browsers from the second group

9485397
opera	firefox
i already checked that output from the json on firefox and opera is the same using this tool so it is not a problem with an actual json feed

9485398
printf	strtod
one sticky issue that i haven t yet touched on is the decimal separator in relation to functions like printf and strtod

9485432
width	height
every post has an image and all images would be identical in width but would vary in height

9485495
google-chrome	firefox
this solution works cross browsers google-chrome firefox ie all versions mobile etc. and cross domain

9485502
capistrano	rvm
i m running rails 3.1.3 ruby 1.9.2-p290 capistrano 2.1.12 apache 2.2 rvm 1.10.2 and whichever version of passenger would have been installed by the install script about a month ago

uilabel	uifont
i want to be able to toggle the bold on off for a uilabel all previous questions in this area use uifont boldsystemfontofsize

9485641
free	malloc
i have a programming project with highly intensive use of malloc free functions

9485641
free	malloc
by this way malloc and free are heavily used called thousands of times per second

9485691
int	double
there s also a slight complication with maps of primitive types - you ll need to arrange for the java side to use double int instead of double int autoboxing i believe is the term unless you decided to wrap pairs already in which case you could make a pair with primitive members

9485840
salt	md5
the user is moe and the password is howard so we use md5 moehowardblah or md5 username + password + salt

9485841
boost	allocator
if you only have three different then you would greatly gain by using a pool allocator either custom made or something like boost pool but for c

9485863
free	malloc
when programming in windows i find calling malloc free is like death for performance -- almost any in-app memory allocation that amortizes memory allocations by batching will save you gobs of processor time when allocating freeing so it may not be so important which approach you use as long as you re not calling the default allocator

9485892
width	margin
whatever you are trying to center using the margin technique needs to have a width defined

9485892
width	margin
try setting a width for the wrapper or simply apply the margin 0 px to #ob

9485918
dictionary	map
in the question you don t define banana and apple anyway i would use a map or a dictionary to store key value pairs with the key being the string object you want to count and the value being the counter of the object occurences in your array

9485962
splinter	selenium
a splinter doesn t use selenium and doesn t have an ie driver

width	height
it surprised me just how difficult it was to search around for a clear-cut way to validate image width height with carrierwave

9486014
width	height
i didn t want to have to store width height in the database so in my model i said

9486014
width	height
so now i have the width height of my image stored in the model object

9486081
distance	pdist
now using pdist i have tried to calculate the euclidian distance between each point using and but both just return an empty matrix

9486081
distance	pdist
does anyone know how to use pdist to calculate these distance

9486092
websphere	ibm
i have a simple jpa project running with ibm rad 7.5 on websphere 7

9486099
free	malloc
i recently implemented my own userspace slab allocator and it proved to be much more efficient speedwise and memory-wise than malloc free for a large amount of fixed-size allocations

9486172
installation	upgrade
instead of going into each installation and manually upgrading it i would like a way to upgrade each installation at the same time

9486211
mouseleave	mouseenter
if so instead of hover use mouseenter and mouseleave

9486218
screens	tablet
one approach that comes to mind as potentially viable would be to overlay another touch screens on top of the tablet

9486236
google-chrome	firefox
needless to say this doesn t happen in google-chrome or firefox

9486292
bazaar	perforce	bazaar	git
so far i ve looked at the usual suspects git mercurial and potentially bazaar as i have good experience with it but our main hurdle currently is to get the version history out of perforce and imported into the various dvcss so we don t lose the history

9486292
perforce	svn
i then had this brilliant brain fart of importing the perforce repo into svn with all the branches mapped to appropriate svn branches as every version control system under the sun can import from svn

9486292
perforce	svn
is there a good tool besides p42svn.pl to export a perforce repo into svn

9486312
aggregate-functions	sum
here i am using sum choose any aggregate-functions of your liking

9486357
width	height
but how can i assign the width and height in asp.net automatically

9486357
width	height
i can do a server control extending image that would query the image size using gdi+ and assign those values to its own width and height properties

9486357
width	height
i would like to cache the height and width values across all pages for each image

9486368
textview	imageview
i m populating a listview which contains an imageview and a textview

9486383
put	get
so the configurationmanager will get the values that you put in the app.config and you don t need to mock anything

9486406
inherited	properties
that is a static properties and moq is designed to moq instance methods or classes that can be mocked via inherited

9486470
button	checkbox
i have built a function using jquery to insert into a table a new row including some inputs like textboxes checkbox and one button

9486482
mouseup	mousedown
for instance some controls respond to a mousedown followed by a mouseup but not to a click

9486496
filtering	grouping
i tried making the linq grouping by syntax work but it kept putting the filtering as a where not a having clause

9486503
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m having some problems getting this to look good in ie firefox opera google-chrome and safari

9486503
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
opera and firefox are the same but ie google-chrome and safari has a bit different look

9486530
inherited	properties
i suspect this is the problem and then the browsers are not letting the table inherited the font properties due to the invalid structure and thus are defaulting to the browser settings

9486541
post	get
get and post are two different methods to send data get is in the url path a b c while post is hidden in the html headers

9486541
google-chrome	firefox
and in your browser use google-chrome or firefox + firebug and press f12

9486588
rss	feed
i get only 10 items from the rss feed you show no matter what i specify in limit

9486607
implements	extends
public class imageadapter extends baseadapter implements listadapter

9486650
division	modulo
this way you do not need division so you can take the remainder of the sum and of intermediate results modulo any number you want

9486664
getter	setter
dave newton is right but also note that jython exposes java setter and getter as properties so self.size 350 300 works as well and is a little prettier to the eyes of a python developer

9486704
mouseevent	mouselistener
i suppose you can register your own mouselistener or mouseadapter and check the click count getclickcount of the mouseevent

9486738
width	height
i m attempting to create a video element as a string set the height and width from variables also strings and i m finding that ie9 is dropping the from the dimension values

9486740
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
manually check values passed from dropdownlistfor radio button checkbox etc are valid for the user session for the current page and state and don t rely on the asp.net event architecture to validate user input

9486763
jobs	cron
i am little confused because on server side we use cron jobs to execute the scripts but this push.php should never exit so i am confused here what to do

9486780
maven	pom.xml
in the second project s pom.xml file specify the first projects maven co-ordinates groupid artifactid version packaging under the dependency section

9486806
width	height
width and height are not how you should be styling an element for size

9486840
put	get
i don t get how to create that signature nor how to put it in the request could anybody point me in the right direction

9486866
pylons	pyramid
pylons one of the two frameworks that joined together to be pyramid the other was repoze.bfg was close to an mvc system

9486866
pylons	pyramid
pyramid and pylons both have a dispatcher functionality to set up the mapping for a request

9486866
pull	push
under pyramid it s a little different -- the default scaffolds have the routing in app init .py but you re free to break it out into app routes.py or use config.include to push it into you handlers or config.scan to pull it from your views

9486924
google-chrome	safari
can anyone tell me why webkitenterfullscreen using an external button works in google-chrome and safari but not ios

9486933
post	put
i wanted to post this as an answer but this is not really based on polymorphism or overloading so decided to put as an edit instead

9486961
gif	png
is there a way to create a gif like image with javascript based on some png or jpg

9487011
jar	war
i have generated the jar file correctly project.artifactid - project.version .jar but when i check the jar file in .m2 folder it has same structure as war file

subnet	packets
which is basically what bonjour mdns does but less general to send a broadcast udp packets open a udp datagram socket and send a packets to the local subnet s broadcast ip

9487044
hide	show
the possibility to hide show the window without destroying the instance

9487060
google-chrome	firefox
of course somethings work only in firefox and google-chrome and ie decides it hates everyone and doesn t work with the solutions that work for other browsers

pbkdf2	salt	scrypt	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2
they discuss hashing salt pbkdf2 bcrypt scrypt and a few other things

9487095
hash	salt
in short answer to you question a salt is a safeguard that makes it take a long time to recover a password in the event of compromise just as a hash is

9487129
setinterval	settimeout
you can use setinterval or settimeout to call a function which would replace the source of an image with another

9487129
setinterval	settimeout
you would then use the css background-position again within a setinterval or settimeout function to change the position of the image

9487143
profiling	debugging
perl regexes also offer substantial improvements in debugging and profiling

9487144
post	get
sending post get requisitions into a servlet and i didn t got any sucess on that either

9487231
tinyint	varchar
all the information is exactly the same so you should use a single table with an additional column call it whatever you want and make it a tinyint 0 or 1 if there are only two possible values or perhaps varchar if there could be more values in the future

9487242
post	get
my idea is after i create a post i d like to get it s tags

9487242
post	get
i just saw that i can override the create action but now i get a missing template error can someone post some example code for overriding create in this situation

9487264

and it doesn t even bother xdebug - profiling and debugging still works like a charm

9487289
centos	linux

consider i have a qml rectangle of width w and height h colored all black

9487337
width	height
i also have an image of black color having same width and height

9487339
acs	adfs
if your applications live in an ad domain for example adfs 2.0 would be an ideal choice because of it s close integration with ad and acs and it s powerful claims transformation capabilities

9487347
width	height
i learned that i should not size the canvas inside css and should instead define explicit pixel width and height

9487347
width	height
i ve been trying to set everything up so that everything resizes on the fly when the browser is resized so i basically have a 5x5 table with rows 1 3 and 5 as a height of 5px and columns 1 3 and five with a width of 5px

9487347
width	height
i don t specify a width or height but i ve tried it with 100 as well

9487347
width	height
afterward i read the width and height of one of the table cells and set the size of each canvas according to that

9487347
width	height
the second problem is that because each canvas has it s width and height defined all other components on screen resize automatically with a change in windows size but the canvas elements remain fixed

9487347
hide	show
ideally since a resize while they re visible is kind of slow i would like to hide or remove the elements when the resize begins and rebuild and show them when resize is complete

9487371
width	height
what i d like to be able to do though is have the scrolling limited to a specific div that has a height of 450 width of 910 and overflow-y scroll set

9487394
put	get
it can upload it just fine put i cannot seem to get it to replace the data it returns an error i cannot find reference to

firepath	firebug
if you are familiar with firebug then get firepath

9487488
versioning	upgrade
if your rubygems versioning is 0.8.5 or later you can upgrade to the latest versioning with

9487510
multicastdelegate	delegation
all delegation even those with only a single object method pair are stored as a type derived from multicastdelegate

9487510
multicastdelegate	delegation
most objects will take the passed-in delegation and add it to a multicastdelegate which the object will then invoke when the circumstance arrives invoking the multicastdelegate will invoke all its members but objects are free to implement the event add and remove accessors however they see fit

9487510
subtract	addition	subtract	add	subtraction	addition	subtraction	add	multicastdelegate	delegation
one should avoid passing a multicastdelegate produced via delegate.combine to an event add handler if there is any possibility that any of the constituent delegation or other delegation equivalent to them may also be passed because many event implementations use multicastdelegate addition and subtraction and thus suffer from weird subtract semantics

9487538
hex	binary
encode it as either base64 or as hex before saving or save it in a binary field

9487562
hide	show
i would then like to close the popup and fire off some jquery hide show events without refreshing the page

how can i identify whether my received packet is using tcp or udp

9487604
fadein	fadeout
is it possible to force jquery use css3 transitions for its fadein fadeout effects

9487641
udp	tcp
to receive udp and tcp separately so you know the difference

9487657
int	double	width	height
i am surprised to see that getters of height and width members has return type double albeit they are int

9487666
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux 10.04

9487668
udp	tcp
typically this kind of thing would be dealt with in streams where you have a stream of tcp or a stream of udp

9487668
udp	tcp
this page appears to illustrate the ip header and that 6 would be the protocol number for tcp with 17 being udp

9487696
int	double	width	height
the class is storing height and width as int it just provides a method that accept double too so you can call it with double values but they are immediately cast to int

9487781
bash	zsh
in bin bash shell the command works fine however in bin zsh it does not

9487814
ant	maven
visual studio lets you do that with the push of a button where with spring you can use ant maven to generate your proxies adapters

9487830
pull	push
i m looking to pull down the lucene.net trunk as a fourth project within my solution so that i can get some of their fixes sooner than when they push those changes to nuget.org

9487832
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it looks like this as expected

9487848
prepare	execute
i can t see any concurrency in your code if you want a better performance set batch size on your prepare statement and execute statements once a while for example after 20 records

9487863
children	parent
the children know to raise a signal to the parent via kill and they have his pid sent to them as an argument and actually the father also has the children pid stored in the shared memory here is some code -

9487873
mouseover	mouseenter
have you tried using the mouseenter event instead of the mouseover event

9487873
mouseover	mouseout
it s designed to only trigger when the cursor enters the region of an element not for instance when you mouseover a sub element and then mouseout of that sub element

9487911
int	double
being limited to int fields only a subset of double s can be represented

9487949
setinterval	settimeout
to delay javascript execution you can use settimeout or setinterval

9487961
pop-up	dialog
if you still need to know how do pop-up a modal dialog it can be done in ie using

9487984
hide	show
i have 2 divs which i show or hide depending on a button click event

9488038
aggregate-functions	sum
once we have a group we can use aggregate-functions on each group and in this case we use sum to count the number of helmets that are safe

9488073
google-chrome	firefox
this is a version of watir that uses webdriver to drive the browsers and offers cross browser support including latest versions of ie firefox and google-chrome

9488098
getter	setter
that means i can not change way of field is accessed add getter and setter

9488112
portrait	landscape
however i want to somehow include a custom parameter that allows me specify whether the test is to be run in portrait mode or landscape mode

9488157
hide	show
seems like jquery and do not modify the dom to hide show the element and hence do not fire domsubtreemodified event

9488258
hide	show

i answered my own question again part2 about making the buttons and options have a current class i believe they were both related enough to be in one question because they both were about how to get the var values in the url to use them within the same overall function - but this was my first post in this site - so maybe i misunderstood

stdio	fflush
for output to a terminal the c stdio system has a feature that it fflush the buffers whenever it sees a newline n

9491771
stdio	fflush
but when output is to a file to increase speed the stdio system does not fflush the buffer

9491798
fflush	gets
i don t think this kind of behavior is mandated by any standard edit actually this is mandated by c99 see jonathan s comment and in the second example even with buffering enabled the library may decide to do a fflush anyway if the buffer gets filled by your printf

9491805
put	get
first you must note that you cannot put a jalali date in a datetime object you will get an exception in dates like 1392 02 31

what i want to do is parse this so i can make an arrays out of it then do a for-loop with that arrays

9491950
google-chrome	firefox
some set up information we re using jquery for ajax and other things but ajax relates to this question node w express for the server and google-chrome 17 firefox 10 for testing we don t need compatibility with ie

9491950
post	get
i have the app.enable jsonp callback set up on the server which works wonderfully for our get routes however it doesn t seem to work so well for our post routes this is all in house right now but better alternatives are welcome as suggestions

9491950
google-chrome	firefox
the request works fine and succeeds in google-chrome however fails in firefox

9491970
getter	setter
so why is this happening when you have getter and setter for the private field

9491970
getter	setter
my guess is that the signatures for the getter and or setter methods do not precisely match the name and type of the private field

9492023
subtraction	addition
for example with a 32 bit word size and say an input of 6 bits i d be interested in checking bits 19 and 3 for addition carries and bits 31 and 15 for subtraction more generally the interesting bits are word size - 1 word size 2 + input bits 2 word size 2 - 1 and input bits 2

9492029
google-chrome	firefox
i m having a small problem with x-browser compatibility google-chrome and firefox for a textarea and margins

9492029
google-chrome	firefox
the textarea under message as you can see is different in firefox than in google-chrome

9492029
google-chrome	firefox
you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both google-chrome lines up perfectly but firefox seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or google-chrome dev tools

9492029
webkit	gecko
it seems to be a webkit vs gecko problem as espresso shows the same as chrome

9492054

9492117
punctuation	words
is there a way to select the entire words including any contained punctuation

9492130
getter	setter
it seems that during reflection it finds a getter for a serializable but not a long and it does not find a setter for the serializable

9492140
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox google-chrome opera ie9+

9492143
width	height
this fixes the math to scale to the max size in both width and height rather than just one depending on the width and height of the original

9492144
nsdata	nsfilewrapper
but apple s document-based apps programming guide for ios regarding custom formats instead of nsdata or nsfilewrapper states keep in mind that your code will have to duplicate what uidocument does for you and so you must deal with greater complexity and a greater possibility of error

9492144
getter	setter
per document defaults are declared as properties the setter modifies the nsdictionary that maps the plist and marks the document as updated and the getter accesses the dictionary with the proper key

9492170
min	max
i derive min max value in the widget_info.xml from these values

9492178
getter	setter
i don t care much for this design - i don t like interfaces merely for getter and setter

9492192
google-chrome	firefox
the button responds to clicks only in ie but not in firefox google-chrome

9492238
hash	salt
while you use a good encryption unless you re adding a salt to the password it is likely easily looked up in a pre-computed hash table rainbow table and you can probably find it online within a matter of seconds

9492256
webkit	gecko
gecko and webkit support the style pointer-events none

9492310
serializable	deserialization
ignoring custom serializable methods that you can write for your own classes to precisely control the serializable and deserialization behavior yes the system will effectively traverse the object graph in order to generate a stream of bytes

i have a dictionary with integer keys and the value for each key is a map with integer keys and set of integers as value

9492479
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to just watch javasript i suggest firebug plugin in firefox or google-chrome developer tool bug f12 or ie developer tool bar f12

9492502
client-side	server-side
the issue was with how the server-side code provided the client-side code javascript with the json string

9492516
hash	hmac
hmac uses a hash function internally

9492516
hash	hmac
hmac-sha256 means hmac using the sha256 hash function

9492516
hash	salt	hash	hmac
you still have a salt and the hash function is invoked twice see any reference on hmac but it is nevertheless a lot faster to check lots of passwords

9492542
width	height
my approach is to have a parent div viewport of fixed width height and overflow hidden then to slide its child div slides which has the actual contents in its child divs to the left or the right

9492557
html5lib	elementtree
i ve tried also html5lib with elementtree but that doesn t even seem to run parsing that would comply with documentation

9492833
post	get
i d like to use all of the major verbs in my app in order to a adhere to standards for rest and b well not use get and post exclusively

9492884
children	parent
so i want to be able to click a button within the element and create another but because the rowspan already equals 2 i need another element to appear at the end of the table cause it needs to count the current parent element as 1 in the list of children of the element and the next element after that should be counted as 2 so it needs to add in a element at the end cause there are 2 rowspans in

9492884
children	parent
so basically i need to capture all children elements starting with the parent element and increment down the element list within the and count them with the rowspan if or rowspan does not exist than it should create another element directly after the parent element of the element.

9492919
textarea	textbox

9492978
width	height
we declare 3 variables width height and stride width

9492994
prng	random
the key to understand is a pseudo random source prng takes the current internal state - which can be set with a seed although a modern prng has a much larger internal state - and uses that to generate a random value and the next internal state

9493050
maven	cobertura	ant	maven
this recent blog post by thomas sundberg contains a method that partially solves the issue by using ant for the cobertura calls instead of using the maven cobertura plugin

9493050
maven	pom.xml
start with a typical maven compile on the parent pom.xml which will compile all classes in the child modules

9493363
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i have tried numerous combinations of adding scrollviews in the detailviewcontroller in viewwillappear viewdidload loadview...and the best i can come up with is what looks like a scrollable view on the top layer as it does show scroll bars and shows me that i did the scrollview.contentsize correctly as i can pan around but the actual view with the fields and stuff doesn t move and the fields are unable to be edited

9494533
kerberos	ntlm
so for example if the ws-federation sign-in request from crm to ad fs sent through the browser says that integrated windows authentication is fine and if you have the integrated handler at the top of your list then iwa is always used for authenticating the user so either ntlm or kerberos depending on browser server capabilities

the rationale for this as explained in the notes when boolean were introduced in python 2.3.5 is that the old behaviour of using int 1 and 0 to represent true and false was good but we just wanted more descriptive names for numbers we intended to represent truth values

9494911
post	get
eg you click on first image button inside div#button1 - in the post array there would be the other image button will not get posted

9494915

free	malloc
and this program never calls malloc or free directly

uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

9494928
int	double

it will keep its width i think but change its height to be tall enough to display all of its lines after wrapping

9495156
jboss	glassfish
application server is generally referred to a server with has ejb container like glassfish jboss etc

9495178

9495259
rspec	capybara
also if anyone has a good way to test that in rspec capybara please do share

9495267
width	height
if it s the height that varies you could set a maximum label size with your standard label width and 9999 height and then check what the suggested size would be for your text using the font of your label

9495303
width	margin
the above solution seems to do the trick as long as the width of your floating element is static and predictable as the margin of the non-floating div is set to span the floating div s width plus the required space between the two

9495319
post	put
if you put your window.location.reload false immediately after your then you ll reload the page before the post completes and that s probably not what you want to do and that would explain your messed up order problem

switching	screens
if i don t use threads the screens freezes on button press and does not switching to the new panel
